New questions about California water supply project
Critics and the state legislator say that they want to know in more detail who pays for the $16 billion project supported by Governor Jerry Brown, according to a representative of the leading California water supply authority, that the Brown administration offers government funding to complete the construction of two huge water tunnels.
Critics claim that the government funding described by the Los Angeles Metropolitan Water Management may conflict with the long - term assertion that various local water supply authorities, not California itself, would pay for Brown’s vision to dig two equal 35 miles of tunnels to drain the water south of the Sacramento River, mainly Central and Southern California.
The initial cost of the construction of tunnels amounting to USD 248 million, which still needs to be authorised by the supervisory authority, has already started to be the subject of a federal audit study.
On Wednesday, the state co-legislators also commissioned a state audit on tunnel construction costs.
On Thursday, State Speaker Nancy Vogel said that despite the Los Angeles Metropolitan Water Management account, money will not be used to complete the current planning phase of the twin tunnels from the general budget of the State.
However, tunnel opponents and a group of taxpayers were critical on Thursday, and a member of the Assembly, Susan Ega, one of the state legislators standing behind this week's audit, asked the state for explanations on Thursday.
"It's a game with the thimbles," said David Wolf, legal director of Howard Gervis's Taxpayers' Association.
In my opinion, this coincides with yesterday's audit (request): there are many more questions than answers.
The tunnel project has been approved by Brown and some politically influential water authorities and water consumers in Central and Southern California.
Supporters claim that the tunnels will benefit the environment and provide the Californians with a safer water supply.
The opposers say that they are worried that the State will use tunnels to divert too much water from the Sacramento River and the Gulf of San Francisco to the detriment of Northern California and to further threaten the native species.
Metropolicies and other water supply agencies to receive water from the tunnels still have to make a commitment to pay for them because of their insecurity as to whether the investment will actually bring enough water to pay off.
The same water supply authorities also announced this year that they would not pay for the completion of the current preparatory work unless the project first obtained the approval of the monitoring body.
On Thursday, the monthly report on the tunnel project published by the Los Angeles water supply authority states that "the state has indicated that additional funding for the completion of the planning phase will come from the state or federal budgets."
After all that the local water supply authorities have spent on the project, including $63 million from his water supply, "it is expected that the state will use public money to complete planning," said Bob Muir, a spokesman of the Los Angeles water supply authority.
Next, he directed questions to Vogel, the State Speaker.
Vogel said that the state is planning to allocate money to complete tunnel planning from the charge for the existing water network of half a century old, the State water project.
The opponents of tunnel construction, however, point to a regulatory framework issued in 2009 which, according to them, prevents the state from spending money on tunnel construction, while the water supply authorities that will benefit from it will not assume payment obligations for them.
"Project contractors have promised to pay for this project and have used financial tricks to circumvent these commitments," said Patricia Šiferle, environmental consultant and long-run opponents of the planned tunnels.
This raises questions about where this money was suddenly found.
Towards a China Cyber Security Law by the Business Group
The coalition of international business groups has addressed China with a request to change the proposed cyber security rules by warning that they will harm trade and isolate the country.
The letter to the Chinese Prime Minister, Li Kecian, has been signed by 46 groups from the USA, Europe, Asia and Latin America, demonstrating the global concern that regulations could restrict or suspend access to the Chinese information security product market.
The signatories include the US Chamber of Commerce, the European Service Forum and groups from Japan, Korea and Mexico.
The proposed rules require suppliers to show the Chinese authorities how security products operate and how information on Chinese citizens will be stored in the country.
The last letter, dated Wednesday, says that it could make theft of data easier and less easily accessible to Chinese customers.
Chemical explosion in Tianjin: a year after the tragedy
Zhang Mengfan claims that society deserves to know what happened in Tianjin.
The Chinese leaders are planning silent commemorations to commemorate the first anniversary of a large-scale chemical explosion in which 173 people died, but not everyone agrees.
John Sadworth reports from Tianjin.
Almost anywhere else in the world would be an anniversary of a disaster of this magnitude that the people remember and commemorate.
However, not in China.
Although the town of Tajin holds a memorial service for the commemoration of some dead firefighters, such commemoration events are excluded elsewhere.
The media controlled by the Communist Party have been told what they can and cannot say, and some survivors, as well as family members of the victims, have been warned not to speak to the foreign press.
However, 23-year-old Zhang Mengfan does not want to remain silent.
"This anniversary, the public should somehow find out what happened," he says to me.
I don't want silence.
On August 12, last year, Zhang was a radio operator in a military fire brigade just a mile away from the epicentre of explosions.
"The bell was received at 22.53 that night, and we started sending my teammates," he says.
They could come to the location within 10 minutes.
In addition, teams from other parts of the city rushed to extinguish the large fire in the chemical store.
None of them paid attention to the fact that large quantities of volatile and toxic substances were illegally stored, well in excess of the authorised quantities and without proper monitoring.
The fire started when a lot of nitrocellulose - a chemical used in nail polishes - dries out and then ignites in the summer heat.
Then it spread to a huge area - to 800 tonnes of ammonium nitrate fertiliser.
In the explosions windows and fire station were broken, where Zhang Mengfan waited at the radio console news from the scene, the roof invaded.
No such information was received.
"When I saw the mushroom cloud, I fell desperate," he tells me.
I knew what that would mean for my friends.
Of the 26 firefighters of his unit who were sent to the bombing site that night, eight never returned.
Many others suffered serious burns and other injuries.
The largest of the two major explosions was likened to an earthquake, and the explosion was felt many miles away.
The total damage is estimated at over USD 1 billion, including over 300 destroyed buildings.
A total of 173 people lost their lives, 104 of whom were firefighters.
The remains of eight humans have never been found.
The official government investigative bodies clearly blame corruption, political contacts and formal collusion, which allowed circumvention of the rules and disregard for security systems.
First of all, such a warehouse should never have been built close to residential buildings.
More than 100 officials and representatives of the company's management have been subject to disciplinary or criminal investigation.
So, while the government can point to the progress that has been made - the thousands of homes assembled and the compensation to the population - these sensitive issues remain.
The tragedy has revealed gaps in a system where rapid economic growth is a priority and the lack of independent supervision is a fact.
That evening’s courage and sense of duty are beyond doubt, yet without the image of a firefighter as a hero, there is a rather gratifying picture.
It has a fireman as a victim who has been sent without prior knowledge in the fight against a man-made disaster that could have been prevented.
Zhang Mengfan is no longer working in the fire service, but will attend a memorial service in Tianjin.
He will carry a message in his heart about his dead companions.
Most of all I want to say to them: I have visited your parents and they are doing well.
Leave your parents to me.
Now I'm a member of your family.
I'll do your job as sons.
Cold spring could affect Scottish rouble shooting season
The Scottish rouble shooting season will start later, because this year the number of birds has decreased due to cold weather.
In several properties shooting is postponed, as many of the new rubles have not survived in the cold spring conditions.
Marking the beginning of the season, the Scottish Game Organizers Association (SGA) says that rouble shooting provides more work than Edinburgh festivals.
However, the Animal Protection Charity Foundation, OneKind, calls for an end to the 'bruth killing' of birds.
The director of the organization, Harry Hutton, said: "The work that is being invested in the provision of a large number of shooting birds is huge and undeniably involves some very controversial activities."
Not surprisingly, society is turning away from this so-called sport and calling on the government to ban the brutal, unnecessary work enjoyed by only a very small part of the Scottish population.
Landowners, however, insist that they commit to maintaining the number of birds and that the shooting of rubles is important for the development of the rural economy.
SGA Chairman Alex Hogg said that the industry provides 8 800 full-time jobs a year in the more remote regions and that it has been a "rich patch of work" in uncertain times.
He said, "Compared to many European countries, Scotland is not so deeply rooted in the culture of "hunting" and some people do not know at all how shooting seasons affect the country economically."
Hog said that the number of jobs provided during shooting exceeded the number of jobs created at the Edinburgh International Festival, the Frindis Festival, the tattooing festival and the New Year's Eve celebration together.
He added: "The employment situation in Scotland is currently quite worrying, especially in the oil and gas sector, so game organisers and their families want to see the industry flourish.
We want to work with the Scottish Government to ensure that hard-working people can continue to rely on these jobs in the future.
R.P.E. Scotland believes that at least eight golden eagles have been killed near the living environment of the rubles.
Many game organisers admit that rubble shooting is not generally popular, but SGA claims that the industry "has taken significant steps forward in terms of best practice."
The opening day of the Russian shooting season is traditionally known as the "Holy Twelve."
However, there is still much discussion about this sport, and the management of rubble shooting sites is linked to the persecution of some of the offenders by nature conservation authorities.
On Thursday, RPB Scotland said that in less than five years, eight ringed golden eagles had disappeared in the Monadliat Mountains, southeast of Inverness.
The Nature Conservation Charity Foundation considers that they have been illegally killed near rubble shooting sites and their satellite bracelets have been destroyed.
The Scottish Minister for the Environment, Rosanna Caningham, said that these reports are "very disturbing and sad."
Mrs Caningham instructed the officials to analyse the evidence of about 90 surviving and missing eagles with transmitters in order to determine whether there is a trend towards criminal activity.
The Scottish moor group blames the RSB for attempts to stir up the sensations of shooting before the start of the rouble season, and states that there is no clear evidence that the birds even died in the area of the Monadlit Mountains.
Rio Olympics 2016: Brion Paige wins silver jumps for Britain
UK representative Paige wins silver jumps
Briny Paige has become the first British woman to win a medal at the Olympics in the jumping of trams, Rio, fighting silver.
Paige (25) missed 0.425 points to gold, because Canada's representative Rosanna McLenana won the second Olympic title in a row with a score of 56.465.
World Champion, Chinese representative Lee Dan went to bronze, while the other British finalist Katherine Dricole finished the sixth.
I can't believe I won the Olympic medal.
I am so happy," said the emotional Paige clearly.
I had no idea that it was a medal, but I was able to show the best performance, so I was so happy that all training and hard work had paid off.
I am so happy that I was able to take part in the finals with Keta, and the participation of one representative in the finals would be historic, but we were there two.
Prior to the Olympic silver competition, Peidge’s highest achievement in the international competition was the fifth in the 2015 World Championships in Denmark.
Trampling was included in the Olympic Games in 2000, and this is the first time that British women have succeeded in reaching the finals.
Response to the medal.
The British team representative Nathan Bailey, the only representative in men's competition for tram jumping on Saturday, was in ecstasy.
Hannah Velana, who takes part in the second Olympic Games, quickly began to praise Peidge’s achievement.
Paige has won a bachelor's biology with excellence at the University of Sheffield.
Rio 2016: Fiji fans celebrate the gold medal in rugby-7
12-year-old boy to see the game, sketching half miles both for cane fields to the nearest television
Fiji begins its first Olympic gold medal celebration on an unprecedented scale
Banks closed, shops closed and celebrations took over Suvas streets, dancing, singing and celebrating
Fiji won a gold medal in the final of the Deodoro Stadium, rugby-7 with 43-7 to destroy Britain.
Thousands of people throughout the island country stopped their work to watch the historic game.
Fiji celebrates its first Olympic medal
Many fans were dressed in Fiji’s colors and rugby’s shirts, carrying the national flag and encouraging the team.
In the wake of the end of the game, thrilled celebrities went to the streets, enjoying and dancing.
"Some people even stopped their vehicles on the crowded streets of Suva and joined the celebration with Fiji's flags, not to address the small congestion they caused," reports the Fiji Times.
The celebrations will certainly continue on the weekend and next week.
Irish Premier League: Finn Harps 0-5 Derry City
Aaron McKenef hit two first half-time penalty strikes at a guest team in Finnpark.
Derry City has risen to the second one in the Premier League, winning a convincing victory with a score of 5-0 in the fight with Finn Harps.
Aaron McKenef put forward a "confect strip" under the leadership of two first half-time penalty strikes that were awarded for offences against Lucas Schubert.
Nathan Boyle hit the gate at the beginning of the second half, and Schubert beat his opponent in the fourth quarter before Keith Ward's late pass, concluding the enemy's destruction in Finnpark.
Darry is on one point in front of Cork City, and both teams will meet in the decisive game Monday evening in Brendiwell.
It was the Derry's first victory over its north-western competitors this season, and they were disturbed by me on the HARPS side.
McKenef saved the game's launch at 17 minutes after Cyran Cole's march against Schubert, even though the infringement turned out to be outside the penalty court.
There was no doubt about the second punitive blow, with the former Caramel Striper Barry Molloy making Schubert fall to the ground and McKenef achieving a score of 2-0 in the third minute after the break.
Boil put an exact point after Dean Jarvis's hand with his foot inside the eighth minute after resuming the game.
The Derry City goalkeeper, Gerard Doherty, had a calm evening, but he managed to protect the goal perfectly, outstretched David Scully at the best opening of the game.
Schubert knocked the ball past Kohl before the breakthrough in 83 minutes, and soon it was followed by a smart kickback by Vard over the guard of Harps center Richard Brass.
It was Derry's biggest victory in the race series and a great preparation for the final game with Cork.
Test after massive tests at the University of Highlands and Islands of Inverness College (UHI)
The entire course of 20 students could have failed in the test of the Inverness College UHI Highest Media Course.
Most of them were students aged 17 and 18 who hoped to use the grade they received in their studies to join the university.
The Inverness College UHI claims that quality assurance processes are being applied, adding that the Scottish Qualification Authority (SQA) is investigating the case.
SQA spokesman said that the highest media evaluation available throughout the country for 2016 is "notified as expected".
Twenty students signed up for the course offered and evaluated by the Inverness College UHI.
Many of the students were young people living in rural areas who were studying online, but often had to go to the Inverness College from their places of residence, such as Locheiber.
One student’s father said that after his daughter’s publications in social media that she did not receive any assessment of her work, at least 10 more also announced that she had not received any assessment of her course work.
He said directly to the BBC News Scotland that about five more people who took this course at Inverness College last year, and whom they managed to communicate, said that the same thing had happened to them.
The situation means that his daughter cannot provide a place at Glasgow University, but she will be able to accept the offer of another university thanks to the qualifications obtained at school.
However, her father said that there were others who attended the college organized media course, who were not lucky and who were now in "forget" and in uncertainty about whether their course work would be reviewed and evaluated with a mark so that they could join universities.
Inverness College UHI is part of University of Highlands and Islands.
Diana Rovlinsone, head and executive director of the UHI, Inverness College, said: "We have exam results and student success very important."
This is confirmed by the excellent review of Her Majesty's Education Inspectorate (HMIE) received this year, as well as by the improved levels of achievement in both further education and higher education compared to last year.
As every year, we carry out a review of all published results, comparing them with the forecasts of each student.
In the case of this particular course, standard quality assurance measures were taken and the evaluation body recently reported "significant improvements in the delivery and management of this assessment" and confirmed that "the assessments were in line with national standards".
SQA is currently investigating the case at our request.
SQA spokesman said: "We are glad that the evaluation of the highest media in 2016 has been carried out as planned and that the candidates had the opportunity to show their understanding of the subject."
Many candidates have shown good performance and showed a slight increase in the A-C score compared to the same qualification last year.
It was developed according to previous and model documents and according to our course and assessment specifications.
Brothers were put in prison for a bloodbath of samurai swords in Kilmarnok
Jason Braden was attacked with a samurai sword, knife, and nunchaks
Two brothers were imprisoned for killing a man with a samurai sword after drug-related theft in Airshire, which turned into a bloodbath.
Sacrifice Jason Braden (38) was stabbed several times in his home in Kilmarnok on July 5, 2015.
In the High Court in Glasgow, James Clark (36) will be sentenced to at least 22 years in prison after being sentenced to murder.
His brother John (38) was sentenced to 10 years in prison after being sentenced to a less severe charge of murder without intention.
Judge Bill Dunlop told the brothers that they had committed "a cruel, cruel and savage attack."
He rejected any assumption that Mr. Bradis had slept and waited for them, armed with a samurai sword.
Judge Danlop added: "You plan together to enter illegally with at least one knife and nunchaks."
Jason Braden may have been a drug dealer, but he was a son, a father, and a friend.
You killed him.
After both men were imprisoned, the criminal police inspector, who led the investigation, said: "The violent and terrible actions of Jason Braden and James Clark have led to the death of Jason Braden."
Going into his world at the age of 38 is a heartbreaking situation that the family has to endure.
The court heard earlier that the brothers from Kilmarnoka decided to hijack Mr. Braden’s gold cuff that they had given him in exchange for drugs.
Under the influence of alcohol and drugs, both went to his house, camouflaged faces with scarves, and armed with a knife and an eastern fight nunchaks.
The murder sword is believed to have belonged to the deceased.
Neighbors said they saw Clarks attacking Brad when he sat on the couch by the window, and heard him screaming.
The prosecutor Richard Godard said at the hearing: "The attack on this man was tough, chaotic."
Then the place of murder was described as a "blood drink".
In addition to wounds from knife stitches, he suffered a severe trauma with a blunt object during his attack.
Three days later, he died at Kilmarnoka Kroshaus Hospital.
The two brothers did not admit to murder.
In providing evidence, James Clark, who had previously been tried 38 times, including an attempt at murder, said, "I didn't want to do that, it was an accident."
John Clark, who had been tried 23 times before, said that he was just involved in helping his brother, who he said was attacked by Brad."
A man was sentenced to prison for shaking and killing his infantling son
David Sinkler confessed his guilt for murdering a child in his home in Eastkill in 2012.
A man who shook and killed his baby in an outburst of anger because he did not want to eat was sentenced to seven years and three months in prison.
David Sinkler shook four-month-old Joshua when "for a moment lost control" at their home in Eastkill Bridge, South Lancashire, on 6 December 2012.
The cause of death was determined only by forensic examination.
Sinkler (34) was initially charged with murder, but was found guilty of murder without intention.
In the Glasgow High Court, Judge Lord Breiseidl Sinclair said, "You attacked your baby son by shaking him, causing injuries from which he died."
When you searched him, you had to know, but you didn't reveal it.
It is only after a thorough medical examination that you confess what you have done.
Your wife believed you.
Now she feels betrayed and can no longer support you.
Lord Breisedl described the consequences of Joshua's death as a "catastrophic" for everyone and said, "Nothing is going to return Joshua."
Previously, the court had found that on the day the child died, Sinkler and his wife, Cursey, went swimming with Joshua and shopping in the Eastkill Broadcast.
At 17.30 C.E., C. Sinkler went to meet her mother and sister.
Just 11 minutes later, she was called by Sinkler, who sounded shocked.
He said to her, "I don't breathe properly, come home right now."
Then he ended the conversation and called 999.
The infant was immediately taken to the Hermaira Hospital, where he died.
The cause of Joshua’s death was initially not clear, but he was examined by a team of forensic experts who identified the consequences of injuries in the eyes and brain that occurred shortly before he died, and such injuries could not be caused by accident.
One of the experts, Dr. Peter Richard, a neurosurgeon advising the children at John Red Cliff Hospital in Oxford, said: "This is because the child has been shaken and thus injured, and has been touched by more force than in everyday life."
The representative of defence Jan Dougid told the court that Sinkler "extremely regrets" what he had done.
Rio Olympics 2016: Chloy Tatone threatens Julia Jefimova's position
British representative Tatone slips out of her hands in a 200 m swim in bronze
The British representative, Chloy Tatone, criticises the controversial swimmer Julia Jefimova's participation in the Rio Games after the Russian representative beats her 200 m in swim.
Jefimova, who was allowed to take part in the games following a complaint about a ban on participation due to doping, fights silver, leaving Tatoni in fourth place.
"I would have liked them to be completely clean games," said the 20-year-old Welsh swimmer.
I didn't tell you who's in there.
I'm not happy with it, but that's what it is.
Jefimova, who won second place, learned about her participation in the games only three days ago.
I don't want to see people get out of sports, but I don't think that's right.
She shouldn't have competed, and a 20 - year - old British representative had to win a medal.
Rie Kanetto won Japan's seventh gold medal in 2016 in Rio, beating Jefimova, who received the silver medal.
Chinese representative of Ginling This was at the bronze, just six hundredths of a second ahead of the fourth single Taton.
Her British teammate, 20-year-old Molly Renšov, finished her sixth.
"Stilling in fourth place is a bit of disappointment, no matter what you have ahead of you," Tatone added.
It's a great experience, and I'm a little disappointed about the fourth place.
I'm so close to the medal, and it would have been a dream.
However, the finalisation itself is a great experience that I will take with me in the coming years.
It was a little disappointment, but in the long run, it will make me strong, and it makes me increasingly seek a medal, so hopefully I will get closer to it next time.
Tatone only lags by 0.01 seconds behind the British record women's 200 m swimming finals.
"Each person must have a second chance," - Jefimova.
Jefimova, who said that she was tired of answering questions about her doping past, defended her right to participate in Rio.
In 2013, she was subject to a ban of 16 months after her body had found traces of anabolic steroids.
The Sports Arbitration Court (CAS) ruled that athletes could not be denied participation in Rio because they had been sanctioned in advance.
CAS dealt with my complaint, and I won.
If someone doesn't like it, and someone has a different opinion, they can turn to CAS," she explained.
I do not support doping, and I have never used it.
In the second case, it was certainly not my fault.
Every person must be given a second chance.
When you come and write you a sentence, nobody puts you in jail.
Ben Praud wins the place for 50 free-style swims
Previously, a British record was put in order to win the 50m freestyle swim finals for men.
Union champion Praud (21) floated in 21.54 seconds to qualify as the fifth fastest for the Friday final (02:44 BST Saturday).
Your delegation is shameless and rude
The Indian Sports Minister, Viyay Goel Rio, has been a very striking personality at the Olympic Games, often seen in podiums, encouraging Indian athletes and taking selfies after their start.
However, he and his extensive company have apparently provoked the anger of the Olympics' organizers because of their unruly behaviour, repeatedly trying to break up to the competition areas without adequate accreditation and rude response, being checked, reports the Indian news agency Press Trust of India.
Vijay Goel, photographed in July, justifies his behavior.
On Wednesday, the organisers of the Olympic Games threatened to withdraw Goel's accreditation if his behaviour did not improve by sending a warning letter after he and his company tried to enter restricted areas at the venue of the gymnastics competition and on the arena where the slogans and fiekvando take place.
"We have received several reports that your Sports Minister has tried to enter accredited competition areas with persons without accreditation," says Sarah Petersone, continental manager of the Rio 2016 Organizers Committee.
When the staff tried to explain that it was not allowed, the people together with the Minister became aggressive and rude, and sometimes broke past our staff.
"If our protocol team becomes aware of other cases of such behaviour, your sports minister's accreditation will be revoked and his privileges in the Olympic Games will be revoked," the letter went on.
The leader of the Indian delegation called this case "an elephant blown out of the fly", and Goel himself said that he had done nothing wrong by writing it all down as "a misunderstanding".
He wrote on Twitter: "As far as I know, we have complied with all the rules.
We maintain the spirit of the Olympic Games and support our Indian athletes.
Otherwise, the Olympic Games are rather gloomy for India, and there is no medal yet.
Those who lost hope in social media pointed out that Michael Phelps had won so many medals - 26 - like India in its history.
Several prominent candidates have already been excluded, including the shooter Abhinavs Bindra, who won the gold medal in Beijing in 2008.
This time he remained fourth.
Money and opportunity run in the wind," author of sardonian tweet and column author of Soba De.
However, some bright expectations remain, as there will be a boxing, golf, tennis, athletics and, yes, badminton competition.
The only Indian gymnast Dip Karmakar will compete in the jumps finals on Sunday, showing her terrifying double-speed "Death Jump", Produnova's jump, which only a few other gymnastics have tried.
In a country with 1.25 billion people, India’s low medals have always been the cause of indignation.
Analysts say there are countless reasons for this.
National passion is a cricket, which is not an Olympic sport.
India has not invested heavily in infrastructure and Olympian training - Karmakar's first exercise tool was made of spare parts of an old scooter.
Parents have always stressed the superiority of academic knowledge over sport.
And the authorities responsible for sport have been overtaken by corruption.
The International Olympic Committee has suspended the Indian Olympic Association for violations of its statute in 2012 because it elected the leaders against whom criminal proceedings have been brought.
In Sochi, three participants of the Indian Winter Olympic Games were even prevented from representing their country, carrying a flag or wearing anything with national symbols.
They competed as independent athletes.

Drug Control Agency (DEA) misses an opportunity for medical cannabis
The answer is, unfortunately: it is unlikely.
This is a missed opportunity that could further delay the provision of treatment to countless people.
Until today, there is only one scientific source for the use of medical marijuana approved at federal level at the University of Mississippi.
In apparently slightly more positive news today, DEA also announced that it would now allow other places to apply for permission to do the same.
It is hoped that the amount and diversity of marijuana available for scientific purposes could increase.
Although it will attract attention as an emphasis in favour of the study, it will be largely symbolic, because no matter how much marijuana is available, if access to it is still difficult, it does not matter.
Imagine a product that is very in demand, but is stored behind closed doors.
In response to the demand for goods, someone makes a difficult-to-understand decision to produce more, but to get and it never unlocks the door.
This product is marijuana and its location on list 1 is this locked door.
Such an unpleasant situation is a medical marijuana.
As marijuana is a substance in List 1 (i.e., by definition, it "is not currently authorised for medical use, and there is a high potential for its use for unforeseen purposes"), there are significant barriers to closing doors.
Potential researchers usually first turn to DEA because it authorises the launch of scientific research.
Even if an authorisation is granted for the study of substances on List 1, the authorities must comply with very strict safety rules and set up high-level safety systems, which may be costly.
There is also an even more subjective consideration of obtaining authorisation from its academic body to carry out research on substances on List 1.
Even if some faculty representatives want to carry out this study, university management may not want to have a problem or any potential side effects due to negative press reports.
This was the case at the University of Arizona when Dr. Sue Sisley was removed from office after trying to move the medical marijuana trials forward.
Sisley eventually had to look for private funding for her project, and only in April, seven years after the initial project was initiated, her project became the first DEA-approved medical marijuana trial for veterans to prevent post-traumatic stress.
Then, after years of struggle with bureaucratic obstacles, the National Drug Addiction Institute has been at the key to the last lock.
At present, it is the largest federal public funder of the exploration of marijuana, and it is the only supplier of marijuana itself.
Even if research is put into free circulation in greater quantities of medical medicine, the Institute will still have to approve all the research it finances.
However, the problem is with the name "abuse".
Dr. Donald Eybram, a representative of the University of San Francisco, who I interviewed for my documentary "Marijuana", says that the Institute's main task is to study substances in the context of their potential addiction, not as medicines.
Abram draws attention to an important fact.
Even if the study overcomes all the obstacles listed above, the door may still be closed if the intention is to study the benefits of medical marijuana rather than the harm it caused.
Note: In a quick (and, I must admit, unscientific) search in the U.S. National Medical Library, 1 434 works were found on medical marijuana in the last five years.
In the same quest, only 57 works were about the benefits of medical marijuana.
Most of the studies were about harm caused by marijuana, such as "Bad travel due to anticholinergic effects of marijuana", "Marijuana-induced pancreatitis" and "Marijuana use and lung cancer risk."
Such a disproportion creates a rather distorted picture.
The road to the use of medical marijuana is paved with surprises and hypocrisy wherever the view opens.
While DEA is taking part in List 1 status without looking at the medical effect, the U.S. Department of Health and Social Affairs at the same time retains the cannabionide patent for large-scale medical purposes.
DEA continues to set marijuana alongside heroin and LSD as drugs with high dependence potential, although the main judge of administrative law at the DEA itself, Francis Young, opposed it.
In a strict medical sense, marijuana is safer than many widely consumed foods.
For example, the ingestion of 10 fresh potatoes may cause toxic reactions.
By comparison, it is physically impossible to eat enough marijuana to lead to death.
Marihuan, in its natural form, is one of the safest therapeutic active substances known to mankind.
By rational analysis, marijuana can be used safely in the treatment by appropriate monitoring.
Again, it was proposed by the DEA's own judge.
And still, almost 30 years later, little has changed.
Whether we realize it or not, we all accept a certain dose of hypocrisy in our daily lives.
Maybe we don't always have the energy to say it out loud, or we're so dumb or embarrassed that nobody seems to have noticed it.
As far as hypocrisy is concerned in the context of federal medical marijuana policy, there must be endurance in order to present the facts without relentlessly.
The lives of patients, such as Charlotte Fiji, whose seizures are reduced by the use of medical marijuana, and many others, depend on it.
For the fact that the plant can bring so many benefits and still be behind closed doors, it is worth talking at a higher level.
Bloody Beetroots: Donald Trump "blondais Berluskoni"
Bloody Beetroots is known in the context of electronic dance music
Musicians say Trump dominates the media like Berlusconi
You know, we're used to Berlusconi in Italy, and for me Trump looks like blond Berlusconi," said CNN, founder of the electronic music punks association The Bloody Beetroots.
The candidate for the post of President of the Republicans and the Italian media magnate, who became a politician, both known for their exaggerated personality, their ability to attract press attention and the changed story in the media.
"Bloody Beetroots" is known for its electronic dance music and has collaborated with various artists, from the legendary Ser Paul McCarthy to the electro-pop singer Greta Svabo Bechu in 2013 in the song "Chronicles of a Fallen Love."
Rifo was born in the Italian city of Basano del Grapa, near Venice in 1977, which coincides with the time when the punk rock was born, and the numbers "1977" have been tattooed to the musician on his chest.
"English isn't my native language, so I don't understand everything about your world," Rifo said, hiding behind the black fee with which he is familiar.
I am trying to explore, and I have tried to improve my understanding of your culture.
Rifo invited the Americans to watch "Videocracy", a documentary exploring the monopoly of Berlusconi over the Italian media.
The documentary is about how "Berlusconi made Italy crazy," Rifo said, adding that Trump had a similar influence on America.
"You see how a person can completely turn over the system and fold it all... along his own," he said.
In my opinion, Trump is not good for this country.
Two Turkish sailors were imprisoned for more than GBP 500 million in the drug case
Two Turkish men have been convicted of smuggling more than GBP 500 million of cocaine on board a ship in the North Sea, each sentenced to at least 20 years in prison.
Mammin Sahin and Emin Ozman were found guilty of trial in the High Court in Glasgow after three tons of A-class drugs were found on the deck of MV Hamal about 100 miles from the coast of Aberdeen.
In 2015, cocaine is the largest cocaine seized in one step and has ever been detained at sea in Europe.
Mamin Sahin and Emin Ozman were sentenced to prison for their role in a large-scale drug transaction
The huge load of drugs found on board is one of the largest in British history
Drugs were found hidden in a specially installed ambush on a tugboat registered in Tanzania that sailed from Istanbul to Tenerife and then to the North Sea.
It was stopped by the British fleet's fleet's fleet's "HMS Somerset" and the border vessel's "HMC Valiant".
Sahin (47) was sentenced to 22 years, but Ozman (51) in Glasgow Supreme Court is sentenced to 20 years.
Judge Lord Kinkleiven said to men that the amount of drugs was "not only significant but ambitious", and drug trafficking has "destructive effects" on people and the community around them.
He said, "You were involved in the most commercial operation, including the transport of cocaine by ship, an operation that crossed international and truly intercontinental borders."
He said that the captain of the ship Sahin was not a "drug at the top of the tree", but he played an important role in the crime, while the other captain of Ozman's role was "something smaller".
Inspectors climbed onto the Hamal deck after being induced by the French customs authority, DNRED, and when it landed in Aberden, they drilled through a steel plate, accessing a secret compartment where 128 bundles of cocaine weighing 3.2 tonnes were found, with an estimated value of GBP 512 million on the black market.
MV Hamal last year was inspected by the Royal Fleet.
There were three tons of cocaine on board.
Inspection of ships found that its ballast tanks had crammed tons of Class A drugs
The ship was on its way from the Bosporus Strait to South America before it was stopped in the North Sea.
Access to this place was opened under the closet in one of the crew’s rooms, and the gap was cemented.
Sahin and Ozman were found guilty of transporting and hiding cocaine on board ships between 20 February and 23 April last year and of supplying cocaine between 21 April and 23 April last year.
Both previously unpunished men who have worked in the shipping industry since they left school continue to say that they are not guilty, but still take the jury's verdict.
Four more men have no evidence of accusations against them.
Says Sahin's lawyer Jonathan Crowe, that married father of two children is a "glorified mule".
He said, "Someone who was involved in drug trafficking."
Someone who was able to drive the ship.
Looking at the drug hierarchy, Sahin is certainly not at the tip of the drug tree, but somewhere below.
The huge amount of cocaine on board means that it had to be lifted by a crane
The police passed through the ship for days before the drugs were broken down into these boxes
He asked questions about his captain's work at "Hamal" in February 2015, the court heard.
Mr. Krow said that he was "shocked" about the fact that important events of his daughter (9) and son (13) had to pass and "simplely want to go back to Turkey".
Both men have not seen their families since their arrest in April 2015, as families are still struggling to obtain visa certification.
Ozman's lawyer Di Mur said that he "deep" wants to see his family, but knows that in the foreseeable future it "will not be possible".
Speaking after the judgments read today by Scottish prosecutor David Harvey said: "International drug trafficking knows no borders, and we who have the task of destroying it are working more and more closely together to get us one step ahead.
"Scottish's success in persecuting criminals is truly global, and in this case we have caused significant economic damage to organised crime."
Drugs were packed in all gaps on the ship, including under the floor.
Inspectors of this contraband found hidden in the ship's laundry room
Mr. Harvey added: "Hamal" was identified by intelligence instructions from the French authorities, and by rapid cooperation with the General Prosecutor of Tanzania, where the ship is registered, who also allowed to board the ship.
"Our investigation then went from Gijan, which provided access to essential data on shipments, to Spain, which provided us with very valuable information on the ship's stops in the Canary Islands.
We also worked with colleagues in Denmark, Norway and the USA to bring together specific elements of evidence.
Despite the thorough intelligence that Hamal is carrying a large amount of drugs, the British authorities could not climb on board in international waters without the permission of the Tanzanian Government - something they had never granted before.
Suu Peiten, Head of the International Justice and Organised Crime Prevention at the Royal Criminal Prosecutor's Office (CSS), said: "As soon and accurately, the adviser to the CPS's criminal law managed to obtain permission from the Tanzanian authorities to board the ship within 24 hours of receiving the intelligence information.
Under international maritime law British officials are not entitled to climb into international waters on board a ship flying the flag of another State, unless that State issues a specific legal authorisation to do so.
Without the rapid action of our criminal advisor, there would be a great risk that the ship could escape and that we could never bring these people to justice.
Photographer Brian Romejn perpetuates the dwindling "Eastern Express" train
Photographer Brian Romejn from Rotterdam took photos of this abandoned train in Belgium
Figures show the rusting inside of the train, torn seats, dust-covered windows and the narrow driving cab
It has already been called the East Express wagon, but it belonged to the Belgian national railway company
The city explorer has taken these remarkable photographs of the ruined remains of a passenger train that once was one of the best ways to travel.
Its flower times have long passed, and the train wagon and locomotive have been left to rot in a train depot in Belgium, where they have become a popular destination for photographers and adventurers.
Photographer Brian Romejn, 40, has taken these terrifying photographs of the rusting inside of the train, torn seats, dust-covered windows and compressed driver’s cab
The train wagon and the locomotive have been left to rot in a train depot in Belgium, where they have become a popular destination for photographers and adventurers.
These trains were a symbol of luxury when they operated under the legendary name between 1883 and 2009.
The locomotive was used by the Belgian national railway company about 50 years ago.
After 126 years on the rails, the last train, which operated with the name of the Eastern exprese, went from Strasbourg to Vienna in December 2009 at the end of the famous historical period.
Eastern express was famous on the route Paris - Istanbul.
When it was launched in 1883 (operator - La Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits) it was known as the French language "Express d'Orient".
It became the Eastern Express in 1891, and by the 1930s it already had regular routes throughout Europe.
It should not be confused with the private "Venice Simpson-Orient-Express".
There are very few "Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits" luxury wagons left.
The narrow driver’s cab shown in this photograph, where equipment rusts, still includes measuring instruments and exposed wires
Romejn said that the driver's cab is "in its own way claustrophobic, and the noise of the locomotive must have been unbearable."
A abandoned locomotive and wagon have become a popular sight for photographers and adventurers.
After visiting the forgotten train in Belgium, Romeinj MailOnlineTravel said, "I really could feel how it was used in its flower times."
For wealthy gentlemen, high hats join the lady in beautiful dresses.
The makeup art Katherine Galloway turns into the series "Arrested Development" in Baster Bluta
Thanks to her impressive makeup skills, reviews and make-up, Texas and YouTube censone Kathleen Galloway have been brought to the army of fans.
However, her latest transformation into Baster Blut from "Arrested Development" is quite unbelievable by any standard.
In a three-minute-long video uploaded on her Kiki G YouTube channel, Galloway slowly and continuously turns itself into a failed image with a hook instead of a hand.
Even at the end of the clip, she uses an audio recording from the show in a terrible but at the same time great performance.
The talented make-up artist starts her video in her female image of a blond woman.
Then, with the help of slow photographs, she slowly turns into a dazzling "memming stone", who is already retreating his hair, and who is Tony Heil Baster Blut.
Galloway does this with colored contact lenses, shading and pulling contours around her nose and eyes, as well as drawing Baster's face on her head.
Wise techniques: Using the slow photograph wisely, she slowly turns into Tony Hale Baster Blut.
In the course of her video, she also takes over the personality and manners of the image of the cult TV, thus pulling in the chin.
The clip, which has been placed on YouTube, has been watched more than 45,000 times, and quite quickly the comments of the makeup artist's skills appeared:
"You're extremely talented," one person wrote a video under Galloway.
In her video she also takes over the personality and manners of the image of cult TV
"I like how you stay in the picture when you do all this," said someone else.
The videobloger Kathleen Galloway had previously successfully turned into the "Parks and Recreation" image of Ron Svenson.
She told her YouTube followers that she was looking forward to making makeup transformations every week in the future.

In Lancashire, father is expelled from children's school for wearing a T-shirt with swear words
The father of two children expelled from the children's school for coming to their sports day on the T-shirt with offensive inscription.
Craig Macbeth (36) of the town of Bernli in Lancashire says he "winter" put on a shirt with the inscription "Laijam un dr.am!"
However, despite the fact that when he noticed his nest and put on the T-shirt vice versa, the next day he found that he was forbidden to enter the school territory.
The lone father, who for four years has been the chief of the Park’s primary school in Kolne, Burnle, was unable to pick up children because of the ban, and the staff even called the social services and the police.
Craig Macbeth (36) of the Children says that he is not admitted to the school territory after arriving at an offensive T-shirt for children's sports day.
Mr. Burnley accuses the headmaster of the school, Sarah Miguel, for overreacting.
He says he has been unjustifiably punished for having put on a T-shirt after a mistake before going to watch his two children's race.
My father, who is no longer a head of school, said, "It was a mistake and carelessness on my part."
I don't think about sports day and I rushed when I put it on.
Nearer the end of the event we had a father's competition, and the director noticed my T-shirt and told me that it was not suitable.
I apologized and cut it off, and that's the end of the case.
However, a 36 - year - old man said that he had received a letter from the head of school that night inviting him to a meeting with the director the next day, but he did not see the need to do so because he had already apologized.
"The school director called me and said that I was banned from entering the school territory," added Mr. Burnley.
I learned that after the day of sports, some parents had raised the alarm on Facebook and that many people were interested in it.
Any reasonable-minded person would say that this is exaggerated.
Mr Macbeta, editor of the online magazine Love Mini, said that he felt that he could not even come after the children on the last day of the semester because of the ban.
However, this led to calls from school and social services.
On the T-shirt was the image of Craig Charles Lister of the BBC cult comedy Red Dwarf with one of his iconic expressions "Laijam and Dr.am."
He commented: "I told them that I wasn't there because I was forbidden to go to school.
Then I was called from the social services and asked why I was not after my daughter.
The school also called the police because I hadn't come to pick my daughter up for 40 minutes."
Mr Macbeta states that he was told that he could no longer come to school and that the ban would remain in force until further statements are made.
He also mentioned that he had been warned that he could be fined GBP 500 if he was caught violating this rule.
Sarah Midgley, director of the Park Primary School, said that the case had now been brought to an end.
Sarah Midgley, director of the Park Primary School, said, "I can confirm that Mr. Macbeta has resigned and is no longer the head of our school."
This case is now over, and I hope to return to my normal school life in September."
Kids City Adviser Joe Kooney said that the school had clear policies and guidelines.
"We all need to keep in mind that you are subject to higher standards when taking up posts such as advisors or managers, and unfortunately this time he did not meet these standards," he said.
Counselor Jonathan Nixon added that he did not think that the school should have imposed a ban on him and that an elephant was blown out of flies.
Mr. Nixon added, "The wearing of such a T-shirt was stupid, and he apologized for it."
The Lancashire police confirmed that they were called from school, but they did not come.
The premises of the former factory VEF, located in the Gatve of Brīvības, have recently been renovated - there are several IT companies, the industry has already begun to call the area the local Silicon Valley.
The rest of the VEF is also developing, including Berzaunes.
The project development and construction of the 2nd stage of the University of Latvia Academic Centre Tornakalns will cost 21 million euros.
The procurement announced by the University of Latvia for the development, construction and author supervision of the 2nd stage technical project at the Academic Centre Torņakalns, Riga, is concluded, according to the notice on the website of the Procurement Monitoring Bureau.
The procurement took the form of a negotiated procedure without prior publication of a contract notice.
The contract will be concluded with the general partnership LNK Industries group, which has undertaken to carry out these works for EUR 21 186 560.
As explained by LU, the University, when launching planning and implementation of the European Union funds for the 2014-2021 planning period, continues the design, author supervision and construction of the next stage of the Academic complex - the Science Centre building, according to the Sketch project and the updated construction meta.
The building of the Science Centre is similar to the building of the Academic Centre of Natural Sciences designed and constructed in 1st stage and its activities, which are similar according to the most important technical and technological parameters, as well as in terms of the scientific and academic staff and number of students present in the building.
The project developed by SIA Sixth style was added to the regulations of the competition, with which information on the development vision of the University of Latvia Academic Centre in Torņkalns was provided to all potential suppliers during the competition, including a list of objects planned by the University of Latvia Academic Centre, which indicates the name of each particular object, the estimated area of the object, the planned year of commissioning of the object and other information.
At the end of 2015, SIA Sixth style made previously developed adjustments to the territory of the University of Latvia Academic Centre Torņakalns building complex, as a result of which the location of the buildings of the Academic Centre and their interlinking was clarified, as well as transport organization in meta territory and its surroundings.
Announces a competition for grass mowing in road partition lanes.
SJSC Latvian road maintainer has announced procurement for mechanized grass mowing in the lanes of the road partitions in the regions of Latvia and in Pierīga, informs LAU.
The object of the procurement is divided into 9 lots: Alūksne, Daugavpils, Jēkabpils, Jelgava, Rēzekne, Valmiera, Talsi and Riga road districts.
Tenderers may submit a tender for one or more lots.
Grass mowing in road compartment lanes is necessary in order to improve the transparency of roads and adjacent areas for drivers, to facilitate the drainage of water from the road, as well as to limit the siting and threshing of the grass.
The most ambitious grass mowing works for farmers in Talsi road district are on 28 roads 637 kilometres of hiking, on 20 roads 432 kilometres of hiking in Valmiera road area, and on 17 roads 384 kilometres of hiking in Alūksne.
It has already been reported that in June the company completed grass mowing works on the main and most important regional asphalted roads of the country, but on smaller regional roads and on local roads VAS Latvian road maintainer planned to entrust part of the mowing work to farmers.
"It is an opportunity for us to use the funding allocated for road maintenance works more efficiently, while at the same time enabling farmers to fully load the machinery and earn money", said Vladimirs Kononovs, Chairman of the Board of the Latvian Road Maintainer of SJSC Latvia.
The closing date for the submission of tenders shall be 22 August.
Ombudsman: Demagogy on compulsory health insurance model with additional financial burden for citizens does not hold any criticism.
Any demagogy on compulsory health insurance, which would impose a direct and heavy burden of payment on citizens, does not hold any criticism, considers the Ombudsman Juris Jansons.
Jansons met today with the Minister of Health, Anda Chaks, to discuss the health situation.
After the meeting, Jansons told journalists that the financing model proposed by the Minister for Health was sustainable and developed, making it more accessible to patients.
He noted, however, that in this case there was a need to talk about additional funding for healthcare, which is currently insufficient.
Jansons also stressed that any demagogy on compulsory health insurance, which would impose a direct and heavy burden on citizens, does not hold any criticism, especially when the Dutch model is invoked.
Jansons said that the Netherlands allocates 11% of its gross domestic product to health, while Latvia is only 3%.
The Government and Parliament must therefore be sufficiently accountable to understand that this freezing point must be raised, the Ombudsman said and added that otherwise the model proposed by the Ministry of Health (MH) would not work.
Čakša thanked the Ombudsman for his support and pointed out that the main concern is that the patient should have access to a doctor, which in turn means that the healthcare system needs additional funding.
The Minister pointed out, however, that with the additional EUR 35 million planned next year, it will be possible to do only the most urgent cases regarding oncological patients and maternity professionals' remuneration.
As a result, the MoU has developed a plan and submitted a request for an additional EUR 41 million to be allocated to health care in order to reduce the waiting lists for specialists and for examinations.
"The question of priorities, whether it will have the resources or not," said Chucks.
However, this amount does not include any increase in the remuneration of doctors.
Commenting on the fact that the medical profession is not enthusiastic about the fact that all three options of the healthcare financing model, including the one that provides for an additional payment to patients, are being driven by the MM in government, Chucks said that by directing all three models, the government is given the opportunity to choose.
Jansons also added that by directing all three models, it is possible to clearly demonstrate that Latvia is not ready to impose an additional burden on the population.
As already reported, the Ministry of Health will defend the option of the financing model for health care, which does not envisage an overall increase in tax burden, but requires that part of the social tax be passed on to health, says the conceptual summary of the report "On the change of the financing model of the Latvian health care system".
At the same time, the Ministry indicated that the best option for financing health care will be chosen as a result of discussions by the end of September.
Local watermelons are ready.
Arbūzi has given up this year, admits the owner of Arojas Rolands Dambis in Grobiņa municipality Medze parish.
Watermelons can already be purchased in the Liepaja market.
Several early varieties have begun to be produced, but the later tubers have dropped well, according to the regional newspaper Kursa Laiks.
"This year the watermelons grow better than last year", says the grower of large berries in Rucava district Artis Ķūsis.
In terms of weather conditions, too, this summer is much more favorable than the previous one when it was cold and windy.
Liepaja theatre guest performances in Riga start.
On August 12 and 13, Liepāja Theatre will visit the Daile Theatre in Riga, offering the audience performances nominated for the "Spēlmaņu nakts" award, as well as a bright intrigue - the solo show by Herbert Lakšteins, director of Liepaja Theatre, and the portal Delfi informs the theatre representatives.
On the evening of August 12, the audience will be shown the human drama "Zilon person" by the director Laura Groza-Ķibere.
It is a story of a real historical person - John Merica - who lived in Victorian London and was called Elephant Man because of his deformed body of inherited disease.
In the studio the title role is represented by the actor Egons Dombrovskis, who has received the nomination "Accomplice of the Year" for Merika's role.
As the critic Normunds Akot described his accomplishment, Merik is a "heart missed" role in which the image born cannot be repeated."
On 13 August the audience will be offered the production Portraits.
The performance has received six nominations of "Spēlmaņu nakts", including "The performance of the big form of the year".
The director has created the production as a peculiar gallery of portraits, giving equally great importance to every image of the play, so each of them is both a center and a background.
The performance consists of a series of mini shows, which, in the end, connect together.
It is an observation of human nature, where the main conflict is between true emotions and cold-blooded calculation, and it is brightly revealing how a person changes in different situations - each of the heroes is sometimes a wolf, who, for the sake of covetousness and his own benefit, breaks up the surrounding sheep, which is sometimes broken by someone else.
On both of these dates, a solo performance by the director of Liepaja Theatre Herberts Lakšteins "Man Who Wakes of the Lift" in the direction of Gaļina Poliščuka will be played in the Small Hall.
It's not a sad thing, but a humorous story about how a person's only friend becomes an elevator.
Despite the cemetery style, which dominates the visual image of the performance, the dominant intonation of the production is bright and even optimistic.
"A man who avoids the lift" is not about the doom of loneliness and age, but about the fact that life is worth loving.
Even if it seems that there is nothing about," wrote Līga Ulberte, a critic about the performance.
Tickets for all productions can be purchased at "Biļešu paradīze" box offices and online.
Detective Olga: My work is not serial, but real life.
Olga Zelika, owner and investigator of "Riga Detective Agency", is already waiting for me halfway.
She laughs loudly and leaves a very positive human impression.
She's dressed in white trousers and white jacket -- a very elegant woman who overturns all my ideas about what a woman-detector should be like.
She's waiting for me with a champagne, which I'm kind to refuse.
I'm telling you I'm addressing her because I found it interesting that a woman is dealing with such an extraordinary thing.
It's always a male job.
Olga has a higher legal education - master's degree.
He used to work in the criminal police.
He realized that he wanted something of his own and founded his own business.
That's enough knowledge.
"I really didn't want to go back to Poland," Olga says.
It's a routine.
There, in the criminal police, we investigated the cases, we collected information.
We work with suspects.
"This year we celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Riga Detective Agency".
She calls for an anniversary celebration: "There will be no drinking."
Everyone's a man of promise.
When asked about her business, Olga says, "Business is very specific."
For the first five years, I had a team.
Then I realized that working in a team is sometimes dangerous.
It's a business where, if someone works unprofessionally, they can get into a very bad situation.
If journalists have fifth power, then we are second.
Of course, the sphere is not simple.
Many try to set us up because we commit fraud with our mate.
That's what people think!
Many come and ask whether they can impose listening equipment to attract dogs.
Many have seen films.
Detectives' business is serious.
"It's collecting information," Olga says.
If there's a crime by law, I have to warn about it.
We're making green tea and laughing, so at least there's a cup to hold on to and negotiate with.
I've had a client whose husband was constantly beaten.
She was looking for protection, of course.
We also have security.
Her husband was a maniac.
At first, everything is always beautiful and good, but then it starts.
"It's the worst," Olga says.
Psihe is broken, and it happens that you can be treated like a cattle.
This may end badly.
Don't give God by suicide.
This is very dangerous.
People become victims at some point.
"Many women try to go away from their families and then return again," she says.
I refused the last order.
"It happened for the first time in my life," reveals Olga.
There was a strange situation.
The woman was married, she had a son.
"His husband beaten his son and made him disabled," Olga remembers.
I believe that a woman has a mother's instinct and, above all, needs to protect her children.
When all this happened, she came to me and asked me to get rid of that man.
Some people are obsessed with revenge.
The most terrible thing is that the mother turned her eyes on it.
I can't understand that.
Her child is now disabled.
We couldn't find a corpse once, and the dog was very helpful.
The drug department cannot do without dogs at all.
"I understand that there are adequate people and there are those who don't have a whole psyche," she says.
Of course, the facts of fraud are topical.
Or divorce takes place in the family and information needs to be collected.
They find out who the guilty party is.
The last thing I've ever had about the subject is that my friends have deceived other friends.
It's interesting because once men smothered, now women.
Even the best friends are fighting!
Women "put" friends for 100 and more thousands of euros.
Women need to be careful when going abroad because they can be sold into slavery.
"Latvian women are intelligent and trust too much", Olga believes.
In some cases couples go abroad to get married a second time.
That's not legal.
Olga says that she had a husband like Jesus Christ.
Long, long hair.
When I was 22 years old, a tragedy occurred.
He had a severe head injury.
He came back as a completely different man.
"I pulled him out," Olga remembers.
It can be compared to hell, it was terrible.
When asked what is the most unusual thing that has been encountered, Olga says, "Everything is special, but it's the most crazy thing to use trust."
When a girlfriend throws a girlfriend.
He borrows and doesn't give up the money.
If you have a lawyer's education and experience in the police, you can work as a detective.
"One thing is to feel like a detective, the other is to be," Olga says.
Situations when dealing with cases of mistrust are quite crazy, because women are often not prepared to solve the situation.
They are not ready to accept the result.
This is an unpredictable situation because a person is not ready to lose a family.
Not every woman is ready to accept reality.
Young girls who feel the taste of money often use rich married men.
One man who followed his wife said that she could not have a mistress because all his wives had cheated on her.
"He was married three times", Olga remembers.
I guess it's a man's problem if all the wives cheat on him.
Olga relates the case of a woman with all her children who left the man, and she asked him if he had ever raised his hand against him.
Actually, I constantly beat him, he answered.
In such cases, I refuse to work.
I find it interesting how things are solved - whether photographs are taken and shown to the spouse, if there is evidence of fraud.
How?
"In parallel to the work of detective, data protection of natural persons exists", Olga says.
This is a provocative question.
One law lets you do everything, the other law doesn't let you do anything.
For personal interests we are allowed to take such photographs and videos, but not for public viewing.
If material is submitted to court that does not comply with the law, then there may be major problems.
To become a detective, it is not enough to have an education and experience, it also needs to be mentally sound and meet the criteria.
We're not taking the fingerprints, the police are dealing with this.
I'm saying to clients, shut off the series, here's real life!
In fact, when I was working in the (police) system, dogs had to be used, they were very helpful.
"Drugs in the department can't do without dogs at all," Olga says.
Some clients turn to me for an investigation into murders, but I don't like taking such things.
These are very difficult things.
Now there are more and more clients of men, because women tend to mock men.
It used to be different.
Now women are entertaining, but men are sitting at home with children.
"Of course, decent people suffer the most," Olga says.
I like Dale Carnegie.
He says stop worrying and start real life.
We all know that if you hit one face, you have to turn the other, but you can't!
You have to say that it's unpleasant.
This must not be the case.
There must be no fear of losing the things that hinder life!
You mustn't become a masochist, and what we're letting do with ourselves is going on with us.
Yes, my first case was directly related to her husband's infidelity when a woman was not prepared to accept the fact that her husband was cheating on her.
She kept calling and asking her what to do.
"I'm asking all the clients now if they're ready to accept a situation when they find out that their husband is really cheating on him," Olga says.
It's not entertainment, it's life.
If you come and hire a detective, you have to take responsibility.
It's not a theater, a show, but real life.
I'm also a rakes specialist.
It is a heart thing and associated with Japanese medicine - treatment by hand.
It's a very interesting thing.
Why have I started doing this?
This is due to a large amount of adrenaline, and you need something to calm yourself down.
Reiki not only calms, but restores energy, illuminates.
"People leave my office positively and satisfied," Olga says.
She has reiki marks on the wall in the office, and Olga tells us that they are written not with a brush but with fingers.
I didn't just get to that point, the book about Reiki literally fell into my hands.
I felt it as a sign.
However, this is very personal.
Find out more about the rake here.
Olga sings, too.
It's her hobby.
We were all afraid of creativity.
I've been playing guitar from 11 years of age.
I've written songs and clips.
I am positive and smiling, but I have to rest in order to recover.
Others are saved by alcohol, and I'm reics.
Alcohol is sinking.
The police use it a lot because the work is stressful.
"It causes aggression, and moves can be unpredictable", she says.
I'm interested in sport and reics.
For 15 years, I worked with tennis.
I also liked riding horses.
I cut off in nature, write articles, and want to write a book.
There is a fine limit to the work when it comes to your life.
"It's a job that you shouldn't let in," she says.
When asked how work can be combined with private life, Olga says, "My beloved man is in Italy."
We have very strong feelings.
That's probably the real love in my life.
I have enough to think about him, and I feel better.
The detectives don't usually trust me, but he has accepted my job.
In fact, I separate work from private life.
I'm not even in this business.
Reiki has directed me.
Already when I was a child, I saw more than others.
Thanks to rakes, intuition opens.
There are many detectives, but few actually working.
In any case, it's working with the brain, and it's hard to shut down.
You also need rest.
"Other way you can't come back," Olga admits.
The most serious case I have worked with is the story of Constant.
I've been working on that thing for a year.
The man literally laughed at that woman.
I did so that the child and her mother left for England - further away from danger.
There was no alternative.
We must not pity ourselves.
We're looking for compassion.
You can't do that.
We have to be happy about every day we have.
Thanks to God.
There are three good things to tell someone else every day.
You have to do a good job or devote a day to yourself.
We can't do this with men.
That is a big mistake.
I have to understand that a man, not a child, is next to us, and I need him to take care of us.
If it's not okay, you have to turn around and go.
You can go to church, it has helped me a lot.
Do not be fanatic, but do what likes and helps.
Nothing will change if there is no change, you have to leave and change your life.
Under no circumstances should we put ourselves and our children in danger.
Don't sit and wait.
Humans are created to do good and to support each other.
If God created us, we are already needed and not in vain in this world.
Never sit on the spot!
How to prepare for the family photo session.
Summer is still in full swing, and immediately another school year, which families tend to capture in photo memories.
To make the pictures look happy and beautiful, it is worth considering how to prepare for the photo session in advance.
Ihappymama's advice is provided by the mother of many children Aleksandra Nesterenko and the professional photographer Marina Levickaja.
You have to photograph it in nature, because it is much more natural and harmonious.
The study makes it much harder for children to feel and relax.
It is recommended to choose a uniform style for the whole family, preferably in the same colour range.
For example, Alexandra says that she chooses clothing for all six members of her family in such a way that the clothes are no more than three shades of color and as few inscriptions as possible.
Don't forget to be in a good mood.
Have fun, joke, play, but never yell or psyche if children are not as obedient as they would like.
And here’s the next advice from a professional photographer’s dowry chest!
You have to understand what exactly you want to capture during the photo session and tell the photographer about it.
For some, they will be beautiful, neat children and an ideal family picture, for others, "life is what it is like", namely, the desire to see real, genuine emotions in the pictures, or, as the photographer loves to say, "refugee backs", "eyes open", "raised up the nose".
Of course, it happens that someone also wants "two in one", but this happens rarely.
In any case, when you go to the photo session, you have to understand that it's just a couple of hours from your life, and the less you'll get a penny, the better.
You're yourself -- there's no hard mother working, cooking, raising, and so on, and not an old dad who's always talking on the phone.
And neither is the man who lives in you behind an unknown shell.
Be a family, remember how great it is to hug each other, smile at your own and joke.
And then the photographer's task will be to capture the right moments of emotion that prevails between you.
If you have chosen a photographer, trust him.
Stop asking 250 times to show you what has happened, listen to his advice on choosing clothing, a place for better shots.
Tilt and iron all the clothes you need in advance so that you don’t have to do so on the day of the photosession.
Plan the route and think about how much time you will need to get to the photosession (especially if the photography takes place in the studio and the time is limited).
If you have young children, then choose a time for a photo session that corresponds to the routine of the day so that it does not happen at a time when the baby normally sleeps in the afternoon.
And, of course, don't forget to bring food, cookies, water and a favorite toy with your children (to be used only in extreme situations).
He prepares that he may need to wear his socks, but he usually doesn’t write about it in such tips, and only photographers know what the problem is, admits Marina.
Don't drink much water before the photo shoot and lie well before that.
And after the photo session, it would be advisable to have some entertainment together.
Go to the amusement park, eat some ice cream, ride roller skates, something that the family likes more.
This way you will at the same time have obtained great pictures and pleasant memories of the day spent together.
Krasnopyorov and Fadejeva: Raising the minimum wage - a miracle or a brake for the economy?
The question of raising the minimum wage in the public debate has almost the status of a holy cow: either to support an increase, or to mention some unspeakable, general phrases.
In view of the significant increase in the risk of stagnation of the economy (as soon as we barely avoided technical recession), it is important to stress that raising the minimum wage is not a miracle that will reduce income inequality with one hint, will bring Latvian salaries closer to the level of Western Europe and will fill the state budget.
On the contrary, if the minimum wage is raised too much, it does more harm than good because raising it undermines the competitiveness of businesses and employment, especially in sectors and low-income regions.
At first glance, it seems that despite several increases in minimum wages in the post-crisis period, the minimum wage in Latvia is not so high that raising for the usual few tens of euros per year would significantly weaken the competitiveness of companies - only 370 euros, while in some European Union (EU) countries the minimum wage is around one and a half thousand.
However, a different picture can be seen if we compare it with the average wage in the country (%) - the minimum wage in Latvia (44%) exceeds the EU average.
As the proportion of recipients of minimum wages in Latvia is substantially higher than in neighbouring countries (17% in Latvia, 11% in Lithuania, 6% in Estonia[1]), a similar increase in minimum wages is binding for most companies.
According to the results of the survey of Latvijas Banka companies, one in five Latvian companies replied that, as the minimum wage increased at the beginning of 2014, it was important or very important for this to increase the prices of products.
This means, firstly, that the rise in the minimum wage was partly financed by consumers (i.e. residents of Latvia); secondly, raising prices for several companies meant loss of competitiveness both in the domestic market and abroad (i.e. increased imports and limited exports).
Due to weaker competitiveness and shrinking production volumes, it was important for almost every fifteen Latvian companies to lay off their employees (which means more unemployment and emigration).
In addition, almost one in eleven companies replied that it was important for him to limit the recruitment of new employees as a result of raising the minimum wage.
It is worth remembering that in 2011-2013 the minimum wage in Latvia did not change.
Therefore, even if, when assessing raising the 2014 minimum wage, one in five companies pointed to improving productivity as important, this does not mean that a similar result could be expected in 2017 as well (a fourth increase in the minimum wage in a row could exhaust productivity gains).
Another important result is that, due to the rise in the minimum wage, it was also important for several companies to increase the remuneration of employees earning more than the minimum wage.
Thus, the impact of the minimum wage was significant even for those companies where no employees received the minimum wage.
In recent years, the rise in the minimum wage in all three Baltic States exceeded the increase in nominal labour productivity (real labour productivity + inflation).
Thus, a further increase in the minimum wage, despite the generally rather low level in euro, will have a negative impact on the competitiveness and employment of enterprises, which is not justified by productivity growth.
When assessing the validity of raising the minimum wage, an analysis of the average indicators of the economy is not enough.
It should also be assessed whether raising the minimum wage is "tolerable" in the sectors and regions where the minimum wage is most commonly used.
The results of the survey of the Bank of Latvia show that the highest concentration of employees with minimum wages is in small enterprises (the number of employees is from 10 to 19 employees; 25%).
At the end of 2013, the share of employees with minimum wages was higher in the industrial and service sectors (16% and 19% respectively) than in the trade (15%), construction (11%) and financial and insurance sectors (2%).
On the other hand, in Latgale, where the minimum wage is 64% of the average wage (and more than two thirds of the average wage in the private sector), its further rise may rather harm by reducing labour demand (i.e. maintaining already high unemployment) and promoting the sustainability of the shadow economy.
Some signs indicate that the significant rises in the minimum wage (by 27% in total) implemented in 2014-2015 have slowed the development of Latgale.
For example, Latgale is the only region in Latvia where unemployment was higher in 2015 than in 2013.
It should be noted that Estonia and Lithuania do not have any region that is so far lagging behind in terms of average wages from the rest of the country.
In Estonia, for example, the average wage in all regions is at least twice the national minimum wage.
In Lithuania, the lowest wages are in the Taurage region, but also there, the minimum wage in 2015 was 54% of the average wage (after two rapid increases in the minimum wage in 2016 this figure could reach 58%).
The call to raise the minimum wage from time to time in public discussions to up to 68% of the average wage in the country (see, for example, here) lacks economic justification and cannot be implemented in the short and long term.
Firstly, a figure so high from the average wage or even as close to it is not in any EU country.
Secondly, it would mean raising the minimum wage above the average wage in several sectors of the economy (which would mean bankruptcy and mass redundancies in these sectors), for example, in the production of clothing, leather products, fish processing, catering services as well as in veterinary services; moreover, it is more than the current average wage in the private sector of Latgale.
Raising the minimum wage from January 2017 to EUR 400-410 per month, as currently proposed by the Ministry of Welfare, would make the minimum wage in Latvia (% of the average salary) one of the highest in the EU.
If nominal productivity increases by 4% and the minimum wage rises at least twice as fast, this has clearly negative consequences for the competitiveness and employment of businesses.
Such negative effects will be most common in those sectors and regions where the current minimum wage level is often used, for example, in Latgale.
The fact that a substantial rise in the minimum wage cannot be tolerated now means that other mechanisms should be used to support low-wage recipients.
An immediate effect can be achieved by travelling the non-taxable minimum (within the limits of the budget) of personal income tax.
Insufficient educational attainment, inadequate education and poor quality of education, as well as poor health (often due to lack of medical cost and long waiting lists) are among the real causes of income inequality.
During the survey 521 responses of the Latvian company on the response to the January 2014 rise in the minimum wage were obtained.
The survey was carried out within the framework of the Wage Dynamics Network (WDN) project.
These figures represent companies with a number of employees of not less than 10.
This also explains the low proportion of employees with minimum wages in construction.
11 fires were recorded in Latvia last day, according to operational information of the State Fire and Rescue Service.
In terms of lats, the biggest fires had occurred in Ogre district Ogresgala parish, where 80 square meters were burned in an unmanaged residential house and Railway Malas street in Jekabpils, where a shed of 30 square meters was burned with open flames.
On Thursday, firefighters also went to calls to burn waste, tires, two cars, building walls and ceilings, barns, house roofs, and unattended food.
During the 24 hours the service has also participated in 21 rescue operations.
Deaths, victims or rescued persons are not reported.
In total, over the last 24 hours, the LAG responded to 38 calls, six of which were misleading.

The Huffington Post is leaving the legendary editor, Hafingtone.
Arianna Hafingtone, co-founder and editor-in-chief of the U.S. media holding The Huffington Post, announced his departure from the company after 11 years of work.
"The Huffington Post", created in 2005 and awarded with the Pulicer Prize, offers serious political and economic journalism every day, as well as a reflection of the Internet's sensations in the news, is considered to be a pioneer in media development at a time when digital technology solutions are rapidly evolving.
From the beginning of his work in 2005, he offered innovative and interactive content solutions under conditions when there was no Twitter, but Facebook gained popularity only among students in state colleges.
Shortly after the re-election of the representative of the Republican Party, George Bush, as President of the United States, Hafingtone did not hide that media journalists represented liberal values, and with this view of the world will also produce news material.
Now Hafingtone has discovered on Twitter that after leaving she is going to start a new business - she plans to create a startup "Thrive Global" to deal with employee health and overload issues.
It is not yet known who could take her place under the leadership of The Huffington Post.
During her work, the portal gave up anonymous comments, stressing to Hafington that freedom of expression is granted to people who stand for what they say and who do not hide behind anonymity.
Also under her leadership in the summer of 2015, it was decided to publish the news of the US presidential candidate Donald Trump in the entertainment news section.
It is true, at the end of 2015, stating that Trump's rhetoric is dangerous to the US public, the news of the odious candidate was published again in the policy section.
In 2011, the U.S. Internet Media Group AOL decided to purchase the rapidly growing news web site "The Huffington Post", which was visited by almost 25 million readers every month at the time of the transaction.
The deal amounted to USD 315 million.
In 2015, the telecommunications giant "Verizon" acquired AOL for 4,4 billion US dollars.
Also, in 2016, Verizon bought the Internet business parts of Yahoo.
With these deals, The Huffington Post, once an influential and independent medium, became a small part of a giant corporation.
Currently, the media content of the famous brand is available in nine international versions, with a total monthly unique number of visits of 81 million.
Four people killed in bombs in Thailand.
In the Thai resort town of Huahin and the southern provinces of the country, there have been nine explosions in the last 24 hours, killing at least four people and several dozen injured, announced the authorities on Friday.
In southern Thailand, in Suratthany province, two explosions took place on Friday about eight o’clock in local time.
One bomb exploded in a flower pot in front of a sea police building, killing a municipal employee and wounding a man, announced Governor of Suratthani Province, Wongsiri Promčana.
"I think it's related to the explosions in Huahin," said the Governor.
The second explosion took place in front of the provincial police station.
On Friday morning in southern Thailand, there were also two explosions on the tourist’s favorite island of Phu Quetta.
On Friday morning, two bombs exploded at the bell tower in Huachin, killing one and wounding three people.
It has already been reported that on Thursday evening shortly before midnight in the resort town of Huahin, two explosions were inflicted, killing one woman and injuring another 19 people, including foreigners.
The woman killed in Huahin on Thursday was a Thai woman.
Of the 19 wounded three were in serious condition, and seven of the wounded were foreigners - four women and three men.
The bombs in Huahin were hidden in two flower pots, one foot [50 m] apart.
Explosives were detonated by mobile phones with a half-hour difference.
Before that, on Thursday one person died in an explosion in the province of Trana in southern Thailand.
The police rescue the baby from overheating in the car; the parents are threatening to break the glass with court actions.
In Riga yesterday, municipal policemen rescued the baby from a hot car, while the parents of the child threatened the police with court works about the broken car glass, LETA informed the Riga Municipal Police (RPP).
Yesterday a excited man came to the patrol and told him that in the Spice parking lot, he saw a car in which an infant was present for half an hour without the presence of adults.
Upon arriving at the scene, an eyewitness car was found that was parked in the sun.
In the front passenger seat there was a child’s seat in which the infant was present.
It was the rays of the sun that shone on the child.
The baby shouted loudly, breathed intensely, and his face was reddened and sweated.
Given that the owner of the vehicle was not present on the spot, an immediate decision has been taken to break the rear glass of the car in order not to endanger the health and life of the infant.
The child with the entire seat is highlighted from the hot vehicle, and the medical staff called.
The child breathed shallow, the skin was reddened and hot, so until the medical staff arrived, the guards of the order applied a cool compress to their forehead.
Nearly at the same time, medical staff and children’s parents arrived.
When the baby’s father saw the broken window on his vehicle, he was aggressive and the medical staff were not allowed to reach the child.
Discussions with parents have been carried out and it has been explained that children under the age of seven are forbidden to leave one unattended.
In addition, the child was left in conditions of health and life - threatening nature.
After the discussion, the medical staff looked at the victim and found that no hospitalization was required.
The child’s parents, on the other hand, categorically refused to give any explanation about the event and threatened with court actions on the broken glass of the car.
During the discussions with their parents, there was no indication that they were under the influence of alcohol or could otherwise harm the child, so the baby less than four months old was given to both.
The case materials have been sent to the Children’s Crime Prevention Division, whose employees will assess parental responsibility.
The RP reminds us that even if the outside is not very hot, a car left in the sun heats up very quickly.
If a child or a pet is left in such a car, it can be life threatening.
The members of LPF could request the suspension of Poni.
Members of the Latvian Swimming Federation (LPF) could in the near future request the President of the Federation to abolish its current director Kaspars Poni, told LETA's former vice president Jānis Dzenis.
He said that, in view of the criticism voiced in recent days about Poni and his activities in the Federation, several members of LPF have signed a letter asking for a general meeting of LPF, which is the highest institution of the Federation, and it is entitled to decide any question raised at the general meeting of LPF.
Members of the Federation are not satisfied with Pone's leadership style, moreover, his trip to the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games, which, in turn, were not able to go to the Latvian record Olympics by the coach of the swimmer Aļona Ribakovis German Jakubovskis, was considered unethical and unworthy by the President.
Mr Dzenis pointed out that LPF members, as well as Mr Aivars Platonovs, Secretary-General of the Federation, have done a lot of work for the federation and sport, but the contribution of Pone to the federation is not very welcome.
A dwarf who worked for a long time in the Federation explained that the Federation had a noticeable attempt to concentrate power in the hands of one person.
Therefore, the members of the federation could also request an amendment to the statutes governing LPF’s activities, which would rule out this possibility in the future.
Dzens explained that there had been dissatisfaction with the work of Pones in the Federation for a long time, however, the events of the last few days have served as members of the "last castle" federation in order to decide that action should be taken.
The former vice president of the Federation said that during the activities of Pone, the work of the board of coaches and judges was greatly reduced.
He explained that in order to ensure faster progress of processes and decision-making in the Federation, LPF members had decided at a general meeting to allow the board, which consisted of Pone and two vice presidents, to lead the federation.
However, as Dzenis admitted, Pone deceived members of the federation.
The members of the Federation trusted Pontus, believing that it would be possible to make decisions faster in the Federation.
"He failed the trust of his members, because in practice he took power in his hands, making an unethical step", Dzenis pointed out.
"This attitude cannot be from a person who should serve as an example to other sports representatives," admitted Dzenis.
In his opinion, Poe tried to satisfy his ambitions as President, which, in turn, does not honor him as President of LPF.
The long-term secretary-general of LPF Vladimir Maslovskis told LETA that a letter to the federation could be submitted next week, so that the general meeting of LPF should be held within one month.
In his opinion, the general meeting had to "speak all the issues of concern" and decide on the next steps.
On Friday, Poe had not yet been informed that LPF's members planned to convene a general meeting to decide on his dismissal.
I don’t know anything about calling such a meeting yet, so I don’t have any comments.
As regards the fact that my fellow Members are dissatisfied with my work, there has been only one case so far, with the coach Jakubovski mentioned, when some dissatisfaction has been expressed.
Before the London Olympic Games, when Ribakov was not approved among the participants, he complained to the International Water Sports Federation (FINA) and invited Latvia not to send any athletes.
"After this case Jakubovskis lost the position of senior coach of the sample, because his actions were not in line with LPF's interests," said Pone.
He also stressed that the general meetings of LPF members, in which he had reported on the progress made, had not received any accusations so far.
"On the contrary, we have received recognition that the quality of the federation's work has improved", said the President of LPF.
Poe also explained that the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro were not going to have fun, but to work.
The majority of people in Latvia do not understand and understand what the functions of the presidents of the federations are.
People do not understand that we are volunteers in these positions, and, unlike the leaders of the Latvian Olympic Committee (LOK), for example, we do not receive wages.
At the same time, we must ensure that the sport federation has enough funding, as only 10% of the required amount is received by the state LPF.
During the Olympic Games, I have had formal and informal meetings with representatives of the international federation and various international programmes, including international sponsors.
"The same has been introduced and I worked on one of the stages of the World Cup in Riga in 2018," said Pone.
According to data of the portal "Firmas.lv", in 2015 LPF's revenue totalled 249 444 euros, which is almost 36 000 euros more than in 2014.
About 40% of this amount was made up of targeted grants received last year, the amount of which, compared to 2014, increased by approximately 10 000 euros.
In the form of members, accessions and other annual contributions, LPF also received approximately 43% more revenue or 109 442.
Last year, the Federation received 35 532 euros in the form of donations and gifts.
Last year, the Federation's expenditure had increased by about 70 000 euros compared to 2014, spending 263 876 euros in 2015.
The biggest expenses were not related to cash payments to individuals, material expenses or salaries - 215 733 euro in the statement is presented as "other expenses".
In cash payments, people spent 20 549 euros, while wages paid 14 684 euros.
According to the information provided by Germany, the Commission considers that the measures in question do not constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) of the Treaty.
As reported, the Ministry of Education and Science requested clarification to the Latvian Olympic Committee (LOK) on LPF President Pones' participation in the Rio Olympic Games, which, in turn, have not been visited by the coach of Latvian swimmer Ribakov Jakubovskis.
Latvian nationals have not been affected by the explosions that occurred in Thailand, according to an entry by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) on the social website Twitter.
According to the Ministry, according to the information at the disposal of the Honorary Consul in Thailand, Latvian nationals have not suffered from explosions.
LETA has already announced that the MFA invites travellers to regularly follow information on political and security developments in the country, as well as to verify the security of the place of stay, pointing out that there is a high threat of terrorism in the country.
The Latvian MFA invites to avoid meeting places, to be particularly careful and attentive when staying in public places and to follow the instructions of local authorities.
Travellers who are in or plan to go to Thai resorts shall be invited by the Ministry to contact tour operators or airlines, specifying whether the journey will be carried out as planned.
The Ministry also invites travellers to regularly follow information on political and security developments in the country, as well as to verify the security of the place of stay.
There is a high threat of terrorism in the country.
In view of the unstable security situation in the country, the FAS does not recommend to travel to the border area between Thailand and Cambodia, as well as to the provinces in the border area between Thailand and Malaysia - in Patani, Yal, Narathivate and Sonkhla.
In case of emergency, the Ministry invites to contact the 24-hour guest of the Consular Department by phone +371 26 33 77 11 or e-mail palidziba@mfa.gov.lv.
It also strongly recommends that anyone travelling abroad purchase a life and health insurance policy, which also provides for repatriation in the event of sickness or death, as well as registration in the Consular Register.
The Messi, however, will not leave Argentina's football selection.
Lionels Messi, a football superstar, decided to return to the Argentine State Union after a short period of reflection, announced the player himself on Friday.
In July, the Argentinian team failed for the second year in a row in the finals of the Copa America tournament, re-accepting Chile's superiority in the decisive match.
Immediately after the loss, Messi announced that he would end his career in the State Union, but after that he was reported to be able to return to the sample.
"I thought about leaving the sample, but my love for Argentina and the sample is too big," said 29-year-old Messi.
The Spanish gram Barcelona attacker in the Messi national team ranks in a total of 112 matches scored 55 goals, which is the best indicator ever.
Together with the adult team Mesi has not been a great success, although in 2014 Argentina became a world vice-champion.
Mesi five times called the world's best footballer.
The Chinese for Dzens and Dzeliņš double the weight in Rio 20 km walking distance.
On Friday, the Chinese marchers Van Dzen and Cai Dzelin won a double victory in the 20 - mile [20 km] Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
The Olympic Champion was crowned Dzen, who ran the distance in an hour in 19 minutes and four seconds, at the finish by 12 seconds ahead of Dzeliņš.
The bronze was won by the Australian marcher Dain Baird-Smits, who lost 23 seconds to the Dean.
Kai Bonfim, a favorite of the houses, corrected the Brazilian record, but he missed five seconds to climb the podium.
Four years ago, he won a bronze prize in London.
He also has two silver medals at the world championships on the same distance.
Judo Coach Baskins: Nikiforenko is not the heavyweight.
Latvian judisti trainer Oleg Baskins honestly admitted that Artūrs Ņikiforenko at the Rio Olympics had hardly any chance to beat the much heavier Azerbaijani athlete Ušangi Kukauri.
There was no practical prospect, only minimal if he had been caught on a technique or parter.
We had already expected it to happen.
He was prepared right, he fought right, but the opponent was stronger.
The opponent was well known, because Nikiforenko had already fought against him twice and both had lost Arthur.
He's heavier, though.
Artūrs has been artificially charged to the heaviest weight category to join the Olympic team.
The weight category of up to 100 kilograms was already occupied, so Arthur used the European quota in the heavy weight category.
With a weight of 100 kilograms, Arthur fought against a Judadist who is 140 kilograms and who has won serious tournaments a couple of times.
In the heavy weight category in general there are very few random moments.
If in light weight categories there are all sorts of turns, then in heavy - very rare.
When asked whether it would be better to fight one degree in a lighter weight category in the future, Baskin replied in the affirmative.
I think yes, Arthur would better fight in the category of up to 100 kilograms.
It's his real weight category.
He's not the heavyweight.
65% of Venezuelans want to withdraw Maduro, the question is whether they are prepared to fight for it.
Two out of three Venezuelans want to suspend President Nicholas Maduro, but the question is whether they are prepared to fight for it.
A day after the National Election Board announced that "there is no time" for the withdrawal of this year's vote, with which Chavismo will be in power until 2019, people on the streets of Caracas continued their usual daily life as if nothing had happened.
"I didn't hear the news because I watched the Olympic Games and how Michael Phelps got two more medals," said Raphael Dayn, a 36-year-old office employee who was resting on Wednesday on Altamira Square.
In early 2014, Altamira Square, located in eastern Caracas, was the epicentre of intense unrest that protested against the Maduro regime.
Now, however, when the opposition has to exert more pressure than ever before in order to achieve a referendum this year, people across the country are no longer showing this kind of energy.
"I want a referendum, but I'm not going to take part in the protests for security reasons," Dian said.
Others, more informed, want to mobilise in the future, but admit that Venezuelans are less motivated.
Tibisei Lusen, Chairman of the Electoral Board, commented on the claim that the government is hindering the withdrawal process.
I will protest whenever the opposition calls for protest, but I know that some of my friends are afraid," Roberto Reyes (60), said Fox News Latino.
So, in addition to all the barriers that the government has built to prevent a referendum, the opposition is now facing a new challenge: to motivate people to go to the streets and protest.
Until recently, the referendum initiative had broad support - during the process of collecting signatures, people arrived in unprecedented numbers.
However, when it comes to protesting against the government's moves to block efforts, the number of arrivals at the rallies is considerably lower.
"Some people focus on food chain building, while others are afraid of arrests and deaths after 2014," said Cipriano Eredia, the legislator representing the opposition.
After Lusen announced that the next step in the referendum process - the collection of even more signatures throughout the country - will have to wait until October, those who are against the socialist government say that President Maduro and his followers are simply trying to take away the courage of the Venezuelans by making them believe that this year's vote is practically impossible.
According to the Constitution, if a referendum were held in 2017, Maduro could be suspended, but he would be allowed to name the next president.
If he was suspended today, he has a duty to declare universal elections.
The U.S. Department of State addressed this issue in a Thursday afternoon's statement calling on the Venezuelan authorities to guarantee respect for the constitutional rights of Venezuelans.
"The other steps towards the lifting of the President's referendum must be taken clearly, specifically and immediately, thus contributing to a rapid and effective resolution of the country's current political, economic and social difficulties," it said.
Luis Salamanka, a policy analyst who was a member of the election board between 2006 and 2009, that changes are not expected so soon.
"I think there will be no referendum this year unless social unrest and protests get even stronger," he said in FNL.
He said that Lusen and the government are breaking the law, but as a result they will achieve their goal if people do not protest loudly.
The opposition in September called for a broad manifestation. First of all, in Caracas, to demand to speed up the process so that the withdrawal could take place this year.
We want people from all over the country to be mobilised in the capital on this day.
The government will be under pressure," said Eredia.
Salamanca, on the other hand, believes that this situation cannot wait so long.
"They should respond to Lusen's statement faster and stronger, because it practically kills a referendum," said the expert in FNL.
Congressman Eredia admitted that some opposition parties want to make the manifestation happen faster, while others want more time to organise the group.
The opposition now needs to be cautious.
If people feel insecure in this situation, there is a risk that the activity of the second campaign for collecting signatures will be low," Salamanca said.
The referendum process for it to be activated must receive support from twenty percent of the national voters, which is almost 4 million people.
Salamanca and other analysts are convinced that even if the withdrawal takes place in 2017, Chavismo will be saddened.
However, some people are less optimistic.
Our party wants a political change today.
"If the government closes the way to the elections, we will have to explore other legal options," Eredia said to the FNL.
The Director of the LNSC, A.Puķe, shall be suspended temporarily from office.
At the extraordinary meeting of Lielvārde District Council on 12 August, the majority of Members supported the dismissal of the director of Lielvārde Regional Sports Centre (LNSC) Ainara Puķītis from his duties for the duration of the inspection of the service.
In the near future, it is planned to find out the circumstances, about which a visitor of the gym has written to the municipality in his application.
Namely, during the visit to the gym, the LNSC client suffered a head injury.
At fault is Lielvārde Regional Sports Centre.
Taking into account the seriousness of the situation and possible recourse of the client to the court, a commission has been established by the order of Vita Volonte, Vice-Chairman of Lielvārde District Council.
Its task is to carry out the inspection of the service at the Sports Centre and to give its opinion by 16 August this year.
An extraordinary meeting of the City Council is scheduled to be re-convened next Tuesday to decide on the next steps.
It should be noted that during the specific accident A.Pukītis was on vacation.
The executive director of the sports centre from Friday to the probationary period is the deputy director of the training work Oksana Grimaluka-Nazarova.
For Ogre seniors sport is a celebration.
Today the Ogre District Sports Centre Stadium hosted the Ogre Pensioners' Association Sports Festival.
The Seniors Stadium was welcomed by Sanita Tauriņa, the organiser of the Sports Development Work at Ogre Sports Centre, who had prepared a special programme for participants of the Sports Festival.
This time individual results will not be evaluated, but participants of the sports festival will be divided into four teams.
"Each participant's contribution will be summed up as a result of the team", explains S.Tauriņa.
Participants will have to perform four tasks - basketball speed, construction of Eiffel Tower together with memory game, florbola agility relay, summer skiing.
To be successful in all four disciplines of the festival program, participants had to perform warm-up tasks - "Vienotity Circle", "Riņķis diciss", "Izpletnis", as well as three relays - horse riding, frisbe and badminton elements.
All tasks were prepared in attractive form, and participants of the sports festival made them with joy, smile and fun comments, supporting each other.
The summer skiing, which took place in the costumes prepared by the organizers, was particularly exciting.
The competition was followed carefully by volunteers of Ogre Sports Centre, who conducted the tasks, recorded the results and did not forbid advice.
There was also Ogre symbol Čiekurs everywhere, who inspired the participants of the Sports Festival.
Ogre seniors proved that they are agile enough, attractive enough, and in good sporting form.
In one minute, Peteris Zeps, a representative of the Green Team, threw the ball into a basketball basket eight times, but his teammate Jānis Staudžs was behind by one successful pitch.
Pensioners are active in Ogre.
The tours are always full of buses, and about 300 people arrive at the parties.
"We meet twice a week at the Family Support Centre, where we can play novuss, table tennis, use exercise equipment", says Jānis Staudžs, Chairman of the Ogre Pensioners' Association.
At the end of the sports festival all participants received thanks for their participation, but the greatest benefit is movement in the fresh air, good mood and time spent together.
In the 2016/2017 Premier League no.19 West Bromwich Albion
Guardian journalists predict heading 14 (Warning: it's not just Alan Smith's forecast, but our journalists' board as a whole)
Last season's 14th position
Chances of winning the League (with Oddschecker) 1000-1
Until last week, it looked like a new season, such as the old Bromwich Albion: The 2016/2017 season will again be a struggle for satisfaction or stagnation, depending on how "empty a glass is" under the even more pragmatic guidance of Tony Pulis.
However, Jeremy Pies then sold 88 % of his club shares to Guochuan Lai and Pulis, in archetypically safe hands, which the bookmakers immediately made favorites in the unpleasant role of the first redundant manager.
The situation has undeniably changed in the Balack Country - and not only Hawthhorn, but also a few miles north-west of Volverhampton, where the young Chinese owners abandoned Kenya's Jaket's services without wasting time.
Pulis has, however, confirmed that his work is not immediately threatened, and the entrepreneur has also expressed his wish not to change the culture of the club.
"I don't want to change the club's virtues or start unsustainable fun," he said, taking over duties.
I want to be a good owner and invest in this club in the long term.
First of all, our aim is to ensure that we stay in the Premier League and then go further; I would like to see the club firmly established at the top of the division.
I think it's the best league in the world, and I want to take this club as far as possible.
That is what Pulis has accomplished, and the first aspect should not be difficult.
The next goal is to break to the top of the table, but it will be important for the new owner and the increasingly divided fan base to hope for a quick breakthrough in the table up to realise that this is an extremely difficult task, given the hard work recently invested by other teams in the middle of the table.
In order to go further than the 14th place of last season, to get up, it will certainly be necessary to work more.
Only the Aston Villa, located at the bottom of the table, hit less goals, and it is worth recalling that at Christmas Albion on average made less than one blow through the gate in 90 minutes, almost the worst score of the division.
They failed to score 13 out of 38 games and to hit more than one goal only in nine games.
Of their 10 victories in no game failed to score more than one goal, and seven games ended with 1-0.
As expected, a dozen from a total of 34 gates were drawn from standard positions.
Not surprisingly, Hawthhorn was dissatisfaction in the team, perhaps the most noticeable after the shocking 0-0 draw with the Villa at the end of January, when the guest team looked better.
On the other hand, only six of the best teams had better scores in defence - although no club has managed to list four middle guards.
These guards are often undervalued, especially Johnny Evans, who wants to get to Arsenal in view of their recent crisis in terms of injured players.
The international team of Northern Ireland experienced an excellent start in the European Championship, and Albion will have to spend a lot of money on selling.
Ben Fosters at the gate is reliable and they are well packed in the middle line.
Darren Fletcher, much like Evans, demonstrated to a large extent that he was still able to play at a high level at the age of 32, and Claudio Jacob is undervalued.
All sides are disturbed by the fact that the long and pictorial story of Saido Berahino is still not clear.
Peese was the owner of the stakes from Stoke and Crystal Palace, but they still remain calm and Mark Hughes is ready to wait.
After the last season, close to liquidation, it is worth all the parties involved to take action.
The attacker is, of course, talented, but, as Pulis has said several times, he has been pushed here on one side, here on the other side, it has been seen for a long time that such a relationship has not worked.
Albion insists that it is necessary to sign the change of documents before allowing the former U-21 team member of England to go, but their 15 million pound march with Diafro Saho broke out a few days before the takeover, claiming to the club that he passed the medical check and had agreed on everything, but he had a back injury that would mean he would have to skip the start of the season.
This puts a great deal of pressure on the Venezuelan Salomon Rondon, who last season looked very hopeful for a moment, but he has to improve his nine-gate performance, especially if Ricky Lambert continues to be so inefficient.
The decision to release Victor Aniceb and Stefan Sesegnon in retrospect also looks strange.
Pulis throughout his career is notorious for his slow young players' uplifting and three teens - Jonathan Léko, Sam Fielda and Tyler Roberts' appearance in the last game of the previous season, with a draw 1-1 with Liverpool, I don't think it's going to be the norm.
He will return to the already tried and tested ones, but Leko is worth keeping an eye on.
The 17-year-old invading midfielder took part in five games in the previous season, becoming the first player born in 1999 in the Premier League, who is also highly regarded by the English youth football system.
Matt Phillips, with a 5.5 million contract with Queens Park Rangers, will be fast, but he's the only new player who took part in the first weekend.
It would not have been boldly said if the end could be quite hasty.
"Everything," Pulis last month said in Express and Star about what should be improved.
Every position you see.
We need to strengthen back players, mid-field players and front-position players.
The objectives are, we know what we want.
It turns out to be much harder to get them than expected, mainly because of the uncertainty about the takeover process.
The season could be determined by the way they have started, with seven largely winning games before the difficult race with Tottenham, Liverpool, Manchester City and Leicester from mid-October.
At that time, the pressure on the Pulis will have become less or unbearable.
And who knows, maybe even Berahino will have found a new club.
Tata Steel UK closer to the rescue transaction after the authorised changes in the retirement aid
The pension trustees standing behind Tata Steel UK said that the scheme could be restructured without being part of the Pension Protection Fund (PFF), increasing the chances of the company to conclude a rescue transaction.
The British steel pension scheme has a liability of GBP 15 billion and an estimated deficit of at least GBP 700 million, creating serious impediments to the conclusion of a rescue transaction between Tata Steel UK and Port Talbot Steelworks in Wales.
Tata Steel is increasingly convinced of securing the future of the British business, which employs 11 000 people, following negotiations with the Minister for Economic Affairs and the pension regulator.
The company plans to combine its European activities, including British business with ThyssenKrupp, a German conglomerate.
However, the conclusion of the transaction depends on whether the British steel pension scheme will be restructured and the government will provide financial support.
Alan Johnson, the pension commissioner, said that this scheme would avoid PPF if the benefits received by employees were modified.
Although this is well financed compared to other schemes, with a deficit limited to GBP 300 million for individual measures, Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp want to control their liabilities.
Johnston said that the trustees admit that it is "not realistic" for the joint venture or any buyer of Tata Steel Uk to take responsibility for financing the current and future deficits.
Modifying the benefits of the scheme was a much more binding option than joining PPF, he added, where employees would have to accept less favourable conditions.
The sources of Tata Steel warn that it could still sell to Port Talbot.
The company has consistently refused to guarantee the future of steelworks since the negotiations on the future of its British business began in March, and this has been used as a stepping stone in negotiations with the British Government.
Kushik Chatterier, Executive Director of Tata Steel Europe, said that the Indian conglomerate wants to make its steel business "more sustainable".
Speaking at the annual Tata Steel meeting in India, Chatterier said that negotiations on the restructuring of pension schemes are moving forward, but he insisted that the scheme was well funded.
"We are talking to various stakeholders, including the British Government and other stakeholders such as the Welsh Government, etc.," said Catherine, reports the Times of India.
It is believed that pensions have a certain impact on the business of goods such as steel, so we need to find a structural solution that does not prevent the business from moving forward.
The pension trustees’ willingness to cooperate in the negotiations on the restructuring of the scheme will be supported by Tata Steel.
Potential changes to the scheme include shifting how the annual inflation-based benefit increase is measured from the retail price index to the lowest consumer price index, as well as limiting future pension payments to the legal minimum.
Johnston added: "The authorised and its advisers have provided Tata Steel, the government and the pension regulator with evidence of the scheme's ability to pay the modified benefits for an indefinite period and at low risk outside the Pension Protection Fund.
Our investment strategy has meant that the financing position of the scheme has not been affected by the recent decline in the securities market in the same way as in other British pension schemes. We are still convinced of the scheme's ability to provide benefits at a self-sufficient level.
CBS commentator confuses Michael Phelps and Ryan Lohti throughout the competition
The commentator of the CBC Olympics on Thursday evening caused anger by mixing Michael Phelps with his rival Ryan Lohti.
Elliot Friedman mixed both of them all over a 200 m individual swim, where Phelps won his 22nd Olympic gold medal.
When Phelps crossed the line, Friedman kept him as Lohti, Phelps’ compatriot, and a long - standing competitor at the top of the world swimmers’ tops.
Friedman exclaimed, "Once he does it!"
Ryan Lohte will beat Michael Phelps in this race!
Phelps might not even get to the podium.
However, Phelps won, but Lohte finished fourth.
Immediately after Phelps got to the gold, the CBS broadcast was silent.
Frydman miraculously admitted his mistake right away.
I'm sorry, I mix the tracks.
Phelps with gold," he said.
The Canadian commentator, whose professionalism was appreciated by mistake on a large scale, acknowledged his mistake again within the next few hours of the event and apologized to the audience on Twitter.
I'm sorry.
I was surprised.
"No excuses," he wrote.
In the meantime, Phelps overtook the record of 2 168 years old as the winner of the largest Olympic victory ever.
The previous record belonged to Leonidas from Rhodes, who had won more Olympic titles than anyone else at the ancient Olympic Games.
Russian hackers have attacked the computer of the former NATO force commander.
Hackers have published lists of General Philip Bridlow and data on the work of one of the Soros Foundations.
The same hackers, who might have attacked U.S. Democratic Party e-mails some time ago and published their lists, could also be responsible for a new series of attacks, reports agent Bloomberg.
According to its information, these cyber-attacks have attacked the correspondence of former NATO European Force Commander General Philip Bridlow and the services of the Open Society Institute, which is part of the projects supported by the millionaire George Soros.
The attackers have published their information on DCLeaks.com.
There's correspondence from Briedlow and data on the activities of the Open Society Institute.
Hackers have been reported to have had access to fund computers for about a year.
The news agency claims that it is the same hackers who attacked the computers of the U.S. Democratic Party and are led by the Russian Special Service.
The U.S. intelligence service warned Congress high officials about a possible hacking attack on the Democratic Party a year ago.
The news agency "Reuters" says that it has information that special services told a number of politicians at that time – cyber attacks are coordinated by two Russian intelligence services or their controlled organizations.
However, Congressmen have not been able to pass on this information to the victims of cyber attacks because it has been secret.
The scandal of attacks on computers of the Democratic Party began after some 20,000 e-mails were published on the Internet, written by the party representatives during the pre-election campaign.
The party’s candidate, Hillary Clinton, announced that the leaking of these letters was organized by Russian special services.
The press secretary of the President of Russia, Dmitri Peskov, has stated that Russia has nothing to do with cyber-terrorists.

Parking in the happiest place on Earth will be even easier in the future.
The Disneyland has released information on its long planned parking lot structure, consisting of a transport hub and a new pedestrian bridge on the eastern side of the amusement park.
The project, located to the east of the amusement park 5 Freeway, includes 6 800 parking spaces and a transport hub where buses, buses, taxis and other vehicles can skip the park visitors.
A pedestrian bridge over the port boulevards connects the park with the parking lot structure and the transport hub.
This structure, together with the planned Star War of land 14 acre expansion project, is part of the US$ 1 billion promised investment in Anaheim City in exchange for a 30-year exemption from entertainment tax.
Construction of the project, which synchronizes with the Eastern Gate, will be started next year.
The parking structure will be created over the public parking area of the Disney Hero, which is approximately 1 300 places.
The transport hub will replace the commercial property purchased by the amusement park in 2014.
The project is expected to be launched in 2018.
"The East Gate is part of our substantial investment in Anaheim city, which will provide additional parking space for visitors and help to reduce congestion near the leisure park, we continue to expand the Disneyland Recreation Park," said Disney's representative Suzia Brown.
On Saturday and Sunday, the quay will be closed, which must be taken into account.

President Vējoni will be replaced by ex-premier Dombrovskis in the race of "Krastu mača" politicians.
The organizer of the "Krastu mača" Edgars Jaunups told the Latvian Television broadcast "Rīta Panorama" that the basketball race "Krastu mačs" will take place 24 hours a day.
One game will last an hour, and in total, 48 teams will match with more than 600 participants.
"Krastu maču" will be launched by the "VEF Rīga" team, which will also present its next season's players.

The Dombrovskis team will join the Rigans with Riga Vice-Professor Andris Ameriks in the lead.
In Liepāja, the insulation of the house will have to agree to two thirds of its inhabitants.
If the owners of the apartments are very harsh and talk specifically about the technical condition of the building, if there is such a possibility to receive support and arrange the building in all possible ways, then it is rather easy not to use it.
One of the most significant changes is that any apartment building will be eligible for EU co-financing from this year, only the condition is that the facade of the building should be insulated.
In advance, it was allowed to use only serial apartment buildings.
The biggest concern for house managers is the organisation of apartment owners’ meetings.
An important problem, where this process is currently delayed, is that 67% of the apartment owners' consent is required.
"The previous programme required 51%", says Toms Cīrulis, Project Manager of SIA "Liepājas nams" (LNA).
"Of course, it is very difficult to ensure this because in a large part of general meetings such a number of apartment owners do not arrive", says the project manager of the company "Namu serviss APSE" Gints Ločmelis.
The largest house managers in Liepaja - "Namu serviss APSE" and the LNA, which serve around 900 buildings, plan to renovate at least 50 apartment houses in the new planning period until 2020.
They do not exclude the possibility that it will be difficult to convince people to vote for renovation works at the start of the work, but with each project the attitude of citizens should improve.
I had to get a bank loan, too, and it took 76% of the home population.
"Speaking, explaining what will be - I got those signatures," says Vita Iesalniece, the oldest energy-efficient building in Latvia.
John agrees with her, who also lives in a warmer building.
Well, you can't make up a party, and the other side plus one person then disagrees.
"No, of course, it is important that everyone agrees with the whole event," Jānis points out.
Such a change of rules has been proposed by representatives of the financial institution ALTUM.
They explain that with 51% of votes in banks it is not possible to attract the necessary funding, which has been experienced in the last programming period as well.
In most commercial banks, two thirds of the evidence of the owners of the apartments was required.
Anda Lagzdiņa, Head of the European Union Fund Division, of the Ministry of Economics, mentions the opportunity to introduce citizens to the existing examples and various benefits that would arise from renovation of the building, for example, energy saving.
As a young man, Aaron was persistently angry with the world for the death of his mother.
The arrest of a potential suicide bomber in Canada was worthy of a spy film.
It all began when the Canadian police received a video from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Very early in the morning, the Royal Police of Canada received reliable information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Among other things, it contained a video recording of a so-called "move", recorded by an unknown person who was clearly in the process of preparing the last attack.
"And he was going to do it with a self-made bomb," said Mike Caban, Deputy Chief of the Canadian Police.
A black masked man in English and Arabic threatened the Canadians and promised revenge for everything they had done to Muslims.
In about three hours, using facial and voice recognition software, the Canadian police have succeeded in identifying this man.
It was 24-year-old Aaron Driver.
He was already under the supervision of the probation service for praising the ideas of terrorism and radical Islam on the Internet.
A court ruling prohibited the Driver from doing this in the future and from engaging in any radical organization.
Until then, however, the authorities did not believe that Driver would pose any physical danger to others.
When the police came to his home in Stratroi, ontario, the young man came out and sat in a taxi.
At that point, the police tried to arrest him, but the driver had started the bomb while sitting on the back seat.
To prevent the second bomb from being detonated, the police shot the young man.
He's dead from his injuries.
The taxi driver hasn't suffered.
In an interview with Canadian television, Wayne Driver, father of a neutralized terrorist, said that his son had turned to Islam as a teenager.
It had initially helped him to cope with drugs and alcohol.
However, Aaron was a problematic teenager who was long - angry with the world about the death of his mother, adding his father.
Only when I saw that video on the news today did I realize how far he had gone.
I had no idea that he was so radicalized.
"And I also didn't know that he knew Arabic so well," says Aaron's father.
The Canadian police admit that if they had arrived a few hours later, the developments might have been quite different.
Radēviča will go to Rio as a tourist and support Latvian athletes.
Ineta Radēvičs said in the LTV Olympic studio that the performance of the seven-time athlete Laura Ikauniece-Admidiņa on Friday in the first two disciplines is not bad, given that the athlete was traumatized.
On the other hand, in high jumping Laura made her spring with the right leg, not as usual with the left.
Radēviča pointed out that it was comparable - just as a person who was used to writing with his right hand would suddenly be forced to write with his left hand.
Therefore, the result of the Ikamniece-Admidiņa, taking into account the injury, is not bad.
Radēviča has revealed that she has not yet contacted Ikauniece-Admidiņa, but is actively following her start and sympathizing with her.
Ineta learned about Laura's trauma recently and expressed her support for the athlete, pointing out that the athlete didn't start making safety cushions for herself, but showed the character and spirit of the fighter.
Speaking about other sports, Radēviča believes that the Olympic norms are very high, therefore one of the Latvian athletes is accused that he went to Rio as a tourist is incorrect.
She also remembered that when she went to the first Olympic Games, where she won 13th place, she was called tourists, and this creates negative emotions.
Ineta sometimes remembers her starters, not just the Olympics.
"I like to remember my emotions, not the results", remembering her experience in sports revealed Radēviča.
She told me that it was always important for there to be someone on the stands who would give us the energy of coercion.
Radēvičs herself will be a tourist this year - she will be going to Rio next week to support Latvian athletes in person.
She says you'll definitely go to athletics.
Ineta Radēviča won the European title in 2010.
In 2004 she took 13th place in the Olympic Games in Athens, and 20th position in the trilogue, but in 2008 the athlete was not pedigree because she was waiting for her son.
In London, as already mentioned, Radēviča had 4th place to jump far.
Murjāņi will show the film "Quantum Code" with physicist Kashcheev in the main role.
The film's annotation says that in parallel with electron fission in the laboratory Kashchejevs is a dreamer, a teacher, a socially active and civic-minded husband and father, who is looking for a connection with the Almighty.
The film's character in the Latvian Television programme "Rīta Panorama" pointed out that film production was an interesting experience for him.
I learned about how film is made, how it is filmed, how sound is recorded.
"And actually fantastic work," said the physicist.
He admitted that the film was made in two years.
The biggest disagreements with the director were about the name of the film.
I am categorically opposed to this name.
There is no quantum code.
"There is no secret that you could find out when watching the film, and everything is clear," added the associate professor of the University of Latvia.
Kashcheyev admitted that he liked the fact that the premiere of the movie will be made exactly during Murjāņi Open-Air Cinema Eve.
They are organized by friends from the foundation "Viegli", and these screenings will take place every evening until 9 September.
Four people died in bomb blasts in Thailand in tourist attractions
After the Thai people voted in favour of the adoption of the military-supported Constitution, on Thursday and Friday, a series of bomb blasts took place in five southern provinces of Thailand - popular tourist destinations - in which four people died and many people were injured.
The first two explosions blew off at the seaside resort in Huahin on Thursday evening, next - Friday morning.
The city is located about 200 kilometers south of Bangkok.
The police announced that one Thai woman was killed in the first explosion and 20 people were injured, 10 of them foreigners.
The authorities confirmed that other blasts blew in the southern cities of Phueket, Trança and Suratthani.
Two bombs exploded in Phueketa suburb of Patong and two more in Phanna province - the tourist region north of Phueketa.
In the last 24 hours there have been 11 bomb blasts in Thailand.
On Friday, Colonel Krisana Patanacharoen, a Thai Royal Police Officer, declared that the explosions were not related to Islamic extremists and were considered local sabotage acts.
"It is too early to draw conclusions," he said.
"But we definitely know that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, in fact it is local sabotage, and we are trying to find the perpetrators."
According to the Office of the SRSG on Children and Armed Conflict, he was responsible for recruitment and use of children in Ituri from 2002 to 2003.
On 12 August, officials announced that four people had been killed in a series of bomb explosions in important tourist areas in Thailand.
There are no conflicts in the country that could lead to terrorists in the country.
"So we can say that these incidents are not terrorist attacks," he continued.
No group has yet assumed responsibility for the attack, and the competent authorities have not accused any particular group, but the bombings took place the same week that Thai voters approved the new Constitution.
All three southern provinces - Huahina, Phūketa and Phanna - rejected the military-supported referendum, and more than 6 500 people have died since the riots in south-eastern Thailand, where the majority of the population are Muslims.
The explosions took place on the birthday of Queen Siricita of Thailand, which is a national holiday in Thailand.
Huahin is located in the royal palace Klai Kangwon, or "the castle far from the worries", which often tends to reside in Thai royal family.
King Bumibol Aduljadej was the longest reigning monarch in the world.

Porgi and Bess - what we have long deserved!
There are so many operas that have never sounded in Latvia.
There's something very rare.
It seems strange, however, that since the 1970s, George Gershwin's opus, Porghie and Bess, have not been staged or played, apart from the periodic production of the chrestomatic solo numbers such as Summertime on stage (including as a titleship at the summer festival hosted by Inese Galante), individual student projects, guest performances and the like.
There are reasons for this - since Latvia is a country in the civilised Western world, it is bound by the Gērshvin family's heirs' regulations and copyright licenses, which are valid for Porgia and Bess until 2030.
Harmonisation procedures are not straightforward.
In addition, when creating a complete production, the author wished that all fourteen soloists should be black.
In Latvia, of course, the discussions and contexts around this opera in the USA are little known from a racial point of view and the composer's desire to fulfil would be difficult.
The concert performance with the help of four artisan black American soloists and their Latvian trade brothers and sisters was performed on August 6 on the 10th anniversary of the Cēsis Art Festival, recalling the charming sound recording by Gēršvins, which intertwins European classical music traditions with American jazz rhythms, gossels, early 20th century fashion dances and memorable hits, telling the clamorous Ubag Porghy of Ketfischrow and the relaxed love story of the butterfly Bess in a musical quality that deserves documentation for the historical annals of music life.
Firstly, because of the LNSO and the conductor Andra Buta.
Despite the complex spatial location of the concert performance in the open-air park of Cesis Castle, the orchestra was on the stage next to the stage, on which the soloists were performing (and danced!) choir While, the overall sound was stylistically nuanced, contrast-rich and precise in both string and metal wind instruments and the piano party (Mārtiņš Zilberts).
Secondly, because of the great team of soloists.
The charismatic dramatic baritone Leicester Lynch (Porghie) is a favourite singer in Europe and America, with both the baritone and basbaritone parties in play, especially in Verdi operas.
The role of Porgy has been sung countless times, and on several occasions Kraun - in this opera he felt like a fish in the water and inspired stage partners even to conjure the emotional atmosphere of the poor people of the fishing village in the concert performance.
Letony Moore in her second Porghie and Bess concert performance (the first one took place in 2012 no more, no less than with Berlin Philharmonic and Sir Simon Retla) revealed as a vitally plastic combination of different vocal styles with dramaticly toned tembra and fantastic piano in the upper register.
It is not for nothing that she is one of today’s most outstanding Aida.
Attractive yamaic tenor Jermine Smith, who was seen by Andris Poga in Boston's production, the image of the drug dealer Sportinlaiff is the company's role on four continents.
In it he demonstrates his simultaneous dance and singing skills as a well-trained musical actor.
Smith is one of the rare nuggets whose voice still seems to be hiding undiscovered vocal possibilities, as it was 15 years ago when the opera voice accidentally found itself in a caricure to laugh at peers.
Unbelievable, even from line 24 and in relative darkness, German Smith's expressive gesture language allows him to see the dust bag of happiness in his hands, even if it isn't there.
How can poor Bess not follow such a mephistophelic tempter who, in vain, believe in the illusion of the wonderful life in New York City?
The tymbrally generous Rodney Clark represented the role of the crèche.
The biggest vocal surprise in the Latvian soloist team in Cēsis was the production of Sirina, represented by Sonora Vaice - a luxurious upper register, a skilled balancing between spoken and sung text, thus changing voice position, vocal acrobatics and dramatism, filled with performance both in Syrin's pity My Man is Gone Now and in the stylised amplified foretelling prayer Oh, Doctor Jesus.
The voice of Margarita Wilson sounded well in the role of Clara, but the iconic Summertime at the very beginning spoke of a little loud and nervous, gaining its true character in reprisals.
The parties entrusted to Andris Lapins (especially the Crabs seller placed on the walls of castle ruins in response to Irma's Chef's resounding Strawberry seller in soprano's thesaurus) were colorfully and brilliantly heard by Mikhail Čulpajevs, Rihards Machanovskis and Andris Lapins.
Bright characters in images of Ilona Bagell, Rihards Miller, Emīls Kivlenieks, as well as in the spoken roles, where Ivo Martinson's explorer and the director and actor of Cēsis Festival, unexpectedly presented to viewers in the image of the White lawyer Archdale, Juris Žagars, stood out.
In Viesturs Kairišs' spatial concept of a concert performance, the choir worked on steps, soloists - mainly in proscension, rarely arriving or leaving stairs.
In the dynamic activity enough, a little comical situation was done in the hands of the sheet music folder Latvian soloists.
Their presence, however, has a rather prosaic explanation.
First, some soloists sang several episodic roles (which sometimes made it difficult to track their stage identity).
Secondly, Porghie and Bess have many dialogues, a conversation with a phrase, a rejoinder, which is easier to trace with notes in front of them.
The audience was greatly helped by the titre machine to go into the details of the opera.
The weather did not spoil, and the first part of the concert performance was long enough.
However, it did not stop most listeners from staying until the end to cheer up the artists.
At nine o'clock in the evening, however, it is quite late for the opera to start at full length, especially if a longer journey from Cesis is expected, but opera Porgi and Bessa have returned to the Latvian musical circulation and will most likely become one of the most outstanding musical adventures of this summer.
Also in Liepaja, where it was said yesterday evening, as well as in quite other acoustic conditions.
In Riga, a man has feared children with a ax on the playground.
Yesterday, on August 11, at about eight o'clock, the State Police received a message from the grandmother of a terrified child, who was alarmed at the presence of a man on Lomonosova Street, in a children's playground, who was fearing children with a ax.
The law enforcement immediately responded to the call and came to the place of the event, where they also met this man with a axe, who was very heavy under the influence of alcohol at the moment of the event - 3.07 promiles.
It was found that a man born in 1962 had previously frightened his children not to make noise.
This time, however, the aggressive man used an ax to beat the equipment of the children’s playground.
The man was arrested.
Criminal proceedings have been initiated in connection with the event for the gross obstruction of public order, which manifests itself in obvious disrespect for society or in shamelessness, ignoring generally accepted norms of conduct and disturbing people's peace.
Such an offence shall be punishable by deprivation of liberty for a period of up to two years, or by temporary deprivation of liberty, or by forced labour, or by fines and by probation monitoring for a period of up to three years.
The presidents of the federations usually use guest accreditations in the Olympic Games.
The presidents of the sports federations usually come to the venue of the Olympic Games for a few days and use guest accreditations, which can change their names, therefore they have several owners during the competition, the representative of the Latvian Olympic Unit (LOV) Marita Vilciņa told LETA.
On Wednesday, a great excitement arose after the comments of German Jakubovsky coach of the Olympic swimmer Aļona Ribakov, who revealed that at the last moment he decided to go to Rio de Janeiro Olympiad, the head of the Latvian Federation of Swimming Federation (LPF), Kaspars Pone, while the coach had to stay at home.
Later it became known that Pone arrived in Brazil with a coach accreditation, about which the president himself expressed surprise, because "now there is nowhere in it".
As Vilciņa told, only two presidents of two federations - Pone, as well as Guntis Zālītis, the head of the Latvian Athletics Union (LVS), lived in the Olympic Games in London.
Athletes live in the Olympic village, as well as official persons, including, for example, coaches, doctors and the administration of the delegation.
Consequently, it is likely that Ponem also had a coach accreditation in London.
"The other presidents of the federations arrive as guests, and they have their accreditations changed - they arrive for a couple of days and after that someone else uses it", said Vilciņa, explaining that the presidents of these federations do not live in the Olympic village either.
Poe Rio de Janeiro arrived at the end of July and left Brazil on August 13, so he is likely to be the longest from the presidents of all the national federations.
It is significant that Latvian athletes participated in swimming only one day - on August 10.
Latvia will be represented in 11 sports at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, and LETA estimates indicate that the presidents of six or seven federations will attend the four-year major competitions.
The hall will arrive in Brazil on Saturday, the President of the Latvian Cycling Federation (LRF) Igo Japins will be at the BMX competition planned for next week, the President of the Latvian Windsurfing Federation Ansis Dāle has planned to fly to Rio de Janeiro on 16 August, when Ketija Birzule's start will be finished, and the President of the Latvian Fight Federation Dzintars Urbančiks – the day earlier.
The President of the Latvian Shooting Federation Kārlis Krēsliņš also planned to arrive next week, when the start of the shooter Dainis Upelnieks will be completed.
Raimonds Rublovskis, President of the Latvian Judo Federation, was not found at least during the Latvian athletes race in Rio de Janeiro, even though his arrival was planned, the Latvian Canoe Federation currently has no president, but the Latvian weight-raising society is still in conflict and its athletes are invited to international competitions by the Latvian Olympic Committee.
Meanwhile, the President of the Latvian Volleyball Federation Atis Sausnītis and the Head of the Latvian Tennis Union Juris Savickis decided not to be present in Rio de Janeiro.
Vasiljevs appreciates the natural breasts of Latvian women.
The world-famous Russian fashion historian, interior decorator, stage designer, author of books, lecturer and collector Alexander Vassiliev visits Latvia very often in recent years.
More recently, he evaluated the contestants in the final of "Miss and Misters Latvija 2016" and admitted that Latvian beauties, unlike the representatives of the beautiful Russian sex, can be proud of their natural breasts and lips, which have not been improved with silicone and botulinum injections.
In a conversation with "Vakara Ziņas" Aleksandrs Vassilievs told that for many years he has been the president of the jury in the popular "Mis Russia" beauty competition.
That is why he has also engaged with great interest in the evaluation of "Miss and Misters Latvija 2016" participants.
Asking how the standards of Latvian beauty competition differ from similar competitions in Russia, Vasilev stressed that Latvians and Russians have very different figures: "Russian beauty contestants have bigger breasts than Latvians."
However, young Latvian women are beautifully dressed and sacred, and can also be proud of their natural beauty, not the miracles of plastic surgery.
Therefore, I especially congratulate the participants of the Latvian beauty competition for their natural beauty.
Vasilev has large plans in relation to his professional activities in Latvia.
At the moment, the exhibition of the collection of fashion historians, "Favorite Nature", is on view at the Museum of Decorative Arts and Design.
In turn, in Ventspils, Livonian Order Palace, the exhibition "Wedding outfits 1860-2010" by Vassiliev is on view.
Vasilev fell so in love with Ventspils that for a couple of days he also enjoyed the city's hospitality and went for a walk along the sea.
I like it very much in Latvia.
Especially now that there is a threat of terrorism across Europe, there is a real paradise corner here.
"To spend time and relax in Latvia is a pure pleasure", admitted the fashion guru.
Moreover, on 23 November Aleksandrs Vassilievs will open a private fashion museum in Old Riga.
Ask for help!
Please donate to our son, brother, grandson.
We, Rinald's family, are grateful to the fantastic people around us and to God that there was a chance to save Rinald, but unfortunately, there is currently no way to fully cover the cost of medical treatment on our own.
Rinald Grinberg is an 11 - year - old adult who was diagnosed with brain cancer at the end of July.
This year he graduated from the 4th grade in Milzkalne Primary School with excellence, a strong athlete and a very talented artist.
Looks like everything gave up to him.
Healthy, joyful, persistent, diligent and active boy.
Always smiling and kind.
July 26 will remain in our family for life.
During the last few weeks, nausea, headache, and doctors put it on the belly virus.
And at first it seemed that it was.
Because who could have imagined that the blame for such "innocuous" symptoms was much more serious, beyond the mind.
On July 26, we got a diagnosis - Rinald has a brain tumour.
There is a rapid accumulation of fluid in the brain, but everything that doctors can help in Latvia is to perform a bypass operation to remove excess fluid, because for direct surgery the tumour is practically not available.
It is also not possible to determine whether the tumor is benign or malignant.
Further state-funded plan: start the radiation and watch what's going on.
It seemed like a bad nightmare -- we're going to look around here, look at the results.
Fortunately, it was possible to show the results of Rinalda's examinations to a doctor in Spain.
He is the Vice President of the World Association of Neurosurgery, one of the leading neurosurgeons in the world.
He undertook to carry out an operation, and it turned out to be necessary to operate immediately.
The tumor exerts enormous pressure on the brain, and the risk of complications is too high.
It is also urgent to understand whether the tumor is benign or malignant to develop a plan for further treatment.
Without thinking for a moment, the parents chose to go to Spain to save their son.
At fantastic speed, on August 8, Rinald and Mama Evija were in Spain, and on August 9, they were operating.
A very complex operation of more than 6 hours was performed.
The operation took place at Santa Elena's clinic.
It was possible to remove most of the tumor, reduce the pressure, get analytical samples.
Rinalds now gets out of bed and like a good teenager, he asks for fries at dinner.
Now just wait for the results of the oncological tests.
Thank you to Dr. Araez and the management of the clinic, who understood the situation and operated urgently without receiving full payment for the treatment before the operation.
They, trusting that the remaining amount would be paid, demanded only a first instalment of 10 000 euros in order to operate and save Rinald's life.
The parents managed to provide 6 000 euros by selling the equipment, but the rest of the necessary amount for travel, living and the first instalment of the hospital was able to borrow from relatives and friends.
But at least another EUR 24 000 is needed to pay for the first phase of treatment in Spain and to return the money we have borrowed for the first instalment.
Please help us get back this surgery, Rinald's health-important.
Each euro is important to help cover the costs of the operation that has already been carried out and to be able to successfully continue Rinalda treatment.
Signs of anxiety in Ukraine raise the question: What does Vladimir Putin think of?
It is possible to judge the truthfulness of these claims.
Ukraine denies them, while the US and the European Union claim that Russia has not provided any evidence.
The Open Analysis Group, Digital Forensic Research Lab, has found some signs of Saturday shooting, but quite little to be able to hinder Moscow's big plans.
Russia is known for its distorting or misinterpreting of events for political purposes, in particular in the context of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.
This does not mean that all Russian claims are unfounded.
Members of the Ukrainian resistance forces damaged the electric pylons supplying the Crimean power last year, and some of them are also involved in criminal activities and human rights violations.
The attempt to attack Crimea is still a topical issue, although there are little grounds for suspecting that the Ukrainian Government would sponsor a scenario of such events.
Whatever happened, the images from open-source analysts show that Russia has been increasing its military presence since at least last Saturday - before the anticipated attack took place.
They show the passage of heavy arms convoys along the peninsula, including missile systems designed to protect the coast.
Interferently Known Russian Escalation
Some reports show that Russian forces in Crimea had already planned rotation around this time, which could help explain the activity, although it would be a very coincidence that it just happened to happen in one of the most stressful times since the annexation in 2014.
Whatever has become known during the weekend, Mr Putin has undoubtedly focused even more on Ukraine in his statements, choosing to use this episode, no matter how realistic it may be, for a greater purpose.
Analysts point to worrying parallels with Russia's behaviour just before the previous military action against Ukraine.
In February 2014, with similar speeches and military manoeuvres, there was a cover for Crimean volunteers' resistance to occupy the peninsula, which at that time was still under the control of Ukraine, just to reveal that it was, in fact, Russia's special units that initiated the military occupation.
In August, when Russian-backed separatists failed in Eastern Ukraine, Putin deployed forces along the border, warning that they might be needed for the "defence" of ethnic Russian civilians in Ukraine, who, according to him, are being attacked.
He arranged a relief convoy to a region that, according to NATO, was only a cover for Russian invasion forces.
What does Mr. Putin intend to do in Crimea?
Some have guessed whether Moscow alone is planning another military intervention.
The fighting in Eastern Ukraine has intensified, as it was before the invasion in August 2014.
But this supposed parallel could be the point when it is intended to introduce fear of military activities, not actual ones, - this will give Putin trumpets both in his relations with Ukraine and with Western countries.
Mark Galeotti, a professor of the University of Nuyorka studying Russia, pointed out that Crimea would have little significance as a point from which to start military action against Eastern Ukraine, which borders on the Russian land section rather than Crimea, and that the rest of the country is better protected.
"There is little chance if the Russians really plan a large-scale offensive," said Mr Galeoti.
Rather, "we can observe a classic Russian strategy in the creation of a press."
The international peace talks on Ukraine, which once were a mechanism with which Putin forced contacts with Western leaders who ignored him because of the annexation of Crimea, are increasingly seen as unsuccessful and insignificant.
By promising that there is a danger that the conflict may flare up again, Putin gives the negotiations a new meaning: to get him off the edge of the abyss.
"It's the standard Putin's tactics - he wants to try to start from the position of strength," Galeoti said about the next peace talks planned for the beginning of September.
"And the only strong side is to say, "If I wanted to, I could make everything much more, much worse."
Reaching an agreement with the West
Putin also said this week that during the Crimean tensions it was not very important to continue negotiations, making other parties convince him to return to the negotiating table and to the centre of the process.
What does it actually do to him?
Firstly, it allows Russia to continue to strengthen itself as a world power, even though its economy is smaller than that of Australia.
Secondly, it positions Moscow as having a veto over the sovereignty of Ukraine, leaving the country to some extent under Russian control.
It can also benefit Putin's long-held hopes of a large-scale agreement with the United States that would resolve their disputes on Ukraine and Syria, with favourable conditions for Moscow, naturally also by ending Western sanctions against Russia.
Putin has hinted at this objective on several occasions since the country's economic situation deteriorated in 2014, mainly due to a decrease in the value of its oil and gas exports.
Since his invasion of Syria last autumn, he has repeatedly called on the Western powers to join him in the great coalition against extremists.
However, Russian leaders may think that they would need to secure such an agreement before the end of January of President Obama's term of office.
Russian officials basically believe that the next president will be Hillary Clinton, who is more hostile to Moscow.
Donald J. Trump, although he is noticeably friendly with Russia, is still considered unpredictable.
Obama, on the other hand, is considered to be "seeking solutions, not conflicts," said Galeoti.
So it makes sense to close the window to get something done quickly.
In the meantime, if a large-scale agreement cannot be reached, it seems that Putin is satisfied with maintaining Russia's weak neighbour by mentioning what will be further.
In the earlier version of this article, the year when Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine was wrongly indicated.
This was in 2014, not in 2013.
At the impasse of the Congress, the White House diverts funds to fight Zika’s virus
The Obama administration said on Thursday that USD 81 million would be diverted from biomedical research and anti-poverty and health care programmes to pay for the development of a vaccine against the Zika virus by resorting to emergency measures because Congress did not approve new funding to combat the virus.
In a letter to the Congress participants, Sylvia Matthews Barwells, Secretary of Health and Humanitarian Services, pointed out that without the funds channelled, the National Institute of Health and the Biomedical Institute for In-Depth Research and Development will remain without money to fight the disease transmitted by mosquitoes until the end of the month.
It would therefore be necessary to stop developing the vaccine at an important moment, as the number of Zika disease acquired in the country increases in Miami.
Last week, there were 7 350 cases of Zika virus in the United States, mostly in Puerto Rico (according to disease control and prevention centres).
Mrs. Barwell said that 15 babies were born with Zika’s virus birth defects.
The virus can cause brain development abnormalities and other serious defects in the babies born to infected mothers.
The prevalence of the disease in the continental part of the United States, where the first cases were recorded at the end of last month, has increased the political rates by the federal government's reaction.
Hillary Clinton stopped on Tuesday as part of the campaign in the Wynwood area of Miami, where there was an outbreak of locally transmitted Zika virus, and pressure was put on Congress to return from its five-week break to approve emergency funding for the fight against the virus.
President Obama and the Republicans of Congress have had conflicting thoughts on most of the annual Zika virus issues.
In February, Obama demanded USD 1.9 billion in emergency financing.
The Republicans stopped it by asking for a more detailed account of what the money will be spent on.
The legislators have been arguing for months about how much money should be given and how it should be spent.
Last month, the democrats blocked the consideration of the Republicans' proposed measure, when USD 1.1 billion would be allocated to the fight against Zika's virus, but included provisions prohibiting the allocation of funds for family planning for the provision of contraception in connection with a virus that can be transferred so sexually.
Because of this impasse, the White House in April was forced to direct USD 589 million to fight against the Ebola virus. About two thirds of the funding is intended to be used within the country.
On Thursday, Mrs Barvela said that her department had spent most of the money and that it would be spent in full by the end of August.
"The failure to decide on emergency funding for the fight against Zika virus has led the administration to choose between delaying the important work on vaccine development and resorting to other valuable national programmes in order to avoid this delay temporarily," says Barvela.
The democrats committed themselves to this statement in order to accuse the Republicans of not giving extra money to fight against Zika's virus.
At the news conference, Nancy Pelosi from California, leader of the minority, invited Paul D.Raid, Speaker of the House of Representatives, to remind Congress of the progress of this event.
"All opportunities have been exhausted, and now we turn to the National Institute of Health," said Mrs Pelosi.
Mr Ryan's advisors say that channelling funds is a step that has been taking for a long time and which the Obama administration has taken away in order to push the maximum political benefit out of the Zika virus problem.
Last week, the National Institute of Health announced that it had started clinical trials on 80 people with vaccine against Zika virus, and hopes to launch the second phase in the Zika virus epidemic countries at the beginning of 2017.
However, as the officials claimed on Thursday, the study will stop without immediate additional funding.
She said that she would direct USD 34 million from the National Health Service to the fight against Zick’s virus in search of cures for other diseases, including cancer and diabetes.
A further 47 million will be transferred to the Biomedical in-depth research and development institution supporting the development of medicines and vaccines in response to public health emergencies.
This money will come from several accounts, including USD 19 million from a programme that provides heating fuel oil subsidies for low-income families, and USD 4 million from substance dependence programmes such as opioids.
Even then, as she said, additional money will only be sufficient for the next month, when the agencies will have to "crack down their activities substantially" in the fight against Zika's virus if Congress fails to act.
Over the last four months, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention has spent $60 million to help states protect pregnant women, $25 million to strengthen their preparedness and plans for the Zika virus, as well as $16 million to help them develop data collection systems to quickly detect microcephalus and other symptoms associated with Zika virus.
Thai leader links attacks on tourist favorites with constitutional changes
The head of the Thai junta on Friday called on the people of the country to be patient until investigators find out what is behind the deadly series of bombs in Thailand this week.
General Pryut Chang-och, head of junta and prime minister, said that criminals were bad people protesting against the new Constitution, which was confirmed by voters in the Sunday referendum.
"There are still bad people, and they worked before the referendum," he said to the people.
The bomb blasts in five provinces on Thursday and Friday, including in Phuket and Huahin, among tourists in popular places, killed four and injured dozens of people.
The authorities claim that the attack on incinerators elsewhere in the country is linked.
Analysts say that bombings have not been aimed at killing many people, but at harming the tourism industry, one of the bright points of the Thai economy.
At least nine foreign tourists were injured in Huanhin.
"No matter what the motives may be, the explosions and attacks of the arson overturn the junta's claim that the post-referendum situation will be stable," said Sunai Fasuk, senior researcher at Human Rights Watch.
These attacks have a discrediting effect on the authorities, terrorise society and harm the tourism-based economy.
Photo Thai rescue workers care for the injured on Friday bomb explosion in Huahin.
The police claim that in their view these explosions are not linked to international terrorism or the protracted Islamic unrest in southern Thailand.
They regard attacks as "local sabotage", not terrorism.
The time and location chosen for the attacks have a strong political symbolism.
The explosions took place on Friday when people were prepared to celebrate Queen Siricita’s birthday, which in Thailand is considered Mother’s Day.
Four explosions descended in the royal residence of Huahin, about 125 miles from Bangkok, where there was also the majority of injured.
The constitution prepared by the military will reduce the influence of political parties and give the military greater powers, even if the government is once again under civilian control.
The junta helped to secure its victory by preventing opponents from campaigning against it.
Murray Hiebert, a South-East Asian expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., pointed to the suspicion of the militants that the attacks were carried out by people who were not voting.
Explosions were "exactly coordinated, but obviously aimed at creating fear and excitement, not mass damage and deaths and injuries," he said.
Last year, 20 people, mostly tourists from China, were killed in the popular Yerevan sanctuary in Bangkok.
Thai officials associated explosions with Uighur fighters who were dissatisfied with the return of more than 100 Uighurs to China.
General Preyut, who has been leading the junta since 2014, when the civilian government was agilely suspended, said that this week's explosions "paint the hearts of Thais."
Why now that the country is doing better, when the economy is doing better, and the tourism industry is doing better?" he said.
We have to ask why and who did.
Golden reaction: what Simone Manuel’s historic moment looked like
When I started the fight tonight, I supposedly tried to take off my shoulders the weight of the black community, which is something that I just brought with me in that position.
I hope, however, that all this will be gone.
I am more than happy about the fact that I can serve others as inspiration and hopefully diversify this sport.
At the same time, however, I would like to have a day when we have more, and it's not Simone, a black swimmer, because the designation of a black swimmer makes it look like I shouldn't be able to win a gold medal or that I should not be able to beat the records.
It's not because I work as hard as everyone else, and I love sports and want to win like everyone else.
Fight for the defence of students - lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (L.G.B.T.) - in Colombia
Two years ago, the 16-year-old Sergio Urrego died, jumping from the shopping centre in Bogota, leaving the message of his suicide on Facebook, quoting Pink Floyd's song Goodbye Cruel World.
His death was the origin of the contradiction that broke out this week in Colombia, where efforts to expand L.G.B.T.'s rights were considered in the wider political struggles that have divided the country into two camps.
After his death, Urrego's mother, Alba Reijesa, lodged a complaint with the court against school officials, blaming them for the exclusion of her only son when it was discovered that he and his classmates had an intimate relationship.
A year later, the Supreme Court of Colombia gave her a favourable verdict, calling on schools throughout the country to develop a clearer policy to prevent discrimination.
The decision was part of a series of legal victories of the Colombian gay rights movement. Some time ago, this movement celebrated the adoption of a decision on the legalisation of same-sex marriages this year.
This week, however, they faced an obstacle in their struggle for equality, because Jean Perody, the minister of education, who is openly gay, got into a scandal about the application of this rule in scandal.
The scandal began when sexually exposed content from the pornography magazine began to circulate in social media, spreading to people that it was part of a handbook issued by the Ministry of Education.
Perody exposed it agilely.
Although the Ministry offered schools assistance on issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity with the intention of helping them pay attention to the rule, it has not tried to impose standardised rules.
"What we want for schools is the tools for conflict resolution," said Mrs. Perdodia in an interview on Thursday.
The discussions began before the national debate on the future of the country where peace talks between the government and the revolutionary Colombian armed forces, or FARC, were held, the partisan group.
The coalition of politicians in the government's opposition and the leaders of the Catholic Church have been extremely quick to mobilise indicting the government of the Presidency, Juan Manuel Santos, for the same-sex union and the promotion of gender change.
To make it even more difficult for everyone, a government delegation negotiating with FARC in Havana recently reached an agreement on gender and L.G.B.T. equality, calling on the government to adopt more inclusive policies.
Government criticism and peace talks on 42-year-old Perodia, Colombia's rising political star.
They demonstrated their pawns in myths and some have also threatened violence against her and her partner, Cecilia Alvarez-Korrea Glena, former trade ministers.
Perody maintained a wonderful peace for the whole week, trying to correct the mistake and reopen the debate on constructive terms.
"Partly what makes me stand and keep my head clear is the awareness that there are children who will only be revealed," she said.
This is a very tight field and a very lonely time.
She also pointed to the link between the peace process and the debate on L.G.B.T. students.
While the Colombians continue to assess the benefits of a deal with the FARC, which would be a turning point for an earthquake in the country, they have to think about the outbreak of the conflict, she said.
"Is a peaceful country one that promotes inclusion or exclusion; is it one in which everyone has the same opportunities?" she asked.
Although this week she has not been pleased to be for the purpose of insults and accusations, she is pleased that in modern Colombia gay students can take an example from her and think that they can also one day try to become ministers.
"It is very important to me that they are calm and aware that they can fully realise their potential," said Mrs. Perodie.
We cannot expect a new suicide in order to start a change.
Keep the vote cyber-safe - The New York Times
"The U.S. is looking for ways to keep hackers away from the ballot boxes" (message, August 4th)
The Minister for Internal Security, Jech Johnson, says that the Obama administration is thinking about additional protection of the security of the national electoral system.
These changes may be necessary and should be considered immediately.
Cyber threats in various forms and the recent discovery that external forces, perhaps national states, are increasingly interested in influencing our elections, require the federal government to pay additional attention to the provision of our electoral system and perhaps see it as part of the infrastructure essential for our country.
Johnson should immediately contact thousands of national jurisdictions that help to conduct elections and offer assistance, advice and guidance to the Department of Homeland Security.
While the diverse and diverse nature of our voting infrastructure hinders efforts to ensure this, it tells us that the process must start as soon as possible.
A writer, a democrat from Mississippi, is a high-ranking member of the National Security Committee.
A boy injured in carousel in Pennsylvania, this week's third event in amusement parks
On Thursday, a boy has been injured by falling off a carousel and taken to Pittsburgh Hospital. The ambulance and park officials say that this week this is the third accident in the U.S. amusement parks where children have suffered.
A child whose name is not disclosed was just taken to a children’s hospital in Pittsburgh about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of Aidlyd and Soukson amusement park in Laijanier, Pennsylvania, said a representative of the West Murland County ambulance services.
The three-year-old boy, who visited with his brother while he was being helped on the spot, was conscious, informed in an e-mail the park representative Jeff Krošors.
Krišors said that the ride "Rollo Coaster" will be closed for the duration of the investigation of the event.
Children must have at least 3 feet (91 cm) in length to be able to ride in a carousel, and those less than 4 feet (122 cm) must be accompanied by adults.
The attraction, according to the information published on its website, was built in 1938 and the State Department of Agriculture indicated that it had been checked in August.
The hospital representative refused to comment on the boy’s health.
On Sunday, a 10 - year - old boy died from the world’s tallest water mountain in Kansassistia, Canada.
On Monday, three girls, 6, 10, and 16 years of age, who fell from over 30 feet (9 m) in height, overturned the panoramic wheel basket during the fair in Greenville, Tennessee, reports local media.
The Japanese Prime Minister, Abe, will not visit the temple on the anniversary of World War II, which honours the memory of those who have fallen in war: Jiji
The news agency Jiji reports that Japan’s Prime Minister Sindzo Abe will not visit the controversial Tokyo sanctuary on the Second World War anniversary, which honours the memory of those who died in the war.
On Thursday, Jiji reported that Abe was still planning to send a ritual gift to Jasukuni’s shrine on Monday.
The temple also honours the memory of 14 Japanese military leaders, who have only been convicted as war criminals, and China and South Korea consider it to be a symbol of the wartime military in Japan.
Abe has not visited the sanctuary since December 2013, when he announced that he had visited it to show respect for those who died for their homeland.
The new Japanese Defence Minister, Tomomi Inada, has not answered the question of whether she will visit the shrine, explaining that it is a matter of conscience.
Inada, a close ally of Abe and a supporter of amendments to the Japanese pacifist constitution, has regularly visited Yasukuni in the past.
The news agency, Kyodo, reports that the Minister for Reconstruction of Japan’s disaster - hit areas, Masahiro Imamura, visited the shrine on Thursday and said that he was praying for Japan’s peace and prosperity.
The relationship between China and Japan, the two largest economies in Asia, has become more tense following the increasing presence of Chinese coastguards and other state vessels near the controversial islands in the South China Sea, which is referred to in Japan as Senkaku and in China as Diaouj.
Two suspects detained in planning the terrorist attacks of the Rio Olympics: police
On Thursday, the police detained two people suspected of supporting the Islamic state of the group in planning a possible attack during the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Before the operation on Thursday, the police had already detained 12 persons, all suspected of cooperating with Islamic state fighters.
The Brazilian Federal Police report that three more persons were interrogated and later released.
The two arrested on Thursday are Brazilians, but the police do not reveal their names and other information.
Although there have been no conflicts in Brazil's history with known militia groups, the government reports that the Olympic Games have made the country a more topical target, especially since the countries fighting against the Islamic State are taking part in the games.
Its fighters control certain areas of Iraq and Syria and the US-led coalition has carried out air attacks against them.
The group has supporters around the world who have shot and bombed civilians.
The young suspect is formally charged with the murder of a French priest
As part of an investigation into the murder of the French priest last month, the man arrested on Monday has been formally prosecuted, on Friday Reuters reported a source of information to the police.
A 21-year-old suspect is under investigation for cooperation with terrorists, and he planned attacks on people, said the source of information.
The man had been in telephone contact with Adel Kermich and Abdeu Malik Petitjan, who terminated the church service in St.
Both were shot by the police.
The suspect had come from his home near Toulouse to St.
The young man, who had no criminal record before, admitted that he had spent the night there, but told the investigators that he had left the next day because he had no good relationship with Kermitch and Pattytjan, said the source of information.
Investigators are trying to find out whether Kermich and Petitjan were accomplices in France and whether they were associated with an Islamic state that has assumed responsibility for the attack.
Pattytjan's cousin was subject to pre-trial detention at the end of last month.
Doruss de Vriess undergoes medical examinations before moving to Celtic
Nottingham Forest Club goalkeeper Dorus de Vries has arrived in Glasgow, hoping to conclude an agreement to move to Celtic.
De Vries was photographed, entering the Roshol hospital before medical examination after Hoop agreed on the conditions with Sky Bet Champions Club.
Parkhead club manager Brendan Rogers is looking for an experienced center guard so that the current number Craig Gordon is in competition.
However, Roger trusts 35-year-old de Vries because he has worked with the Dutchman at the Swansea Club.
He played 51 games in Swansea, which led by Rogers in 2011 won the right to move to the Premier League.
He changed the Welsh form to join Vilks in the summer, and since 2013 has been City Ground.
He has also played in Scotland during his career after the Diunkermline season, after moving back in 2006.
His stay in the Eastend Park ended with disappointment, however, when Pars experienced a double agony, being "sent into exile" from the highest level before the loss of the Celtic Scottish Cup.
The gatekeeper had a year left in the Forest under the contract, and Celtic was reported to have to pay only a nominal fee to obtain his signature.
Macy's will close 100 stores.
Supermarket giant Macy's on Thursday announced its plans to close 100 shops, which is a dramatic step to help the store chain get ahead of the potentially huge problems: in America, it claims to have an online shopping era for too many shops.
Macy's regularly reduces its store portfolio, often closing several dozen under-earning stores immediately after annual holiday fever.
However, with its summer announcement that it will close 15 per cent of its 728 outlets, the chains appear to have taken a much more aggressive stance than many similar retailers in terms of reducing the number of their shops by adapting to a very changing shopping environment.
Pedestrians and buyers go past Macy's store in New York.
The retail giant announces that it plans to close 100 shops.
Macy's has many reasons to try to change something: many of its stores are located in small regional shopping centres, as the number of buyers has been particularly affected by the boom in e-commerce.
The retail sector as a whole has faced more difficult times, as buyers increasingly choose lower price retailers such as T.J.Maxx and fast fashion makers such as H&M to buy clothes.
These factors, together with short-term difficulties such as ever smaller international tourist spending and seasonal weather conditions that Macy's has placed itself in a fragile situation that has already lasted for more than a year.
On Thursday, the company announced that its comparable sales in the last quarter had dropped by 2.6 percent, a rather weak indicator, which nevertheless was an improvement, given the very poor 6.1 percent drop in the year-on-year, which was found in the previous quarter.
The retailer's income was USD 5.87 billion (USD 7,64 billion), 3.9 percent less than in the same period last year.
Macy's stated that closing shops would cost it about USD 1 billion in terms of annual turnover.
And closing such a large number of shops at the same time could be seen as a recognition of the defeat of the retailer.
However, the value of the company's shares fell by 17 percent on Thursday, which indicates that investors perceive this move as a proactive measure that tells us about a stronger future for Macy's.
In a way, the fact that Macy's reduces the number of shops should not be surprising.
Terry Lundgren, Director-General of the Retailer, said earlier that there are simply too many shops in the chain.
Senior managers have for some time said that they have adopted a new strategy, where special emphasis is placed on 150 of its most profitable shops, trying to achieve higher sales in already profitable outlets.
Jeff Janette, Director of Macy's, who has been appointed for Lundgren since 2017, said in his statement almost all the shops that the company intends to close are those where sales and profitability slide down.
"We are aware that these outlets do not yet get an adequate return on investment and often do not have the level of customer shopping experience that reflects our efforts in relation to the Macy's brand," Janette said.
The company announced that it would present a list of shops that would be closed later.
Macy's said that it is still decided on the closing shops and that it is not yet known exactly how many workers will be laid off.
The retailer will not leave completely the main markets where it currently has shops, but it will think about closing those stores that are located in less active places.
This move is likely to be disliked by the managers of shopping centres who are counting on such large tenants as Macy's to attract and retain other smaller shops in their shopping centres.
Do your bottle of water contain dangerous bacteria?
According to a new study, drinking from refilled bottles may be "a lot worse than licking your dog’s toy", considering how many bacteria you will have to deal with.
Readmill Reviews commissioned EmLab P&K to test 12 bottles of four different types of water - with a screw cap, with a flip-off cap, with a snap-off cap, and with a straw.
Each bottle of athlete had been taken for a week without washing.
Your bottle of refilled water may be as dirty as a dog toy.
"With 12 bottles of water tested by us, we found that the reusable drinking dishes can have an alarmingly high number of viable bacterial cells: more than 300 000 colony forming units per square centimetre (KVV/q.cm.)," says Treadmill Reviews.
Bottles with flip-off caps showed the highest amount of germs, with more than 900 000 colony forming units per square centimetre (CVV/qcm).
The bottles contained microbes that can cause skin infections, pneumonia, or blood poisoning.
Bottles with pressurised caps were the next worst with 162,000 CFU/cm, while containers with screwed caps contained only slightly less than 160,000 CFU/cm.
"Drinking water from such bottles can be worse than eating from your pet container", is indicated on the website.
A well better picture can be seen for bottles with straw, where only part of the bacteria in other bottles were found - only 25 CFU/cfu.cm.
This could be because the water drops to the lower part of the straw instead of sticking to its edges, thus attracting moisture-loving microbes.
The microbes in the bottles with straw are described as "mostly harmless."
"Based on the results of our test, we recommend choosing a bottle with straw, both because of the small number of bacteria and the absence of harmful microbes," mentioned on the website.
We also know that when it comes to bottles and bacteria, stainless steel is a better choice than plastics.
In addition, bottles without cracks and hard to clean areas will have fewer microbes.
On the website, readers are advised to wash the bottles after each use, ideally with a weak bleaching solution.
Religion Must Become Modern or Forget
In the United States, the Democratic Party has recently nominated Hillary Clinton as its presidential candidate.
If the results of the latest surveys prove true in the elections themselves, America will inaugurate its first president, a woman, in January.
Last week, across the ocean, British Prime Minister Teresa May discussed Britain's withdrawal from Europe with German Chancellor Angel Merkel.
The women raised in Western society are raised in such a way that they are aware that, thanks to education, ambition and hard work, they can be competent and successful in any field of professional activity.
And today young girls can target on a number of existing role models, working in the field of leadership.
So, is the long and hard fight for women's equality finally over?
Hillary Clinton is ready to become President of the United States at any time, but in the area of religion, women's leadership is still a controversial issue.
Okay, not completely.
In the religious field, women's leadership remains a controversial issue.
Last week, Pope Francis announced the creation of a new commission to assess whether women would be consecrated as diacons in the Catholic Church.
The Anglican Church consecrated Libya Lane as the first woman-bishop in January 2015, but it was only after a failed attempt in 2012.
While the reform of the Jewish movement has been set for women in the rabbinic round since the early 1970s and in the conservative movement since the early 1980s, the concept of the rabbinic woman in orthodoxy still has a very fierce resistance.
In November 2015, the American Orthodox Rabbi Council published a rather harsh message in its third attempt to stop an ever-increasing wave of support for the rabbi-addiction of Orthodox women that the concept of female rabbi is contrary to the law.
Not without irony, when Hillary Clinton was nominated as a candidate for President of Democrats, a group of American leaders of Orthodox rabbi who oppose the ordination of women launched a series of "discussions" on this controversial issue.
Why is there such a difference between secular and sacred?
Orthodoxal Judaism, like most other religions, is looking for stability in what it considers to be long-standing traditional values.
This is reflected in the ability to resist the pressure to adapt to a changing society.
Those who are against female ordination do so on the grounds that it is not "traditional."
However, taking over with the preservation of traditions in this way has a price.
And the price of such unilateral thinking can paradoxically undermine the tradition itself by taking away from the traditional community the oxygen it needs to maintain its vitality.
In the book "Augusta Firearms", in the military history of the First World War, Barbara Tachman emphasizes the danger of giving priority to tradition in what has become known as "the tragedy of red trousers."
Until the outbreak of World War I, when the fighting moved from fighting at close distances to a heavier artillery being sent from a farther distance, it became profitable to hide soldiers as long as possible.
British and German armies responded to these changes by changing their bright uniforms to boring grey and brown.
French soldiers, however, still wore the same red hats and trousers that made them light targets.
The French Minister of War Affairs Adolf Messimie’s suggestion that the armies under his command could do the same was perceived with ridicule and opposition.
Red trousers reflected the pride and prestige of the army, and the military traditionally were not prepared to give up.
Speaking in parliament, former Minister for War Affairs, Eugen Etien spoke on behalf of France.
"Abandoning the red pants?" he exclaimed.
Never!
"It's the unspeakable and idiotic appendix to the most visible of all colors," then wrote Messimian, "it had to have evil consequences."
Faith leaders who are fighting to include women in leading religious roles could fall into the same trap.
Focusing solely on "traditional" religion, rather than asking the important question: "What changes are needed for religion to flourish?" they risk losing about 50 percent of their followers.
They also take away from the whole community the talent, skills and enthusiasm that women would otherwise bring.
To insist that men continue to wear trousers when it comes to religion may be traditional, but as the destruction of red trousers shows, it may not be worth it.
Dina Breivere is a founder of JOFA (Women's Orthodox Feminist Association) in Great Britain and an orthodox rabbinist student at Yeshivata Maharate in New York.
The children of Roja district learned new skills in the camp.
From August 1 to 6, the camp "Varavik Bridges" took place at the Rojaupe Children's and Youth Initiative Centre, during which participants creatively expressed themselves, sports, as well as acquired new skills.
We arrived at the camp on the closing day, when the children enthusiastically painted glass jars.
Māra Folkmane, the youth initiative centre for children and young people, told that this was one of the activities that participants liked most.
A visit to the "Mazbebriņi" carpenter of Einars Kalniņš was also a great pleasure.
The laser graviter was the most popular among children, as it was possible to see how the drawing on the computer was gradually applied to the board.
E. Kalnins has told about the subjects to be studied at school if he wants to work in carpentry, namely mathematics, especially geometry, computer science, as well as technical drawing and drawing.
He also stressed the need to work more with the brain than with the muscles in this profession.
There are individual orders in the small hall, and it is important to plan everything first.
In order to get to know each other better, when the camp started, participants participated in various games, as well as jointly formed the camp's coat of arms.
On Wednesday there was a hike along the sea from Roja to Žocene, natural materials were collected along the way, which were later used for making cards.
Sports games were also held, which are of particular importance to the participants.
We walked to the apartment houses, where we had a sports and recreation area, played football and a net ball.
Children like sports activities, we have a lot of boys playing football, basketball, and every time they ask for something sporting.
Girls like more peaceful activities.
On another day, we used a self - fortifying mass to decorate jars that could later be used as pencil holders.
There was also a talent evening, children chose with whom to perform, and one evening was devoted to performances.
Board games were also played, each of them could show their knowledge during the photo orientation, where objects had to be found and photographed by pictures.
The task was to make different in every picture.
We painted also mandalas - some like it more, some less.
There will never be one lesson that everyone will like - sport is closer to another, and creative lessons are closer to another.
"Now it looks like everyone works enthusiastically with glass painting," explained M.Folkmane.
At the end of the camp, diplomas for creativity, sports and assistance were issued - several children helped in the economic work.
The name of the camp "Varavīksne tilti" is created because of the participation of children from three associations – Rojupe and Melnsila Children and Youth Initiative Centre, as well as the multifunctional center "Strops" of Roja Municipality.
These are unifying bridges.
If the Royers come up with something faster, we borrow ideas; if the other way round, they borrow from us.
We share our experience.
This year, 30 participants took part in the camp - children who were active during the year.
"We had expected it to be 30, and that's how it worked out," says Mr. Folkmane.
The camp was held for the fifth year.
It started in 2010, when Roja region social service decided that large families and children of poor families should organize camps in summer.
In the meantime, however, the situation in Roja has improved, and now the camp is intended for residents of the region who come and operate in youth centres.
The aim is to spend time meaningfully and comprehensively.
In the past, two camps took place and 20 children participated in each of them, whereas at the moment, due to the overall decrease in the number of children in the country, only one camp is organized.
Similar activities take place during the rest of the year.
Children draw, paint glass, and Einārs Kalniņš came to visit, who taught how to burn wood, how to make machines from wood, we saw different shapes with a saw.
There is also a new technique - encaustics, it is painting with a hot wax chalk.
Teacher Ilze Šelkova led classes in forming of polymer material, we formed coulombs and various dishes.
We make paintings from natural materials, interesting mandalas from beans, peas, linseeds, in the autumn we collect leaves.
We try to use what we have around us.
The youth centre works from 15.00 to 20.00 in winter, and from 14.00 to 20.00 in summer.
"On average, 15 children visit the youth centre per day", says Mr Folkmane.
She stresses that Roja County Council is very supportive, which understands the need to allocate funds to children because they shape our future.
Charlton Athletic fans "can only get a seasonal ticket if they sign a behavioural contract" and agree not to criticise the club on social media.
Although we recognise that everyone has the right to his or her own personal opinion, publishing confusing comments on such websites is not good.
The administrative fan was then told that he would have to receive a ticket personally from the former police senior inspector, Cliff Eger, who joined the club last month after 35 years of his career in the police force.
The letter goes on: "I must inform you that the award of a seasonal ticket will be renewed on the condition that you sign the "Harmonized Contract of Conduct" (ABC), which will stipulate that in future you will refrain from publishing obscene or confusing comments on people representing the club or club on all social media websites, or any other type of behaviour that might be considered antisocial."
Speaking to Daily Telegraph, the fan described how he called the club after paying a seasonal ticket, which was never received, and two days later a letter was received by post.
Yesterday he went to the club and said, "They told me that I had said too much "tweeting", making others tweet too, which is ridiculous."
Cycling holidays on the Dalmatian coast
What do you mean by the word "grace"?
I traveled here with all my strength," said Kolina, a former U.S. Navy Commander who has just travelled 25 miles along the central part of a rough Croatian island, leaving nothing there, except the bucket sweat and the slap of juicy sailors who have been ripped out in the hostile mountains.
Some cyclists sing hymns or kindergarten poems to make it easier to reach the mountain.
Colina's friend Petty recommends The Little Engine That Could.
Others count the gorges or simply suffer in silence, thinking about what it requires to enter a trance-like state, which is spoken of by hardened cyclists.
Colin swears are poisonous rather than diverse.
To drive some yards ahead of her is like after Hugh Grant as at the beginning of the film "Four wedding and one funeral".
Her and my mission is a week-long "luxury" yacht and a cycling trip along the Croatian North Dalmatian coast and islands, organised by Freedom Treks.
Cycling in summer heat in such a steep mountainous place as Croatia may not correspond to everyone's understanding of luxury, but it is said that the North Dalmatia is easier to drive out than the South Dalmatia, our saddles are soft, and when we filled the booking forms, freely and convincingly before all those months, there was a window that we didn't remember that could have been provided with a battery-charged e-bikes.
The luxury part of the deal is our floating house for a week, a brand new "Melody".
At the end of the trip we can throw our bikes in a pile at our guides Ivan and Ivan and jump at the stern of the ship to hear in blue water without touching sea urchins, sharp stones and other people on the narrow stone barons called the beach.
In June, the temperature of the sea is perfect, everyone agrees: cool enough to cool, but not cold.
On "Melody" lies masks and breathing pipes and some kayaks, if either someone feels energetic after a heavy morning on saddles.
Instead, most of us are returning to our cabins with air conditioners, where Helen, the ship's masseur - I am not kidding - will have already covered our beds, replenished our minibars and left a new box with chocolates on the table.
Ivan says that stretching after cycling is very important, and in the afternoon we learn to stretch on our beds or pillowed lounge chairs on the top deck with the bar Antonio, who is always ready to cook one of his cocktails.
"Melody", 42 m long with 15 cabins and half a dozen crews, not a famous super yacht, but a stylish small cruise ship.
It turns to a small island port between fishing boats and fleet holiday yachts, and we are proud to be part of it.
Kolina and Petty belong to a group of friends from the Meetup.com in Washington (Colombia County): sports and social activists after 45, as they call themselves.
Last year’s vacations in the Netherlands were so successful that they decided to try something more adventure-rich, and so they are in Croatia.
The competing chapel from their church is a boating and cycling holiday in Provence, and every afternoon the air is thickened by a competing Facebook publication ping pong rally.
An element of holiday adventures can be exaggerated, because our schedule is nothing if there is no specific regime.
"The breaktail and dinner are at eight," Ivan announced to the new participants at the opening meeting when we started the road from the beautiful old Port of Trogir, located near Split.
One of the ship’s bells shows that the buffet is open, while the other calls for quietness at the end of the meal and listens carefully to further information.
"Good morning!" is a cultural context that is probably lost everywhere, but not in the British continent.
Some difference - fun has already gotten up, jokes fall like a horn of abundance, while Ivan releases the daily excursion maps, but we all pretend that we are frightened by swinging, loops and profiles with ups and downs, although anything else would surprise Croatia's cycling journey, which starts and ends at sea level.
"It's like a heart monitor," says Ivan.
Absolutely flat is not recommended.
Ivan leads an information meeting in parallel, freely switching from English to German.
There are weeks when he has to deal with a dozen different nationalities, but we are a simple group - the Swiss, Germans, Americans and British, who easily sit at tables at mealtimes, where two speak English and one talk German.
We're all friends on the road.
Cycling contributes to membership, and the only competition is within, i.e. with itself.
I do not remember when the group's dynamics would have been more harmonious and relaxed.
Soon we get on Ivan's wave.
A slight rise is a slope that should not be confused with roughness, which is a good thing.
The hairpins are serpentines and straight forward means straight: simple, but not always easy.
Instructions for cycling are always the same: "To drive one by one, to keep a distance, and that's not a race.
Meet me on the beach at nine.
All right, five pairs, I forgot you're on holiday.
Take plenty of water with you.
From Trogir we will go on a two-day cruise north through the Kornati Archipelago, where we will travel almost all the way to Dugi Ottok - the Croatian "Long Island" - and after a little money we will go for a walk along the Telašcica Nature Park to admire its steep cliffs and salt lake, which flows sea water through the underground canal.
It is said that those who swim in it due to its power become younger.
If we come along, will our feet feel younger and stronger?
On the small island of Molata, we turn south again, jumping from the continent to the nearby islands by seemingly random means.
Most of our trips are on empty small roads on the country's exteriors with wide sea views and varied vegetation: olive groves, vineyards, sharp plant stands, Mediterranean aromas in the air, and countless butterflies in flight.
As we move forward, there is always a breeze, but when Ivan stops, there is always a big shadow, and the small puddles are a reward for those who arrive faster.
Sports and social activists travel a lot on weekends, and they know the standards of behaviour by sending out warnings along the line and leaving space for motorists to perform overtaking manoeuvres more safely.
"You almost hit," one cyclist says to the other after the truck driver decided to make a overtaking manoeuvre in an opaque curve and slowed down rapidly.
Fortunately, the brakes worked.
Ivan divides us into three groups every piece of short section for driving on the main roads, with Ivan at the very back, to encourage and "give the pace," as Ivan says.
If we have to cross the main road, we all gather, step off the bikes and safety after changing with our bikes on the other side as we have been instructed, not before.
"Do you think Ivan knows that he doesn't talk to a group of children?" asks the Swiss cyclist when we stand on the side of the road and wait for the signal when we can cross it.
Not the whole afternoon, we can devote ourselves to relaxing.
The city review reveals a Roman forum and a sea organ playing music that sounds like a moaning of a trapped marine monster, through pipes embedded in a stone in the promenade and open water.
The famous sunset of Zadar perfectly falls between the main course and the pudding, and after darkness we return to the sea organ and watch the wave-powered lamp game in the glass trotuary, which is actually a dance floor.
When "Melody" starts its way early in the morning to the bustling Biograd resort, the organ song is nothing more than a whisper.
On the fifth day we are completely free from cycling.
A trip up the river Estuary of the Krka River to see its waterfalls; then an afternoon sightseeing tour in Siberia, where we see the thought of the cathedral, the masterpiece of the Dalmatian Renaissance, as well as a twilight walk on the peaceful island of Zlarina, looking for its local treasure coral, makes this day interesting.
Lurda is going to pick up pilgrims in the shadow of attack
During the annual Catholic pilgrimage, people gather at the sanctuary of Lurda Our Lady.
The French security forces are on high alert because thousands of Catholics gather at Lurda’s annual pilgrimage in the shadow of several acts of terror.
Each year on August 15, tens of thousands of people gather at the temple at the foot of the Pyrenees Mountains to celebrate the enthronment of the Virgin Mary.
This year's pilgrimage is taking place at a time when the Catholics have been shocked by the slaughter of the older French priest on 26 July by two Islamic extremists who invaded the church in northern France during the Mass and cut his throat.
Jacques Amel was murdered two weeks after a Tunisian -- investigators say he was radicalized by Jihadist's online videos,-- crashed a truck in the Bastille Day party crowd in the town of Nice in Riviera, killing 85 people.
After three large-scale attacks in 18 months, many French people are cautious about attending public events.
The number of tourists decreased dramatically, and the authorities feared that the number of pilgrims this year could fall rapidly.
However, the fear of mass withdrawals did not materialise -- and some organisers say that there has been even an influx of visitors' applications at the last minute.
Around 25 000 believers are expected to arrive, including large groups from Italy and Belgium and a delegation of approximately 200 Orthodox Christians in the Eastern Federation.
Many pilgrims have declared that they will not be intimidated.
"We don't mean to stop living," a 66-year-old visitor Christian said to AFP, describing prayer as "the only weapon" in the fight against violence.
"It is important to show that life continues," said Matier Gvinar - one of the coordinators.
We will not give up our faith, our beliefs, and our way of life simply because some fanatics are trying to sow fear.
Due to concerns about safety in France, a number of large-scale measures have been lifted since the Nice attack, including the huge stock market in the northern town of Lille and the European cycling championship on the highway, which was to take place in Nice in September.
"Last week I lived in fear that my phone would call in one call to withdraw applications," said Fabien Lögesne, the priest responsible for the official pilgrimage last weekend.
"On the contrary - it seems that attacks have mobilised believers," he said and announced the inflow of last-minute applications.
Christian Žel, head of the local hotel workers' trade association, confirmed "increased interest" in pilgrimage after attacks.
There were extremely strict security measures around the sacred place where the virgin Mary appeared in the grotto in 1858 to a poor shepherd Bernadet Subirou.
Some 250 police officers and two dozen soldiers have been assigned to protect the sites, including bomb neutralization experts and explosives search dogs.
At the entrance, the bags were checked, and the number of access points was reduced from twelve to three.
Catherine Simcoxus, who traveled on a pilgrimage from northeast England to Lurda at the beginning of this month, described the increased security measures.
"Until Thursday morning there were armed guards in the shrines, and then through the gate (with metal barriers) only one way could go, and the bags were searched," she said.
"This all frightened my three children who were used to Lurda, and it was hard not to frighten them when they asked why it was so," she said.
It has not ruined my impressions, but it saddened me that it was necessary, and I realized that many people were calmed down by these measures.
The opening procession route of Friday is also shortened - instead of starting in Lurda and moving on to the shrine, it will begin and end in the shrine.
Other measures include the closure of airspace for flights over Lurda, the closure of streets near the road shrine and the replacement of waste bins for transparent plastic bags.
The French Minister for the Interior, Bernard Kazenev, will check security measures on Saturday.
About six million people travel to Lurda annually, making it one of the largest Catholic pilgrimage destinations in the world.
Many visitors are carrying relatives who are sick or disabled and who come to swim in the spring cave where Bernadette had seen Mary, believing in the healing properties of water.
Thierry Castio, one of the organisers, described this year's gathering as "a little unusual" in view of the "threat as the roots seem to be in France."
However, he claimed that this would not affect the quality and depth of their experiences.
Françoise, 58 old volunteer who helped sick pilgrims, admitted that in her opinion the presence of soldiers dressed in civil clothing was "a little depressing."
However, if it calms everyone down, it is good.
Zaragoza shopping centre shot two wounded people
Two people were seriously injured after a man fired at a shopping center in Zaragoza, northeastern Spain.
The incident took place at 11 a.m. on Friday morning at the people’s full Aragonia shopping centre in Zaragoza.
Initial reports show that the shooter might have shot a woman who might have been his former partner.
After the shooting, the armed criminal fled and is currently being sought by the police.

Yesterday 12 drunk drivers and four aggressive riders were caught on Latvia's roads, informed the State Police.
Four of the drunk drivers stopped were in Zemgale, three in Riga region, two in Kurzeme and Latgale, and one in Vidzeme.
All four aggressive riders stopped in the Riga region.
In turn, 218 administrative infringement protocols have been prepared for speeding.

46 protocols have been completed in Zemgale, 36 protocols in Vidzeme, 26 protocols in Latgale and 22 protocols in Kurzeme.
The opening of the waterfowl hunting season is approaching.
Each year, on the second Saturday of August, a waterfowl hunting season is opened.
This year it will begin on August 13 at 16:00, therefore the State Police invites both hunters and residents to be particularly careful and to comply with security regulations.
The hunting of waterbirds takes place not only in hunting grounds but also in public water bodies, and even though the weather conditions do not promise heat as they have been for years, it is acceptable that these water bodies will also be used by holidaymakers together with hunters.
Both hunters and holidaymakers and those living by watercourses are encouraged to be particularly careful in the vicinity of lakes and rivers and to comply with safety rules, thus not endangering themselves or others.
As in previous years it has been observed that during the first days of the season the number of hunters takes part in the hunting of waterbirds, this year the State Police in cooperation with the State Forest Service will carry out reinforced hunting control.
The law enforcement will focus on compliance of movement of weapons and ammunition with the norms of the law, as well as will monitor that hunting takes place without the influence of alcoholic beverages and intoxicating substances.
The police recall that the use of semi-automatic firearms with a total capacity of more than three patrons in waterfowl hunting is prohibited, inter alia, by drawing attention to amendments to the Law on the movement of weapons and special aids, in particular Article 22 (91), which states that persons with long firearms or high-energy pneumatic weapons registered for hunting or sports, and with a short stop for up to two hours when they are transported to or from hunting, have the right to keep the weapon and ammunition in the vehicle during hunting, but must be placed in the safest place possible, so that the case or other packaging containing ammunition or weapons is not visible from the outside of the vehicle, placed behind locked doors and fitted with an alarm device to ensure that they do not accidentally enter the hands of unauthorised persons.
The police call to take care of their own safety and that of their fellows during the hunting season and, if you notice violations of the law or a threat to security, we invite you to report immediately by calling 110.
In the event of any threat, the law is ready to respond to the information provided by the population.
New Caledonia coast is rocked by an earthquake of 7.2
On Friday, the coast of New Caledonia was shaken by an earthquake of 7.2, and seismologists reported that there was no tsunami threat.
The epicenter of the earthquake was located at a depth of nine kilometers 109 kilometers east of New Caledonia at 1.26 Greenwich time (4.26 p.m. Latvian time), declared the U.S. Geological Research Centre.
The Pacific Cunami Alert Centre pointed out that there are currently no warnings or recommendations regarding the possible tsunami threat to the region.
"The landmarks in this region, as we know, are not unusual, activities are not unusual lately", said Senior seismologist Phil Kamins of the research center "Geosscience Australia".
It could potentially be felt on the islands of Vanuatu or New Caledonia, but I doubt whether it is so powerful as to cause damage.
New Caledonia is located in the "Fire Circle" - the area of the tectonic activity of the Pacific Ocean, where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur frequently.
Colombia and Venezuela agree to open the border.
Colombia and Venezuela agreed to open checkpoints on the border between the two countries, which were closed on the initiative of Venezuela a year ago, with the President of Colombia and Venezuela, Juan Manuel Santos and Nicholas Maduro, on Thursday.
Originally, border crossings will be open only for pedestrians.
Starting from Saturday, five border posts will be open daily from 8 to 20 p.m.
It will be possible to open the border to transport after the conclusion of certain international agreements on security, trade and energy, the Presidents indicated.
Maduro ordered the closure of the border last August in response to the attack by Colombian fighters on the Venezuelan border patrol.
Three Venezuelan soldiers were injured in this attack.
In July this year, Venezuela unilaterally opened the border twice because of the severe economic crisis: the Venezuelans in poverty tried to break through the border in order to buy essential goods in border shops.
200 000 Venezuelan citizens took advantage of this opportunity.
This time it is time for one of the prides of Latvia, the sympathetic Madara Palameika.
Madara Palameika was born on June 18, 1987 in Talsi.
She is a Latvian athlete who competes in spear-throwing competitions.
Her coach is father Gints Palameick.
Latvia's record spear thrower.
Participated in the 2012 summer Olympic Games, participated in the World and European Championships several times (the 4th place in the 2014 European Championship), the 3rd place in the Diamond League overall score.
"Facebook" announces fight ads to the blockers.
The most widely used social network in the world, Facebook, has broadcast a kind of warning shot, suggesting that blocking advertising banners using special tools is unacceptable and that users will have to watch ads anyway.
The popularity of ad-barriers is increasing, but this means that companies whose main source of income is advertising are decreasing.
Facebook has now made it known that it understands the annoying nature of advertising banners, but users will have to live with them anyway.
True, they will be given the tools to choose the type of material they are shown, reports the BBC.
"As we provide people with more and more control options, we will also start showing ads to those who use ad blocking software," said Andrew Bosworth, Vice-President of the Facebook ad business.
In other words, users will be able to choose what type of ads they see when they select brands and industries that they find interesting.
"People don't like to see ads that don't apply to them or interfere with their enjoyment of content," said Bosworth.
Ad-blocking tools on mobile devices usually do not work, from which Facebook gets the biggest visit, but the resulting reduction in banner exposure is also worth billions in monetary terms.
According to the BBC, advertising blockers are used by around 200 million people.
It has already been reported that in the previous quarter of the business year Facebook revenue from advertising was 6.2 billion US dollars or 5.55 billion euros.
I have to say that this is not the first time Facebook has been actively involved in determining what network users see in their news streams.
As one of the last steps, Facebook has just started to take action to remove or at least limit from the news streams the "Scale" headlines behind which "empty" messages are actually hidden.
At night on Brivibas street will perform asphalting works; take into account traffic restrictions.
Tonight, asphalt construction works will be carried out from Bērzaunes Street to Gustava Zemgala gatve, thus drivers have to take into account limited traffic in this section of the street.
As LETA learned in Riga City Council, traffic restrictions in this stage will start tonight from 21 AM and asphalting works will last until 12 August 7.
Traffic towards Juglu will be directed along tram tracks.
Drivers have to take into account limited traffic at this stage and additional travel time.
The municipality calls for awareness of the restrictions introduced and for compliance with traffic organisation procedures.
The restoration of the pavement started on the main streets of the capital city - Brīvības Street from Raiņa bulvara to Lāčplēša Street and from the Air Bridge to Jugla Street, Lāčplēša Street from Salu Bridge to Avotu Street, Juglas Street from Kvēle to Maliena Street and Lielvārdes Street from Dzelzavas Street to 84.vidusskola.
The construction works will last until the beginning of the new school year and are organized continuously, also during night hours, when mainly asphalt laying is carried out.
Medvedev's deputy in Riga secretly met several ministers of the ZZS.
The Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev Arkady Dvorkovics last week, while visiting Riga, secretly met three ministers of the Federation of Greens and Farmers (ZZS) at a fish processing factory.
The informal meeting took place at the factory "Kaija", and the Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola, Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis and Minister of Agriculture Jānis Dūklavs participated in the meeting, according to the web portal "skaties.lv".
The fact that such a meeting took place was confirmed to the portal by Reizniece-Ozola.
She explained that during the meeting she was talking about lifting sanctions for fish processors, as well as about Inčukalns gas storage.
The meeting, contrary to diplomatic practice, was held without involvement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The organiser of the meeting was the Russian Ambassador Alexander Vesnyakov.
The suspicion of more than €130 000 embezzlement is held by the accountant.
The State Police (SP) Economic Crime Prevention Board (ENAP) has detained an accountant, who has been working in the company for 20 years, for 130 thousand embezzlement from a commercial company in Riga this month, informed the agency BNS representative Gita Gžibovska.
Current information shows that the suspected woman has committed illegal activities for several years and has, together, caused more than 130,000 euro of damage to the company.
Given that the company's officials had not followed the cash flow closely and trusted their employee, they only learned about the machinations that were taking place several years later.
The ENPP police arrested the suspected woman born in 1963 this month and carried out a search at the company.
Criminal proceedings for misappropriation have been initiated in relation to what has happened, if committed to a large extent.
For such crime the law provides for deprivation of liberty for up to ten years, confiscating property or without confiscation of property.
Currently, a security measure, which is not related to deprivation of liberty, has been applied to the detained person.
Antibodies to the Zika virus have been detected in nine people in Estonia.
In Estonia, nine people have been tested for antibodies to the Zika virus, which means that they might be exposed to this infection, according to the Estonian public broadcaster ERR.
The information provided by the laboratory shows that 121 samples were tested for Zika virus this year and nine of them were positive.
The first cases of Zika have been reported in Finland and Sweden in countries near Estonia.
According to the Estonian Health Authority, no case of acute infection with Zika virus has been recorded in the country and people do not need to undergo Zika virus testing in the case of flu-like symptoms, but they should contact their family doctor.
We have found IgG (immunoglobulin G) antibodies that show that the subject is infected with Zika or similar virus at any time.
"This doesn't mean that the patient is ill with Zika's virus," explained Paul Naber, head of the infectious disease department at the laboratory "Synlab".
Zika's virus is transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus Aedes.
There is a problem in Latvia with the development of high-quality car procurement, said Ingus Rūtiņš, Vice-President of the Auto Association, in an interview with BNS.
Whether there are problems with dumped prices in the car industry, Rūtiņš replied in the affirmative.
Sure.
However, car purchases differ from service purchases where price manipulation is easier.
In any event, the car has to pay a certain amount in the end, as it has to be purchased from the manufacturer.
However, the problem is and can be classified into two groups.
Either the advertiser is incompetent and does not know how to create high-quality procurement, resulting in "buy" himself, often unaware of it.
"either very conscious procurement is built to get something concrete, and there are all kinds of miracles," said the Vice-President of the Auto Association.
He pointed out that it is now popular to talk about moving away from the lowest bid to the most economically advantageous bid as the criterion for determining the winner of the procurement, but in part of society there is still a misconception about these things.
Now it's very popular - let's go from the lowest price to the most economically advantageous offer!
However, the criteria must be established in both cases and, when they are taken into account and evaluated, a decision is nevertheless taken on the basis of the lowest price.
In qualitative procurement, the technical criteria should be very precise and market-conform.
The points, on the other hand, do not have to assess anything that can be expressed in monetary terms.
Points should not be used to assess fuel consumption, emissions, services and similar things.
You need to know the life cycle of the car, the mileage, etc., then you can simply count everything together.
"The question is only about which of the scenarios the customer himself is interested in?" explained Rūtiņš.
In his turn, the Project Manager of the Auto Association Pēteris Rubulis noted that problems are related to the fact that often the same person makes purchases for cars, work gloves and food, and these purchases are derived from one example.
We have also brought a sample of spare parts for procurement for consultation, which was difficult to describe as a detailed absurdity.
"The problem is that the purchaser very often lacks any understanding of the subject matter of the procurement and the requirements are simply copied from somewhere", admitted Rubulis.
Rūtiņš added that the smaller the structure that announces procurement, the bigger the problems.
"Of course it is precisely because there is a lack of human resources and expertise," said the Associations Vice-President.
Latvian volleyball players do not get to fight for medals.

Die Antwoord is accused of stealing style.
The South African band "Die Antwoord" on Thursday accused the director of the film "Suicide Sqaud" ("Passalls Unit") of using the group's unique appearance without permission, calling the respected director "a tiny frightened bitch".
The group's leading singer, Jolandi, has turned to the film studio Warner Bros in his mobile app "Instagram", saying: "Just like David Ajer, you steal our style."
As she claims, the movie stars in Karas Delavinja and Jared Leto have said that Ayer was a great fan of Die Antwoord in the film field.
"But you didn't ask for permission to cheat us," said the singer.
A 31-year-old musician claims that her group member Ninja addressed Ayera with a text on this issue, but he "never answered like a little frightened bitch."
Jolandi insists that Ayer has captured scenes from the introduction to the 2011 short film "Umshini Wam" showing the South African hip-hop duet.
She has also published a video that allegedly proves that Ayer Joker and Harley Quinn's images have been removed from the appearance of both singers.
Letto himself insists that the image of a joker is based on the image of rock musician David Bowie's image.
At the end of her statement of claim, Jolandi agreed with the harsh assessment of critics earned by the film after its premiere.
Jolandi and Ninja, in the real names Henri du Tuata and Watkins Tudor Jones, gained fame with three rap studio records, promoting African Zef counterculture.
"The Rosenberg Trio" (Netherlands) is going to be the first time in Latvia to have an opportunity to hear this evening, on 12 August, at "Summertime" festival.
The virtual ensemble will play the world’s best known guitarist composition, in which the music of different nations and countries intertwine.
On the stage of the Dzintari Concert Hall, Johnny Rozenbergs will join the Trio stage - an unrepeatable performer of Frank Sinatra's repertoire and at the same time a master jazz guitarist.
Inspired by the legendary guitarist Django Reinhardt and steadily developing his natural musicality, it is Rozenbergs who today embody the very essence of gypsy celebration and jazz.
All members of the ensemble are cousins whose names adorn the posters of the leading jazz festivals, and many of Trio’s recorded albums have earned the status of Platinum and Golden Disk.
The melody aches, the special guitar sound, the inimitable vibrato of strings, the interplay of sanded for years and the ensemble's sense of being the characteristics why Rozenbergs have invited Randy Crawford, Lučano Pavaroti, Shirley Bassi, and other world celebrities to join in their concerts.
Trio is also welcome to the Carnegi Hall in New York City, Los Angeles, Vienna, Montreal, and other cities.
"Summertime" will perform together with the ensemble the charming voice owner, songwriter and guitarist Johnny Rosenberg (The Netherlands).
Johnny gained wide recognition as a singer in 2010 thanks to his sensational participation in the Voice of Holland TV show, where he immediately became a favorite of the public.

Turkey is looking for missing diplomats following a coup attempt
Turkey is looking for at least 32 diplomats who did not return with the withdrawn staff after the attempted coup on 15 July.
Foreign Minister Mevits Čavušogls said on Friday that 208 Turkish Ministry staff were withdrawn from jobs around the world and 32 had disappeared "without permission" during the coup investigation period.
Some 18 000 civilians, military leaders and academics have been arrested or withdrawn from their positions in Turkey, with the government considering them loyal to the US official Fetulla Gulen, whom it accuses when drawing up the government's plan to go.
Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania, is on the list of the most sought-after people in Turkey.
Kavosoglu said that the team of the U.S. Department of Justice would come to Turkey later this month to discuss his possible extradition.
This issue has become a problem in US relations with Turkey, a member of NATO.
The US objected to the tactics of the strong armament of Turkish President Regep Tajyp Erdogan after the coup, and Turkey responded by seeking closer ties with Russia.
Kavosoglu said that the Turkish military attachés in Greece had fled to Italy, the Attaché in Kuwait tried to escape to Saudi Arabia, but was sent back, and two generals from Afghanistan were caught in Dubai and sent to Turkey.
He also said that two officials fled to New York in Bangladesh, and one of Russia went to Japan.
The Daily Hurryiet newspaper of Ankara, quoting military sources, reported that the Turkish military attaché in Jordan was also missing.
The Wall Street Journal, citing a US official who is aware of the situation, reported that a Turkish military officer based in Virginia, NATO, has applied for asylum in the United States.
There are those who have managed to escape.
There have also been refugees among our diplomats," Kavosoglu said to the NTV broadcaster in an interview.
Since yesterday, for those who were originally withdrawn, the time has come to an end.
We will take legal action against those who did not return.
Organizers of the Olympic Games try to clean the green-coloured diving pool
The Olympic divers, who were supposed to be trained on Friday, came to a closed pool, because it took more time for the organizers to clear the green - colored water before the first individual race at the Rio Olympics.
The water suddenly changed its color on Tuesday, the synchronized diving race in the middle.
The organisers claimed that the water competition was safe even after the larger pool next to the polo and synchronized swimming was also painted lightly green.
Diving was not possible yet, when athletes arrived for the morning warm-up, although finally the pool was opened at 13.00 local time - only 2 1/2 hours before the women 3 meters race.
The color of the water looked closer to its usual color, but still with a greenish tint.
The American diving Abby Johnson, who competes on a trampoline, told me that she was just coming to warm up to find out that the pool was closed without warning.
She wrote on Twitter that "#FixTheSwamp (repair the swamp) should be in fashion.
The British diver Tom Dalley, who won bronze in the synchronous diving of the platform, also commented on the status of the pool in the Twitter record.
Hopefully this means that we have not dived in the last few days as very bad!
Mario Andrad, the chief spokesman of the local committee of organizers, stressed that the pool for the competitions is safe, giving the green light to 3 meters for the races.
He agreed that some athletes were disturbed by water, but he said that it was the result of cleaning up the pool.
"We repeat what we have said all the time, water in no way endangers the health of athletes," he said.
On the first day of such a water situation, one or two athletes complained that they could not see their eyes.
It was the result that the first reaction, when we saw water becoming green, was to use one of the chemicals - chlorine - it is used very often in swimming pools.
We reduced the quantity immediately.
We checked the water again, and that was perfectly in line with the parameters.
Simon Langford, the chief spokesman of the María Lenka Water Sport Centre, said that the pool was closed for additional cleaning work.
He said that the decision was supported by the world’s leading organisation, FINA (International Federation for Swimming).
"The reason is that the water has to be calm, so that the pool can get back to its blue color as soon as possible," Langford said in his statement.
Andrada said that the deterioration of the basin had surprised the organizers unprepared.
"China is not an accurate science," he said.
Some things, as you can see, lasted.
Over the last few days, getting the color of the rainwater in its normal state made it even more difficult.
"It doesn't work," Andrad said.
He added that athletes had access to dry workouts in the morning, but admitted that it "was not perfect."
He explained that the change in the colour of the pool was due to increased alkalin levels, just as water in the aquarium can become green if not properly monitored.
When we started to do something about green color, there was a discussion about the best chemicals.
We cannot use too much chemicals in water because athletes are training in it," said Andrad.
We could certainly have done better at the beginning to prevent water from becoming green.
When it turned green, we made a mistake again.
AP sports watchers Jay Koen and Steve Wade in Rio de Janeiro took part in this action.
Shanghai, Taipei, despite the suspension of cross-border communication, will nevertheless organise a forum
Shanghai and Taipei, however, will organise the annual city forum from 22 to 23 August in Taipei, announced on Friday by the municipality of Shanghai, despite the suspension of cross-border communication mechanisms.
On behalf of Sha Hailin Shanghai Mayor Yang Xiong, a senior municipal official will lead the delegation represented in the forum, announced the Shanghai Government in its official microblog account in Sina Weibo.
Both cities have been holding the Forum on a rotational basis since 2010.
The 2016 Forum will focus on the exchange of experiences in areas such as health, electronic administrative services, culture and transport, seeking "to deepen the exchange of experience and cooperation in various aspects" between the two cities, as reported by the Shanghai Government.
The Taiwanese side has not recognised the agreement reached in 1992 to strengthen the one-China principle since the new leader, Tsai Ing-ven, took office in May, resulting in the suspension of communication and consultation mechanisms.
Ma Ksiaoguangs, a spokesman of the State Council of the Taiwan O ce on land, said on Friday that peaceful cross-border relations can exist while the Taiwanese side adheres to the political foundations of the 1992 agreement.
"We have an active and open attitude towards the exchange of experiences between cities on both sides," said MA stressing that the essence of cross-border relations and exchange of experiences between cities should be interpreted correctly.
Ugandan President meets China's Foreign Minister, looks forward to closer cooperation
On Thursday, at a meeting with China's Foreign Minister, Vanga Ji, the President of Uganda, Joveri Museveni, thanked China for its long-standing development support for Uganda and expressed his hope for closer cooperation.
Museveni said that China is an old friend of Uganda and Africa, who supported the African continent's liberation from colonialism and later supported Africa's economic and social development.
The President mentioned the construction of the Zambian railway in the 1970s as proof of China's generous support, even when China itself was not very prosperous.
Museveni said that China has engaged in multilateral cooperation with Uganda, both in infrastructure and business, and in cultural exchanges, and added that this kind of cooperation contributes to the long-term development of Uganda more than simply financial assistance.
He hopes that China will be able to engage in various ways in the development of Uganda's infrastructure and the construction of industrial parks.
He also calls on the Chinese to invest more in Uganda and to travel around it.
Vang Ji commended Uganda's efforts in the areas of industrialisation and agricultural modernisation and added that China would continue to be the most reliable and ideal partner of Uganda's cooperation.
Vang stated that China is ready to do everything possible to help implement the economic and social development of Uganda, and added that China-Uganda cooperation is genuine and without any political considerations, because it is based on a high level of political credibility and a proven friendship over time.
He said that China could strengthen cooperation with Uganda in the construction of infrastructure and industrial parks, as well as support the development of this East African nation's energy and agricultural sectors.
