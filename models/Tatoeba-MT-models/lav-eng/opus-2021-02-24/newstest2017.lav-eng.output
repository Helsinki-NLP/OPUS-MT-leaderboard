28-year-old cook found dead in San Francisco supermarket
This week, a 28-year-old chef was found in the staircase of a supermarket who recently moved to San Francisco.
But the victim's brother says he can't imagine anyone who'd hurt his brother, saying, "His life finally started to improve."
The body found at the Westfield supermarket on Wednesday was identified as a 28-year-old resident of San Francisco, Frank Galicia, said a representative of the San Francisco Office of forensic expertise.
The San Francisco police announced that his death was declared a murder and that an investigation is under way.
The victim's brother, Luis Galicia, tells ABC KGO in San Francisco that Frank had previously worked as a chef in Boston, but six months ago he got to his dream job at the restaurant Sons & Daughters in San Francisco.
The representative of Sons & Daughters informs that the news of his death shocked them and shocked them.
"We are a small team working as a united family and we're going to miss him very much," said the representative.
In this difficult time, we think with Frank's friends and family.
Louis Galicia says that Frank first stayed in the hostels, but in recent years life has finally improved.
"He moved into a new apartment and met a girl," Luis tells radio station KGO.
Louis Galicia says he doesn't know who's gonna hurt his younger brother.
He was a good man with a wide heart.
"He always spoiled his family by cooking a delicious meal and cooking lunch," said Luis Galicia
He never wanted to get involved in a dispute.
He was the brother who adapted to the others.
"Taking into account everything that went wrong in the world, he was like a rough diamond that glowed brightly every day," he says.
Anyone who has information about what happened is invited to call the SFPD Information Telephone 415-575-4444.
New medical strike: calls for new protests
The representatives of the new doctors request their trade unions to start protesting about the new contract.
The New Doctors Committee (JAK) of the British Medical Association (AAL) is about to request advice to support wider protests at the beginning of September.
According to JAK, the ministers have failed to dispel the doubts about the Treaty.
In July, the new doctors and medical students rejected the contract offered by the AAL.
A total of 58% of the members who voted against the Treaty voted against.
In a message published on Twitter on Thursday evening, Ellen McCorta, member of the JAK Council, points out that the government continues to remain silent on this matter and therefore the contract offer has been rejected.
She said: "In view of this, the JAK's vote has resulted in the total rejection of the contract offer and the decision has been taken to request new formal negotiations to discuss the most important issues."
In response to the silence of the government, JAK formally requested today a meeting with the Council of the AAL to authorise the development of new contracts, which will enter into force in September.
As a result of the dispute, the new doctors took part in six strikes, including for the first time in the history of the NHS.
After the vote rejecting the terms of the contract proposed by the AAL, recommended by the BMA, Dr. Johan Malawana, the representative of the new doctors of the AMA, resigned.
Before meeting 54,000 new doctors and medical students, he had told BMA members that the offer was good and would be accepted.
After the vote, the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, informed us that the contract would be concluded with English doctors.
Russia and Turkey: An Alliance of Disadvantaged?
A gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to break up and announce eight months of the war of name and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted Turkey's leader in St. Petersburg, the impression was that Ankara needed this partnership more.
However, they were not alone.
Vladimir Putin's smile looked dazzled and did not cause warm emotions, even considering his usual abstinence.
On the other hand, Tajyp Erdogan named Putin his "Dear Friend" at least five times, according to the review of the meeting.
I lost my count.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only improve to pre-crisis levels, but would become even stronger.
The next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan behaved as if nothing had happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm leads to conflicting feelings.
However, the glow from Putin shows that the Russian leader has forgotten nothing.
The first thing he mentioned in his speech was the shooting down of a Russian aircraft on the Syrian border.
Moscow responded harshly at that time.
Putin accused Ankara of stabbing a dagger on the back of Moscow.
The injury was even more painful, given that it came from a friend.
It will be very difficult, perhaps impossible, to restore true confidence.
Russia's public position has, however, changed since November.
For several months, government - controlled television spread aggressive accusations against Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that the Turks were responsible.
The most serious were the allegations that Erdogan's own family made profits from the illicit trade in oil with the Islamic State-controlled part of Syria.
He himself denied that, of course.
However, the main message of the St. Petersburg meeting is that it is time to forget the past.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received President Erdogan's apology.
Russia could see it as a kind of victory.
Ankara's benefit from peace reconciliation is obvious.
Firstly, Erdogan needs all possible friends after the failed coup last month in which he was tried to be overthrown.
His position has also been shaken by countless terrorist attacks.
The same is true for economic reasons.
Russian sanctions have caused profound losses, especially the ban on charter flights, which usually provide for the influx of millions of Russian tourists every year into Turkish resorts.
The number of tourists fell by almost 90%.
The Russian tour operators and charter companies will also breathe in relief when regular flights are restored.
They are hoping for a holiday fever in the Mediterranean in the end of the season.
Already this week, the national TV predicts a drop in the price of fruit and vegetables, as Turkish imports of fruit and vegetables will be restored.
As quoted in the local newspaper Vedemosti: "Thourists for them, tomatoes for us."
However, the visit also had other political motives on the part of Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for, in their opinion, a weak reaction to the coup attempt.
Dissatisfaction with the long-standing EU accession negotiations and the intervention of Putin, who is willing to take advantage of the situation that Turkey is alienated from the West, can also be considered.
The Russian leader undoubtedly obtained additional points in the eyes of Ankara, expressing his support for its elected government after the coup attempt.
Note that Moscow understands this well, because itself is deeply rooted in the fear of regime change in the country.
The summit, which took place in this luxurious seaside castle, gave Russia and Turkey an opportunity to present what an analyst, the "outdated alliance", two countries that feel excluded from the West, joined forces.
However, despite the publicly demonstrated unity, there are still significant differences of opinion between the two countries.
The main differences concern Syria, where Russia presents itself as a peacemaker, but in fact Russia and Turkey support the opposite parties.
After more than three hours of initial talks, the two Presidents announced at a press conference that they had not discussed the matter without wishing to disclose it.
The Turkish President purposefully avoided the issues of conflict between the two countries, while President Putin wanted to highlight them.
There is no clear consensus on how both countries could find a common language on Syria.
However, after months of openly hostile relations and potential disasters, when a NATO member Turkey hit a Russian fighting plane, the situation has improved, as both leaders have at least resumed negotiations.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland
Brand SKB will have a supporting role in the future, as notified by the Bank’s Executive Director.
Outside Scotland, the SKB will no longer be available.
Ross Makewan tells the BBC channel in Scotland that the brand of SKB was associated with the bank's ambitions on a global scale.
It has given up these ambitions because eight years ago the bank almost went bankrupt and needed financial assistance.
Meanwhile, branding strategy experts have used the SKB brand to protect other consumer financial brands.
The bank received millions of pounds from international sports sponsors, from Six Nations regby to Wimbledon tennis champion Andy Murray.
However, it has now been decided to bring other national brands to the fore.
The Scottish Royal Banaka will be available to Scottish customers, but it will not be initialised.
In England and Wales, all references to the SKB, outside the head office and official stock exchange, will be changed to the name NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Smaller private financial brands, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank, will also be noted.
Makevan was interviewed during the trip with customers and employees through Invernessher.
He told the BBC's Scotland Channel: "SKB will become our investor brand and with which our employees work, because now we become more a brand bank."
In time, the bank itself became a global brand and SKB became a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have global ambitions, we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in their industry and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
SKB has already announced that it will not continue sponsoring the "Six Nations" and will involve various brands in sports sponsorship.
"It's high time to become a brand bank, because we've been asking ourselves a long time ago how to become a better bank for our customers?" says the executive director.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical if we announced that we would become a great bank for our customers and develop these brands.
However, thanks to hard work and focusing on the needs of our customers and not on our own, we have obviously made a big difference.
We can revive these brands again, so I think that is the time now.
Frankie Detori wins 3000, first place in New Market with horse Predition
Detori picks up the champagne, winning his 3000th victory twice at the first race in New Market.
On Friday, Jacques Frankie Detori won his 3000th victory in British history, winning first place in New Market.
He achieved it by winning the second victory in this race, which took place in his native city, riding with Predition, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth Jackey who has achieved such a result in horse sprint races.
He has joined Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Pigot, Pete Edery, and Willie Carson.
The three-time champion Jackey Detori, who before that won with the horse Ghayar, said, "It's something special."
I'm very moved because my family is here.
I'm very happy that this happened in New Market, because I've been living here for 30 years.
This is not a big race, this is not Royal Ascott, but a regular Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I feel relieved and very grateful.
After the victory Detori and Predition are welcomed with applause and cheer.
Two jockeys have reached this record in the race with obstacles - champion Richard Johnson and 20-time career-end champion Sir Antony McKoy, who set several records in his career, winning more than 4300.
Lester Pigot, a nine-time derby winner, won 4493 wins during his career.
Frankie is one of today's best jockeys, and it's not surprising that he has succeeded, which few can achieve.
He is stylish and powerful, but his tactics distinguish him from other jockeys.
He is a fantastic racing agent, his enthusiasm and charisma for years attract fans of this sport.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie at the Epsoma race that he would have won 6,000 if he had not just participated in the weekends and the big races.
However, seriously speaking, it is a real pleasure that Frankie has been winning the UK race on a regular basis for 30 years.
He is a joyful man who serves a great purpose in the British race, and he is an outstanding Jackey.
Frank Detori noted this achievement with his brand - flying jump.
From finishing at wind speed to flying jump, Frankie Detori has been a British horse racing face for twenty years.
This has been a journey full of adventures.
He has won countless big races, including the famous 1996 "Great Seventh" in Ascott, and has survived the plane crash and disqualification for the use of preparations.
Three years ago he found it difficult to return after six months of disqualification, but he demonstrated his power of character by challenging those who questioned him, returning to his best form.
And he could take part in the race for some more time -- Detori has previously said that he would like to continue to participate in the race until at least 50 years of age.
President of Russia Putin releases Head of Administration Sergei Ivanov
President of Russia Vladimir Putin unexpectedly released Head of Administration Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been among the closest people to Putin for many years.
The 63-year-old politician has now been appointed Special Representative for Nature and Transport.
The Kremlin's statement states that Putin "decided to release Ivanov from the duties of head of the Russian President's Administration", without mentioning the reason.
He was replaced by Anton Vaino, who was his deputy since 2012.
The 44-year-old Vaino is a diplomat.
Vaino was born in 1972 in Tallinn, Estonia, and graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MVSAI) and later worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
According to the Kremlin's website (in Russian), later he led the President's minutes and government administration.
After his appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
In my opinion, the main task of the administration is to support your work as President of the country by drafting laws and controlling the implementation of your decisions.
Putin told a Russian broadcasting company on Friday that Ivanov himself wanted to leave his position and recommended Vaino as his substitute.
Are smiles convincing?
This step has confused Moscow.
Sergey Ivanov is an ancient and close ally of Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, worked in the Soviet security service of the KGB.
In this capacity, he was one of the most influential men in Russia.
At the state television broadcast session, both men announced that Ivanov resigned on his own initiative.
But despite the smiles directed at the cells, which such an explanation rarely convinces, especially before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of the fight for power?
Nobody knows that.
However, the official statement that the man, who was considered a potential president, suddenly wanted to be the leader of Russia's environmental policy, is perceived with great scepticism.
In the notes published on the Kremlin's website, Ivanovs says to Putin: "It is the fact that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to entrust me with this difficult post, one could even say the problematic post, four years.
It turns out that I have been in this position for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took up his post in December 2011.
Previously he was Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB National Security Service, as well as Putin.
In the late 1990s, Putin headed the Federal Security Service, which is the successor to the KGB, Ivanov held the post of deputy to him.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusted most.
At the end of Putin's second term, Ivanov was considered a potential candidate for the post of President of Russia, as Putin's re-election to the third term would be unconstitutional.
But then, another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev, became president.
Putin became Prime Minister, and after three and a half years he returned to the post of President.
The advent of wild fish in a garden in Banfa
A husband from Banfa asks for help to find out the conditions of a species in his garden.
Kevin Bane thinks that 75 fish could be sand eels, who have come with the water room.
Mr. Bane, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, made a video of fish available on the Periscope website, hoping that someone could know how these 5 centimetres of fish came into his garden.
Queensferry intersection: The bridge is now connected to the Faif.
At present, a GBP 1.35 billion project is expected to be completed in May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern part of the Queensferry junction with the viaduct, which means that the bridge is now connected to the Faif.
The first of the four connecting parts is completed, which means that the construction of the bridge is coming to an end.
The structure of the faifa bridge is 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It consists of 10 000 tonnes of steel, 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 support cables.
Currently, the GBP 1.35 billion project is expected to be completed in May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keit Brown had come to the construction site today and was one of the first to climb the bridge.
He said, "This is a symbolic and historic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Bridge."
In this project, we see an unparalleled engineering solution, where only this part of the construction has used more than 30 000 tonnes of cement and steel.
Despite the enormous weight and size of the bridge, connecting the bridge and viaduct is an extremely delicate process that requires enormous precision.
In total, more than 79% of the bridge deck has already been built and the last section that will connect the bridge with Rosita will be inserted today, which means that all parts of the bridge are ready for construction.
Michael Martin, director of the fourth bridge project, says: "The first connection is a very important point in the construction of any bridge."
In this fantastic project, the first connection demonstrates top-class engineering.
After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the support of the northern tower, we were left to connect the northern section of the road with the part of the ground, or viaduct.
This was done by moving the part of the viaduct of the northern accessway to the south.
It was a huge and at the same time very delicate operation.
Huge, because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled at an angle of about 3%.
Delicate, because the tolerance in both directions with which the team worked was only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went well.
Simone Bailes gets the gold in gymnastics for women.
Forget the tension.
Forget the excitement.
Simón Byles doesn't care.
Dynamic jumps.
Easily perform exercises on a log.
It's unbeatable on the floor.
Absolutely perfect.
And finally the Olympic champion.
On Thursday, a 19 - year - old American gymnast won a gold medal, demonstrating the complete difference between himself and the rest of the world on the Olympic stage.
Her total score of 62,198 was above the silver medal winner and her teammate Alija Raismane and the bronze medal winner of the Russian athlete Alija Mustafina.
On Thursday, US athlete Simona Bailsa performed an exercise on a log in the individual sports gymnastics finals for women in the summer 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Bailsa became the fourth American in a row, who won the championship title and the fifth best gymnast, gradually strengthening her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and perhaps the best gymnast in the history.
When the end result was announced, she burst into tears, for the long journey to that point was over.
This achievement ranks him alongside such unparalleled athletes as Michael Phelps, who raised his sports to a different level.
For the last three years, Bailsa has dominated her sport by winning 15 medals at the World Championships, including 10 gold medals, performing such excellent, precise and ambitious combinations of exercises that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lu Rötne called her "the best gymnast she ever saw".
In Brazil, she was faced with the final test, where she had to compete to a large extent with the hopes placed on her rather than with the other sportsmen.
She would be disappointed if she returned to her home in Spring, Texas, without gold medals.
US athletes Simona Bailsa (left) and Aly Raismane hug after winning the gold and silver medal respectively in the individual gymnastics finals for women in the summer 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which took place on Thursday.
Bailsa won the first gold medal on Tuesday, making a special random coordinator Marta Karolji farewell party.
Although Bailes claims that she had not waited for anything like this on her long journey to the peaks of fame, it is not true.
Part of her performance's free movement, which includes her special acrobatics, is accompanied by Latin music, which would fit perfectly on the street next to the Arena of the Rio Olympic Games.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl, who was adopted by her grandparents when she was still an infant and was discovered by the mother of coach Amy Bourman on a tour to the gym, where the Būrmane's seats were held, has now become a force to consider.
She has not lost in the multigame since the summer of 2013 and the winning series can continue as long as Bails wants.
Although Mustafin’s two rotations led a little, it was only an illusion.
The balance beam and the free movement - part of the competition, where Bails will defend his title as champion, is still ahead.
She took the lead with a score of 15,433 on a log and strengthened her leadership with a result of 15,933 in free movement
The Raismane gently embraced her while they waited for the results, which were only formality and she poured out in tears of joy when the dream she had once written in her notebook came true.
The result of Raismane was a slight retaliation for four-year-old events, when she shared third place with Mustafin, but lost the fight for the bronze medal.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team, which the Americans call "grandmother", came up with convincing leadership.
After performance in the free movement, which dispelled her doubts about her return, she could devote her to a crowd of air kisses.
Meanwhile, the 19-year-old Bailsa's viral Twitter recording r, which she published this week, has already had a completely different meaning.
Six-year-old Mahay Brown's "loose-holed" lives in a gunfire in Philadelphia.
The police say that a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, pointing out that he is already the second six-year-old to be shot in Philadelphia this week.
The children's grandparents confirmed to the CBS Philadelphia news channel that it was Mahay Brown.
Grandparents say that Brown was shot several times, including in the groin, leg, arm, and stomach, but was still conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
His grandmother, Delores Melendez, tells television: "His little body was simply bullet-holed."
I can't believe it.
The boy is in a critical condition and has already undergone several surgeries.
The family informs that he will definitely recover.
He had to start at the first grade of the local elementary school.
Brown is one of the four people shot in the Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two 29 - year - old men and one 32 - year - old man.
CBS Philadelphia reports that one of the 29 - year - olds is in a critical position, while the other two are in a stable position.
The channel says that the child was found in the front seat of the car next to the 29-year-old victim in a critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police investigate whether any of them was an attacker.
The investigator told CBS Philadelphia that several shooters were likely involved in the shooting.
At the location, there were found gun shelles belonging to various weapons.
Looks like it's been a long-time shooting.
Shells have been found on both sides of the pedestrian sidewalk.
"So it looks like there have been several armed shooters who actively participated in the shooting," says the Philadelphia police captain Antony Ginaldi.
Several homes and cars have also been damaged.
No one has yet been detained and the police have been reported to check the camera records.
On Tuesday, a lost bullet hit a six - year - old girl in her hand while playing in front of her home in the Westowlin area.
She is gradually recovering, but the police are still looking for the culprit.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
I call it a Women of the Year Olympic Athlete Command for a number of reasons.
First of all, I have been to all the summer Olympics since 1984, and the US team has never been so good.
Secondly, the team consists of three athletes, Simona Bails, Gabby Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who are inspired by many young girls.
People can be proud that this team also includes Aly Raismane, a Jewish woman and Madison Cociana, who is a Catholic.
Finally, this team truly represents America.
It has also strengthened the participation of black and Latin American athletes in this sport.
For the past four years, the best gymnast is an American of African descent.
Last year, Simone and Gabby took 1st and 2nd place.
These are impressive results.
As a surprise, Gaby Douglas became Olympic champion at the previous Olympic Games, and America was able to rejoice.
Now the world has seen incredible exercises performed by the triple world champion Simona Bails, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez doing unprecedented but masterful exercises.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American in a row to win a gold medal for women.
Her teammate, Aly Raismane, won the silver medal.
We have seen the best that this sport can bring, but the situation in the rest of the country is completely different in the exercise lessons.
Simone, Gaby, and Laurie were included in the Olympics, as were Allia and Madison.
They are the Olympic Five, because the next Olympic gymnastics team will have only four athletes, and this is the last year of the coach Marta Karola.
In fact, gymnastics are expensive sports. Gymnastics are mainly trained in private athletic clubs, and they are maintained by parents who pay for training, premises, travel, uniforms, hotels (trainers, athletes and their families) and other expenses.
Most of these Athletics clubs are located in urban areas that can afford this sport.
In these clubs athletes spend all their workouts, and it is a costly and long investment for athletic families.
Amy Bourman - Simona Bailsa coach and Maggie Hainy - Laurie Hernandez coach have trained their athletes since both girls began to practice athletics.
We need to provide young girls who are inspired by Simona, Gaby and Laurie with cheaper gymnastics.
I founded my athletic organization 20 years ago.
My organization is in Harlem and we offer more than 15 000 exercises for young people (mainly black and Spanish) for free or at a low price. We have also trained national and international champions.
In September we will open a branch in Detroit (my home town) to give local young people the opportunity to get to know this great sport.
Athletics develops strength, flexibility and body coordination, as well as teaches hard work, discipline and goal-seeking.
This combination provides a long life with good health and success both at school and at work.
This team will inspire thousands of young girls to train in athletics and it is fantastic.
Dealing with this sport is very important, especially for young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thanks to Simone, Allia, Gaby and Madison for the great "Girls Force" demonstration, winning the gold medals of the Olympic Games and motivating countless young girls of different backgrounds to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After Jeremy Hunt’s offer was rejected, the new doctors plan to make more strikes.
The ministers hoped to end the disagreement by reaching agreement on changes to the agreement with representatives of the British Medical Association. However, 58 percent of the 37 000 new doctors who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt announced plans to conclude a contract, indicating that the NHS is in a fragile state and that further delays will only harm workers and patients.
The first new doctors have already signed the new contract, which provides for changes in the conditions for night shifts and weekends to improve working conditions during non-standard hours.
Last night, Dr. Ellen Macourt, the representative of BMA's new doctors, stated that young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially that it will deepen the labour crisis and it does not provide equal conditions for all doctors.
Eight weeks left until the first group of new doctors sign the new contract, so progress needs to be made, because there is not much time left.
BMA's efforts to solve the problem by negotiation have been faced with the government's unwillingness to engage and sometimes with complete silence.
This is despite the fact that Jeremy Hunt said just last month that his door was always open.
Jeremy Hunt must take immediate action, stop inactivity and cooperate with new doctors.
If he does not, the new doctors are ready for new protests.
During the last strike, more than 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were postponed at the end of April, while nurses and consultants tried to replace the doctors who had gone on a picket.
Ministers hoped to end the disagreement by reaching agreement on changes to the agreement with representatives of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants to raise the rate for working on weekends to 54 000 new doctors who would be covered by the new contracts.
Daniel Mortimer, NHS Employment Executive Director, invited young doctors not to go to strike.
Mr Mortimer explains that strikes do not solve anything, but only increase the pressure on the workers and worry, cause stress and delay for patients, carers and their families.
Over the last two months, we have talked to the new Committee of Doctors and, together with the Ministry of Health and other institutions, we have responded positively to their questions about guardians and rapporteurs.
Employers hope that active cooperation on other important issues, such as employee placement, flexible training, additional training for those returning after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of training programmes, leaving studies and gender pay inequality in medicine, shows that employers, English health education institutions and the Ministry of Health are seriously willing to implement the agreements concluded with BME in November, February and May.
Medicines of 2 pounds per day may reduce the risk of heart attack.
Thousands of patients who have had a heart attack could be treated with the medicine at an average of 2 pounds a day, as the official representatives recommend that it be used in more people and for longer periods.
The anticlotting medicine Ticagrelor reduces the risk of recurrent heart attacks in people with heart disease.
This medicine is already prescribed for use 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of another heart attack.
It is recommended that NHS-represented NICE be used for 4 years after a heart attack to further reduce the risk of heart attack in people with cardiovascular problems.
However, it is recommended that NICE currently under NHS should be used for 4 years after a heart attack in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.
Each year, about 140,000 people in England experience heart attack, and a quarter of them experience another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attack and stroke are caused by the accumulation of fat in the walls of the heart, leading to blockages.
If a blockage breaks, it can cause a clot, blocking the flow of blood to the heart and causing a heart attack.
On the other hand, if a blood clot separates from the wall of the blood vessels, it can go further into the blood stream and block blood access to the brain, causing a heart attack.
People who have had a heart attack are more at risk of having a new heart attack.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca, which is marketed as Brilique, reduces the risk of blood clots forming.
New NICE guidelines, published today, are recommended for use in humans at 90 mg of Ticagrelor for 12 months and for 3 years at 60 mg twice daily with aspirin.
Professor Carol Longson, Director of NICE Health Technology, explains: "Despite the availability of medicines to prevent a recurring heart attack, more than a quarter of people who have had a heart attack experience another heart attack or stroke, which often has serious consequences."
Fear of repeated heart attacks can have a negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
Evidence suggests that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of a recurrent heart attack and heart attack in people who have already experienced it.
By provisionally recommending treatment with Ticagrelor, we are glad that we can expand the treatment options for thousands of people, who are thus the winners.
In view of the limited information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor, in particular the risk of bleeding when this medicinal product is used for more than three years, the draft guideline does not recommend its use beyond this time limit.
Political correctness culture promotes electoral fraud in Muslim communities
Former Mayor of Tauerhamlett, Lutfur Rahman, was dismissed for corruption, according to a report from the leadership.
The government report reveals that the culture of political correctness is turning a blind eye to large-scale fraud in Muslim communities.
Former Minister of Government Sir Erik Pickl criticises the police, election supervisors and city councils for ignoring the signs of fraud in the electoral process because they "are afraid to offend ethnic and religious interests."
The former community secretary, who has now become the leader of the anti-corruption organisation, says that the intimidation of voters for religious reasons is so widespread that the police should allow guards to be placed at the polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He also suggested that voters should present a personal identity document when they vote to prove their true identity.
At the moment, voters are required to give only their name and address.
He even recommends that the fingers of the voters be marked with a special ink in order to prevent a double vote.
The rapporteurs must also provide greater protection, says Sir Erik.
He felt that the press should ensure greater access to Council documents and decisions taken by informal committees and working groups.
He says, "The aim is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to protect the local government from a wider culture of corruption and fraud that goes hand in hand with it."
The report was commissioned by the Dawning Street following the scandal in connection with the elections in the town of Tauerhamlet.
Last year, the Special Election Court decided to remove Mayor Lutfur Rahman from the office of mayor of the city due to corrupt and illegal activities.
The Court found that Rahman "cially distorted" the religious view of his Muslim community and silenced his critics, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
"Rahman led his election campaign with a statement that it is the religious duty of believers Muslims to vote for him."
Some 300 votes were fake or questionable, since one person had voted several times.
Sir Erik also points out that there are signs of fraud throughout the country.
He pointed out that fraud in postal voting, where senior members of Muslim communities forced others to vote for their preferred candidates, was particularly worrying.
Sir Eriks suggested a number of measures to improve the electoral system, including the production of a personal identification document to clarify the identity of the person.
His report states: "The evidence shows that vulnerable members of ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, are being forced to vote for candidates selected by community elders, especially in the communities of Bangladesh and Pakistan."
"There is concern that district authorities are not paying attention to these problems because of political correctness, because they might harm ethnic and religious interests."
Sir Erik outlined 50 recommendations on how to improve the electoral system, which also includes a ban on political activists to act with voices handed over by post in order to prevent the "collection of voices".
The report, which is being examined by Teresa May, also calls for a more thorough check of registration in order to prevent the use of electoral lists for immigration fraud and benefits fraud.
Consider the possibility of requesting voters to present an identity document before the vote.
To select the fingers of the voters with a special ink to avoid double voting.
Systematic verification of the nationality of persons to ensure that a person has the right to vote.
Set a three-year limit for requests for automatic postal voting.
Prohibit political campaigners and activists from working with votes handed over by post and electoral envelopes to vote by post.
Ensure that the police have the authority to appoint a guard at the polling stations.
Make changes to the law to facilitate the prosecution of persons for intimidation in accordance with the 1983 Human Rights Act.
Prohibit photographing at polling stations.
To require the use of English only in polling stations (except in Wales).
Reinforce training to ensure that pollers go to ballot boxes one by one.
Sir Eric strongly criticises the Metropolitan police, perplexing that there have been no charges in the Towerhamlet case.
He says: "The election court only disqualified Luftour Rahman and his representative for their activities related to corruption and fraud."
He was conclusively convicted of the standard of criminal law evidence on the basis of irrefutable evidence.
He also criticises the inefficient "check-up" of the voters of the City Council at the polling stations.
Sir Erik says: "The court's decision last year is an alarm bell.
Our land is known as the birthplace of the parliament, but the alarming and disguised spread of electoral fraud and the eviction of the authorities that fraud does not threaten this good reputation.
Rage with a cyclist - Kate's peer and other Rio Olympic celebrities
Fans of the 2016 Rio Olympic Games will be thrilled by the French cyclist Paulina Ferranda Prevot, whom the fans found to be extremely similar to the Duke of Cambridge.
However, a 24-year-old cyclist is not the only athlete who fights for gold this summer, who, according to the media, is proud of his celebrity counterpart.
Therefore, in honour of the Rio Olympic Games and all the famous faces that we now see on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympics participants, which is quite similar to Hollywood stars.
Hunter and Wolf: Brady Allison, a member of the U.S. archer's team, left, has been compared to Leonardo Di Kaprio since childhood
Apart from Kate’s counterpart on the cycling track, many people on the Internet say that this archer could be a twin brother of the superstar Leonardo Di Kaprio.
Brady Allison, a member of the U.S. men’s archer’s team, caused a storm on Twitter when photographs were published that resembled very much Wall Street Wilk.
The athlete himself noticed the storm in social media and admitted that he was compared to Leonardo Di Kaprio since childhood.
"I personally don't see much similarity, except for the beard," Brady says to Huffington Post.
"He's a handsome guy, so I see it as a compliment."
This year, one of the most popular pairs of London's Olympic peers in 2012 will undoubtedly become even more popular: the stunning similarity between British far-reacher Greg Rutherford and popular actor Nile Patrick Harris.
The Russian athleticsian Allie Mustafina is compared with the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefana thanks to her large, expressive eyes.
In terms of swimming, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burg has been compared with Matthew Morrison's "Created for stage" star for several years.
Changes: this user has noticed that Nathan is an `sportable version' of the movie 'Inception'.
Similarly, the tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnet have similar eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist, swimmer Julia Efimova and actress Annaline McKorda can be proud not only of sun-burned skin and blond hair. Meanwhile, fans believe that the athletic U.S. athlete Nathan Adrian is like Joseph Gordon LeWitt.
Harsh Women: The Football Star (left) Houpa Solo and the actress of Dexter series Jennifer Carpenter (right) have a similar face shape and eyes.
Not one: someone on Twitter was pleasantly surprised to learn that others also see these similarities
Theory: this user believes that there may be a reason why both look so similar
Recently, a Twitter user declared with real pleasure that "other Internet users agree that Houpa Solo and Jennifer Carpenter actually look identical."
The U.S. football star and the actress of Dexter series really have a very similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons apply to Kerry Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linny. Also, the gold medal winner's athletics Gaby Douglas boasts a beautiful, broad smile, similar to the smile of the "Bring It On" star Gabriella Unijona.
The commentary on the CBC Olympic Games apologises for commenting that the Chinese swimmer is 'ending up like a pig'.
Byron McDonald's analysis of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhas finish fourth place in a 4x200 m free-style relay for women, called out the storm of indignation in CBC spectators.
Canada's CBC was forced to apologize, because one of its commentators made comments that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer from the race " flew out of the race that smelled alone" and "ended like a pig".
Commentator Byron McDonald thought that his microphone was turned off when 4x200 m freestyle relays for women ended up expressing their personal opinion.
McDonald, who was included in the CBC commentator team to give the comments vitality, said: "That little 14-year-old from China can't keep up."
"Overruns, she flew out of the race, that she just smelled and died like a pig."
Thank you very much.
The 14-year-old Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhana scored 1:57.79 in the second stage, which is 1.61 seconds slower than the Canadian Taylor Rucka result, allowing Canadians to catch up with China.
The audience throughout Canada reacted immediately on the Internet because they were shocked to hear such a tone and expressions.
Emmet McFarlain wrote on Twitter: "Did a direct CBC commentator just said that a 14-year-old swimmer from China "expired like a pig"???"??"
The idiot didn't realize that they were still in direct air.
Ai Yanha from China in the 4x200m freestyle final women were named "a small 14-year-old from China who does not keep up."
The criticism of Byron McDonald quickly came into force because many asked for explanations.
Twitter users could not believe by hearing Byron McDonald's insensitive comments.
Twitter user Sarah Paradise wrote: "Oho, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and you because we all sound like racists. # disgusting.
Soon afterward, Scott Russell, who was the leader of the CBC live broadcast, apologized for McDonald's comments, saying: "We're sorry that the comment on the swimming result was on the live air."
It was an unfortunate choice of words and we are very sorry that this happened.
The CBC apologised to more than 90 people who had responded to this comment on Twitter.
McDonald's colleague Scott Russell had to apologize for him.
The CBC then copied an apology to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comment.
Also, the channel quickly published an apology and a statement.
We very much regret that such comments were made and came directly into the air.
Yesterday we reacted immediately and apologized to all the viewers and followers of the live broadcast in social media.
For the sake of clarity, Byron's comments were made about the swimmer's performance and not addressed to her personally.
However, in any case, these were unprofessional and unsuccessfully chosen statements and Byron is very sorry for what happened.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald personally apologized directly and tried to explain that he did not think that his comment would be viewed as a personal attack.
He said on the CBC Olympics live: "I would like to take the moment and apologize for the comment I made yesterday after the free-style women competition."
I'm talking about the swimmer's performance, not about her personally.
Needless to say, I did not intend to show disrespect, and I am really sorry that this happened.
The buyers of Primark are shocked by a woman who brazenly try lingerie in the middle of the shop.
The buyers were embarrassed when the woman began to undress her to try panties in the middle of the shop.
As she made the situation worse, she used them to make sure that they suit her and then took her off, putting the panties back on the shop shelf.
She kept looking for clothes at the Folkeston Bouverie Place shopping center and used four more panties.
Primmark shop Bouverie Place in the shopping centre in Folkeston – the place where this woman used underwear and then put it back on the shelf.
At the time, the mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, was in the store, telling us that the unknown woman, after wearing underwear, put on her clothes and left the store without buying anything.
She points out that people could not believe their eyes.
Standing in the middle of the store, she took her underpants from the shelf, took off her tights and trousers and measured them right there.
She didn't even try to find a more discreet place to measure them, she just used them on the spot.
Everyone looked at her pants off and apparently did not like them, because she just put them back on the shelf.
She measured three more panties until she decided that she did not like them and left the store.
He did not seem to be worried that someone was watching or thinking about the person who would buy the clothes she used.
Ms. Davidson (33 years old) from Kent says, "The idea of Dardza that someone will buy clothes that have been tried by another person and have not been washed off afterwards."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson adds: "I assume that the shop staff, after she left, took the clothes out of the store shelves - which is also acceptable."
I can't imagine buying a new underwear and finding out that another woman used it and then didn't wash it.
The representative of Primark indicated that Primark was aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday, 9 August.
The specific clothes have been removed from the store shelves.
How to protect yourself from firearms using Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer.
To find out how to protect ourselves in a close distance from attackers with a firearm, we talked to Krav Maga’s grandmaster from New York City, Ron Misrac.
Whether you are attacked from the front or from the back, this video shows how to protect yourself and win over the attacker.
The Mizarake indicates that if the attacker attacks from the back, then you must turn first to see the attacker clearly and avoid the shot path.
Then the weapon must be grasped between your front arm and shoulder and you must strike the enemy's face with your free elbow.
Then there's a shot with a knee in the groin and while the attacker freezes in pain, takes his weapon, hits his face with a gun's grip and retreats, continuing to turn the weapon against him.
If the attacker approaches from the front, the situation is similar - to avoid a shot-up trajectory, to grasp the weapon and to fold it so that the evildoer cannot shoot.
At the same time, you have to put pressure on the gun and hit the enemy on the breasts and finally take the gun away and step back to keep pointing at him.
Sounds complicated?
Watch the video to see exactly how Misrake does it.
But remember, if you're not the master of Krav Mags, then it's safer to give your money back to the loser.
The Vandal family inaugurates Saltash Cornwall’s social home and is put on the street.
The Vodka family has been put out of residence for terrorizing neighbours, causing damage to a social home of 50,000 pounds.
Tanja Skeldon and her partner, Sean Trebilkoks, were only a minor property in Saltash Cornwall because of several complaints against them.
After forced expropriation, shocked housing officials found that the property had been completely destroyed.
There were holes in the floors and walls, waste was spilled everywhere, and the walls were covered with graffiti.
The family has now been evicted and is likely to live in private property.
Donna McKevoy, operator of the Cornwall Housing Service, says that there is a concern that housing will not be able to be restored.
She says that the people who lived here were extremely difficult, and she believes that people cannot live like that.
In the case at hand, a number of factors need to be assessed, since this property will not be of good repute in Cornwall in the future.
This family is famous and their name is well known.
The couple had three sons who were periodically in possession and the police said that their terror was a form of violence, street ravaging with baseball sticks, intimidation of the local population, drug abuse, drug sales, and loud twitching and swearing.
The 47-year-old Skeldone, in whose name the property was owned, was sentenced in June for antisocial behaviour.
A number of destroyed rooms in the house have found litter.
In a house where drugs can be traded in the past, several floor boards have been pulled out.
Neighbors say that they regularly climbed the street and were constantly called the police.
The Cornwall Housing Service forced them out of the property after they had been given 11 weeks to move out of the house voluntarily.
The desperate neighbors were very happy to be evicted because their life was absolutely hell.
One said, "They didn't care about other residents."
We lived next to them for 20 years, it's always been crazy.
I can't believe how often we've seen the police here.
We couldn't sleep this morning.
We woke up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
Now that they are finally gone, here will be wonderful.
Adam Fitzpatrik, who is head of the neighbourhood protection of the Cornwall Housing Service, said that the family did not cooperate with the local security authorities.
The family has lived here for 20 years and here regularly called the police.
Various old and unusable objects were found in the overgrown garden of the house.
He also said: "It is a great pity that the tenants did not show any responsibility for their behaviour, because evictions are always the final step considered by the Cornwall Housing Service."
This was a very difficult case, since their behavior was extreme and their neighbors were very hard to see in their behavior.
I appreciate the work of all my team, the police and members of the commune of Devon and Cornwall, who were courageous and cooperating with us in providing the necessary information.
I hope that this event will make life easier for our neighbours and will show that antisocial behaviour is unacceptable.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons lived here in different periods of time, but all were about 20 years old.
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the rooms after displaying.
The staff will now have to clean up the garbage heap left in the house.
In 2014, the police searched the house and found more than 70 grams of marijuana, weights, accessories and 1 700 pounds in cash.
Skeldone is only found guilty of storing Class B drugs with a view to their distribution.
She insisted that the money was intended for a monument to her son Lee Scheldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being evicted, it has become known that they are now renting some private property in Plymouth.
On many walls of the house were drawn graffiti.
The police say they will continue to evict tenants who violate their rental contracts.
Angela Crow, representative of the Devon and Cornwall police, points out that this eviction is a clear warning to other tenants who continue to violate the rules.
She also said, "This is a warning to those who believe that they can behave as they wish and that there will be no consequences."
The police of Devon and Kronvola do not accept criminal and antisocial behaviour, and the police will continue to work with our partners to protect local communities.
A readiness to spend can give impetus to the economy.

The mayor of the Cannes has banned burkini swimsuits on the beaches.
The mayor of the southern French resort town of Cannes has banned the wearing of the burkini swimsuits on the beaches of that city, which almost completely covers a woman's body and very resembles a hydrosuit, said local officials on Thursday.
The mayor of the Cannes, David Linar, has signed an order that "access to beaches and swimming is prohibited for anyone who does not have a suit that respects good customs and secularism" as a basic principle of the French Republic.
"Pludmale dress, which outwardly shows religious affiliation at a time when France and places of worship are the target of terrorist attacks, may pose a risk of public order disruptions (fragmentation, collisions, etc.) which need to be prevented", says the order.
"We are talking not about banning the wearing of religious symbols on the beach, but about outdoor clothing related to trust in the terrorist movements that are fighting with us", explained the municipal utility manager Thierry Migul.
He added that the burkini swimsuits on the beaches of Cannes have not been seen since July 28, when Linar, a member of the centre-right "Republicans" party, signed the order and it came into force.
This week, the aquapark in Marseilles abolished a planned private event for Muslim women dressed in burkini swimsuits, as it was outraged by politicians from both the right and the left.
In France, it is forbidden to wear face-covering headgear of Muslim women, but not religious symbols or appropriate clothing.
On 14 July, 85 people were killed in a terrorist attack organised in the nearby town of Cannes, Nice, under the responsibility of the Islamic State.
On July 26, two attackers who had sworn their loyalty to the Islamic State brutally murdered priests in the church in northwest France.

The festival "Kubana" has begun in Lucavsala.
On Thursday, August 11, in the evening in Lucavsala was given a start at one of the last festivals of this summer - "Kubāna" will take place there until Sunday night.
In the first evening, those gathered were spoiled by such groups as Enter Shikari from Great Britain, which was expected last year, but from the program disappeared, American punks "NOFX", DJ Maxim from the group "The Prodigy" and others.
In the next few days, the programme also features noteworthy words – Guano Apes and Garbage, Marky Ramon with Marky Ramone's Blitzkrieg, Brutto&Lyapis with Belarusian punkroc leader Sergey Michalock, popular Georgian actor and singer Vahtang Kikabidze, Ukrainians Vopli Vidoplyasova and a number of other, but full programme of the event can be viewed here.
This is the second year that Kubana festival takes place in Latvia.
Last year it suffered a financial failure and huge losses, but it did not stop the organizers from rehearsing - they added a spirit to the title, included a Latvian group in the programme (Friday night at 19:15 on stage "All Day Long") and announced that now the festival has become "closer and has gained a local colorful next to Riga symbols such as its panorama and cats".
Whether these efforts will be justified, it is too early to judge, because the festival just ran, but, as Delfi Entertainment observed on the first night, at least so far huge crowds of people have not been able to attract and the number of visitors was similar to last year.

President, who remained in the shadow: Gustavs Zemgals 145.
On Friday, August 12, it is 145 years since the birth of the second President of Latvia, Gustavs Zemgals.
Zemgals proclaimed the state of Latvia, but it is unprofitably left in the shadow of the first President of Latvia Jānis Čakste and the last President of the pre-war period Kārlis Ulmanis.
None of our statesmen have defended democracy and the rule of law as much as Zemgale, Arnolds Auziņš writes in his book dedicated to Gustavs Zemgals ten years ago.
In conversation with the portal Delfi Auziņš emphasizes that Zemgals is one of the few high-ranking politicians who have had a sense of humor.
The rest of the strings, always very right.
He taught not to be, but today it could be like Raimonds Vējonis.
"He was the one who was close to the people," says Auziņš.
Modern politicians do not know the history, they referred to Karli Ulmanis as a good leader, but rarely does anyone know how disgusting he was.
The only person he has not shouted at in government sessions was General Balodis.
Even if he is kind and smiling in pictures, he was hysterical by nature.
"Zemgals, with his sense of humor and democracy, leaves the opposite impression", says Auziņš.
In a conversation with Delfi, professor of the Faculty of History and Philosophy of the University of Latvia Aivars Strangs agrees with Auziņa's assessment of Zemgale as a peaceful and weighed stateman.
He also notes that Zemgal has earned respect for minorities and has regularly invited Jewish representatives to the presidential palace.
"At that time, it was not the usual course of action, after the Zemgal Presidency, Albert Kviesis took over this tradition," says the historian.
He was such a quiet and sedentary man who had to be persuaded to become president for a long time.
He didn't want it himself, he just didn't love it.
He was also quite critical of himself because he did not know the French language, but he believed that the President should know it.
"During the residency, the basics of French were learned," explains Stranga.
He did not allow himself to stand again; he did not like such high posts.
In all respects, he is a very respectable person in the history of Latvia; he had a serious post before he got into the presidential palace - he was a very demanded notary.
Zemgals also managed the famous Zemgala cashier at Suvorova Street 3, where there was a society of savings and savingsmen, in which practically the Latvian state was formed in government talks.
He was always progressive.
He was not a great fan of Ulmanis, but he did not object publicly either.
"In private conversations, however, it has sometimes been said that Ulmanis' actions are not really primordial to him," says Strang.
He lived a peaceful life, and there is no suspicion of lawlessness or corruption.
How does Zemgal remember today?
It is a pity, but for a large part he only associated with a street in Riga.
He was an absolute democrat, he was centered.
"During his time, there were no major shocks, namely, he could associate with such a truly stable Presidency," summed up by Stranga.
During the Presidency of Gustavs Zemgals, from 1927 to 1930, there was also a visit of Latvia to Sweden, which at that time implied full recognition of Latvia in a neighbouring country and integration into the family of democratic nations of Northern Europe.
On May 28, 1929, Zemgale visited Stockholm.
The Swedish King Gustav V's reply visit to Latvia took place on 29 June 1929.
The second President of Latvia was born in 1871, but passed away in January 1939.
Simple ways to help a child cope with anger attacks.
I often face the fact that my child’s anger, the onset of anger, is considered by my parents to be something wrong and insane.
When the child openly shows his anger - we don't know how to react, "Econet" indicates psychologist Jekaterin Kesa.
The specialist encourages a small discussion about these natural and human feelings - anger and anger that each of us periodically experiences.
Aggression - it is already a physical activity directed against another person, and it usually appears when we feel angry.
When we adults are angry, excited - we usually know what's going on with us and how to deal with it.
We can express our anger and anger within ourselves: express, suppress, hide, keep in ourselves, tell our friends or other loved ones about it, we can kick a sofa in anger, smoke a cigarette (this is not the best way to dispel anger!), take a shower, hit it with a couch on a table and do other things we don't usually do.
We don't take our aggression against others, because we know various other ways to deal with these emotions.
Children do not understand what is happening to them, how to call them, and how to live with them.
They can say, "Go away!", you're a fool, "Bad mom", "I don't see you", "I won't be friends with you" - and very rarely when I can say, "I'm mad at you."
Children live in a literal sense, they are completely here, at this moment, they are spontaneous and truly expressing their feelings, and often they are also held captive by various emotions.
It is very important that parents do not deny the child feelings, including anger, do not shame and do not feel ashamed, but, on the contrary, help the child.
Do you need a break in the relationship?
There are so many reasons why I would like a moment, a day or even longer to "turn off" from all over the world.
Is it possible to pause the relationship for a moment and breathe a little?
Or does it show that each partner has a way to go?
The gentlemen share their views at different ages.
Jānis (23) is brief and concise: "In my opinion, if you need a pause in a relationship, you are not with the right person".
Meanwhile, Eduard (30) has discovered a scheme that could possibly help someone.
If you feel that your partner starts falling on your nerves for every little detail, then surely it's the right time to look into other hunting fields to see if you miss him, or if you don't think about him or don't even want to see him at all.
So the answer is yes, having a pause can help you save time and understand how important the other half is to you.
Kaspars (29) reveals his theory.
In my opinion, one should have a daily pause, because if you spend time with a person 24 hours a day, seven days a week, then disputes are inevitable.
They are caused by the fact that you notice every detail the other does, and it starts to fall on the nerves.
People get tired of each other, especially if you don't even talk about anything anymore, just about what you've done during the day.
My personal experience makes me think so, so I haven't survived the relationship for more than a couple of months.
If you think for a moment that it's better elsewhere or with someone else, why is this woman you're with deserved to think that it's not good enough here and there's a paradise field behind the mountains?
Thinking alone is a little betrayal.
If not, then not.
"I have, so I'm a little denouncing those who don't have." says Edmund (46).
Carl (33) has the opposite view.
I think everybody needs a moment for a breath.
You can't look each minute, all the time, from morning to evening, in each other's eyes, and rejoice at the enduring love.
Come on!
There are so many things - friends, work, parties.
Everything has its time.
Of course, also for a friend or wife, but if both can hold the balance between family life and the rest of the world, it can live to the edge of the grave.
That's it and that's it.
Mārtiņš (27) says: "It is hard to say whether or not you need, you may or may not take a break, but one thing is clear - the initiator of the relationship has nothing to the end, something is missing."
If this question arises, then it should be taken into account that in the near future there will be any changes - for the good or for the bad, it depends on itself.
I mean, while you're still young and crazy, you have to pause all the time, but when everything gets serious and the relationship goes into a completely different phase, there's no question of rest.
You decide to spend your whole life together!
"If you can't withstand each other's society and sometimes you need a respite, then what will happen when you're pensioners who comment on how passing cats do or argue about the day when the garden should be dubbed," explains Kristaps (19).
All the names of the lords have been changed.
With his enthusiastic and enthusiastic personality, Rozentāls was the first to awaken interest in fine arts among Latvians.
"In this sense, he was the first love of the Latvian nation, which as such will remain unforgettable," Romans Suta wrote about the old master of Latvian painting Janis Rozentāls.
Also in 2016, revealing the extensive retrospective exhibition of the Old Master in the restored main building of the Latvian National Museum of Art, it is clear that Rozentāls is the first love of Latvian art.
The exhibition was opened on 12 August, but already from 13 August it is available for visitors and will be on view until 30 October.
The Latvian National Museum of Art honours painter Janis Rozentāls (1866-1916), whose 100th birthday on the international scale is included in the UNESCO calendar of ceremonies.
The retrospective exhibition, featuring more than 150 works, is one of the central events of Janis Rozentāls' anniversary programme.
The selection of artworks is mostly made from the collection of the Latvian National Museum of Art, which convincingly represents the main stages and genres of classical creative activity, stylistic turnover and the diversity of techniques.
In addition, exhibits from Akseli Gallen-Callella Museum, Literature and Music Museum, Liepaja Museum, Tukums Museum and several private collections in Latvia and Finland are used.
The atmosphere of the turn of the century is revived by the presence of photographs, the mobile application of the exhibition reveals the interplay of individual works of art with photographs taken by the painter with his own camera for creative purposes.
The Finnish-Latvian Commonwealth Society "Rozentāls-seura", named after the Latvian classic, at the Latvian National Museum of Art, at the same time offers the first stop of small informative travelling exhibitions "With a glance in Finland, with a heart in Latvia".
A similar exhibition with content in English, Finnish and Swedish will be opened at the Virks Gallery in Helsinki in autumn.
Matt Leblank looks forward to coming back to TopGear.
Matt Leblank, director of TopGear TV, said that he was looking forward to returning to the second season of the car show, but admitted that he did not know what was expected in the future.
Nothing is officially happening yet.
"If there is, the BBC will announce it," Leblank revealed with the television critics.
Doubts about the future of "Gases in the Floor!" arose in July, when Leblank's partner Chris Evans announced that he was leaving the show.
After leaving, Evans admitted that Leblank and "Gases in the Floor!" were "as created for each other".
Evans describes the star of the former series "Friends" ("Friends") as a "real and good man", thus dispelling the rumours that the friendship of the two were lost during filming.
When asked what he liked most in the show, Leblankm replied that travelling to other countries, such as South Africa, Morocco and Ireland.
According to BBC, the show in the new 24th season does not intend to replace Evans for the time being.

In 1989 a motorcyclist was born in Dobele district, Naudite parish, and he tried to avoid a dog that ran out of the road and overturned.
He's in the hospital, too.
Last day, 71 road traffic accidents were reported in Latvia, which affected 16 people.
In some places it will rain and become colder.

However, the air will not warmer than +18 degrees.
His interpretation of the U.S. model business behind the scenes has resulted in a perversely sophisticated photo shoot taste and the inexorableness of the horror film.
Basically - a very provocative work of sophistication and banal vulgarity, in which the borderlines between the European art house film and the territory of Hollywood genre product are difficult to draw.
The film with Vigo Mortensen highlights the question of whether the conceptually chosen models of life (ecologies, vegetarianism, alternativeism and isolation from the gluteusity and values of consumer society) bring blessings or destructiveism to their children.
The father of six children, an idealist after the death of his wife, is confronted with questions about the correctness of choices and the true values.
A touching, lively film by Matt Ross this year won the Cannes Festival Award for the Directory.
Of course, sharks do it as they attack beautiful girls - in the jaws it was a swimmer, in this case a brave surfer, represented by Blake Lavley.
The work has required a great heroism from her.
This survival solonum is like James Franco's show of acting in the film for 127 hours, and Ryan Reynolds' game in the film Covered alive.
Perhaps there is also the main role character Mila Kunisa, whose transformation from a sample to a creative resident and a close family value connoisseur seems only to be created by the fantasies of desperate Hollywood scriptwriters.
The Islamic state has captured 2000 civilian populations in Syria.
The Islamic state fighters of the terrorist group, fleeing Menbiga, Syria in Aleppo Province, captured some 2 000 civilians who are used as living shields, announced on Friday by the U.S.-supported Kurdish and Arab alliance and observers.
"We didn't shoot at them because they took civilians with them when they fled to Gerabulus," said Kurds Menbige's Military Council spokesperson.
After two months of fighting, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (QSD), a US-sponsored Kurdish-Arab Alliance in northern Syria, announced on Friday that Menbiz had been liberated from the jihadists.
The Islamic state occupied the Menbuzhi in 2014.
As early as last week, QSD expelled most of the "Islamic State" combatants from Menbig, but some persisted and showed fierce resistance.
On Friday, however, they left the city, taking captives with them.
Islamists are going to Gerabulus, on the Turkish border.
The London-based Syrian activist organisation Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) also reported that the Islamic State kidnapped about 2,000 people.
SOHR reported that Islamists kidnapped the city’s citizens’ cars, forced people to get into them, and then taken them to Gerabulus.
The Islamic state fighters have also committed mass kidnappings in the past.
In January, Islamists abducted more than 400 civilians, including women and children, in the province of Deir az Zoras in the east of Syria.
Later, some 270 prisoners were freed from Islamists.
It is not known how many Islamic state fighters have fled Menbiga.
Press representative of the Kurdish Menbig Military Council reported that QSD managed to rescue 2500 people held captive by Islamists in Menbiga.
Information gathered by SOHR shows that at least 437 civilian citizens, including 105 children, have died in the battle for the death of Menbians.
He killed 299 QSD fighters and 1019 Jihadists.
Kolegova refuses to stand for the post of Head of SRS.
The Head of the State Environmental Service Inga Kolegova has decided to withdraw his candidacy for the post of the Director General of the State Revenue Service (SRS), the Agency was informed by LETA at the Ministry of Finance.
Kolegova points out that discussing her candidacy has increased the contradictions between the ruling coalition parties.
It seems that the real reasons for the discussions are related to the visible but more often invisible interests of politicians and have nothing to do with the assessment of my professional abilities.
"This is also unacceptable to me", emphasizes the applicant for the post of SRS manager.
If her candidacy was confirmed in the government, it is clear that it would not be a convincing vote and it would not allow to fully work and implement the necessary changes to the SRS, feeling the support of the entire government.
Without it, it would not be possible to work fully, concludes Kolegova.
"I have repeatedly emphasised publicly that I do not want to be politically dependent, but now the whole process of my candidacy is too politicised", explains the official.
"Thank you for the trust and support that you have shown me, it is an experience that I consider to be a benefit", in the submission to Reizniece-Ozola, writes Koļegova.
The agreement on Wednesday stated that during the meeting with Kolegov "significant contradictions" were revealed between the candidate's explanations and the information available in public registers about the dividend payments of SIA Pallogs, because publicly available decisions of Pallogs participants' meetings envisage not to distribute profits.
Currently, the Deputy Director General, Dace Grey, is responsible for the management of the SRS.
Livani police are involved in saving two small unattended children, informs the State Police Latgale Region Authority.
A message about an unattended stroller with babies got on Friday around 7 p.m.
They were in Livani near the former shop building.
The two little girls were immediately handed over to the medical staff for help.
There was also a document bag and a mobile phone.
In less than half an hour, the law enforcement found out where the children’s parents could be located and went there.
Upon arriving at the woman’s civilian home, the police found out that the woman was sleeping because she was under the influence of heavy alcohol.
According to the initial information, the woman born last night in 1992 visited a friend where she had consumed alcohol.
While going home after meeting together, the woman has decided to leave her children at the shop under uncertain conditions.
The police immediately informed the orphan’s court about what had happened, which will also decide on the future fate of the children.
The Freeport of Riga has implemented all recommendations of the SAO regarding the Russian island project.
The Freeport of Riga Authority has implemented all of the five recommendations of the State Audit Office (SAO) regarding the development of infrastructure in Krievu Island for the transfer of port activities from the city centre, informed Diena.lv portal in the company.
Approval of the project is planned for the next meeting of the Board of the Freeport of Riga.
In order to implement the recommendations in accordance with the opinion of the SAO, when preparing the necessary documentation for implementation of the recommendations, Riga Freeport Authority was also guided by the conclusions of the legal and operational audit carried out by the international auditor Deloitte Riga Freeport Authority and the recommendations given for improvement of the project management in the next project stage.
Information on the implementation of the recommendations has also been sent to the SAO today.
Despite the fact that the Freeport of Riga Authority does not agree with the SAO's opinion on the feasibility of the Krievu Island project, we are very responsible for the implementation of the project and the provider of funding – the European Commission (EC).
I would like to stress that all the planned construction works under the project have been completed in due time and in the planned amount.
"In order to prove to all those involved in the implementation of the project, including the EC, SAO and also the employees, that the main goal of the freeport is to successfully implement the project, we have fully implemented all recommendations of the SAO regarding the management and supervision of the project", says Sanita Kaire, the project manager of the Russian island.
The long-term action plan for the implementation and monitoring of the project was supplemented with the main planned activities of the parties concerned and the deadlines for the necessary decisions, the definitions of meetings and regular reports and their deadlines, the tools for monitoring the planned construction process, as well as the definitions of the most important border points.
The approved action plan for reaching the project goal by 31 December 2018, in accordance with the recommendations of the SAO, is supplemented with performance monitoring activities, thus strengthening the control of the activities of other parties involved in the project implementation from the Freeport of Riga side.
The project management plan has been re-designed to improve project management and reduce potential risks, defining the project management areas and indicating the developed documents that provide a control and monitoring mechanism for each of them.
Project management organisational chart has been developed to increase project capacity, which reflects the planned structure of project management team, qualification and functions of employees.
In order to improve communication between the Riga Freeport Authority and the parties involved in the project, a project stakeholder communication plan has been developed which, in addition to the parties identified in the project action plan, defines the stakeholders, the principles, types and periodicity of information exchange for the successful completion of the project.
On the other hand, in order to improve control over the use of financial resources, the need for concluding a service contract or launching a procurement contract and the rule of law will need to be further substantiated in future.
Within the framework of the project port infrastructure meeting world standards has been built on Krievu Island - four new deep-sea berths, railway connections, as well as engineering communications.
Constructions co-financed by the Cohesion Fund have been completed and put into operation already at the end of the last year, achieving the expected funding savings of 10.6 million euros.
In Slovakia, security at airports has been strengthened as a result of threats.
After receiving non-specific threats, Slovakia increased security measures at several airports on Friday, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
"In view of the threat, we have stepped up security measures at international airports in Bratislava, Poprad and Košice", AFP informed the news agency on Friday by a press representative of the Slovak Ministry of the Interior.
"The National Security and Analysis Centre is currently analysing the information we have received," he added.
On 16 September, an informal European Union (EU) summit will take place in the capital of Slovakia, with the participation of all the countries of the bloc except the United Kingdom.
The meeting will discuss the consequences of the British Brexit referendum and discuss the future of the EU without Great Britain.
Slovakia holds the EU Presidency until January.
German researchers discuss the number of victims of the Berlin Wall.
According to a new study, the number of victims at the Communist yoke of the former East Germany could be much higher than previously thought, but doubts about the actual number of victims have still not been dispelled.
According to data released on Wednesday by the Berlin Wall Museum Checkpoint Charlie, between 1945 and 1989, 1841 people have been murdered by the western ally zones and later by the Communist authorities of West Germany, who have tried to get out of their controlled territory.
The museum has been studying border-related deaths for years and is adjusting the number of victims from time to time.
This year, 11 more deaths were added to the list, including among the victims a six-year-old boy drowned in an attempt to get his family to West Germany through the then Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
Among the young victims of the Berlin Wall are also the deserters of the Soviet army.
"The ultimate damage caused by the double evil of communism and socialism is not yet fully documented," admits the museum's director Aleksandra Hildebrante.
"Our task is to ensure that the graves of those who died in an attempt to escape from the Communist controlled state are maintained and not lost," says Hildebrant.
But other researchers have already questioned the new figures.
"The figure 1841 is inconclusive", in an interview with the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung claims that Jochen Statt, an expert in the history of East Germany at the Free University of Berlin.
He is currently reviewing, together with other researchers at the Free University of Berlin, the suspected deaths at the border, and so far they have only managed to confirm 260 cases.
Previously, researchers estimated that only the communists murdered 138 people at the Berlin Wall.
In view of the people who died trying to escape the Baltic Sea or to get to the West through the territory of neighbouring countries, the number of victims could, according to Stoat, reach about a thousand.
However, this is still significantly less than 1841.
One of the reasons for the different numbers of victims could be different methodologies.
The Checkpoint Charlie Museum also lists all cases of suicide of the eastern German border guards, whether or not they were directly related to their service.
The museum also lists deaths that are not linked to direct violence.
"If seniors between 70 and 80 years of age died of a heart attack after having contracted border control, this must be the consequences of this "slaughter line", says Hildebrant.
However, Stythos is convinced that a distinction must be made between the old people who may have died as a result of their treatment and those whose death was caused by long waiting in hot weather on a bus at the border.
Regardless of this, it is not easy to track the victims, because the Communist East German authorities did not collect such statistics, and researchers have to find documents in various scattered archives, according to the Utah.
However, the Steat Group has recently found new documents and could therefore come up with a new estimate of the number of victims in the near future.
LPF President Pone went to Rio with coach accreditation; that's a surprise for himself.
The President of the Latvian Federation of Swimming Federation (LPF), Kaspars Pone, has come to the Olympic Games in the last few days with the accreditation of the coach, but he himself is surprised at it.
On Wednesday, a great excitement arose from the comments of German Jakubovsky coach of the Olympic swimmer Aļona Ribakov, who revealed that at the last moment he decided to go to Rio de Janeiro to Pone, while the coach had to stay at home.
Initially the list of riders was approved swimmers Aļona Ribakova and Uvis Kalniņš, coaches Jakubovskis and Dave Collins, as well as the president of the federation Pone.
The Latvian Swimming Federation registered five participants for the Olympic Games, and even before departure Aldons Vrubļevskis claimed that Germans would be and are looking for tickets.
"However, apparently for objective reasons he was not," said Pone, saying that it did not affect the result of Ribakov.
At the request of the federation, Uvy’s trainer undertook to help her.
Pone, who is himself a member of the Executive Committee of the LOC, strongly criticised the LOC’s activities by blaming the organisation supervising Olympic sport.
In my view, it is unethical to confirm five persons to the Executive Committee of the LOC and not to take one of them.
"I don't know why the Swimming Federation didn't have enough seats", Pone said that the work of the Federation and its presidents had not been evaluated in the society, reminding them that the presidents of the Federation do not receive salaries.
Poe also criticised Jakubovski himself, saying that before the London Olympic Games, when Ribakov was not approved among the participants, he complained to the International Water Sports Federation (FINA) and invited Latvia not to send any athletes.
Pone could not tell why he was with the trainer accreditation at the Olympic Games, which most likely had to be Jakubovski.
"I was declared president of the federation ("team leader"), but for unknown reasons I got coach accreditation and now I can't get in anywhere."
The situation changed every day, the number of accreditations available changed.
Until the last moment I thought there was going to be German, because I didn't have any other information.
According to information available to LETA, a few days before Ribakov's start she had a conversation face-to-face with Poni and had tears in her eyes, however, the president of LPF himself said that it was an everyday conversation with the desire to tune athletes before the start.
Pone recalled that LPF oversees five sports in the Olympic programme, and four of them also provide training for children in Latvia.
The President of the Federation said that drowning issues are also very important in Latvia, and he also talked about such programs, while he was in Rio de Janeiro for almost two weeks.
He praised the work of the Federation and said that in 2018 the World Cup could take place in Latvia.
Location in Rio de Janeiro is not my vacation, I work here, I waste my time and I try to carry out four-year programmes.
600,000 young salmon will be introduced into the Daugava River.
During the JSC Latvenergo fish resource recovery program this week salmon and sea trout pups are released at Mangala Island in Daugava, and this year it is planned to introduce more than 600 000 annual salmon and sea trout pups grown in fish farms of the scientific institute Bior Tomes and Doles.
Latvenergo Agency LETA informed that the release of fish will continue for the coming months as well - 6 300 000 juveniles and larvae of various species are introduced into the water bodies of the Daugava basin every year.
In spring and early summer 2016, pike and lamprey larvae will be released, in June - strong, in July - one-summer salmon, in August and September - zanders and vimbas.
Māris Kuņickis, the manufacturing director of Latvenergo AS, told that care about the environment is one of the cornerstones of the sustainable development of Latvenergo Group.
"In measures for the protection and reproduction of fish resources, every activity is focused on environmentally friendly actions in close cooperation with the scientific institute Bior, by both growing and introducing fish juveniles into the Daugava basin and implementing other activities," said Kunickis.
This year more than 600 000 annual young salmon and sea trout will be introduced into the estuary of the Daugava River.
For the second year, juvenile fish are marked before being introduced by cutting off the fat fin.
Today, there are 25,000 juveniles of salmon with an average weight of 31.3 grams.
Each year the release of juveniles and larvae takes place in a scientifically based species composition and in a numerical extent in the Daugava River and its basin water bodies.
The reproduction of fish resources in Daugava and its basin water bodies is carried out by Bior in accordance with the regulatory enactments, based on the expertise of losses caused to fish resources as a result of Latvenergo's economic activities and providing a conclusion on what compensation measures are to be taken in order to ensure the diversity of fish resources.
The State Environmental Service, on the basis of the said expertise, decides on the amount and type of compensation.
The amount of Latvenergo annual compensation in the programme for the restoration of fish resources is EUR 1 035 000.
In the spring of 2016, Latvenergo in cooperation with the association "Mās ziņas" placed 400 artificial fish spawn nest in Daugava near Kaibala and Ikšķile for the fifth year.
Cooperation with the association, promoting the natural spawning of fish, is an additional initiative supported by Latvenergo within the framework of the fish resource recovery programme.
The placement of artificial spawning nests in the reservoir is an important measure that contributes to the protection and reproduction of fish resources in the Daugava.
In the festival "Sançais Concert Hall" there is a rural courtyard, forest, axe.
Sleep in the tent, eat as a restaurant, walk in keeds and listen to exquisite chamber music, enjoying the quiet peace of nature - such a combination is offered by the alternative chamber music festival in Sansau, which is inviting the third summer to Aknīste district.
The festival will take place in the courtyard of the former parish estate, next to forests and fellings.
In three days - from August 12 to 14 - on five stages you can combine a carefree exquisite enjoyment of nature and academic music.
Here music meets theatre and contemporary circus, performances and installations.
Opera and academic music, especially in its latest manifestations, find new listeners in a free and open environment without the stiffness of concert halls.
The distance from here to Riga is about 150 km, but to smile in the face and ease in the legs only a few minutes.
"I asked you not to look for the programme because we deliberately chose not to publish it before, so that people would not go to one particular event or artist, because the real taste of Sansau can only be caught by spending all three days there", invites the initiator and owner of the festival, operabaritons Armands Siliņš.
The goal of the festival is Friday at 17.00, and the first concert is at 19.00.
Of course, there will be software with all the information on the ground.
For those who have to choose one day, we recommend Saturday, because it is the most saturated - from 9.00 a.m. to the next dawn.
"The artists' names are available on the website www.sansusi.lv," says Armands Siliņš.
The magnificent artists' bouquet includes violinist Eva Binder, cellist Kristīne Blaumane, opera star Inga Kalna, clarinetist Guntis Kuzma, trumpetist Jānis Porietis, pianist Reinis Zariņš, quartete Quadra and RIX, and even Estonian aerial acrobat Grete Gross, who together with Latvian musicians Ēriks Kiršfelds, Mārtiņš Zilberts and actress Ancis Strazda have created a contemporary circus performance Confines on the artist's inner struggle.
New works have also been created specially for the festival.
In the performance for children "Kukinis" composed by Oļesja Kozlovska and Jēkabs Nīmanis according to F. Kafka's motifs of transformation, along with Armands Siliņš, musicians and actors will participate entomologist (insect researcher) Uģis Piterāns.
Oskars Herliņš has written the first String quartet, while Anna Kirse - the Opera of the Trees, performance, whose main characters are Andris Kalnosol's director with Katrīna Neiburga's video projections and Andris Eglītis' stage design, which will be trees in three small clusters in the three-hectare clear cut.
By singing with the voices of Laima Lediņa, Dinara Rudāne and Zigmārs Grašs, they will end up in romantic relationships, just like in a study by Swedish natural scientist Kārlis Linnaeus of the Enlightenment era in the tree wedding (1729).
Today, one of the biggest hopes of the Latvian delegation, Laura Ikauniece-Admidiņa, is launching the Rio Olympic Games.
Ikauniece-Admidiņa at 15.35 after the time of Latvia will start the competition in 100 meters of barrier race, but at 16.50 a competition in high jump will be expected.
But already at night for Saturday at 2.35 will begin to push a bullet, while at 4.05 - 200 meters sprint.
The seven-fight race will be concluded on Saturday, when long jumping, specking and a 800-metre race will take place.
Before the Olympic Games, Ikauniece-Admidiņa, who won the bronze World Championship last year, was named as the candidate for the Olympic Games.
In May, the Latvian woman set a new national record (6622 points) and won the second place in the prestigious seven-fight race in the Austrian city of Gecs.
She also participated in the 2012 London Olympics, when she won the ninth place with a repeat Latvian record.
During the last year and a half, the national record has been corrected by the athlete four times.
Today, at 16 p.m., the Latvian judo fighter Artūrs Ņikiforenko, who starts in the weight category over 100 kilograms, in the first round leading the fight with Azerbaijani athlete Ushangi Kukauri.
To Juddiss, this will be at the career of the first Olympic Games.
The agency LETA has already announced that on Thursday in the weight category up to 100 kilograms, the Latvian judo fighter Jevgenijs Borodavko suffered a loss in his first fight.
He gave in to the Japanese Hagu Rjunoski, who later won the bronze.
In 2000, Vsevolods Zelonis brought Latvia the Olympic bronze award, but in the next four Olympic games, Latvian judiths won only one victory in seven fights, which was won in London by Borodavko.
At 16.30 p.m. after the Latvian time, Dainis Upelnieks will start a qualifying booth shooting competition, but the selection will be concluded on Saturday.
Upelnieks received the Olympic sign only on the day when the composition of the Latvian delegation was officially announced, however, later he revealed to LETA that he had been quite safe for driving since April.
The athlete arrived at the Olympics as one of the first Latvian athletes, trying to make the most of the training opportunities in the shooting field.
At 19.05 p.m., the final three trips will be made by the debutant of the Olympic Games, Kathy Birzule, a 17-year-old Latvian sailor who competes in sailing for sailboards in RS:X class.
After three days or nine trips Birzule totals between 26 athletes is currently located in 25th place.
On Saturday, the finals of the medals will take place.
Today, it is finally planned to conduct the competition in academic rowing, where the Latvian national of Ireland Sanita Pushpure must participate.
The competition was cancelled on Wednesday due to adverse weather conditions.
Puspure will compete at 19.10 in C/D semifinal single ladies, fighting for the 13th place in the Olympics.
On Tuesday, in a quarterfinals, she won the fourth place from the third position, which would allow her to continue the fight for the medal, behind a mere 0.65 seconds.
Puspure won the 13th place in London four years ago, when she also represented Ireland.
Today, the Olympic Games will be divided into 24 medal sets - arch shooting, athletics, cycling, riding, jogging, jumping, judo, academic rowing, shooting, swimming, tennis and weightlifting.
Reid claims that if Clinton is elected to the office of President, she will appoint Garland as the judge of the Supreme Court.
The leader of the Democrat Party of the Senate, Harry Ryd, is convinced that if she becomes president, she will nominate Merika Garland as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
The Republican Party of the Senate has blocked Garland's approval since March, when he was nominated by President Obama.
The leader of the majority of the Senate Mitch Maconnel announced that the next president would choose who would replace the current judge of the Supreme Court Antonina Skalia.
On Thursday, during his conference, Ryd announced that he was convinced that Clinton would choose Garland.
Reid’s representative later stated that he had not personally talked to Clinton about this subject and that it was just speculation.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to swing the boat with a different choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the U.S. District Appeal Court of Colombia.
Raid said that the Republicans blocking Garland's nomination are "particles" and act in the interests of Donald Trump, a candidate for President of the Republican Party.
He also said that Trump was not suitable for the work of the President.
Treats announces a naked photo calendar for women and men.
The magazine Tract will work with photographer David Belmer to create the 2017 calendar in Pirreli style in the 1970s.
In their 2017 NU Musa calendar, it is planned to demonstrate the new supermodels, not naked celebrities.
At the beginning of this year, Steve Shaw, president of Tracts magazine, announced that his erotic art magazine was different from the old-fashioned Playboy, because "Playboy is a male magazine".
This magazine is for women.
Looks like he's also talking about a calendar.
In the press release about the calendar, Shaw says: "We have to return to the picture of an unfailing and classic nakedness, where the woman's body does not confuse, but inspires both women and men."
Women will want to participate in this project, because it is a great work of art.
Models can be sent in electronically or personally during chesting sessions in Los Angeles and New York.

Greenland shark is the longest-lived vertebrate - video review

Sharks explorer Julius Neilsen says that the long - lived record belongs to a female, which could be between 272 and 512 years old and 5 metres long.
The French court rejects the request to demolish shops in the "Junglu" refugee camp.
The French court rejected the request by the authorities in Calais to dismantle dozens of self-made shops and restaurants in the "Jungli" camp, where several thousand refugees live.
At the court hearing in Calais this week, the authorities indicated that the State would have to dismantle 72 self-made shops, where people sell various goods in the camp area, such as cigarettes and energy drinks, offer hairdresser services, tea for 50 cents (40p) and simple meals for some euro in self-made restaurants.
The Prefect Office in Kale pointed out that these self-established companies should be dismantled because they form the shadow economy and do not pay taxes, as well as create fire and sanitary risks.
The representatives of the humanitarian group explained to the court that these small enterprises are essential, because the food provided by the government and support groups does not meet the needs of the camp, in which the number of residents continues to increase.
They also pointed out that self - fashioned shops and restaurants often offer free shelter and food to those most in need.
The Lille Court ruled that there is no legal basis for expelling people who have created 72 self-made shops, but it understands Kale's prefect's concerns.
Justice Jean-François Molla said that food, coffee and restaurants play a greater role than simply providing food to people who live in "extreme conditions".
He pointed out that these places were peaceful places of meeting for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places at risk of demolition is the camp cafe "Jungle Book Kids", which provides more than 200 free meals a day, English and French language lessons and provides advice on asylum issues to hundreds of vulnerable minors without adult escorts.
More than 170 000 people have signed a petition on the protection of a children's cafe.
The letter addressed to the Guardian states that the abolition of the cafe "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old."
On Friday two charitable organizations "Help for Refugees" and "L'Auberge des Migrants" announced that the number of residents of the "Jungļu" camp has increased to 9,000 people, which is the highest rate since the rapid influx of migrants in the summer.
Great Britain wins the silver rugby-7 series when Fiji's state unit masterfully fights gold.
The impressive performance of the British national team in the rugby-7 series ended on Thursday when, in an exciting final at the Deodoro Stadium, Rio, the Fijian national unit convincingly destroyed them with a score of 43:7.
Fiji demonstrated a masterclass in the management of the ball, the ball plays with its foot, the support game and the brutal force game, fighting gold, the first Olympic medal in its history.
The defeat brought a great prize of consolation - the silver medal, which was Britain’s third medal that day. The British team can be proud of its success in the first Olympic rugby-7 tournament in which they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The hard fight in the semifinals, in which the Boxing team was defeated with a score of 7:5 in the first half of the day, probably played back to the UK finals.
But in any case, Fiji's team is now in its best form to win a team of 15 men.
Although unlikely, some consolation for Britain might be the fact that at least one British won a gold medal. It is the main coach of Fiji's team Ben Ryan - a former English coach from Wimbledon.
It was an exciting adventure for Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's leadership, they lost all the games in the rugby-7 series stage in Adelaide.
This time they lost only one game.
The defeat is painful, but growth is amazing.
Fiji impressively started a match by reprimanding Britain’s power for joy.
Captain Tom Mitchell and his comrades were hitting several opposite buses and the World Series champions took the lead at 5:0 when Osea Kolinisau got the first landing.
In the last four minutes, Jerry Tuwai also increased the predominance of the landing in the right wing.
The result of 12:0 and the British team had not even touched the ball.
Michelle’s superb power did not allow the huddle Leon Nakarava to gain three points, but it had little effect on Fiji’s outcome.
In the seventh minute of the game Jasa Veremalua got a landing in the right corner, strengthening the predominance of Great Britain by 17:0.
After the overplay, Nakarava further increased the predominance and had stayed for more than a minute... at the end of the first half-time.
Vatemo Ravouvou avoided some clumsy British forces and crossed the line, winning points.
The landing provided a result of 29:0.
Fiji seemed to be born to play in rugby-7 machos while the British were still studying.
In fact, that is true.
The British team made profound changes in half-time, breaking the Fiji player line... four full minutes, which was good at the first half-time standards, until Joshua Tuisov, after a fantastic team game, scored a few more points for the Fiji team.
Dan Norton managed to score points for the British team by landing in the left corner and scored 36:7, but the game was already lost, while fans of South Sea islanders sang, waved flags and danced in podiums.
Fiji’s happy attitude cannot be admired.
Mata Viliame made Fiji’s victory even sweeter with another landing at the end of the game.
After the end of the game, Fiji was able to celebrate, but the British were able to sit down in the grass after their defeat.
In the first half of the day, Fiji won Japan with a score of 20:5, while the British were superior to South Africa, where in a very fierce battle both teams won the ground and the South Africans lost only a few points.
In the first half of the year, Kyle Brown led the boxing team, while in the second half, Dan Norton crossed the line with brilliant skill and delivered the ball between the poles, ensuring the victory of the British.
Markus Watson, the brother of the English rugby-15 team player Antony, provided the team with a victory and another silver medal at the end of the game.
The coach's fight with cancer has been inspired by Helen Glover and Heter Staning to win the rowing race.
It will be the most emotional gold medal in these races, and it is already expressing a lot.
From the first to the last beat, Helena Glover and Heather Stanning’s golden moment played a special role in the Estacio da Lagoa track.
Although there are only two athletes in the boat, they were accompanied by the echo of Robin Williams, who inspired them to win the second Olympic gold medal in rowing couples for women, becoming the first women in British sports history to achieve such success.
They were undoubtedly dominating, because for the 39th time they won an unparalleled, unprecedented victory.
Both excellent athletes with the elegance of the swan glide on the surface of the water do not fully reflect this triumph.
Behind each gold medal, there is a team working hard to continuously improve the performance of athletes, and the greatest contribution to their success was made by a trainer who, 30 months ago, did not know if he would experience this day because he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to him, it disappeared as quickly as it appeared.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of those that can and did operate.
If not, it would spread throughout the body.
And the situation would become out of control.
It changes your vision a little.
William's cancer was discovered in December 2013.
This trio was lucky that William could start the recovery procedure at the beginning of the 2014 mid-season and reduce the duration of the break to a minimum, if you can say so.
I needed income, so I had to recover quickly.
This stimulated recovery.
I was in the hospital and took distances of 6, 10, and even 15 meters, although the doctor said that a few steps would be sufficient.
It all started.
Airing itself is a challenge, but this time it was even bigger.
After the victory, the first idea immediately was about Williams, who was very worried all morning and spoke more than usual under the influence of excitement.
Staning, who has served in the Royal Artillery Unit in Afghanistan, said: "This was an emotional week, but it means a lot to me."
This only confirms how much it means to us and how much I, Helen and Robin have worked.
The three years with Helen and Robyn have been great.
Without Robin we wouldn't have achieved anything, so huge thanks to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I can't imagine a better training companion or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost any race in five years.
The couple reach speeds that the competitors cannot compete with.
Even in the last 500 metres, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover were too high.
We felt every moment.
Helen shouted, "Keep the rhythm, keep the rhythm."
It is really important not to lose concentration.
We succeeded in a good start, but at the same time we did not have high expectations.
That day, we didn't have the intention of overthrowing the records, but just rowing well and winning the race, and that's what we did.
A couple of years will rest to decide what to do next.
The next month will be the wedding of Glover and TV adventurer Steve Bashal.
For the time being, she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean this was my last race.
That would have been too much pressure.
It took me about six months in London to understand that I was the Olympic champion.
It was a new experience and I was very worried.
This time it took about four minutes.
She said, "The feeling is fantastic."

Kolegovu will be "directed to the last" in the post of the Head of the SRS.
According to him, now Prime Minister Maris Kučinskis (Green and Farmers Union) and Minister for Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Green and Farmers Union) are already "principially important" to approve the candidate Koļegov as the Head of the SRS.
Rajevskis estimated that both Kučinskis and Reizniece-Ozolas in this government approval of SRS manager is the "first big decision" that can affect their future as politicians.
If now begins to change the position of the candidate for the post of Head of State SRS, this will have a negative impact on their image in the state administration.
The agenda of the next meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers includes the issue of transfer of the Head of the State Audit Office Kolegova to the post of the Director-General of the State Audit Office, according to the government agenda.
Koļegovs was promoted to the post of the Head of the SRS by Minister of Finance Reizniece-Ozola after Ināra Pētersone resigned from the management of the service and when the competition for the post of the SRS Director General ended without a result.
In an interview with the Head of the SRS, Dace Grey on Thursday, August 11, admitted that if she was offered to stand for the Head of State, she could agree.
The Minister of Finance admitted that he did not consider other candidates for the post of Head of SRS for the time being.
Raivis Dzintars, Head of the Saeima faction of the National Association, also acknowledged that the NA is still supporting Kolegovs under the supervision of the SRS.
In Spain, the possibility of reducing the budget deficit is threatened by the failure to form a government.
On 12 July a month ago, the European Commission (EC) found that Spain and Portugal had not taken sufficient measures to bring the deficit level down to the 3% of gross domestic product (GDP) required by the euro area.
Estimates show that despite the austerity measures implemented, Portugal's budget deficit was 4.4% of GDP at the end of last year and 5.1% in Spain.
The European Commission decided, however, not to impose economic sanctions on both countries, but at the same time to set fiscal targets for the next few years.
One of the reasons why the EC did not introduce sanctions against these two countries is the growing Euroscepticism in many countries of the European Union.
Additional sanctions would only increase such a negative mood.
Critics point out, however, that the EC is not consistent in its decisions by agreeing from the outset on uniform rules and then failing to apply them in practice.
For example, the President of the German Bundesbank, Jens Veidmann, has pointed out that Europe is losing confidence in itself in this way, giving citizens the impression that the rules of the European Union are recommending rather than binding.
The EC has now proposed and approved by all Member States to extend the deadline for correcting the deficit until the end of this year for Portugal and until 2018 for Spain.
The European Commission promises to examine the progress made by both countries in the coming months, while at the same time pointing out that both Spain and Portugal must be prepared to introduce additional austerity measures if circumstances require it.
Initial forecasts indicate that the target for Portugal could be reached in due time and that the budget deficit could drop to 2.5% of gross domestic product already this year.
This means that under the Stability Programme, this country's government must implement austerity measures amounting to 0.25% of GDP this year.
These measures should be included in the budget for this year, with an additional focus on the control of the cost of purchasing goods and services.
In the case of Spain, the situation is much more complex.
This year the budget deficit should be reduced to 4.6%, next year to 3.1% and in 2018 to 2.2% of GDP.
Moreover, in the next two years, consolidation measures should amount to 0.5% of GDP each year.
The fact that Spanish political parties have not been able to agree on the formation of a government for eight months now makes it particularly difficult to achieve these objectives, and it is becoming more and more likely that Spain may have to hold early parliamentary elections for the third time in a year.
However, opinion polls show that the third elections would not change the political picture in the country substantially.
The most popular party is still the popular party led by the current Prime Minister, Mariano Rahoy, whose elections would again receive less than 33% of the votes.
Only the socialists have increased their popularity slightly, while the popularity of the political parties "Podemos" or "Together we can" and "Ciudadanos" or "Citizens" against austerity measures has slightly diminished.
The People's Party wants to get the Socialists and "Ciudadanos" involved in the government this month, otherwise it will not be possible to adopt and submit the draft budget for 2017 to the European Commission for approval by mid-October.
As stated by Rafael Hernando, a representative of the parliamentary faction of the People's Party, if the government fails and the parliamentary elections are held for the third time, Spain will become a laughing stock across Europe.
The cleanliness of beaches in the Gulf of Riga is critical.
After surveying beaches for the fifth year, activists concluded that unfortunately every year there is an increase in the number of waste found, and most of the bathing sites are blamed here.
The most polluted bathing areas are located in Riga.
The City Council explains that bathing areas are cleaned every day, but it is difficult to fight dirty visitors.
In addition, waste left on land during rainfall can be flushed into water, thus significantly impairing its quality.
Apart from the Liepāja beach and certain places in Kurzeme, beach cleanliness elsewhere in Latvia is critical.
This is the announcement made this week by volunteers from the "My Sea" campaign.
During the fifth year of walking along the Gulf of Riga, activists concluded that the amount of waste left by the population has increased every hundred metres.
Unfortunately, this year this critical assessment has come into being.
"We see that this will be the year when the amount of waste on the beach 100 meters may possibly even exceed 200 units", says Jānis Ulme, representative of the expedition "My Sea".
The Latvian Radio called, he was on the beach of Tūja, where the voluntary march along the Gulf of Riga continues.
This year, activists have had to collect even fluorescent lamps left in the sand of the sea between various household refuses and the remains of picnics.
The participant and organizer of the tour Ulme says that it is the inhabitants who are responsible for the pollution.
"The main source is the beach visitors themselves, because more than half of the total waste is plastic, different waste, starting with bags, plastic pieces that are already in the process of being broken down, they can no longer be identified, and for fish, bottles, corks," says Ulme.
Among the dirtyest beaches are also bathing sites in Riga.
For example, in Daugavgriva almost 800 waste units were collected on average every hundred meters, which is a critical amount.
The organisers of the campaign also explain that almost every step of the campaign is tossed and warning or prohibition signs are not located everywhere.
"The average figures for all three bathing areas of Riga together - Daugavgrīva, Jākelļļļi and Vecāķi - unfortunately come large and far beyond the desired goal, which Latvia is moving towards, to reduce the number of waste units to 135 units by 2020," concludes the environmental defender.
Bathing in Riga takes place every day, even twice during the hottest days of summer, explains the representative of the City Council Uģis Vidauskas.
Still, it is difficult to deal with unclean visitors.
We are returning to the cultural issue of these people.
"Those who fertilise, drink alcohol, smoke and do all those things that cannot, even special signs don't work," says Viduskis.
Viduskis therefore invites bathing visitors to report pollutants to the police as well.
You can call the police, safely point to these violations and thus fight all.
There may be some new warnings, but, as I said, it is hardly going to change the situation radically.
"As everyone together simply has to turn to and be intolerant of such offenders," he stresses.
Meanwhile, water quality measurements have already been carried out for the fourth time this summer by the Health Inspectorate, which may impose a ban on official bathing areas.
This year, like other years, water quality is good and satisfactory everywhere.
The current situation is that all 56 bathing sites have always had good water quality and no restrictions on bathing.
"For the last time, we'll take the analyses at the end of August," says Normunds Kadikis, Senior Environmental Health Officer of the Inspection.
Waste left on land during heavy rainfall can be flushed into the water.
This in turn can affect its quality, says the environmental specialist.
Rotations in the Russian elite continue - change of leader in Putin's administration.
Did he leave his job himself?
Vladimir Putin has announced to Russian media that Sergei Ivanov himself wanted to leave this position and will henceforth be the special representative of the President for nature protection, ecology and transport.
Putin commended Ivanov in front of television cameras for the changes: "Honor Sergej Borisovič, we have been working together with you for many years and we are doing it successfully."
I am satisfied with the way in which you carry out the duties entrusted to you.
I remember well that we have agreed not to use you in this position of head of the presidential administration for more than four years.
That is why I understand your desire to change the scope.
And I hope that you will make full use of your knowledge and experience in your new role as well.
However, it is highlighted that the leadership of the Presidential Administration is a very important position and that it made Ivanov one of the most influential people in the country.
In view of the forthcoming elections of the State Council in Russia next month, rumours have been made that this step is linked to the fight for power in the Russian political elite.
Ivanov was also called a possible replacement of Putin in the post of President, therefore the statement that he himself wanted to hold the post of President of nature protection and transport has created doubts.
According to the archive of Lsm.lv, Ivanov is the general member of the KGB and the Federal Security Service.
Ivanov has been an ancient and close ally of the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin.
He started his career in special services in 1975, where he met Putin.
Later, when Putin became Head of the Federal Security Service, Ivanov became his deputy.
At the end of the reign of the first Russian President Boris Yeltsin was appointed Secretary of the Russian Security Council.
In 2000, after Putin came to power, Ivanov's "Information Security doctrine" was approved, which included the revitalisation of state censorship mechanisms in Russia.
In 2001 Sergey Ivanov became Minister of Defence of Russia, but already in 2005 - Deputy Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov and was responsible for the development of Russian defence industry companies and arms exports.
Now, after leaving the office of Head of the President's Administration, Ivanov will also retain his place in the Russian National Security Council, where the new Head of the President's Administration, Vaino, will also work.
Blano comes from the family of the Soviet party in the elite.
The post of Head of the President's Administration is said to have been recommended by Ivanov himself.
Anton Eduardovich and I have been known for a long time.
Another time we worked under your leadership in the government.
And for the last almost five years, we have been in contact practically every day.
"That's why I'm sure that by all professional and personal characteristics he is ready for this work", said Ivanov.
Blano comes from a family that belonged to the elite of the Soviet party.
His grandfather Karl had high positions in the Estonian Communist Party, including ten years up to 1988 as its first secretary.
The online edition "Meduza" with reference to the book "Estonian Self-Determination and Independence" writes that at the end of the 1980s Karl Vaino asked Moscow to give permission to use force against demonstrators.
However, he had been refused and soon lost his post.
Shortly after that, Vaino has moved to Moscow.
Anton Vaino has graduated from the Moscow Institute of International Relations and manages the Japanese language.
However, he has left the diplomatic service to serve in the administration of the President's minutes.
It has already been reported that the removal and even arrests of several high-ranking officials have shaken Russia in the last weeks, including the replacement of governors and federal representatives of several counties.
According to political scientists, President Vladimir Putin rearranges the ruling elite before the elections in 2018.
One of the main features is that power structures are increasingly being represented in leading positions.
The judo fighter Ņikiforenko also loses in the first fight of the Olympic Games.
This was a fight in the first round, and the Latvian judo fighter has finished his participation in the Olympic Games in 17th place.
Coach Oleg Baskins admitted to Latvian Television that there were very few expectations of Nikiforenko, and that was already clear before the competition.
He also discovered that the judo fighter had suffered a shoulder injury.
It is noteworthy that in order to get the Olympic sign, Nikiforenko had to start in a different weight category than usual - that is, in a weight category of up to 100 kilograms.
The Azerbaijani wrestler was 25 kilograms heavier.
As reported earlier, Jevgeny Borodavko stood for two and a half minutes in a weight category up to 100 kilograms against Rjunosuki until the opponent succeeded in a pure victory.
Consequently, Latvia has finished the judo race in Rio.
Dreams disappear in Rio's sand.
Jewdist Yevgeny Borodavko entered the Thursday.
Yes, he had a more titled opponent in front of him, but the ambitious can sometimes surprise.
He didn't get it.
Artūrs Ņikiforenko's task was even more complicated, because the experience is smaller and the opponent is also respectable.
The result is similar, even though he stayed on the tatami for almost a minute and a half longer than Borodavko.
Unfortunately, in recent times, Latvian judithists have the greatest lack of ambition.
Since Gunārs Ķirsons and his financial studio Vladimirs Šestakovs, Aleksandrs Jackevičs left Latvia, "Golden Score" is no longer taking place.
Jackevich, who consults the Kazakh judists here, and Vsevold Zelony doesn't see the heirs.
But if he doesn't grow, neither will he.
And that's the prerogative of the federation.
Therefore, as from another galaxy in "Rīta panorama", the President of the Latvian Judo Federation promised Rio to win medals.
Flight far from reality.
In the evening we were eagerly waiting for the beach volleyball match Samoilov/Smediņš - Evandru/Pedru Solbergs.
Intriga as the "death" group - losers are out of the game.
The Latvian duet, however, had a small derogation - it could also be lost, but not more than with four points in two sets.
The tension was added to the long-standing previous game.
No one wanted to die -- this feeling over the windy court was all along the length of the match.
The gusty wind created additional challenges for the players.
At first, it seemed to be an ally of ours - which is more comprehensive -.
But he didn't.
It was easy enough to play against the Latvian duet here.
Serve to Samoylov and wait for him to burst.
Against Canada broke, the first set and the third start broke against Cuba, because the load was no joke.
Smediņš could fish at that time, because there was little work, but when he was, he did it for honor.
The Brazilians Samoilov and Smédins could win two sets, because the first took the lead at 16:15, but on 16 they also stayed, drawing the lost point limit.
But it could also be lost by 0:2 because the deficit in the second set was -4, but also thanks to the wind, we managed to win.
The third one was already on Evandri's serves.
A chain was formed - the inconclusive Serve, the second pass often flies too close to the net, and Samoylov left very few options for an effective attack.
If there was a stranger to the Cubans Samoilov in the square, this time he was more successful, and it would be unprofessional to bring the loss to Sasha.
The Krail was wrong, too, and it is symbolic that he hit the last bomb in the block.
Lost the team.
This time, there was certainly a lack of success: in the third set alone, two attacks by Evandro almost flew out of the court, but the ball hit the line.
Two aisles were next to the line.
The controversial episode also led the video to the advantage of the opposers.
If Evandro was tormented with servés in the first two games, they were very productive against ours.
All aggregated in the loss on the tabloid.
Now the causes of failure need to be examined calmly.
Perhaps it was like living next to a stadium, not with a delegation in the Olympic village.
Two and a half hours went by.
Perhaps a little overconfident was given by a series of seven semifinals.
Maybe Klagenfurt shouldn't have been played, but sooner come here and better acclimatise.
Maybe there was a mistake in finding the top of the athletic form.
For now, more questions than answers.
The games are over for our Buddhists.
The dream of medals is over.
What's next?
There are still a few World Cup tournaments left, and also Jurmala's "Masters".
Smédins and Samoylovs have never been or will not be friends in their lives, because there are too different personalities.
But that's not necessary either.
When the dream of the Olympic medals has collapsed, the idea of divorce may also arise, because blame will be sought not only within itself, but also in a partner.
It is not difficult to decide, but it will be much harder to find a worthy partner in Latvia.
Both brothers play the bee, but John and Tom have already tried and divorced, while Mikhail Samoilov is still too green to begin conquering the world's peaks.
You can try Harald Regze, Aleksandr Soloveja, Edgars Toča to return to Mārtiņš Pļaviņa, but it will not be better than this option, which proved itself more than once during the World Cup stages.
Copacabana sand didn't smile at them this time.
And that's it.
Of course, it should also be taken into account that beach volleyball is becoming more popular, new pairs are entering the circulation, and only the few have a height of less than two metres.
It does not guarantee success yet, but it is an important argument in the fight for victory.
Ours don't stay longer.
Both athletes and journalists have the opportunity to live in the venues offered by the game organisers, as well as to choose their own.
The U.S. basketball team lives on a cruise ship, some tennis players do not stay in the Olympic village.
Also, some beach volleyball players have found a hotel in Kopakaban.
This time, rather modest accommodations offered to journalists were subject to very excessive prices.
That's why the choice fell on the apartment rent.
The risk is, because sometimes they can be uncomfortable from a logistical point of view.
This time the risk is justified.
Together with Vladimir Vladimirovich we rent apartments on the Copacabana-Ipanema border.
The beach is 200 meters away, a pool arena half an hour's walk.
The district is safe enough, because the favelas are far away, but vigilance must not be lost here either.
Vladimir Vladimirovich, though, is not what some think about right away, but the most professional sports journalist in Russian media Vladimir Ivanov.
P.S. It looks like another medal dream was dreamed up on Friday morning.
Laura Ikauniece-Admidiņa stayed behind her personal records in the 100-metre obstacle race and high jumping.
But there are still five disciplines.
After a 10-year break, "Porgy and Bess" sounds in Liepaja.
In Latvia, the opera "Porgy and Bess" was first studied in 1973 at the Latvian National Opera.
Since then, the internationally recognized masterpiece has not been repeated.
That is why the organisers of the Cēsis Art Festival and the Liepaja Art Forum have decided in close cooperation to give the audience an opportunity to enjoy George Gershvin's masterpiece.
"We are very pleased that after a ten-year break, when Liepaja was last able to enjoy the opera production, this great version of George Gershwin's "Porghie and Bess" opera concert studio is to be enjoyed with us in the new, newly opened concert hall "Great Amber", says Baiba Bože, head of the concert hall "Great Amber".
Opera "Porgy and Bess" is a vivid musical language story about love, its volatility, passion, as well as everyday tragedies and simple everyday pleasures.
It reflects the African American vitality, music and rhythm.
It is precisely this lack of political correctness in this opera, this exclusion of tolerance makes it so alive.
"And yes, this love story is extremely powerful, extremely beautiful and in some way really deep", says the director Viesturs Kairišs.
What I like most - listening to or playing this opera - are always such stops - famous melodies, famous motifs, but these transitions from one character to another, illuminating one person or another person, or choirs, or orchestras.
"It's the most exciting, this building," the opera is appreciated by the music director and conductor of the opera "Porgy un Bess" concert studio Andris Poga.
Visitors to the opera agree that this is a grand event.
They are very pleased to hear this world famous Guershin Opera.
Blessed is that Liepaja can feel the breath of the world.
"Execution professional", opera appreciated by visitor Edgars Lāms.
The concert was special because for the first time the orchestra played at the New Open Concert Hall "Great Amber" and for the first time the opera concert performance took place.
The square next to the renovated building of the Art Museum could be named after Janis Rozentāls.
Riga Vice-Senior Andris Ameriks announced at the opening of the Rozentāls anniversary exhibition that the museum's own address in the future could be not Krišjāņa Valdemāra iela 10a, but Janis Rozentāls laukums 1.
The director of the museum Māra Lāce admitted that re-registration of the address will result in a considerable bureaucratic burden, however, overall this idea is welcomed and therefore accepted the proposal of the municipality.
The city of Riga has laid a kind of foundation stone for this idea in 1936 by creating Burkards Dzeņa monument to Janis Rozentāls, who is standing next to the museum.
Vilhelms Purvītis, then director of the museum, was one of the initiators of this monument.
In this way, this further action could be purely logical.
But Wilhelm Purvītis, where are we going to put his name?
"But if you promise to think, Mr. America," said Lace.
After extensive reconstruction and modernisation, the National Museum of Art officially opened its doors this May.
This week, the reconstruction of VEF Culture Palace will finally begin.
The castle will be restored by SIA "Velve" by approximately 11 million euros.
It is planned to renovate several castle rooms, including two spectator halls, as well as to adapt the building to people with reduced mobility.
Riga City Council intends to raise six million euro of European Union funds for the project, however, Oleg Burov, the Director of the Property Department of Riga City Council, admits that for the time being, the project has not yet been fully clarified by European funds.
"Despite the fact that the political will to start repairs at the VEF Culture Palace involving the European Structural Funds is, we are waiting for months for a decision, real action from the officials of the Ministry of Finance, it will be given money or not", says Burov.
Last December, we were told that everything depends on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance received a letter from the European Commission that you are making your own decision that Brussels is not taking a decision here.
Now we see another round of discussions emerging, so we will see what we can expect in the coming days.
"I would like to say that the Riga City Council undoubtedly guarantees that this process will be started and completed within the deadlines", points out Burovs.
As reported more than a year ago, in March 2015, VEF Culture Palace collectively organized a farewell concert before the immediate renovation of the building.
Although a year later, the renovation of the building had still not started and collectively continued to work under inappropriate conditions.
In the strategy of the Property Department of Riga City Council the renovation of the VEF Culture Palace is divided into seemingly independent reconstruction works, where each will ensure the implementation of different functions of the castle.
First - increase of accessibility of VEF Culture Palace and improvement of surrounding territory.
It will arrange the surroundings and engineering communications, as well as restore the facade of the building.
The second is improvement of the VEF Cultural Palace service offer.
It plans to restore the interior, walls and ceiling of the building, improve the stage and sound recording studio, as well as arrange the internal engineering communications of the building.
Third - Improvement of working conditions of creative amateur collectives, which includes plans to improve workshop equipment, room heating and ventilation systems.
Before the 40th anniversary of "Līvu" you can get acquainted with the legendary rock group at the exhibition in Liepāja.
The exhibition will feature various objects characterising "Līvus" - photographs arranged in a time line to reflect the group's activities from the beginning until 2010, when the group's activities are announced.
Participants will also show stage costumes, musical instruments, awards and concert recordings, as well as other things not yet seen to the general public that reflected the creative activities of the group "Līvi".
The exhibition will be supplemented with items from the Liepaja Museum collection.
The visual design of the exhibition was created in collaboration with the fashion artist and painter Elita Patmalniece.
Musicians, who have been associated with the group "Līvi" and their relatives, also responded to the call and shared both objects and memories.
The origins of "Līvu" can be traced back to 1972, when a vocal instrumental ensemble was created at the Liepaja Culture House, which was led by Juris Pavelols.
In its original composition, the ensemble participated in the festival "Liepājas amber" in 1972 and 1974, as well as in the views of the city and republic.
In 1976, the fateful meeting took place, when Juris Paujols got acquainted with Ēriks Ķiģelis and Metalurgs in the culture palace founded a group, inviting to join Ingrīda Gutmanis, Andris Krūzins and Jānis Grodums.
Over the years, the composition of the group has appeared more than once.
Participants have joined, others have gone their way, some have returned.
Above all, however, the desire to confirm that Latvian rock music is able to live and exist has remained unchanged.
"What to see was not lacking - jeans, hairy and bearded, these boys differed considerably from the stereotype of the generally accepted stage singer", says music spectator Klaas Vāvere about the group.
In addition to the musicians mentioned above, such outstanding musicians as Igo, Vilnis Krieviņš, Modris Sterns, Valdis Štarks, Laimis Racenājs, Tālis Pusbarnieks, Ainars Virga, Aivars Brīze, Guntars Mucenieks, Dainis Virga, Tomass Kleins and many others have worked in the band.
Entrance is free of charge.
The exhibition is open from August 19 to October 30.
On August 27, Liepāja Concert Garden "Pūt, winds" will host "Līvi" 40th anniversary celebration "Līvifest 2".
For the first time in 8 months, Bulgaria is experiencing inflation.
In July, Bulgaria's national statistics posted 1% of monthly inflation.
This is the highest since 2012 and the first above zero since October of the previous year, when it was positive (0.2%).
Average annual inflation after PCI, in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016), compared to the previous year, was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 was 101.9% year-on-year and the average monthly inflation was 1.0%.
Since the beginning of the year the inflation rate was -0.2% (July 2016 compared to December 2015) and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016 prices for the following groups of consumer goods were rising: food and soft drinks (1.7%); transport (1.8%); entertainment and cultural events (6.3%); hotels and restaurants (1.2%); household goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and footwear (2.2%); home appliances, household appliances and regular house cleaning (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the previous month's level for alcohol and tobacco, management, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Zbigniew Stankevich: The time is coming, and the truth is rising.
In an interview, Zbigniew Stankevich, Archbishop of the Latvian Catholic Church, emphasizes that if we want to gain strength for life, we must put the Gospel message at the centre of it.
For the power of the truth is greater than that of evil.
Many are already on their way to the celebration of the ascension of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Aglona.
What message will believers receive this year?
In recent years, the pope’s Nuncia has expressed a desire to conduct the main worship in Aglona.
Hence, the main message lies in his hands.
The fact that Bishop Jānis Bulis is leading the Cross path has also turned out to be a kind of tradition.
He will also form his own message.
I've been conducting the day before the Christmas Gyrilia church service.
Last year I turned to Pope Francis' encyclical "Laudato si" and updated the common house, Earth's theme in the context of Latvia.
This year... Of course, I'm watching what's happening in the world, and I try to respond to it in my speech.
My approach coincides with the church's suggestion that the Gospel message should be put at the heart of life.
It must be shown that the Gospel answers the most painful problems of a person's life and gives him inspiration for a further journey.
Then it speaks to people.
But in Cesis, in the Campus discussion, you said that "you must return to the understanding of the full man".
What do you mean?
Does this mean that a person is turning away from the church message?
And does the church have the resource of such a return today?
The capital of India robs a dying man on the side of the road.
In the capital of India, no one seems to be aware of a man killed by death on the side of the road - it turns out he's slept for an hour on the side of the road and then he's still robbed, informs the BBC.
A man identified as Matibule was reported to have been driving a rickshaw during the day and working as a guard at night.
At 5:30 a.m., he went home on the road when he was hit by a car.
The camera record shows that the driver got out of the car to look at the victim, and then he left.
After an hour, when no one seems to know of the bleeding man, he was robbed by a garnazz.
About 90 minutes after the hit, the police arrived on the scene and the victim was taken to a hospital where he died of injuries.
When withdrawing his candidacy to the position of the Director General of the State Revenue Service (SRS), Inga Koļegova, the Head of the State Environmental Service, has saved the government from falling, considers Ojārs Skudra, associate professor of the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Latvia.
The interpretation of Kolegov regarding the withdrawal of the candidacy in connection with the contradictions in the ruling coalition is due to the fact that she has prevented the fall of the government.
In a conversation with agency LETA said that it was hard for him to imagine that next week at the government meeting "Unity" would support Koļegova's candidacy.
Consequently, if the Unity Ministers voted against, but Kolegov would still be approved in office, this would lead to the resignation of the government.
The expert also considers that prior to the announcement of the withdrawal of the candidacy Kolegova has consulted both the Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola and Prime Minister Māris Kučinskis.
At the same time, it was also a concession to "Unity", which strongly opposed her candidacy.
When predicting whether a suitable candidate could be found through the competition, Skudra admitted that there are two options: either a compromise figure will be selected or the institution will continue to be chaired by Dace Grey as the executive director of the office of Director General.
At the same time, he points out that if the Minister of Finance had so far argued that no other candidate was being considered, it was a hint to the Grey that she should not participate in the competition.
LETA has already announced that the Head of the State Environmental Service Koļegova has decided to withdraw his candidacy for the post of the Director General of the SRS.
Due to the "Unity" objections, the government postponed the approval of Kolegova as the Director-General of the SRS on Tuesday for a week.
After the decision of the government to postpone the decision, Kolegova confirmed that she is still ready to become the Head of the SRS.
Later, however, her thoughts were changed: in her application to the Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola, on Friday, she points out that she withdraws her consent to the transfer to the post of Head of SRS and this is not an easy choice for her.
The press secretary of Prime Minister Māra Kučinskis Andrejs Vaivars explained to LETA that a new competition will be held for the vacant post of the Director General of the SRS.
An accident in the centre of Riga involving a police car.
In the center of Riga this afternoon there was a road traffic accident involving the State Police car.
The police car with on-board sound and light signals has rushed to the highest category call until Krišjāņa Barons and Dzirnavu Street crossroads with another car.
The police explain what happened, but preliminary information shows that the second vehicle has not missed the police car.
There's a woman in an accident.
This year, the population in Riga has decreased
At the beginning of this year there were 638 784 inhabitants in Riga, which is 0.34% less than in 2015, when 641 000 people were officially registered in the capital, LETA was informed by the Central Statistical Bureau (CSP).
In terms of population, the capital of Latvia ranks 30th among the capitals of the European Union (EU) countries and the large cities with a population of more than one million.
According to the EU's statistical office "Eurostat", Riga has the highest proportion of women – the capital of Latvia is in the first place among the largest cities in Europe, with 127 women per 100 men.
The three Baltic capitals have the highest proportion of women in Europe’s largest cities: in Vilnius, they are 123, and in Tallinn, 121 women per 100 men.
A warning pictogram shall be provided at the LNMM.
In the next few days warning signs will be placed near the Latvian National Museum of Art (LNMA) - pictograms, the representative of the Property Department of Riga City Council Baiba Gailīte informed LETA.
Currently, the repair of the museum glazed atrium damage caused by skateboarding has been successfully completed.
Warning pictograms will be placed near it in the next few days.
Its inhabitants will be told that the surface can be slippery during rain and snow, and it should not be used by cars, bicycles, roller skates, or skateboards.
Ušakovs also wrote about this in the social network Facebook at that time, who pointed out that no damage to safety does not cause, but "sees impure", and skateboarders "will come to chase".
Holidays for children and parents - New playgrounds for children have been established in Riga.
During this summer season, Riga Municipality has installed two more playgrounds in the city, Ķīpsala and Čiekurkalns, which are already available for children.
On the beach of Ķīpsala there is a large, multifunctional toy vessel with various climbing elements, bridges, games, pipes and slides.
The playground is for children of all ages.
The field is also equipped with swings and different balancing elements.
The world of Fantasy is brightened by the attraction of small sailors on the coast of Daugava with a view to the passenger port and cruise ships there.
In the playground between the 4th and 5th cross-lines of Ciekurkalns there is a playground, a trampoline, a step track, a balance bridge, swings, toy balls and other elements of the game, as well as a gymnastics area with rings of strength and coordination trainings, parallels and other elements of sports.
Under the field lies rubber cover in various colors.
A new, colorful pavement was inserted from the street to the playground.
The honey discovers the reconstructed road section.
The Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis, the management of SJSC Latvian State Roads (LVC), as well as representatives of construction companies SIA "Binders" and local governments today opened the reconstructed state main road border Russia (Grebņeva) - Rezekne-Daugavpils-Lithuanian border (Medumi) (A13) section from Medumi to Lithuanian border (156,4-163,05 km).
Roads are the country's business card, especially border roads, so it is particularly gratifying to discover a reconstructed section on the border with our southern neighbours.
This is another example of the improvement of the situation on the main national roads due to the co-financing of European Union funds.
"As the forecasts show, during this planning period the available funds will be acquired already in 2018, and we have to think about how to continue maintaining the most busy roads in very good quality, and also to ensure mobility of the population in all regions of Latvia without European Union funding", Uldis Augulis stressed by cutting the symbolic tape.
The Minister of Transport also pointed out that proposals prepared by traffic experts on sustainable financing of Latvian roads in the near future will be presented to the government.
Construction works in the period from Medumi to the Lithuanian border (156,4-163,05 km) were started by SIA Binders last year and this year they were continued after the technological break.
The cost of reconstruction is €13.5 million (including VAT), the project was co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
"On the reconstructed road section, the road construction has been completely restored and next year repairs will be started in the next stage from Medums to Daugavpils itself, thus the whole road from the Lithuanian border to Daugavpils will be arranged," said Jānis Lange, Chairman of the Board of the LVC.
The country's main roads are the most congested, and by 2018 we intend to ensure that all the main roads in the country are in good condition.
The next task will be to maintain them in good quality, ensuring timely periodic maintenance and replacement of asphalt top layer every 7-9 years.
"It will, of course, require adequate funding, and all travelers look with hope at the proposals made by the expert group to improve the road financing system," noted Lange.
Road connections and lighting have been arranged within the project in the Hunting Centre.
Significant land works have been carried out: in four stages large-scale dedusting and massive churning and embankment works, the longitudinal profile of the road has been evened out, which has so far been very uneven.
Public transport stops have also been re-established and a turning point for public transport has been re-established.
Previously, the road had insufficient bearing capacity, and the terrain was not transparent because of mountainous valleys, as well as the old road of common terrain.
In the next construction season it is planned to restore the road section from Daugavpils city border to the now reconstructed section (144.80.-156.40).
This year, the LVC plans to perform works of different types more than 1100 kilometres of national roads.
Information on all planned repairs on the national road network is available on the website of the LVC www.lvceli.lv.
"To achieve the desired weight reduction results, the right choice of food mixes is crucial", says Lithuanian dietologist Laura Romerate-Kuklieriene.
In addition, it is easy to do it during the summer period, when our own gardens grow fresh fruits, berries and vegetables.
A well-considered combination of dietary products can help not only to reduce overweight, but also to promote various body processes in a targeted way.
Macaroni and vinegar are a successful combination as they provide a long lasting satiety and help fight fat.
Studies published in the European Clinical Dietary Journal have shown that vinegar has a beneficial effect on blood glucose levels and helps us to feel perplexed.
Cayenne pepper and protein - rich food, such as poultry or protein cocktail, not only makes you feel satiety, but also reduces the craving for large meals at the next meal.
Such a combination of foods can also increase the amount of calories burned after a meal up to 35%.
Studies have shown that Cayenne pepper can help to get rid of the layer of fat in the abdomen.
The egg contains a protein called choline, which stimulates metabolism, while paprika is a good source of vitamin C.
Adequate intake of these nutrients can reduce cortisol levels and thus reduce the accumulation of fat around the middle body.
Oat flakes with fresh berries are another delicious and fat - burning meal for breakfast, which is worth including in your menu.
Oat flakes and berries contain fiber, which, according to Canadian scientists, controls the sense of grelin - an appetite-stimulating hormone - and thus also hunger.
The berries also contain polyphenols, which help to reduce weight and prevent the formation of fat.
Vegetables and proteins can also perform miracles in weight reduction.
Such a combination can create a feeling of satiety.
Vegetables contain water and fiber, so they contribute to the feeling of satiety.
At the same time, proteins slow down the digestive process and provide a feeling of satiety for longer.
For lunch, you can eat chicken with salads or make a protein cocktail from the finished mixture and enjoy it with your favorite vegetables.
Avoid what product combinations.
Fruits contain sugars - monosaccharides or disaccharides - compounds of one or two molecules.
On the other hand, starch in vegetables is a polysaccharide.
Fruits decompose mechanically in the stomach, while chemically they do not decompose until they reach a third or fourth degree in the digestive process that occurs in the intestine.
Starch divides into three different stages, which begin already in the mouth.
Therefore, it is important not to eat sweet food immediately after a meal.
When eating sweet food immediately after a meal, it is "blocked" in the stomach along with other dishes, where it is not chemically digested and begins to blow.
Do not eat bread, potatoes, peas, bananas, dates or other products containing carbohydrates together with lemons, limes, oranges, grapefruits, pineapples or other sour fruits.
The enzyme ptialine, which is found in saliva, works only in an alkaline environment.
In addition to inhibiting the digestion of carbohydrates, fruit acids also stimulate their fermentation.
Do not eat eggs and meat, nuts and meat, cheese and eggs or cheese and nuts, meat and milk, eggs and milk or nuts and milk and similar combinations of protein-rich products per meal.
Their processing requires different digestive juices, each of them with different strengths, characteristics and time to reach the stomach.
Watermelon, honeymelon, muskatmelon and other melons must always be eaten separately from other foods.
Melons are not digested if they are present in the stomach with other foods.
Fat in combination with protein-rich products.
Fats form a successful combination with starch, however, the same cannot be said of fat and protein - fat prevents the digesting of protein.
Proteins can be combined with a very small amount of fat.
If high levels of protein products are consumed, avoid total fat intake.
This also applies to the freshing - it is not recommended to combine large amounts of nuts (contains protein) with healthy avocados (contains fat).
Such a combination hinders effective weight loss.
How to cook?
"Food preparation, heat treatment leads to a significant loss of nutrients - about 15% to 55% of the initial nutrient content of the products", says nutritionist.
In most cases, nutrients go to waste, cooking foods in water.
However, the nutritional value of some foods increases directly by boiling.
It is recommended to use the remaining liquid after cooking to prepare the soup - in this case you will not lose any nutrients left in the water and you will be able to eat them later.
It is advisable to cook vegetables, including by steaming them.
Thermal treatment significantly increases the bioavailability of lycopene contained in tomatoes.
By boiling tomatoes for 30 minutes, the amount of lycopene increases by 25%.
Thermal treatment also significantly increases the bioavailability of betacarotene found in red, yellow, orange plants such as tomatoes, carrots, sweet potatoes and spinach.
Heat treatment of eggs and meat removes the natural properties of the proteins contained therein, making them easier to digest.
Heat treatment of meat and eggs also makes iron and other minerals contained in these products easier to absorb in the body.
It should also be borne in mind that freezing products may reduce the amount of vitamin C from 10% to 90%, while freezing fiber does not affect it.
Beans in combination with tomatoes can increase iron intake in the body, which in turn provides better brain and muscle function.
Our body absorbs up to 33% less non-blood-producing iron found in plant products such as beans, leaf greens, cereal products than blood-producing iron found in animal products such as beef, fish and chicken.
You can greatly increase the absorption of non-blood-producing iron in the body by eating non-blood-producing iron-containing products together with vitamin C sources such as oranges, tomatoes and berries.
Vitamin C helps to change non-blood-producing iron so that it is more easily absorbed by our body.
Iron is needed for the production of hemoglobin, which provides oxygen delivery to the muscles and brain.
To get maximum benefit from the salad, add to them healthy fat, such as olive oil or linseed oil.
When preparing sandwiches with salmon, add vitamin D to rich salmon or sardines, which is a good source of calcium.
Vitamin D increases the amount of calcium absorbed by the gut and plays an important role in bone formation.
Oats (as well as other whole-grain products) together with sources of vitamin C, such as strawberries, blackcurrants, raspberries and other fruits or berries, help to stabilise cholesterol levels and avoid blockage of the arteries.
Snapchat "Anime" effect is criticised for Asian caricure
Snapchat representatives say that this filter is inspired by animation, but some commentators argue that it is racistly insensitive.
With this lens effect Snapchat allows 150 million users to change reality in a rather absurd way on a daily basis and to play with their identity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or an image that fits in Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Lens are foggy, image-distorting instruments that generate more than 30 million modified selfies per day.
Any error shall quickly become apparent to the public.
Snapchat's lens effects have been criticised in the past, when they receive accusations that the application promotes too black or light shades of facial skin as a benchmark of ideal beauty.
This week, new lens effects were published that allow users to create dissects of eyes, teeth and round cheeks, and some critics called it a racist Asian cartoon – “yellow face”.
The question was also asked as to whether such contradictions did not suggest that the company had greater problems with diversity.
News and public accidents flared up on Wednesday when the publications "The Verge" and "Motherboard" announced that the effects of lenses had been removed from the application.
The company explained that the objective of the lens is to portray Anime images, not to cariculate people of Asian descent.
However, for those who have experienced racism, these effects resemble painful stereotypes.
Others categorically denied the parable of Anime.
Korean-American art student Grace Sparapani Twitter's entry on the images gained a wide resonance. In an email she indicates that the effects of the lens are "anointing and uncomfortable, to say the least".
She added that it was hard not to notice the obvious similarities between Asian cartoons and lens effects.
This indicates that the lens effect is not just a yellow face, but a yellow face in the sense of racism.
Snapchat is not the only company that has fallen into this cultural trap.
American culture is also involved in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from business meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices we use on a daily basis.
And Snapchat's large youth audience, which represents different races, unlike the elderly, is more sensitive to such things.
If Snapchat lenses create an image that offends users, then "Today such things don't go unnoticed", said 25-year-old Katie Jou in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, the product manager of the company “Medium” Jou deleted his Snapchat application and advised others to do the same.
In her article "Medium" and a telephone interview, she explained that in her opinion the problems with race are due to Snapchat's employment policy, which does not sufficiently support racial diversity.
Jou criticised the management of the company, which consists mainly of white men and then concluded his article with the reference #DeleteSnapchat.
"It means that there is no racial diversity in the company, so such decisions are allowed. Does the company work in some other races, but they do not hold such a position as to be able to express their opinion safely and comfortably", says Chinese-American Jou.
Others share her view, but Snapchat has not responded to her complaint.
The company does not disclose the number of employees represented by different races, indicating that it is a private company.
Snapchat refused to discuss the origin of its employees, but its representative found that the company had hired a staff specialist who would focus on the presence in the company of racial minorities, who were not widely represented and would facilitate inclusion in the company.
On the other hand, Jou will not renew his Snapchat account, adding: "It is interesting whether they really need more users like us to understand that this is wrong."
The Congress Chamber announces that the reports on the Islamic State have been distorted by military officials.
In a statement issued on Thursday, the Congress Chamber states that the U.S. Central Command has distorted the reports, portraying a war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria more optimistic than is actually the case.
The Central Command Intelligence analysts express their general dissatisfaction with the provisional report of the Task Force set up by the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Republican Representatives of the Defence Financing Sub-Committee, stating that their leadership controlled reports on American progress in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as Centcom, is a military base in Tampa, Florida, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The latest news on this report shows that the intelligence reports, endorsed by the senior leaders of Centcom, reflect the US's fight against terrorism more positively than it actually is. The facts were regularly distorted to represent better results than other intelligence analyses show.
Ken Calvert, a representative of the Republic of California, says: "Centcom's behaviour is unacceptable - it is our soldiers who suffer when our policy makers receive false messages."
Centcom's management errors can be found in the organisation's top management.
This 10-page report shows in detail the problems that exist in the coverage and analysis of the Central Command of American efforts to prepare the Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although it does not provide conclusive evidence that senior officials of the Obama administration have distorted the reports, it shows that Centcom's leadership has put some pressure on analysts to reflect a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic state (also known as ISIS or ISIL).
The report indicates that in the first half of 2015, press releases, statements and reports from the Central Government showed the situation to Congress in a much more positive light than it was in fact.
For example, Centcom's representatives publicly announced that Mosul's recovery operation could start as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul is Iraq's second largest city, still under the control of the Islamic State.
The representative of the Kansas Republican Party, Mike Pompeo, says in his report: "A series of months' investigation clearly confirms this."
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the US central management chief officials distorted the reports, depicting ISIS threats in Iraq weaker than they were in fact.
The Republican Party set up a working group to learn that analysts are concerned that information about the Islamic State is distorted.
As the investigation continues, the report published on Thursday will be followed by new findings in this case.
The General Inspector General of the Ministry of Defence investigates Centcom's intelligence activities.
Members of the Democrat Party of the Intelligence Administration Committee made their own report public on Thursday, in which they agree with some of the conclusions of the Working Party of the Republican Party.
In his report, Democrat spokesperson Adam B. Shif reported that from 2014 to 2015, Centcom too limited the preparation of intelligence assessment reports in relation to ISIS and Iraqi security forces.
Mr. Shifa explains that this process "stopped the dissemination of information", aggravated the ethics of analysts' work and "displaced facts that were not in the truth."
But Shif and Democrat members added that there is no evidence that White House has put pressure on Centcom analysts to produce reports according to "pre-defined or political position".
The Daily Beast published on Thursday the preliminary results of the congress investigation.
In August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon General Inspection launched an investigation following complaints from Centcom’s analysts.
The spokesperson of the Pentagon, Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, announced that the Pentagon would not comment on the report of the Congress until the investigation continued.
He also added that experts sometimes interpret complex data in different ways, and the Ministry of Defence and the Intelligence Authority call for a constructive dialogue on vital national security issues.
The investigation is not limited to the question of whether the American-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is successful (a statement made by an increasing number of representatives from the Ministry of Defence).
But last year's accusations call into question whether President Obama can fully rely on reports from the Central Government on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hotspots.
Criticism of Islamic State Intelligence resembles more than ten years old events when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study claiming that George W. Bush's administration initiated the Afghan war, thinking too little about its possible consequences.
Hoooker also played an important role in the discovery of the Islamic State's intelligence issue.
Last year, official representatives reported that Hoooker's team found that, in contrast to public reports, air raids at Islamic State oil plants did not significantly worsen the financial situation of the terrorist group because they had built temporary plants to sell oil on the black market.
The Times of September reported that this discovery did not go beyond the walls of Central Management.
So General Lloyd Austin III, commander of Centcom, received sharp criticism because many law-makers believed that war reports described the situation too positively.
In April, General Austin retired, and General Joseph L.Wotell took his place.
In the US duel with Britain in a women's field hockey, wins the US, thereby winning the fourth in a row.
A day after winning over Japan with a score of 6:1, on Thursday Katie Bama scored the first two goals for the US women's field hockey team when Americans beat the Indian team with a score of 3:0.
Five goals in two games are an unforgettable achievement, but 27 - year - old Bama said that she could not remember or that she would ever have succeeded.
She said, "I have no idea."
I am not one of those people who count their goals.
But she knows that the American score at the Olympics is 4:0, which gives them a tie with Britain in its band, which on Thursday after winning over Japan at 2:0 remained unwinned.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday to play the last match in the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals and the game will determine only which team will take the first place in the group of six teams and whose second.
The winner of the first place will avoid a meeting with a strong Dutch team leader for the second group for a little longer.
In spite of the Saturday game, American women have already called a storm of surprise, taking the last place in London four years ago among the 12 teams.
That team also had Bama.
She grew up in Blubel, she first took a field hockey blackjack at the age of 3 (her older twin sisters were already doing this sport in Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16, becoming the youngest player in the history of the team.
She didn't go to the 2008 Olympic Games because she didn't get to the finals.
But 2012 was a failure for her and her team.
The following year, the Englishman Craig Parham was appointed as a team coach and everything changed for the better.
Bama called it "cultural, mentality and physical change."
We did not invest as much in London as we do now.
We have changed everything.
In Thursday's game Bama revealed the result by getting the goal in the first half-time with a rear pitch from a close distance.
India started the game without winning in his account, but their selection was very fierce and kept a minimum score of 0:1 until the end of the third period when Bama repeatedly scored the goal.
She introduced a ball into the anti-inflammatory zone on the left side of the field, then she managed to get to the middle of the field and send the ball into the anti-inflammatory goal, putting the American woman at 2:0.
In the mid - fourth period, Melissa Gonzales scored another goal.
This was the first U.S. Gatekeeper Jackie Briggs dry game, each of the first three games running through one gate.
She's running in.
And so does Bama.
"We're going very well right now," said Paham, but how good will show the game on Saturday.
The most depressing food of the period of depression is "The Fatal Meal"
In March 1933, shortly after being elected president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down in an oval room to have a meal.
President Roosevelt liked such fine culinary delicacies as goose liver pâté, or fuagra, and Maryland turtle soup.
But that day his meal was much more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato porridge and dessert - plum pudding.
Jane Ziegelmane says, "It's a way to show solidarity in cooking with people who were very hard to deal with."
Her husband, Andriew Kou, adds, "It's also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
A couple of Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
In Kou's last book "Garden stew" describes Chinese cuisine in America, but Ziegelmane in her book "97 Abeles" describes life through food at the rental house in the eastern lower part of Manhattan.
Their new joint work "The Fatal Meal," published by the publishing house Harper on Tuesday, is the story of American food during the Great Depression.
Showing some solidarity in cooking, they held a meal together the reporter "Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop", a simple lunch-dinner, located in the Flatiron district and operating since 1929, when the great depression began.
Mrs. Ziegelmane, aged 54, ordered a sandwich with processed cheese and chopped olives, and 57 - year - old Kou ordered turkey, potato porridge, and vegetable salads.
When the reporter ordered the false hare, the couple admitted that his choice was very appropriate for a conversation about the Great Depression Food.
Mrs Ziegelmane told me that the counterfeit rabbit was very popular.
There was a peanut bunny, a liver bunny, and a bean bunny.
They were made from basic ingredients and other ingredients that enriched the meal.
Imagine what it's like to eat as many peanuts as they are for lunch.
Mr. Kou gave off.
"Surely it seemed that the belly was full of lead," he remarked.
In the predicament years, the American lunch table was similar to the Swedish table, especially in rural areas.
Women prepared meals for their husbands-workers and breakfast, at lunch and dinner were served freshly prepared cookies.
During World War I, the Americans sent food to Europeans. "The Fatal Meal" describes how the Americans adapted to the circumstances when America was suddenly no longer a land of abundance.
"At that time, food became the main focus of the American people's daily life," said Mr. Kou, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write exactly on this subject.
The new budget diets became equally important: such unknown foods as the counterfeit bunny and stew became everyday, stews were "a great way to use surpluses," noted Mrs. Ziegelmane, because the cooks could hide the unattractive ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit.
Meat, which has been the main ingredient of American meals for years, has now become an extremely rare luxury commodity.
At a time when the number of calories and the nutritional value of the food were more important than the taste, new, unseen formations were born.
In an ancient cookbook, Mrs. Ziegelmane found a recipe for making onions filled with peanut butter.
Mr Kou adds: "It wasn't a popular lunch-table supplement."
Mrs Ziegelmane says, "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and fried onion are incompatible.
Many recipes of home food adapted to difficult times.
Household economists such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Household Economy, from 1923 to 1943 determined the country’s eating habits that had not been experienced before or after the Great Depression.
By publishing articles and recipes in newspapers and magazines, they suggested that housewives become "economics" and accept such challenges as turning the pasta and carrot mix into a delicious meal.
"The Fatal Meal" is a feast of historical delicacies.
Particularly interesting is the evidence of the government's attitude towards its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "let me eat cake" attitude.
Although he spoke publicly about his simple childhood and meals in Iowa, he actually ate as a fine millionaire that he had become.
Mr. Kou says, "She liked European cuisine, like a fish with a cucumber sauce."
He ate in a nearly gold-plated living room wearing a lunch jacket.
He was completely taken away from reality.
President Roosevelt would have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, hadn't told him to set an example with his eating habits.
The book tells us that Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who did not learn how to cook, so White House became a place "where not only was served one of the most unflavoured dishes in Washington, but also the worst prepared dishes".
As the country’s economy recovered, most of the culinary practices of the depression era disappeared.
But we continue to pay attention to calories and nutritional value, as well as how to apply science in cooking, added Mrs Ziegelmane.
A couple say that when writing the book, they gained a better understanding of Mrs. Ziegelmane’s mother’s eating habits, for example, why she could not throw her food out.
"She was really afraid to throw out the food," said Mr. Kou.
Mrs. Ziegelmane said, "She actually ravaged people."
There was an incident with wind cakes once.
After we had eaten at Eisenberg’s dining room, the writer’s couple pulled out a dessert made at home — a plum pudding that President Roosevelt used to eat at lunch.
"It's a plum cream," said Mrs. Ziegelmane, adding that at the time it was a common habit to give chic names to modest dishes.
It is free of foam cream, only prunes, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone was impatiently soaking the spoons in the brown mass on the plates.
Surprisingly, it was not that bad.
Mr. Kou ate a few more bites.
Sounding like an experienced "economicist," he said to his wife, "A pinch of hazel nuts."
Gilead will receive reimbursement for legal expenses in the fight with Merck for Hepatitis C patent
The district judge has decided that “Gilead Sciences Inc.” has the right to be reimbursed for legal services paid by it in the case on termination of hepatitis C patent against pharmaceutical company “Merck & Co Inc.”
In June, Gilad was fined 200 million pounds for breaking two Merck patents, which threatened it with the successful Sovaldi and Harvoni tablets, when the US Federal Judge found violations of Merk's practices, such as post-promises lies and other unethical practices.
In the hearing of the case on Thursday, U.S. district judge Beth Labson Freeman pointed out that Gilead has the right to claim compensation for legal expenses incurred in defending it in the present case.
Merck is trying to gain a position in the market against Gilead, which dominates the market with the new generation of Hepatitis C drugs, which are effective in 90% cases of liver disease.
The case was started already in 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other in an attempt to acquire ownership of the newly developed active component sofosbuvir, which is the main component of Gilead medicines.
The US-sponsored forces claim to have taken full control of the city of Manbija from the Islamic State.
The US-sponsored forces have taken full control of the city of Manbija in the northern part of the country on the Turkish border and the last Islamic State soldiers have left the city, announced the group's representative on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) are now cleansing the city from the last opposing fighters who have not yet left the city.
They have freed more than 2,000 hostage-civils captured by the combatants, told Reuter news agency Sharfan Darwisch of SDS's ally Manbige Military Council.
"Now the city is under our full control and we search for fighters," he informed Reuters.
In 2015, Clinton income reached 10.75 million dollars and the couple paid the 34.2 percent federal tax rate.
On Friday, Hillary Clinton released the 2015 tax return, which shows that the candidate for President of the Democratic Party and her husband have earned USD 10.75 million this year and paid the federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent.
During 2015, Clinton has donated 1 million US dollars, mainly to his Clinton charity. Former President Bill Clinton earned about 5.3 million dollars by performing as a speaker and the former Secretary of State has earned 3 million dollars from his book on work in the State Department, published in collaboration with Simon & Schuster.
Clinton's election ally, Tim Kane, U.S. Senator of Virginia State and his wife, Anna Holton, have published their tax return for the last 10 years.
They paid a federal tax rate of 20,3 per cent in 2015.
"Hilary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set new standards of financial transparency", said Jennifer Palmiere, partner of the Clinton campaign in her statement.
Donald Trump, on the other hand, is hiding behind various pretexts and reservations so that he does not have to comply with his promises to disclose tax information.
Disclosure of paid tax information is a record practice for US presidential candidates, but it is not required by law.
The New York businessman Trump and his lawyers mention the State Revenue Service audit as a reason not to disclose tax information.
"Your move", in his Twitter record, about the tax information of a candidate for the Democratic Party was reported by Clintone's campaign partner Ians Sams.
On Thursday, special adviser to Trump Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish tax information before the audits had been completed.
Trump's critics, including Mits Romny, the presidential candidate of the 2012 Republican Party, and other Republicans, claim that his refusal raises questions about his real estate, donations and other commitments to his business, including commitments to Russia.
Clinton poured oil into the fire by publishing a video on Friday, where several influential Republicans request Trampa to publish its tax information.
She returned to this question again during an economic speech on Thursday in Michigan.
She said to the crowd: "He refuses to do what other presidential candidates have been doing for decades."
Politico says that in the 1990s Tramp has paid very little or no taxes for two years, and on Friday, the business columnist of the New York Times reported that many accountants and lawyers believe that nothing has changed.
Federal tax rates are an important issue in this presidential election.
Clinton, in support of the proposal by the billionaire Varena Baffett, promotes the idea that everyone who earns more than 1 million dollars a year should pay a tax of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports this proposal.
Last week, during Klinton's speech in Omah, Nebraska, where his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is also located, Babeph invited Trump to exchange tax declarations.
Buffet said that he too is being audited by the Revenue Service and Trumps is afraid of the electorate, not the tax authority.
The Clinton campaign has released tax information up to 2007.
Clintons now live in Chapakva, New York and have paid an average federal tax rate of around 32 per cent and a total tax rate of around 40,5 per cent between 2007 and 2014.
The 2015 Clinton Tax Survey shows that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income is a salary.
Their main investment was the low-cost index fund from which Clintoni received $109.000 in dividends.

Jewish film director criticises the hotel in Berlin for turning off Israel's long-term negotiating code at the request of an Arab - RT News
The French film director of Jewish origin has caused a storm in social media when he discovered that there is no Israeli long-term conference code available at Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin.
Claude Lancman, documentary director of the Holocaust "Shoah", did not hide his dissatisfaction with the Berlin Kempinski Bristol hotel and addressed an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his recent visit, Lancman tried to find Israel's long-term negotiating code on the hotel's list.
However, the country was not included in the list of countries to which you can call directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible that in 2016, in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel has been wiped out and destroyed?
It's Lancman.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol Hotel offers to call the country through its call center.
The Director requested an explanation from the hotel staff.
Lancman writes that the answer he received "was shocked."
The hotel administrator explained that "this is a conscious decision of the hotel management".
The reason for the code was even more infuriated by the film director.
"Most of the guests are Arabs and they requested the deletion of the Israeli code," Lancman quotes the hotel employee's explanation.
Sudddeutsche Zeitung states that Israel's Ambassador to Germany, Jakov Hada-Handelsman, called this case "a big shame".
We are surprised and shocked by this incident.
That in itself is a great shame.
And the fact that this has happened precisely in Germany is an even greater humiliation in this hotel network.
No explanation required.
The official said: "We hope that the hotel will draw the right conclusions".
This event also received a rather wide resonance on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.
Others believe that the Kempinski hotel was simply natural for Arab customers.
Another record said "feel," stating that the hotel is located on Kurfurstendam Street next to the synagogue.
Der Spiegel says that the hotel itself has quickly rejected all the accusations, stating that all of this is a "misconception" and apologies to Lancmann.
"We have not received a direct order to remove Israel from the list of country numbers," Sudddeutsche Zeitung quotes a representative of Kempinski.
And adds that the code was again added to the list.
The police use rubber bullets and tear gas to protesting Brazilian students.
The clash between students and the police took place on Thursday in São Paulo, Brazil, where students gathered in a demonstration against reforms of the government's education system.
The police used rubber bullets and tear gas to students.
Problems began when the law enforcement authorities tried to expel students, which resulted in the use of rubber bullets and tear gas by the police.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to show their dislike for the reforms of the education system.
The proposal by Governor of São Paulo Geraldo Alckmina is to close almost 100 public schools, while 300 000 students will be relocated to other schools with the aim of saving money.
Some demonstrators drew graffiti on the walls with messages against interim President Michael Temer.
This protest took place only a few days after the previous protest, when the students gathered in demonstrations with the aim of expressing their support to the suspended president, Dilma Rousefa, whose impeachment was voted for by the Senate.
Scott Kelum Skinner is the first to finish, bringing a gold medal for cycling to Britain
Calum Skinner from Scotland finished the first men's cycling team in the sprint race in Rio last night. The British team protected its title of champions that it won in London in 2012.
The 23-year-old athlete from Glasgow played an important role in this race, making the legendary Scottish, Sir Chris Hoy proud and winning the favorites of New Zealand.
Four years ago, Britain won an amazing victory when Hoi won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they also repeated it at the World Championships in London, even though Hoy had already finished his career as an athlete.
The problems were in the stage between the Beijing and London Olympics, as they had to replace the experienced start specialist Jamie Staf.
They did it at the last minute.
When Hayes left, Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill his seat.
The British coaches had hoped for Skinner, seeing his potential in him, which he later proved.
Hinds, Kenny - champions who participated with Hoy and Skiner four years ago, who set the Olympic qualification record, but the race was better for the New Zealand team.
However, the British trio won gold medals.
The Hindus were close in their lap, Kenny took the lead, and Skiner guarded the lead.
The change of strategy played an important role in the victory, as Hindus drove more gear to allow Kenya and especially Skiner to drive faster.
Hoy watched the race as a representative of the BBC and caught the eyes of Skinner, Kenya, and Hindus when they climbed on the podium.
A 23-year-old Glasgow said, "It was an unspeakable honor."
I'm doing everything to defend my name.
In the final we set the Olympic record and won the World Champions.
It was simply unbelievable.
There's no better victory.
After winning together with Kenya and Hoy at the 2012 Olympic Games in London, Hinde confessed that she deliberately fell on the track after a failed start.
Later, he refuted this comment and British competitors were unable to prove the contrary.
There were no such incidents this time.
Hinde said: "The British flags on the stands brought London to mind."
Over the last 3 months, we have become a united team.
We have lost so many World Championships, so the victory at the Olympic Games was really special.
One medal will race for a country that won seven of the ten gold medals for cycling in Beijing and London.
If this achievement is an indicator of the team's progress over the last five months, then the next five days will be very exciting.
Given Kenya's result, he could really repeat Hoy's success by winning three Olympic gold medals.
For Kenya, this would mean six gold and one silver medal. In addition, Kenny was born on 23 March (it seems to be a British holy date, since Steve Regreiv, Mo Farah and Roger Banister were born on that day).
Hoy was born on that date.
Kenya's next race is a sprint that starts today and will continue for the next three days.
A 28-year-old athlete from Bolton said, "Now I just enjoy it all.
Team ride is always the best.
Because then you can win with your teammates.
To be honest, it's a little lonely to win alone."
Hinda said, "If he gets two more gold medals, he should be appointed as knights."
On that day, it was the only fight for medals, but it was not the only good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggin, Ed Clensey, Steve Burke, and Ovein Doul showed the fastest qualifying time for four.
Their time was 3:51.943
The world record that was set in London in 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and the final will take place today in the second half of the day, where Vigins will definitely be the focus of attention.
Yesterday before his qualification trip, he had a disagreement with the Commissariat when the judges summoned him to measure his height.
On the women's journey, which will continue and end today, Laura Trot, Joanna Rowsel Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milngavia set a new record time of 4:13.260.
The British delegation hopes that the British cycling team will win medals in the middle of the Olympic Games.
Recalling the excellent and unprecedented performance in Beijing and London, everyone expects the same achievements in Rio.
In the meantime, the technical director Shane Saton resigned, and Hoy and Victoria Bendletton graduated from their careers.
However, at the beginning of the first cycling race, it seems that Britain, as always, will reach its highest level at the right time.
The future of the Portland Cemetery is becoming uncertain because an ambitious treaty has been terminated.
The future of the aluminium smelter and hundreds of its employees in Portland, Victoria has become unclear, as its main customer of energy company has announced the termination of cooperation.
This statement is based on the Victorian government's plans to stop subsidising the energy company, which is vital for the company to continue working.
20 years of subsidies will be discontinued in November.
As a result, more than 2000 jobs at the Alkoa Portland plant are at risk.
Up to 2 000 direct and indirect jobs could be at risk.
In addition, it will also have unpredictable side-effects, as the smelter consumes about 10 percent of all Victorian electricity supply.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry Cemetery, which led to the disruption of the Anglesea power plant.
The Alkoa Portland Cemetery is loss-making and can be closed.
This has been the result of several years of speculation on the appreciation of the Australian dollar and the cost of production.
The plant’s energy supplier AGL, which supplies energy from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latroubes Ileja, says that the other three owners are also likely to terminate their contracts.
The majority of the power plants are owned by Alcoa and Alumia joint venture, and in addition the shares are owned by the Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp holding companies.
"AGL" looks forward to continuing the Portland plant, which would mean a further supply of energy to the mine," said its representative.
AGL announced that the treaties are so-called "risk restrictive agreements" to enter into force as of November 2016.
The contracts have a period of validity of 12 months and will therefore remain in force until 2017.
AGL plans to receive revenue from these contracts also in the fiscal year 2017," said the company's representative.
As of fiscal year 2018, the potential impact on profits is limited by favourable market forecasts for future wholesale electricity prices.
AGL claims that it has already calculated losses of 187 million dollars in its forecasts, provided that these contracts will be terminated.
Alcoa states that the decision to terminate the contracts will not affect Alcoa's ability to continue its operations or supply it with energy.
The U.S. company reports that in 2010 it has concluded a contract with “Loy Yang” for 20 years, but in November it will be discontinued. The company does not provide any explanation why it will cease cooperation.
Analysts have expressed concern about the possible closure of the Portland Cemetery in Victoria and the closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle, due to the weak economy of the sector.
Steven Mikkelsson, CEO of AGL, said last week that analysts estimate Portland uses 600 megawatts and Tomago 900 megawatts of energy per year.
If these two plants left the energy market, the demand for energy would drop significantly.
And that would not be good at all.
The Community Legal Centre rejects 160 000 people every year.
More than 160 000 people are rejected every year, and the situation could deteriorate as the budget drops.
Three out of five people in Queensland - mainly pensioners, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the means to combat illegal evictions - are refused free legal assistance and representation.
The Community's legal centre, which is already overburdened, warns that the decline in funding will only make the situation worse.
As of June next year, these legal centres will receive 30% less funding than before.
James Farel, director of Queensland Legal Center, said that the latest report by the National Association of Legal Centres states that legal aid is being refused to thousands of people in need.
Mr. Farrell pointed out that if this decision was not annulled, the situation would only get worse.
He also says, "The legal centre of Queensland is constantly underfunded, which means that thousands of people in need are refused assistance."
People who are trying to put an end to violent relations, people with deep debts, families who are experiencing divorce, workers who are unfairly dismissed - all these people have legal problems and this report shows that they are not getting the help they need.
As of June 2017, the federal government will cut funding by 30 percent, meaning that several thousand more people in Queensland will have to solve their complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Attorney General and the Queensland Senator George Brandis to stop the cuts immediately so that people in need of legal assistance can obtain them.
Last year, the government revealed its plans to raise the level of legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to pay attention to the needs of local communities and their clients, and to invest in this important area by the Palazzo government.
Donald Trump's campaign was sued because one of the employees pulled out a firearm
New York: The organizers of Donald Trump's campaign have been sued because they have failed to act on information that its North Carolina operations manager has turned a firearm against an employee when they traveled in the same car in February.
This incident was described in a court action brought on Wednesday by Vincent Borini, a former campaign programmer, before the Charlotte Court.
Brondi said that he had waited months for this case to be brought to an internal hearing, but understood that it would not happen.
Manager Earl Philip "wound the gun, put his right index finger on the cock and turned the barrel against Vincent's knee", Brondi claims in his complaint.
He also claims that when he made complaints to the local and regional campaign management, Brondi learned that at least four more people had experienced the same thing.
"The guns don't have to shoot to make a loss," says Brondi in his complaint.
Just two days before this case was submitted, the candidate of the Republican Party for the presidential office caused a scandal by announcing to the people that the "People of the Second Amendment", i.e. arms owners and enthusiasts, could act if his rival Hillary Clinton and his elected judges were to win the election.
Tramp campaigners said that the media had snatched his words out of context, and he never incited anyone to violence.
Broadly with their request, they want to recover compensation from campaign organisers for negligent supervision, and from Phillips for attack, illegal use of weapon and emotional stress.
Hop Hicks, a Trump’s representative, did not comment at once.
I've never been able to get in touch with Phillips.
The WCCB - Charlotte local news agency reports that Philip has recently left the campaign.
Also, he has not been able to call his consulting firm "Innovative Consultancy Services".
President-designate Donald Trump of the Republican Party has conducted a controversial electoral campaign.

A new tradition - parish and sports festival in Ķulciems.
On Saturday in Ķulciems for the first time people gathered for Parish and Sports Festival.
After the celebration of ten years, it was decided that the Lake Festival would be no longer.
A new page has now been changed.
The day began with sports competitions.
This time the race was not in traditional ways and too serious, because, for example, darts had to be thrown into a sleeping target, the boot flew, with the human left hand throw, there was no "balling" at all in the Olympic Games.
However, each participant could show how strong, brave, agile, and resourceful he was.
After the sports games, everyone gathered in the open - air stage, where the parish festival began.
In the meantime, there was also a "children's corner", where the little ones could break into inflatable attractions and get a new image in the face of the sinking yard.
The novelty that could also become a tradition was the parade of vehicles, where both tractors and motorcycles went.
Everyone was addressed by Inga Kadikiķe-Skadiņa, the Head of Ķūļciems Parish Administration, who wished a nice rest and dry time, but it did not disturb much.
The festival continued with the greeting of the youngest residents of Ķūļciems.
It is really good that the parish has added five girls and one boy.
With their performances, amateur art collectives from Engure region had come to the ķūļciems – the audience enjoyed the performances of the senior dance group "Rudens Ritmi", dance performers of different nations "Redas" and youth dancers "Golden Pearls".
And it's nothing that someone had to slip on a wet stage.
Of course, the local people and visitors were pleased by the famous actor duo Jānis Jarāns and Dainis Porgants, who were once again Mildiņa Nabiņa and Skaidrite Kraniņa, as well as the attractive wives of Berzciems from the fishermen's farm "Dieniņas".
Balls were played by the Bruģis band.
Britain must maintain the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow.
Heathrow will not only promote prosperity and growth in local regions and London, but also throughout the country.
This, in my opinion, makes Heathrow very attractive, as in 2012 in London, where we invested a huge amount of work so that all the regions of the country benefit from the Olympic Games.
Stratford and East End scored an enormous amount from the Olympic Games.
And we will do this again by providing local people and businesses with business opportunities near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we will create 10 000 new business opportunities, 40 000 new jobs and finally put an end to youth unemployment around Heathrow.
Like at the London Olympics in 2012, there will be people here who believe that this challenge is too big and that the expansion of Heathrow is too ambitious.
People then said that Britain would never be able to prepare for the Olympic Games at the time and that it would be a global failure.
Skeptics were wrong about 2012 and, in Heathrow's case, they will not be right.
There are always obstacles that need to be overcome, but Heathrow has overcome everything so far.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that will benefit society as a whole, not individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs, economic growth of 211 billion, creating the ground for both employment and experience at the airport and throughout the UK.
Heathrow has a great team that has created an infrastructure investment programme worth GBP 11 billion, covering the time and budget, starting with the terminal 5, which has been named the world's best airport terminal for five years and ending with the terminal 2, which is built between the two most intensive runways in the world.
They are now ready to set up a third runway, which will be financed by a private investment of GBP 16 billion.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success, and I am sure that this will also be the enlargement of Heathrow.
It is time to revive the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, ensuring the future of our trade and creating a new employment environment that Britain could be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton is a board member of Heathrow and former Secretary of Commercial Affairs of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.
In Switzerland, a woman runs on the highway trying to commit suicide.
The victim slipped on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police are trying to find witnesses of an accident when on Thursday, early in the morning, several cars crossed her on the highway.
The accident took place on Thursday shortly after midnight on the A1 road near the Canton of Vo in Morges.
A report by the Wo Canton police states that the woman was drowned on the road in the dark, where she was driven by several cars, desperately seeking to commit suicide.
Undoubtedly trying to kill himself, the victim, 49-year-old Swiss, drove several cars, including a truck.
She died on the scene.
Several of the drivers involved in the accident have already given evidence, but others involved have not yet been clarified, says the police, who call for references to the drivers involved and witnesses of the accident.
Criminal investigations have also been initiated in the case, which in such a case is a logical step, a lawyer Gilles Hofsteller told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it is not yet known whether any of the drivers involved will be penalised.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
Hoffsteller adds, "This will be clarified by the prosecutor."
Two similar incidents that have occurred in the last 5 years show that none of the drivers will be held liable.
In both cases, the pedestrian was on the highway in the middle of the night, so it was decided that drivers could not expect a pedestrian to be on the highway in the middle of the night, according to the newspaper.
Last year, a policeman was excused for being killed for negligence when, in August 2014, she drove a man who was lying in the middle of the night on the A1 road near Paijerne.
The court found out that the 22 - year - old victim had drunk and later noticed falling asleep on the road.
The court concluded that the policeman, who was on her way to the scene of the accident, traveled in a manner appropriate to the circumstances and the judge admitted that the lying man on the road was "a completely unpredictable and exceptional case".
Anyone with information about the accident on Thursday near Morges is invited to contact the police by phone 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
On the Internet, signatures are collected for a new SRS manager’s competition.
The petition portal "Avaaz.org" has started collecting signatures for the post of Head of the State Revenue Service (SRS).
The petition addressed to the ministers of the National Association (NA) and the Greens/Farmers' Union (ZZS) states that the public wants a transparent and professional nomination process.
The petition was created on August 10, and it is currently signed by 55 people.
The nomination process of Inga Kolegova, the candidate for the post of the Director-General of the SRS, is opaque and unprofessional.
This brings to mind the best Soviet Union functional traditions.
It discredits the public administration and once again disappoints the public in government and politics.
"There is a need for a competition with clear criteria against which all candidates must be evaluated", says the petition text.
Its author Jānis B. pointed out that the public has no known criteria, as Koļegova has chosen for the post.
Nor is it clear what the candidate's intentions are in the work of the SRS.
The petition indicates that the State Chancellery must create a new, open competition in which professional candidates are actively addressed, personnel selection specialists are attracted and appropriate remuneration offered.
Minister for Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola officially nominated Kolegov for the post of Head of the SRS last week, this week the government was expected to approve him in the new position, but all ministers of the Unity party voted against, so the issue of a week was postponed.
Samoilov: If we lost, then I played badly.
Beach volleyball players Aleksandrs Samoilovs and Jānis Šmēdiņš have hoped for a prize at the Rio Olympic Games, however, without it, there is no difference in where to close the race, Samoilovs said after leaving the tournament.
One of the world's most powerful pairs of beach volleyball on Thursday in the final and decisive game of the tournament with 1-2 (16:21, 22:20, 7:15) lost to the Brazilians Evander Gonsalves Oliveira and Pedro Solberg Salgada, concluding their participation in the four-year major sports forum.
Latvian athletes won one victory in three sub-group matches, but the same ratio was for two more couples.
The ratio between the small points of the three pairs, which after the convincing loss suffered in this match, was most unfavourable for the Latvian duet.
"In the first set we were in the lead, but from 16:15 we also stayed on 16 points", Smēdiņš remembered the course of the game.
I don't even know how we stayed out of the rest of the set.
You can't play like that.
Then in the second set everything was fine and at the top of the set it was able to break the game, and it should have been a good basis for the third set as well.
We started it in a similar way, but after we exchanged parties, the result grew only for one team.
We had too many mistakes in the attack.
In the sub-group, all the teams were similar, almost all of them had three sets, so small points were important.
"We should have played more like this, not given 3-4 points in a row several times," said the athlete.
We knew he could be served.
"In the first set we got to the end of it, in the second we put 1-2 points, but in the third at +4 he already left the game", Smédins remembered.
We tried to show you the best game.
Sometimes it happened, sometimes it didn't.
I did not look at the overall situation before the match, but it was known that as many small points as possible were needed.
"If we lost, so I played badly," Samoilov said.
We expected a good serve from Evandro, and we did quite well with it in the first sets, but the third one opened his serve and found it difficult to build an attack.
And I made a lot of mistakes in my admission, but I had to deal with it.
Samoilov told us that unlike the previous match today athletes were not nervous.
"We went, played, also protection was, but needed a better welcome of the serve," said the athlete.
"They played well and in the end came to the "urrā".
Before the tournament, we immediately said that the draw was the most uncomfortable one we could have had.
We also had the prospect of fighting for first place, but we didn't even get out of the group.
"All of us expected a medal and we of ourselves, but after that there is no difference - 25th place or 4th," said Samoilov, who predicted that the duet would continue to play together in the future.
I think that there will be no questions and that we will continue to play together, because this is just one tournament.
Samoylov Rio de Janeiro was already in the career of the third Olympic Games, because in 2008 he competed with Mārtiņš Pļaviņš in Beijing, but four years ago he played with Ruslan Sorokin in London.
Meanwhile, for Smédins, this was the second start in the Olympics.
Latvenergo follows the process of opening up the gas market also from the position of a potential trader.
Latvenergo, the state energy company, follows the process of opening up the gas market from the position of both the consumer and a potential trader, said the company's press secretary Ivita Bidere.
"The decision on whether Latvenergo will join the gas market in the future as a trader will be determined by which gas market model and legal framework will be established."
"Therefore, for our part, we are actively involved in the drafting and commenting of regulatory enactments, as well as we submit our proposals", Bidere said.
The Agency has already written that the Ministry of Economics (EM) in cooperation with the Public Utilities Commission and the Energy Company "Latvijas Gāze" has developed Cabinet Regulations project "Regulations on Trade and Use of Natural Gas" that will change the existing principles of operation of the natural gas market, ensuring natural gas users the right to freely choose natural gas trader from 3 April 2017.
Working on the new regulation of the natural gas market, the EM aims to make the natural gas trade process as simple and user-friendly as possible.
Therefore, the most efficient and user-friendly service solution has been chosen as "the centre model of the trader", where all activities related to customer service are provided by the trader – one contract, one invoice and one information provision and customer service place, leaving to the distribution system operator the technical issues of the natural gas distribution system.
A similar solution is currently being implemented in the electricity trade.
We would like to remind you that it is planned to gradually open the market for household users – even after 3 April 2017, those household users who will not want to choose another natural gas trader will be able to continue to receive natural gas from the existing trader at a regulated price, thus becoming related users.
"In this case, the obligation to supply natural gas to connected customers at a regulated price is imposed on the public trader", informed the Ministry.
In turn, traders will have to choose the natural gas trader with whom to conclude a natural gas trade contract.
Until the conclusion of the natural gas trading agreement for a certain period of time, traders will ensure the sale of natural gas by the existing natural gas trader at a price fixed by it.
The Cabinet of Ministers regulations project details the rights and obligations of the natural gas trader, system operator and users.
The regulations shall determine the procedures for supplying and terminating natural gas, the requirements for the safe use of the natural gas system, the rights and obligations of the trader, the public trader, the system operator, the user and the owner of the gaseous object in the supply and use of natural gas; the procedures for the settlement of the received services, the rate of delay, the procedure for switching traders and the supply of natural gas to related customers in the event of disruption of the supply of natural gas by the public trader.

Minister: next week it is planned to discuss increase of remuneration of SRS Director General.
The Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Green and Farmers' Union (ZZS)) is planning to talk with Prime Minister Maris Kučinskis (ZZS) and government coalition partners about the increase in remuneration of the Director General of the State Revenue Service (SRS).
On Friday, she said to journalists that increasing the remuneration of the Director-General of the SRS should be addressed as a matter of urgency in order to make the post more attractive to potential re-tenderers.
The next week will also talk about changing the terms of the competition.
The Minister also stressed that she had no idea of any particular candidate to address for a vacant post.
At the same time, Reizniece-Ozola expressed her opinion that the Head of the State Environmental Service Inga Koļegova would have been a good Director General of the SRS.
As regards the current executive director of the SRS, Dace Pelēko, who expressed his readiness to apply for this post, the Minister reiterated the view that the new SRS Director General should be "side-by-side" and should not come from the SRS structure.
She also stressed that she was waiting for the Saeima to return from her leave in order to direct amendments to the laws necessary for the reorganisation of the SRS as soon as possible.
The agency BNS has already announced that the Head of the State Environmental Service Inga Koļegova has submitted an application to Dana Reizniece-Ozola (ZZS), the Minister of Finance, which withdraws his candidacy for the post of the Director General of SRS.
In her application, she said that it was not an easy choice, but during the last two weeks her relatives have been under serious emotional pressure, even though they have not taken any legally reprehensible action.
Kolegova also pointed out that the discussion of her candidacy has increased the contradictions between the ruling coalition parties, which are also unacceptable.
The former SRS Director General Inara Pētersone has also been reported to have left office at the end of June.
Oil prices continue to rise; stock exchange indices in the US and Europe are rising, as are the values of the US dollar.
Global oil prices continue to rise on Friday morning, with the confidence of investors having a positive impact on the statements made by the Saudi Minister of Oil Affairs, which reinforces the expectation that the major oil-producing countries will take action at the September OPEC meeting to stabilise the global oil market.
The three main US stock exchange indices reached a record high on Thursday, which was not observed since 1999.
The main positive factor in the market was the rise in oil prices and the strong financial indicators of several large companies.
The rise in oil prices and the strong financial performance of several companies on Thursday were also the reason for the rise in European stock exchange indices.
The value of the US dollar increased on Thursday against the euro, against the British pound and against the Japanese yen.
New York stock exchange electronic trading The price of WTI brand crude oil for deliveries in September rose by 1.78 US dollars to 43.49 US dollars per barrel.

The turnover of the canning manufacturer "Zila Lagona" is dropping by 33.8% last year.
Last year the turnover of the producer of canned products "Zila Lagona" was 4,202 million euros, which is 33.8% less than a year before, whereas the losses of the company decreased 5.7 times - to 904,7 thousand euros, according to the annual financial report published in the data base "Lursoft".
According to the company's management report, in 2015 the company was operating with losses due to several reasons, including the permanent lack of working capital caused by the exit of Unicredit Bank from the Baltic market by terminating the previously valid credit line and leaving the Blue Lagoon with concluded contracts without being able to fulfil them.
As a result, the company did not have sufficient resources to purchase cheaper raw materials in large quantities and to receive a discount.
The withdrawal of the relevant bank from the Latvian market also prevented the company from implementing European Union structural funds support projects, which would have allowed the production facility to purchase new production equipment and upgrade its infrastructure.
The financial indicators of the company were also negatively affected by the rise in raw material prices and the unwillingness of customers to pay more for the goods produced by the company.
"Only in the second half of July 2016 customers acknowledged the price changes and were ready to purchase goods at the new - the highest - prices," says the company's management.
Also in 2015 "Zila lagoon" started discussions with potential investors, including evaluation of the company's movable and real estate.
Investors have already been with the company's largest creditor, Unicredit Leasing, where the parties have become acquainted with and discussed possible investment plans.
At the same time, the company's activities and development were positively affected by the implementation of the restructuring and optimisation plan launched in 2014 and 2015.
This plan included the improvement and optimisation of technological processes, which allows for higher production productivity and capacity.
"A number of equipment was purchased, which ensures higher production speed," said the company's management.
The management of "Zila lagoon" notes that the equipment purchased in 2016 will allow the company's production unit to fulfil such orders, which were not possible until now.
The first batch of production to be produced on this equipment will be ready in August.
As the minutes of intent on the sale of the product have already been signed, all the production will be sold in accordance with the minutes of intent.
The new product will increase the turnover by about 300 thousand euros per month", says the company's management.
The company also plans to sign a cooperation agreement on fish product deliveries to Iraq in August 2016.
Blue lagoon in 2016 sent the first experimental container to Israel, expanded the market to Cyprus and this September will sign a cooperation agreement with a new supermarket chain in the USA.
As a result of all the above-mentioned measures, the company intends to increase its turnover.
In 2014, "Blue lagoon" worked with a turnover of 6.347 million euro and losses of 5.113 million euro.
The Blue Lagoon was founded in 1997 and its share capital is EUR 1.156 million.
The company is owned by two Latvian individuals – Mikhail Kaidanov (89,11%) and Igor Širšons (10,89%).
Welcome 15 pl. to the museum to welcome the film diva Zara Leander and participate in the press conference.
Riga can be regarded as the city of the beginning and inspiration of the career of the beloved cinema dives of Zar Leander.
The visit of Zara Lendere to the aunt Ruth, who was the Swedish ambassador to Latvia, turned out to be fatal in Riga in 1924, because it was she who revealed to the woman of Zara Leander the unusual low contralt, which she tried to debut on the stage of Riga cabaret.
Maybe it was the accidental fact that in Riga, it became the fateful turn in Zara's creative path towards the world's glory.
Riga Zara Leander was connected with warm memories, and she hoped to come to Riga in her guest performances, but unfortunately these hopes were not destined to be fulfilled because World War II began.
Using the form of the performance, this meeting will be possible at Riga Festival 2016 and the outstanding role of Zara Leander will be played by the great Ieva Kerēvica.

Neighbor repair forces a man to leave his home when he breaks his ceiling.
The LTV broadcast "studija 4" was addressed by Dmitri Saidjaševs, whose neighbor has begun to repair the capital in his apartment, and since then, Dmitrijs has been cared for by plaster from the ceiling and is not sure that staying in the apartment is safe.
The problem is that my neighbors carried out arbitrary construction and my apartment has a damaged ceiling.
Then I informed the Riga Construction Board, the House Manager and other organizations.
The Construction Board said that we are no operational service and we do not have any expert.
"The owner of the apartment must go to the Latvian Engineering Union, and there will be an expert," says Dmitry.
The invited expert arrived, recorded what happened and admitted that the division was in unsatisfactory condition.
However, a month has passed since Dmitry’s first application, and until the beginning of this week no one was able to answer whether being in the apartment is life-threatening.
In the Construction Board said that this is the legislation, wait if you are not satisfied, write to all in a row.
"Then I wrote to the Riga City Council, but they transferred the house to the manager, then the house manager again to the building board, and then it is a dead end", says Dmitry.
After examining the whole pile of papers, it is clear that the work has been stopped, even though one can hear from time to time that someone is working there.
Within a further two months, an expert’s report must be carried out and within six months, the owner of the apartment carrying out the repairs must repair all these defects.
The independent expert has drawn up his opinion, but the building board considers it incomplete and superficial.
The expert has not indicated whether the metal lattice of this supporting structure is affected, so it is not certain that the owner of the lower apartment is being put at risk.
"Therefore we have requested additional clarification from this expert", says Ilze Žūka, representative of Riga City Construction Board.
Despite the ban on carrying out any repairs in the upper apartment, it is still heard from there that construction continues.
The penalty for arbitrary construction without a building permit is between 70 and 700 euros, but in a particular case the penalty can be much more severe.
While waiting for the expert's opinion, the Construction Board decided that both apartments should not be operated - both in which construction works are carried out and in which Dmitry's apartment.
"This is an unprecedented case in the practice of the Construction Board, when, due to their ignorance or simply unwillingness, the population may have caused a threat not only to their property, but also to the owner of the lower property, as a result of which this owner cannot exploit his property", says the representative of the Construction Board.
Now it remains for Dmitri to look for another place to live in - with relatives, friends, in a hotel or rent another apartment.
But Dmitry can try to recover the damage from his neighbor on a civil basis, which can take a lot of time.
Due to the arbitrary construction, it is currently prohibited to stay in both apartments until the construction engineer has reached his conclusion, and it may have to wait for up to three weeks.
Losses will have to be borne by the owner of the apartment where the repairs have taken place.
The owner of this apartment, because the construction board has not taken into account, is also facing prison sentence for up to six months.
Guess what!

The e-mail of former NATO Commander Bridlow has been hacked by Russian hackers.
The hackers, who hacked the computers of the U.S. National Committee of Democrats (DNC), may have carried out a number of other cyber attacks, also hacked the e-mails of former NATO European Force Commander Philip Bridlow and servers of George Soros Institute "Open Society", reported on Thursday by the business news agency "Bloomberg".
The hackers published the information on "DCLeaks.com".
Among other things, Briedlow’s correspondence and information on the work of the Soros Institute are included there.
For hackers, the Institute's computers have been available for a whole year.
According to Bloomberg, these cyber-attacks have been carried out by the same hackers associated with Russia's special services, who have hacked DNC emails.
The Wall Street Journal, in turn, reports that the US President Barack Obama's administration is currently examining the issue of imposing new sanctions on Russia in response to the hacking of DNC computers.
In order to impose sanctions, the administration will have to formally attack the servers of the Democratic Party against Russia or hackers supported by the Russian authorities.
As reported, the WikiLeaks website in July released some 20,000 e-mails obtained from the DNC computer system, from which the leaders of the Democrat Party have, of course, tried to harm the campaign of the former rival of party candidate Hillary Klinton, the senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders, in the fight for the nomination of democrats for the presidential election.
According to the US press, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which investigates the hacking of democratic servers, as well as other U.S. special services, believes that Russia's connection to cyber-attack is almost indisputable.
McCartney: The presence of Yoko Ono threatened "The Beatles".
Paul McCarthy admitted that the presence of Yoko Ono created a sense of danger for the legendary band "The Beatles".
The 74-year-old rock star now maintains a "good" relationship with the widow of late John Lennon, but when she went to visit the band at the recording studio, she frightened McCartney, because Ono was the only woman among the group members - George Harrison, Ringo Starr, Lennon and McCartney.
When the singer was asked about the relationship between the two, he replied to the Rolling Stone magazine, "It's really good."
We felt threatened at that time.
While we were recording, she was sitting on the amplifiers.
Most of the group could not tolerate it.
We were able to, but not very successfully, because we were very tense.
We were not sexists, but the girls usually didn't go to the recording studio, they let us work.
When John began to meet Joko, she did not sit in the control room, but in the middle of our four.
The author of "Yellow Submarine" has also admitted that he is now in regular contact with his former group member Ringo, and from time to time approves the work plans of the recording studio "Apple", but otherwise "The Beatles" is "ending".
When asked if he was still meeting the other only member of the legendary rock group, McCartney said to the Rolling Stone magazine, "Frequently not."
We meet at social events and parties.
But I'm not going to the meetings, but I feel a little detached from it.
I left Apple during the severe divorce.
I sent John Eastman to meetings in my place and said, "Tell me what everyone says, because I can't suffer sitting at that table."
It was too painful as if we saw the death of our pet.
The company now works in such a way that I just listen to all the records.
I am part of the approval process.
NASA climate model: Venus used to be a habitable planet
Based on NASA’s latest climate models, Venus has once been an inhabitable planet.
Scientists at NASA Godarda Space Research Institute have developed a model to explore Venus’s history using tools and algorithms that climate scientists also use.
The model was designed to determine whether on Venus, which has a hot surface, where there is no water, and whose atmosphere consists almost exclusively of carbon, conditions similar to those of the earth have ever existed.
Scientists have previously guessed that Venus’s slow speed is due to the dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulations show that Venus was once thin, earthlike atmosphere, and it turned slowly.
The model also looks at Venus’s former topography.
There were more dry areas on the planet than on the earth, but there was enough water and geographical diversity on it to create life and to prevent the evaporation of water.
In early Venus, the sun was 30 percent brighter.
In the simulation of the GISS model, the Venus spin model reveals that the light part of the day on it lasts for 2 months, explained in a press release by GISS scientist Antony Del Genio.
This process heats the planet’s surface and causes rain, which in turn forms layers of thick clouds that act as an umbrella, protecting the planet from the sun’s heat.
The result is a moderate temperature of the climate, which is actually a few degrees lower than the temperature on earth today.
The model represents Venus’s history, which is similar to the theory of evolution developed by scientists in their hypotheses.
Although it has been inhabitable, Venus has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet rays over several billion years.
The oceans evaporated, and the spirits were burned by ultraviolet rays.
As water completely evaporated, only the thin atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse gas - Venus, as we know it today - remained.
Scientists published the results of the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns from the role of Avalanche coach
On Thursday, the coach of Colorado "Avalanche" and the vice-president of hockey operations, Patrick Roy, submitted the resignation as a reason for not having enough influence in the team's decision-making process.
The vice president and general manager of Colorado, Joe Sakik, confirmed this message and informed us that the club would immediately start searching for a new coach.
"For the last three years, I have been energetic, enthusiastic and purposeful as the principal coach and vice president of the hockey operations of the Colorado Club," says 50-year-old Roy in his statement.
During this summer, I have thought a lot about how I could improve the team's performance in order to give it the necessary brilliance and achieve a higher level of performance.
In order to achieve this, the visions of the chief coach and vice-president of hockey operations must be completely identical to those of the organization.
He must also be able to influence decisions relating to team performance.
At present, these conditions are not met.
Jake, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
Jake said Patrick informed him of his decision today.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization and wish him all the best for the future.
In his first season with the team "Avalanche" in 2013-2014 Roy was recognized as the League's best coach and won the Jack Adams Award.
He helped the club to reach 112 points and first place in the Central Division, but in the first round of the defeat game Colorado the team was defeated by Minnesota hockey players. Since then, the club has not entered the exclusion games for two years.
"Avalanche" concluded the 2015-2016 season with a result of 39-39-4 and remained five points behind the "Wild" team without receiving the second special invitation of the organizers of the Western Conference.
The Gatekeeper of the Hall of Fame Roy won four Stanley Cups in his career - two with the Montreal Canadien and two with the Avalanche.
North Sea oil platform workers resume negotiations and delay strike
Employee strikes for the remuneration of North Sea oil platform workers have been postponed, as both parties to the dispute have resumed negotiations, the negotiators are telling.
Periodically, the oil processing company "Wood Group" is holding strikes on the North Sea oil platforms, where the company "Royal Dutch Shell" operates.
The joint statement states that the trade unions of the Wood Group and Unite and RBT agreed to resume negotiations on the settlement of the dispute.
During the coming weeks, a number of full-day meetings are scheduled to start at the beginning of next week with a view to reconsidering issues of concern.
The trade unions stated that their recent events, organised after more than 25 years, were against the planned wage cuts of 30 per cent.
This year, due to negative market pressure, the Wood Group reduced the wages of the North Sea workers by 9 percent.
As early as 2014, the company reduced the ground workers' wages by 10 percent.
The company explains that the additional wage cuts would allow the company to survive the market downturn.
Shell already reduced wages for several thousand people and announced plans to stop oil and natural gas operations in 10 countries in order to optimise its work in preparation for a large-scale merger with the British energy company "BG Group".
Energy companies are under pressure as a result of falling oil prices, and the situation is further complicated by Britain's decision to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of the week, Dave Anderson, a Scottish Member of Parliament, met with workers' representatives to discuss one of the most important issues: the North Sea strike plans.
He said that the North Sea is vital for the region's economy.
In his report, he explains that the North Sea and the country as a whole need an economy that benefits all, not individuals.
In 2016, investment in new North Sea projects is expected to be close to 1.4 billion dollars, compared to 7 billion dollars invested over the last five years.
Kepler is measuring the speed of turning stars in the Plead constellation.
Kepler’s recent telescope mission has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of the speed of star rotation in the Plead constellation.
The new data helps astronomers understand why the stars in this constellation rotate at different speeds, as well as how the speed of the stars refers to the formation of planets.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other constellations, we will get more information about the relationship between the mass of stars, age and even the history of its solar system," said Pasadena Caltech Infrared Process and Analytical Center scientist Louis Rebula.
The constellation of the Please is 445 light years away from Earth.
Many stars in this constellation only start to grow, reaching the age of about 125 million years.
They turn at maximum speed.
These rising stars emit large amounts of star winds at maximum speed.
When winds come into the magnetic field of stars, they slow the stars down.
As the stars age, their speed of rotation decreases.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by determining the time between the appearance of a recognizable area of stars, such as sun spots.
The latest star speed catalogue shows that larger stars turn slower than smaller stars.
Rebuls compares the stars with the dancers, the larger-sized dancers perform pyruettes slower than small-sized dancers.
Rebuls tells that the Please "ballet" shows that slow rotating objects are larger and larger, while faster rotating objects are very small stars.
Thanks to the fact that the Please constellation is so close, it serves as a great space laboratory, where you can compare star characteristics with spin speeds.
Rebuls says that the Please constellation helps to create theoretical models for the rotation of stars in both directions for both older and younger stars.
We still have a lot to learn how, when and why the speed of the stars slows down and about their complete stopping process.
Rebul and his colleagues presented a detailed analysis of the speed of rotation of the Plead stars in three new publications, which will shortly be published in the Astronomy Journal.
