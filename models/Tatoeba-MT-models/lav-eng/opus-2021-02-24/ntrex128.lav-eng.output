Members of the Assembly of Wales (AM) are concerned about the possibility of "getting perceived as mums"
Some members of the Assembly are concerned about the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reason for this is the plans to change the Assembly's name to Welsh Parliament.
AM is worried throughout the political spectrum that it can make them a target of ridicule.
One of the Labour Party's AM explained that their group was concerned about "the echoes with the words Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, "twp" means "single court", but "pwp" means "kaka".
The parties Plaid AM indicated that none of the groups were "unsatisfied" and have suggested alternatives.
The representative of the Conservative Party of Wales admitted that their group was ready to examine the change of name, but added that MWP is very similar to Muppet, which means "age".
In this context, it should be noted that the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly to the English Yorkshire dialect "u".
The Assembly commission, which is currently drafting a bill to change the title, informed: "The final decision on the terms to be used to designate the members of the Assembly must, of course, be taken by the members of the Assembly themselves."
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 granted the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals, which gained broad support for changing the Assembly's name to the Welsh Parliament.
As regards the name of AM, the Commission preferred the Welsh Parliament Member (WMP), but MWP received the greatest support in the public consultation.
The AM explicitly recommends alternative options, but the fight for the agreement can cause headaches for the Speaker of the Assembly Elin Jones, who is expected to table a bill of change in the coming weeks.
The draft law on changes will also include other changes to the work of the Assembly, including the rules on the disqualification of AM and the structure of the committee system.
The final vote of the AM on what they will be called will take place once the legislation has been discussed.
Macedonians go to vote in referendum on change of name of country
Voters will vote on Sunday whether their country's name will be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular referendum was organised to resolve decades of disagreements with neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbour gives the impression of the claims on its territory, and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's request to be admitted to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, one of the plebiscite of changing the name of the opponents, declared that he would ignore the vote.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is simply a thing to be done in order to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's church bells shut up when the churches of Harlem fight for existence.
"As the old people I've talked to, I used to have a bar and a church on every corner," says Mr Adams.
"Now there is neither one nor the other."
He admits that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People today are socialising in other ways," he said.
"Bars are no longer living rooms in the neighbourhood, which people visit regularly."
Speaking even to the churches, he is worried that the money he receives when he sells his property will end faster than the leaders hope, "and sooner or later they will be back to their starting point".
Churches, he added, may be replaced by apartment buildings with apartment properties, which will accommodate people who will not help the remaining shrines in the area.
"Most of the people who will buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he explained, "and this will bring them closer to the day when these churches will close forever, because it is unlikely that most of the people who will move into these apartments will become members of these congregations."
Both churches were built by the white congregation before Harlem became the Black Metropolis — the Metropolitan community in 1870, and St. Martin — 10 years later.
The original white Methodist congregation abandoned the building in the 1930 ’ s.
The building was taken over by a black congregation that had worshiped God right next to it.
The black church of St Martin took over his blessings during John Howard Johnson. On 125th Street, on the main shopping street in Harlem, he led a boycott of working retailers who had refused to hire blacks or give them promotion.
The fire in 1939 seriously damaged the building, but because of the plans of the Father’s Johnson Congregation to rebuild the building, they ordered a ringing game.
His blessing David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and descendant of St. Martin's church, proudly called the bell game "the bells of the poor people".
The expert who played this call game in July used other words: "cultural treasure" and "an indispensable historical instrument".
Expert Tiffany Ng from Michigan University added that it was the first bell game in the world played by a black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago at a larger bell game in the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather told him that St. Martin's congregation did not replace him.
The events of the past few months around St. Martin’s church reflected a knotted relationship between architects and contractors, some of whom had been attracted by secular authority and others by the episcopal church diocese.
The council of the church, composed of secular leaders, wrote to the diocese in July with concern that the diocese "will try to pass on the costs" to the council, even though the council was not involved in the hiring of architects and contractors sent out by the diocese.
Some in the congregation complained about the lack of transparency in the work of the diocese.
Shark infests a 13-year-old teen in a lobster fishery
On Saturday in California, the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy who dived after lobsters and wounded him. It was the first day of the lobster season, the services tell.
The attack took place shortly before 7 o'clock in the morning, near the beach of Beacon's Beach in Encinita.
Chad Hammel informed KSWB-TV San Diego that he and his friends had dive about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard that the boy was crying for help, and then the group flew to help him pull the boy out of the water.
Hammel explained that at first he had thought that it was just excited about the caught lobster, but then he "understood that the boy was screaming" My bit!
I'm bit!"
The whole bone of his key was torn apart," said Hammel, who immediately noticed it when he got to the boy.
"I yell to all leave the water: "There is a shark in the water!" added Hammel.
The boy was taken by air to Radie’s children’s hospital in San Diego, where his condition was considered critical.
The attacked shark species is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles reported to the media that a shark had been observed in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not a dangerous species for humans.
Jails added that the victim was traumatized by the upper part of the body.
Officials closed access to the beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in the city of Encinita for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Jails pointed out that there are more than 135 shark species in this area, but most are not considered dangerous to humans.
Sainsbury's plans to penetrate the UK beauty industry market
"Sainsbury's" goes to the attack "Boots", "Superdrug" and "Debenhams" with the queues of supermarket-style beauty products and trained sellers.
As part of the significant investment in the UK's GBP 2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow, although the sales of fashion and home items are decreasing, 11 shops in the country will test out larger rows of shelves for beauty products, and if everything goes well, there will be more such stores next year.
In the beauty industry, funds are invested when supermarkets are looking for opportunities to use shelves previously reserved for televisions, microwave ovens and home goods.
"Sainsbury's" informed that it would double its offer in the field of beauty up to 3000 products, including brands such as "Revlon", "Essie", "Tweezerman" and, for the first time, "Dr. PawPaw".
The existing lines from "L'Oreal", "Maybelline" and "Burt's Bees" will also receive more space with branded zones, similar to those in "Boots" stores, for example.
The supermarket also re-markets its Boutique line of make-up, where most products will be vegan-friendly, which is increasingly demanded by younger buyers.
In addition, the perfume wholesaler Fragrance Shop will try out the concession in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which was opened last week in Croydon in southern London, and the second one will be opened in Seli Oak in Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and switching to small purchases of food every day in local shops mean that supermarkets need to invest more in convincing people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that points of sale of goods will become more and more similar to department stores, because the chain of stores is trying to fight off Aldi and Lidl shops, offering a larger range of services, but without food.
"Sainsbury's" has placed "Argos" outlets in hundreds of shops and has opened several "Habitats" since it bought both chains two years ago, which is said to have improved sales and made the purchased more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to improve its beauty and pharmaceutical departments ended in defeat.
"Sainsbury's" joint venture with "Boots" was tried in the early 2000s, but the union broke out after a dispute about how to distribute income from pharmacy stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy develops after "Sainsbury's" 3 years ago sold its 281 store of the large pharmaceutical business to the owner of "Celesio", "Lloyds Pharmacy" chain, for 125 million pounds.
According to this plan "Lloyds" will have to complement the assortment with a wide range of exclusive skin care products, including "Roche-Posay" and "Vicchy" in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, said: "In order to improve the environment for customers, we transformed the appearance of the shelves of our beauty products and their impact.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues, who will always be ready to make a recommendation.
Our brand range is designed to meet all needs, but an attractive environment along with a comfortable location means that now we are a delightful goal on the way to beauty, a goal that challenges current shopping habits."
Peter Jones full of tediousness after Holley Williamby gives up the 11 million pound deal
"Dragon Den" star Peter Jones "became angry" after the TV show director, Holly Willoughby, renounced the 11 million pound deal with his lifestyle brand to pay full attention to his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Vilouby has no time to devote her homewear and accessories to the brand "Truly".
The couple's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
"This Morning" 37-year-old programme manager used Instagram to announce that she was leaving.
Holly Williamby has left the Dragon Den star Peter Jones in anger, because at the last minute he left their lucrative lifestyle brand business — to draw all his attention to his new huge contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources of information claim that Jones was "full of trumpet" when a TV girl, during a tense meeting on Tuesday at his business empire residence in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, announced that her new contracts, worth up to 1.5 million pounds, meant that she no longer had the time to devote to their homewear and accessories brand "Truly".
The company was compared to Gwynetta Plato's Goop brand and, according to a hint, it will double the Viloubia's wealth, which is estimated at GBP 11 million.
When Willoubia (37) used Instagram to announce that he was leaving Tracy, Jones took away from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
According to the source of information: "Truly was the most important of Holley's priorities.
It should have become her long-term future, which would be devoted to the coming decades.
Her decision to leave surprised all those involved unprepared.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday: everything was so close to the start.
In the centre of Marlowa there is a warehouse full of ready-to-sale goods."
Experts believe that one of the most financially profitable stars, the leader of this Morning, can pay millions to the company to leave because a lot of money has been invested in various products – from pillows and candles, to clothes and goods for the house, and even more delay in their launch.
And that can mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children, Willouby, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been in close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for 10 years.
Vilouby's "Truly" was established with Kep in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman in March.
Both couples spend their holidays together, and Jones holds 40 % of the shares in Boldvin’s TV production company.
Viloubia must become the messenger of the M&S brand and she will replace Ant McPartlin as the head of I'm A Celebrity ITV.
A close source for Jones yesterday said, "We don't want to comment on his business."
A serious conversation "and then we fell in love"
He joked at the criticisms that he would receive from news companies about a comment that some may find "indecent to the President" and about the fact that he treats North Korea's leader so positively.
Why has the president given up so much?
Trump said in his playful "message dictor" voice.
"I didn't give up anything!"
He pointed out that Kim had shown interest in meeting once more after Trump acknowledged their initial meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards North Korea's denuclearisation.
However, negotiations on denuclearisation have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, one of the main North Korean diplomats Ri Jongho (Ri Yong Ho) informed world leaders in the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "response" to North Korea's initial steps towards disarmament.
Instead, he pointed out that the US continues sanctions aimed at maintaining tension.
Trump was more optimistic in his speech.
"We have a great relationship with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had produced positive results — the cessation of rocket testing tests, the release of prisoners, and the return of the remaining American soldiers to their homes.
And he defended his unusual approach when it comes to relations with Kim.
"It's easy to give the impression of the president, but instead of 10 000 people standing outside, trying to get into this densely populated area, we have 200 here," said Trump, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and the earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island, killing hundreds of people
Following the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-governmental organisations, for example, were told that their assistance was not necessary.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lomboka population was displaced, the state of national disaster was not declared, but it is necessary to propose foreign aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they said very clearly that they were not asking for international assistance, so it is a certain problem," said Ms Sumbung.
Although Save the Children collects a group to travel to Pala, it is still unclear whether foreign workers will be allowed to work there.
Mr Sutopo, a representative of the National Disaster Agency, explained that Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see whether international agencies will be allowed to contribute to aid.
Given the regular nature of the earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is still extremely untenable for the rage of nature.
Although there are shelters for tsunamis in Aceh, they are rarely found along other shores.
It is likely that the death of Palo was also affected by the lack of warnings about the tsunami, even though the warning was effective.
Even in the most favorable times, moving between the many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The hospital ship, anchored in Lomboca to treat the victims of the earthquake, is now going to Pala, but it will take at least three days to reach the victims of the new scourge.
President Joko Widodo had made the improvement of the destroyed infrastructure in Indonesia central to his election campaign and he has allocated large amounts of roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds has tortured Mr Joko's administration and is waiting for him to be re-elected next year.
Moreover, Mr Joko has to contend with the long-standing problem of tensions between the sects in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority has adopted one of the conservative forms of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands expelled from their homes, while Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other primitive weapons.
Watch: The Riverpool player Daniel Starige restores balance in the match against Chelsea.
Daniel Sturridge saved the Liverpool from his loss against Chelsea in the Premier League, winning the goal in 89 minutes in a Saturday game at the Starford Bridge Stadium in London.
Starige received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri, about 25 meters (30 yards) from the Chelsea Gate, when his team lost at 1:0.
He moved the ball a little to the left of himself and then kicked the ball in the direction of the goal pole.
In this attempt, the ball flew high across the square, reaching the top right corner of the net.
The ball eventually flew over the head of Kep Arizabalag, who was in a jump, and fell into the net.
"I just tried to get that position to get to the ball, and players like Shaq always play as far ahead as possible, so I just tried to get as much time as possible," Starige explained Liverpool.com.
"I saw Kante approaching, touched the ball, and, without thinking, I kicked."
"Chelsea" was in the lead at mid-time at 1:0 after the Belgian star Edden Hazard got the words in 25 minutes.
The Blues attacker played the ball back to Mateo Kovacic before turning to the middle of the field and jumping to the Liverpool area as quickly as possible.
Covačič quickly played and got the ball back in the middle of the field.
Then he made a beautiful blow between the players, allowing Azard to get into the zone.
Azard beats the defense and completed the combination with the left foot hitting a distant pole in the network, past the "Liverpool" by Allison Becker.
"Liverpool" at the Champions League Group stage on Wednesday at 15.00 in "Stadio San Paolo" Naples (Italy) will fight with "Napoli".
"Chelsea" will meet with "Videoton" at UEFA European League on Thursday at 15.00 in London.
Indonesia’s tsunami kills 832 people
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has reached 832 people, early on Sunday declared by the national disaster agency.
It was reported that many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings after the 7.5 - magnetic earthquake that struck the country on Friday and caused up to 20 feet (~6.0 m) of high waves, informed the agency's representative, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The city of Pala, with more than 380 000 inhabitants, was covered by ruined buildings.
Police suspect women's stabbing arrests a 32-year-old man
The murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A 44 - year - old wounded victim was found at 7.55, Grayson Mews, John Street, and suspected murder was arrested by a 32 - year - old man.
The police have called for people in the area who have seen or heard something.
The detective inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation has just begun, but I want to invite everyone who was around John Street in Birkenhead to contact us and saw or heard something suspicious.
I also invite every taxi driver, who might have recorded something in their car video recorders, to contact us, because they may have important information for our investigation."
The police representative confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead, and she was found in her possession.
This afternoon, friends who think they know a woman have come to a crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues and, as the police informed, they are involved in informing the immediate relatives of the victim.

He could not say a word when he learned what had happened.
Citizens are told that it will be hours before they are allowed to return.
It was heard that a policeman told a man that the whole neighborhood was perceived as a crime scene.
A woman in tears appeared at the scene of crime.
She goes on to say, "It's so awful!"
In the two afternoon, there were two police vans inside the cordon, and another was placed right next to the outside.
Several policemen were stationed inside the cordon and controlled the apartment building.
Everyone with information is asked to use DM @MerPolCC by 30 September, call 101 or contact "Crimestoppers anonymously" by phone 0800 555 111 naming 247.
Kromwell's statue in parliament becomes the latest "historical rewriting" scandal
Abandonment would be ethically justified given the similar activities of the Taliban, as a result of which his fanatic Puritan followers destroyed so many of England's cultural and religious monuments.
However, the Cromvel Society described the proposal of Mr. Crick as "false" and "test to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "Taking into account the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside of Westminster's palace would also be the target.
Cromwell himself neither ordered nor performed the destruction of icons during the civil wars of England.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor, a century earlier lived Thomas.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s magnificent depiction of Cromwell’s view in the 19th century is part of historiography of a person who, as many believe, is still worth honoring.
Mr Goldsmith said to Sunday Telegraph: "Many Cromwell, probably more than today at the end of the 19th century, considered it to be a defender of parliament against external pressure, which, of course, was a monarchy in his case.
Historical discussions on whether this really is a completely accurate presentation of the topic are ongoing.
What is clear is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century determined the future development of our nation, and Cromwell as such is a recognizable personality that represents one of the sides of the separation of the time.
Being a protector of the Lords, it is worth praising and remembering what he has achieved."
A pig-slaughter to death collapsed a farmer in China
According to local media, the pig in the market in south-western China attacked and killed a farmer.
The man — mentioned only his surname Yuan — was found dead with a broken artery, all in one blood at a pig house on the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou Province, on Sunday reported at South China Morning Post.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines to pigs on 30 May 2005 in a pig stable in the province of Xining in the province of Qinghai, China.
He and his cousin were reported to have arrived on Wednesday from neighboring Yunnan Province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found a man dead and discovered that the door of the nearby pig house was open.
He said that there was a large male pig with blood on his mouth.
According to a judicial medical examination confirmed that 550 pounds (~249 kg) heavy vepris had broken up the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and mutilated," said his cousin – his name is only mentioned in Wu, writing "Guiyang Evening News".
The safety camera material showed how Yuan entered the market on Thursday at about 4.40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan was neither his nor his cousin.
The market manager informed "Evening News" that the vapris was turned on to prevent its attacks on others while the police collected evidence at the scene.
According to the information, Yuan's family and market management discuss compensation for his death.
Although such cases are rare, other pig attacks in humans are known.
In 2016, the pig attacked a woman and a man on their farm in Massachusetts, resulting in critical injuries to the man.
Just 10 years ago, 650 pounds (~295 kg) of pig in Wales kept the farmer forced to the tractor until the animal was terrified by his wife.
After farmers at Oregon ate their pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba, CBC News, explained that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a gun shot.
"They're just playful.
They like to bite, they're very curious... they don't want to harm you.
You just have to show them enough respect," he said.
Orcana Rose’s conclusion brings a vast and powerful case to the southwest of the United States
Orcane Rose is predicted to weaken along the coldest waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
In the next few days, however, Rose will bring flooding to northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
At five o’clock in North American Eastern time, Rose’s gusts reached 143 km/h (85 miles per hour), which corresponds to a category 1 hurricane, with a point of 620 km (385 miles) southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low pressure depression is formed over the Pacific Ocean, moving east toward the east coast of the United States. With the power of the tropical storm approaching the peninsula of Lower California, Baja California, on Monday it will begin to push the moisture masses deep from the tropical zone northward to the southwest of the United States.
Rose on Monday will bring up to 10 inches (~25.4 cm) of rain in the part of Mexico.
Then tropical humidity, interacting with the approaching low-pressure depression, will form a vast heavy rain zone in the southwest in the next few days.
1-4 inches (~2,6-10,2 cm) of rain will cause dangerous sudden floods, mud currents and possibly landslides in the desert.
Moisture deep from the tropical zone will cause rainfall that will reach 2-3 inches (~5,1–7,6 cm) per hour in certain places, especially in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
In part of the south-west, especially in most of Arizona, up to 24 inches (~5.2-10.1 cm) of rain are expected.
There may be sudden floods with rapid deterioration due to the dispersion of tropical rains.
It is highly undesirable to walk in the desert because of the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into rapid rivers, but storms will bring local gust winds and sand storms.
As the low pressure depression approaches, it will bring local heavy rain to the southern California coastline.
Rainstorms are likely to exceed half an inch (~1.3 cm) in total and this can lead to small mud flows and slippery roads.
This will be the region's first rainfall in the wet season.
Certain diffuse tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday before the rain takes over the wider area late on Monday and early on Tuesday.
Strong rain will spread on Tuesday in the Four Corner region (DR Colorado, DA Yuta, NA Arizona and DR Jaunmexica) and will last all Wednesday.
In October, there is a possibility of intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States, as the Arctic temperatures are falling, but the tropics are still quite warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic changes in temperature at a short distance.
This is an example of dramatic temperature differences on Sunday in the central US.
The difference between the temperatures in Kansas, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and Saint Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, varies by almost 20 degrees.
The next days will try to build up and expand a long summer heat.
The beginning of October is expected to be warm in a large part of the U.S. central and eastern parts, reaching 80 degrees Fahrenheit (~27 degrees Celsius) in large areas from the southern plains to part of the northeast.
The temperature in New York City on Tuesday could reach 80 degrees Fahrenheit (~27 degrees Celsius), which would exceed the average by about 10 degrees.
Our long-term climate forecasts indicate a high probability that in the first half of October the temperatures in the eastern part of the United States will exceed the average.
More than 20 million people watched the Bret Kaveno case
More than 20 million people on Thursday's six television channels watched enthusiastically, as evidenced by Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, candidate of the Supreme Court, who accused Kaveno of sexual harassment, which she claims to have occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political tie continued, with broadcasters interrupting the regular transmission to report the latest turn of Friday: an agreement organized by the senator of Arizona, Jeff Flake, that the FBI will investigate the charges for a week.
Forda informed the Committee on Justice of the Senate that she is absolutely convinced that Kaveno drunk him and tried to remove clothes during the high school party.
Kaveno showed no dispassionately that he was absolutely convinced that this was not the case.
According to Nielsen, on Friday, 20.4 million people watched it all.
CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC recorded interest from medium-sized viewers.
Data for other broadcasters, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which demonstrated it, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has problems counting people looking at the offices.
To get a better idea, this number of viewers corresponds to the number of watchers of the "Oskara" ceremony.
"Fox News Channel", whose commentators have strongly supported the appointment of Kaveno, had the highest number of viewers, an average of 5.69 million during the whole day's hearing, informed Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3,26 million spectators.
CBS attracted 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, informed Nielsen.
The interest remained great even after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican team had published a statement that he would vote for Kaveno's appointment, the senator was noticed by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, when he, accompanied by the indignation of protesters, tried to get the elevator to the hearing of the Justice Committee.
On the live CNN, he stood for several minutes stabbed eyes, as tarnished.
"I stand here, right in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told that "you have power while so many women are powerless."
Flake explained that his team had made a statement, and before the elevator the door was closed, he was told that he still had something to say at the committee hearing.
Cable networks and broadcasters reflected what was happening live several hours later, when the Committee on Justice was going to vote on the nomination of Kaveno to vote in the Senate.
Flake, however, claimed that he would only do so if he knew that the FBI would deal with the accusations against the candidate next week, which was demanded by a minority of democrats.
Fleek was partly persuaded by conversations with his friend, the Democrat Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Koons and several other senators, Flake made his decision.
The choice of Flake was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes for the Kaveno approval without an investigation.
President Trump has commissioned the FBI to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of political games on Brexis
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Teresa May accused people who criticise her plan to withdraw from the European Union of "political games" with Britain's future and undermining national interests.
The British Prime Minister, Teresa May, arrives at the Conservative Conference in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, right next to an interview with her on the first page of the newspaper, Maja's former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, continues to attack her Brexis' plan for the future of Britain's relations with the European Union, so-called Chequers plan, emphasizing that the suggestion that Britain and the EU use each other's tariffs is completely absurd.
Shooting Wade Sams: The police have arrested Duteon Simpson, who is suspected of murder of a LSU player
The police have arrested the suspect for shooting Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, aged 20, was arrested and arrested as an accused of second degree murder, informed the Baton Rouge police station.
The officials released a video of Samson’s clash with Simpson, and the police said that Sams lost his glasses during the fight.
The CBS daughter company, WAFB, reports that the police found glasses at the scene of a crime and found Simpson’s blood on them.
After the Simpson interrogation, the police informed him that he had confessed to the shooting of Wade.
According to a lawyer, he was given $350,000 in security.
On Friday, a team of legal medical experts from East Baton Rouge Parish issued a provisional report stating that the death was caused by a shot in the head that struck the neck.
The Department thanks the working group on the search for refugees from Louisiana State Police, the State Police Forensic Laboratory, the South University Police and the population of the territory for assisting with the investigation leading to arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU Sports Director, thanked the law enforcement of the territory for their "effort and work in the name of justice".
Sams was 20 years old.
6 feet 6 inches (~1.98 m) the long attacker grew up at Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball LSU.
In the last season, he won an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in one game.
On Friday morning the LSU basketball coach Will Wade announced that the team was "shocked" and "shocked" for Wade's death.
"That's what a man always worries about," said Wade.
The volcano spits the ash across Mexico City
The ash from the Pokathepetl volcano has reached the southern vicinity of Mexico’s capital.
After activity was observed in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours, the National Disaster Prevention Centre on Saturday warned Mexicans that they should not approach the volcano.
The centre observed multiple dip and shaking.
Social media images showed that the vehicle’s windshields in Mexico City, such as the Hochimilko (Xochimilco), were covered with a thin layer of ash.
Geophysicists have noticed the activation of the volcano in the south-east of the capital for 45 miles (72 kilometers), since a 7.1-magitud earthquake shaken the central part of Mexico in 2017.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police conflict with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the confrontation of independence protestors with the public order police and when thousands joined the opposition demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarising vote on separation in Catalonia.
A group of disguised dissociation supporters, who were prevented by public police, tied them with eggs and pulverized them with powder, creating dark dust clouds in the streets, which would normally be full of tourists.
Later that day the clashes broke out, and the policemen used twigs to prevent fights.
For several hours, groups of advocates of independence, saying, "Do not forget and do not forgive!", were involved in confrontation with pro-unitive protestors who spoke: "Spanish Immortality!"
According to local newspapers, 14 people were given medical treatment because of minor injuries during the protests.
One year after the referendum on 1 October, which was declared illegal by Madrid but was praised by the Catalans, the idea of independence in the occupied region remains under great pressure.
The voters were confident in their independence, although the turnout was low, and those who were against separation mostly boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan officials, almost 1 000 people were injured last year, when the police tried to stop voting at election points throughout the region, and there were brutal clashes.
The groups supporting independence had been on Friday night to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but the demonstrators were forced to choose a different path.
Narcis Termes, a 68 - year - old electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, admitted that she no longer hopes that Catalonia would gain independence.
"Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents' eyes filled with tears of joy because they were allowed to vote, but now everything has stopped," he said.
Although the parties that support Catalonia's independence won last year's regional elections with a small but significant victory, they have fought to keep moving this year, as several of the most well-known leaders have either emigrated or are arrested and are waiting for a trial for their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
The 42-year-old mechanic Johann Puig, who filmed a protest on the phone to support the police, said that the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"The tension is getting bigger," he said.
On Saturday, one of the nine Catalan leaders, Oriol Junqueras, who has been under detention until the trial since the previous year, announced that he would stand for elections to the European Parliament the following year.
"Candidation in the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression that the Spanish Government has brought against us," he said.
Londonderija: Men arrested after hitting a car in the building
Three men (33, 34, and 39 years old) were arrested after the car was hit repeatedly against the building in Londonderium.
The incident took place in Balynagard Crecent on Thursday at approximately 19.30 BST.
Detective inspector Bob Blemmings informed that the gates and the building itself were damaged.
It is possible that the car was fired from an arballet at the same time.
Menga's blow lets Livingston 1-0 win the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first gates provided Liwingston's victory
The Supported Livingston stunned Ranger, bringing Steven Gerrard his second loss in 18 games in the role of Ibrox club manager.
Dolly Menga's blow turned out to be decisive, because Gary Holt's team levelled the situation with "Hibernian".
Gerard's team hasn't won in this season, and next Sunday they have to meet the leader of the Hearts, from which they lag by eight points.
Before that, on Thursday in the European League, "Rangers" received Vienna's "Rapid".
Meanwhile, Livingston extended its series to six games in the division without losses, and the main coach, Holt, has still not felt the taste of defeat since the previous month changed Kenny Miller.
Livingston doesn't take a chance against the dim guests
Holt's team had to be in the lead long before they got their words, with their direct game that made it difficult for Ranger in a variety of ways.
Scott Robinson broke out, but delayed his attempt in front of the goal, then Alan Lithgow's attempt to slow the Craig Halkett's blow with his head across the goal line was unsuccessful.
The owners allowed Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they would be able to stop the guests in the planned places.
And that is how the decisive gates arrived.
Ranger allowed for a free-stroke, and Livingston used the corridor, Declan Gallagher and Robinson merged to provide an opportunity for Menga, who beat and scored the gates from the middle of the zone.
At this stage, "Ranger" managed the ball, but the protection of guests turned out to be impenetrable and no one interfered with the goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
This continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos ordered Kelly to save the gate.
Scott Pitman's attempt was interrupted by the agility of the "Rangers" goalkeeper Alan McGregor, and Litgovs threw past the gate in the "Livingston" combination.
In the Livingston area, centred bombs continued to appear, but two calls for punishment were rejected after Halket's fight for a ball with a substitute for Glenn Middleton and for playing by hand.
"Fenomenal" "Livingston" performance - analysis
Scottish BBC Alsdair Lamont in the Tony Maši arena
Phenomenal performance and result of Livingston.
Each of them was excellent, continuing to beat expectations by continuously improving performance.
Their game style and personalities have practically not changed since returning to the highest echelon, but much praise is earned by Holt for the way he has assembled the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great in maintaining a first class of organized protection, while Menga made sure that Connor Goldson and Joe Worral kept alert.
But Ranger lacked inspiration.
No matter how good they were at times under Gerard’s authority, they were far from these standards.
Their last ball was boring — only once they broke into the part of the master's field — and it's basically an invitation to wake up, "Ranger, who is in the middle of the table.
Erdogan in Cologne is expected with mixed feelings
On Saturday (29 September), when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin, there was a lot of smiles and blue sky.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have disagreements on various issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new gigantic mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
The police blocked a crowd of 25,000 people for security reasons, not allowing them to gather in front of the mosque, but many of the supporters came near to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan — many of them Kurds — also expressed their attitude, condemning both Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to take him in.
The protests between the two parties reflect the contradictions created by the guest, some of whom consider the German Turkish to be a hero, while others despise the autocratic.
Road Traffic Accident in Deptford: A cyclist dies in a collision with a car
A cyclist died in London when he crashed a car.
The collision took place at the intersection of Bestwood Street with Evelyn Street, on the road section with intensive traffic in Deptford, south-east of the city, at about 10.15 BST.
The driver stopped and provided medical assistance, but the man died on the scene.
The collision took place several months after another cyclist died on Childers Street, about a mile from the place of the Sunday collision.
The police in the capital city announced that the police were involved in identifying the man and informing his family.
There are closed roads and diverted buses at the location of the event, but car drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Larsin Prison: Six employees injured during the disorder
Prison Administration (Prison Office) reports that six prison staff were injured in riots in a men's strict regime prison.
The riots broke out in HMP Long Lartin prison in Vorchestershire at approximately 9.30 a.m. on BST Sunday and are still ongoing.
In order to prevent riots involving eight prisoners who are confined to one wing, the Tornado Special Service staff were involved
Mild facial injuries were treated at the site of the event.
A representative of the Prison Service stated: "In order to resolve the HMP Long Larsin incident in prison, specially trained prison staff were involved.
Six staff members were given medical assistance due to injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons and say clearly that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend more time behind bars".
There are more than 500 prisoners in HMP Long Larsin prison, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, the prison chief was reported to have been hospitalized following an attack by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the rebels were sent to prison to resolve the serious riots in which the personnel had been attacked by billiard bombs.
Orkan Rosa Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City are threatened with sudden floods (likely to benefit drought-affected areas)
Arizona rarely suffers from tropical depression, but this is likely to happen early next week when Orcan Rose, with the rest of her power, is moving across the desert southwest, causing a sudden flood risk.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning of sudden floods on Monday and Tuesday in the western part of Arizona, in the south and east of Nevada, in southeastern California, and in Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaf, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move right across Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving with the rain late on Monday.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix on Twitter recorded that since 1950, only "ten tropical cyclones maintained the status of tropical storms or depression in a 200-mile (320 km) radius from Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was an Orcany 40 miles (65 km) from the AZ borders."
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict a rainfall of 2-4 inches (~5.08-10.2 cm), reaching up to 6 inches (15.24 cm) in some places.
Other areas in the south-west of the desert, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive 1-2 inches (~2,54-5.08 cm), reaching as much as 4 inches (~ 10.2 cm) in some places.
For those who are not at risk of sudden flooding, Rose's rain can become a blessing because of the drought in the region.
Although the possibility of flooding is a very serious concern, some of the rainfall is likely to be good because the south-west is currently suffering from drought.
According to the US Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category, reported weather.com.
First, hurricane Rose’s road leads to Lower California, Baja California, Mexico, where it will reach its shores.
Rosa still has the force of hurricane on Sunday morning at the maximum wind speed of 85 miles (137 km) per hour, located about 385 miles (~620 km) south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moving north at 12 miles (19 km) per hour.
The storm encounters cooler Pacific waters and therefore slows down.
So it is expected that the hurricane with the force of a tropical storm will reach its coast in Mexico on Monday afternoon or in the morning.
The rainy part of Mexico can be strong, posing a significant risk of flooding.
"It is expected that the rainfall will reach 3-6 inches (7.62-15.24 cm) from Lower California inside the south-west of Sonora, the precipitation is likely to reach 10 inches (25.4 cm)," reported weather.com.
Rosa will move north, across Mexico like a tropical storm, and then reach the Arizona border early in the morning as a tropical depression, which will then cross Arizona and arrive south on Tuesday late in the evening.
"The main threats expected from Rose or its remains are very heavy rainfall in Lower California, the north-western part of Sonora and the U.S. deserted south-west," said the National Centre of Orcano.
This rain is expected to cause life-threatening sudden floods and mud flows in deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20 - year - old man were arrested for attempted murder after a 16 - year - old boy was found in Somerset.
The injured teenager was found in the territory of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at about 4.00 BST.
He was taken to the hospital where his condition remained "stable".
The police informed that 17-year-old and two 18-year-old teenagers, as well as a 20-year-old man, were arrested overnight in Redstock territory, Eivon and Somerset.
The police have asked anyone who could have mobile phone material about what happened.
Tramp claims that Kaveno has suffered from the "evil and anger" of the Democrat Party
"The vote on Judge Kaveno is a vote to reject the cruel and violent tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump announced at the meeting in Wheeling, Western Virginia.
Trump stressed that Kaveno has suffered from the "evil and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kaveno testified before Congress, where she vigorously and emotionally denied any allegations of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford decades ago when both were teenagers.
Ford also testified in the course of his hearing about his accusations.
On Saturday, the President announced that that day, the Americans saw Kaveno's "excellence, ability and courage".
"The vote on the approval of Judge Kaveno is a vote to confirm one of the most educated lawyers of our time with a bright history in connection with the ministry to the people," he announced to the supporter crowd in West Virginia.
President Kaveno referred to the nomination as being lazy when he talked about the importance of the Republican activity in the interim elections.
"Five weeks to one of the most important elections in our time.
I didn't stand as a candidate, but I actually stand as a candidate," he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere fighting for great candidates."
Trump argued that the democrats have undertaken a mission of "protest and resist".
It is expected that the first of the important procedural votes in the Senate on the nomination of Kaveno will take place no later than Friday, CNN informed the Senior Assistant to the Republican Party leadership.
Hundreds of people killed in an earthquake in Indonesia, and it is clear that the number of victims is increasing
Officials reported on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed, many simply washed away when gigantic waves hit the coast after a severe earthquake and tsunami struck Sulawesi in Indonesia.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered on the beach for the festival in Palu, where up to six metres (18 feet) of high waves hit the coast in a chair, rinsing many to death and destroying everything that was on their way.
The Tsunami broke out after a violent earthquake of 7.5 balls.
"When the tsunami threatened yesterday, people were still on the beach and didn't run away immediately, and they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, representative of the Indian disaster relief agency BNPB, informed the briefing in Jakarta.
"The tunami did not arrive alone, it brought cars, logs and buildings, it dragged everything that was on the ground," Nugoro said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the sea at a speed of 800 km/h before it struck the coast (497 mph).
"Many people climbed into trees to save, and survived," he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Pala.
The photographs taken by the disaster agency show many destroyed houses and shops, deformed and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftershocks of the coastal city continued to tremble on Saturday.
The earthquake series was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application stressed in the BPPT's statement that Friday's massive earthquakes produced about 200 times the energy of the nuclear bomb dropped to Hiroshima during World War II.
The location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay may have reinforced the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho devastation was described as "wide" and informed that thousands of homes, hospitals, shops and hotels had collapsed.
He said that the bodies of some victims were found trapped under ruined buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were lost.
Nugroho acknowledged that the number of casualties and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Pala, in an area called Dongala (Dongala), which is located closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
"Communications "was completely destroyed, no information was received from Dongala," said Nugroho.
More than 300 000 people live there," said the Red Cross, adding that its personnel and volunteers travel to the affected regions.
"It's already a tragedy, but everything could have been even worse," the organization informed.
On Saturday, the Agency was widely criticised for not informing that the tsunami had struck Palo, even though officials claimed that the waves arrived at the alert.
The video on social networks reveals that the man on the top floor of the building desperately calls people on the bottom of the street that the tsunami is approaching.
Within a few minutes, the water wall hits the shore, washing away buildings and machines.
Reuters news agency was unable to confirm immediately whether the material is real.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a serious loss of power supply, which cut off the Pala of communication, making it more difficult for officials to coordinate rescue.
The officials announced that the army had begun to send cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still need food and other basic necessities.
The city airport is only open to aid measures and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit Pala on Sunday.
Indonesia's tsunami is more than 800 victims.
That's very bad.
Mr. Doseba said that the workers of the World Vision, who successfully reached the city of Palu from Dongala, and now live in tarpaulins in the backyard of the office, traveled past the scenes of devastation.
"They told us they saw a lot of buildings that had been destroyed," he explained.
That's very bad.
Even when aid groups have resolutely started organising relief efforts for disaster victims, some complained that foreign aid workers with great experience were not allowed to travel to Pala.
According to Indonesian legislation, funding, resources and personnel of overseas organisations will only be allowed to arrive if the disaster area is declared as a national disaster area.
This has not yet happened.
"It is still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Arriani, representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government announces, "OK, this is a national disaster," we will be able to accept international aid, but this status has not yet been defined."
When Palu arrived on the second night after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, friends and family members of unfound people continued to hope that their loved ones would become miracles that would brighten the gloomy life of natural disasters.
A little boy was pulled out of the drain on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescue workers released a woman who had been pressed under rubble for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, a trainer of the Indonesian national paragliders team, had prepared two of the missing paragliders for Asian games that took place earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other people who were trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were their students.
"As an experienced paraglider," he said, "I teach the burden of emotion."
Mr. Gendon remembered that after the news of the breakdown of the Roa Roa hotel spread to the paragliders' team, he desperately sent whatsApp reports for hours to participants in Palu competitions who took part in the beach festival.
However, the result of his reports was only one grey mark, not two blue marks.
"I think it means the messages didn't reach the addressee," he said.
Thieves abducted 26 750 dollars during the ATM filling in the Newport on the Levee complex
According to a statement from the Newport Police Department, thieves stole $26,750 from the Brink's employee on Friday morning, filling the Newport on the Levee ATM.
"The driver of the car emptied the ATM of the entertainment complex and was prepared to fill it with more money," Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While the manager was busy, another man ran "from the back to the Brink's" employee and stole the bag with money for the ATM.
According to the press release, the Witnesses noticed a number of suspicious persons who left the scene, but the police did not specify the number of those involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities should contact the Newport police 859-292-3680.
Kanje West: Reper changes his name to Je
Rapper Kanje West changes his name to Ye (Je).
When announcing the replacement on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The headquarters that previously knew as Kanyi Vestus."
The 41-year-old West had already been called Je for some time and used the nickname "Ye" as the name of his eighth album, which was published in June.
This change takes place before his appearance on the show "Saturday Night Live," in which, as expected, he will release his new album "Yandhi".
The creators of the show tell us that he replaced the singer Arian Grande, who stopped the work "emotional causes".
The West has said that it is not only an abbreviation of his current professional name, but it also has religious significance.
"I believe that "Ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "Tu"," Vest explained earlier this year, discussing the name of his album with Big Boy (Big Boi).
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
At first was Kanje, which means "only one, followed by "Ye", which is reflection on the good and bad in us, on our confusion, on everything.
Album more is reflection on who we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs, known so far as Puff Daddy, Diddy or Diddy, but this year he declared that he preferred the words Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who had previously cooperated with Vestus, also has and has not used the sign of thought and capital letters.
The elected Mexican President promises not to use the army against civilians
The elected Mexican President, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has promised never to use military force against civilians during the 50th anniversary of the bloody retaliation of students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday to "never use the army to oppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, military units shot a peaceful demonstration, killing up to 300 people at a time when left-minded student movements spread throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has sworn to support young Mexicans by issuing monthly grants to students and opening up more public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of education are driving young people into criminal gangs.
U.S. funding for artificial intelligence should be doubled
As China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in this field, explains the investor and artificial intelligence practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments were made after various US government bodies have made statements on artificial intelligence, although the US as a whole lacks a strategy in the field of artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, China launched its plan last year: its aim is to become a leading country in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"A double budget for artificial intelligence research will be a good start, considering that all the other countries are so backwards in the US, and the next radical turn in the field of artificial intelligence is expected," said Lee.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said that doubling the funding could double the possibility that the next achievement in the field of artificial intelligence would take place in the USA.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harbour, CEO of "Sinovation Ventures", who has invested in one of the most prominent artificial intelligence companies in China "Face++".
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University to create a system of artificial intelligence that beats America's best Othello (Reversi) player, but later he was a senior employee of Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee recognized the previous technology competition organised by the US government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be prepared to identify people with ideas for the future.
"Scientists in the United States often have to work very hard to get government grants," said Li.
"It's not China that attracts leading scientists, it's the big companies," he explained.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university luminaries to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee added that changes in immigration policy could also help the US to improve its achievements in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that green cards should be automatically given to people with a PhD in artificial intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China published its next generation artificial intelligence development plan.
Lee explained that the Chinese National Science Foundation provides funding for people in academic institutions, similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organisations, which allocates money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
This year, the U.S. Defense Department (U.S. Defense Department) established a joint artificial intelligence centre, which will bring together partners from industry and academia, and White Nam announced the creation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA (Central Research and Development Organisation of the US Ministry of Defence) announced a $2 billion investment in the initiative called "AI Next".
The National Science Foundation, on the other hand, now invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation, which was tasked with establishing a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has not been operational for several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on change of name
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", taking a step that will prevent decades of disagreement with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's requests for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, emphasises that its northern neighbour's name is a sign of opposition to its territory and has vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
Both governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalists in the opposition insist that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in a referendum, and the campaign calling for boycott has raised concerns whether the turnout will reach the minimum of 50% required for the referendum to be recognised as valid.
The referendum bulletin asks: "Are you in favour of membership in NATO and the EU by means of an agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying on their way to Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the break-up of Yugoslavia, becoming an organisation, such as an EU and NATO member.
"I have come to vote for the future of the country, for Macedonian young people, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament have declared that they will take into account the outcome of the vote, which will become decisive.
A change in the name will require a 2/3 majority in parliament.
The National Electoral Commission informed that no violations had been reported by 1 p.m..
However, the activity was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in previous parliamentary elections, where 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said 62-year-old Giose Tanevski, a voter in the capital of Skopje.
The Macedonian Prime Minister, Zoran Zayev, his wife, Zorica and their son, Dushko, handed over their votes in a referendum in Macedonia on the change of name, which will open the way to NATO and the European Union, to Strumica in Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov, prepared a small stage and arranged chairs at tents put on by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to stand up with our heads, not through the door of our servants," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a small country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China or Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zayev claims that membership of NATO will start the necessary investments in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate exceeds 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority will give a vote for, the more than 80"per cent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zayev said after giving a vote.
He said that the result "yes" "will confirm our future".
The survey published last Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research shows that 30-43 percent of voters will take part in the referendum, less than the required activity.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian "Telma TV" found that 57 percent of the voters were planning to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them replied that they would vote in favour.
For a referendum to be successful, voters must have 50 percent and another vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the Western-oriented government that came to power last May.
Watch: The "City" of Manchester Sergio Aguero shoots through the whole "Brighton" protection to get the goal
Serhio Agvero and Raheem Sterling won the Brighton protection allowing Manchester "City" on Saturday at the "Etihad" stadium in Manchester, England to win with 2:0.
Agvero gave the impression that his goal score at 65 minutes was ridiculously light.
The Argentinian attacker received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the combination.
He ran out between the three Brighton guards, and went inside the free space.
Then Agvero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He took the ball for one guard, then outruns several more Brighton at the edge of the field.
Then he made a pass to the left, reaching Sterling.
The English center attacker used his first touch to play back at Agvero, who used the right football boot to defeat the Brigton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan, hitting the ball on the right side of the network.
"Agvero is struggling with foot problems," Pep Guardiola, manager of "City" told the reporters.
"We discussed playing with him in 55, 60 minutes.
That is exactly what happened.
We were lucky that he got the gate at that time.
But it was Sterling, which provided Sky Blues with an initial advantage in the Premier League's wrestling.
The gate was reached in 29 minutes.
Agvero got the ball deep into the Brighton.
He sent the ball with a beautiful blow along the eggs of Leroy Sane's left leg.
Sane made several blows until he entrusted Sterling to take the ball to the farthest gate.
The Sky Blues center attacker easily sent a bomb into the network just before crossing the border.
"City" fights with Hoffenheim Champion League group games on Tuesday at 12.55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Zinshai, Germany.
Shercer wants problems at Rockies
Since "Nationals" does not participate in the defeat games, there was no reason to restart.
But Scherzer, who is always ready to compete, hopes to take advantage of the opportunity against Colorado "Rockies" on Sunday, but only if "Rockies" is in actual exclusion games. And "Rockies" in the Western Group of the National League is in the lead with one game against Los Angeles "Dodgers".
"Rockies" has issued at least a white card with a Friday night at 5:2 winning "Nationals", but still has not won their first title in the division.
"Although we're playing the same thing, we can at least have fun knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver, with the crowd and the other team, will probably be the most annoying I will be facing this year.
And why wouldn't I like to compete?"
Nationals have not yet announced who will start the game on Sunday, but they say they're ready to let Shercer throw.
On Thursday, Shercer, for whom it will be the beginning of the 34th, did a litter session in the "bullpen" part of the out-of-field, and on Sunday he will throw the ball during his normal rest.
Washington Labroc is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikes 220 2/3 inning in this season.
Trump hosts rallies in West Virginia
The President referred to the situation in which the candidate of the Supreme Court Brett Kaveno, chosen by him, has entered, while also talking about the importance of the activity of the Republican electorate in the interim elections.
"Everything we've done is under threat in November.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
It is really very, very serious — I didn't stand as a candidate, but actually I did, and that's why I'm everywhere and I'm fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say, "You see this terrible, terrible group of radical democrats who are acting right now.
And they are determined to regain power, using all possible means to achieve the goal. You see evil, repugnant actions.
They don't care what they're going to hurt, who they have to break in order to gain power and control, that's why they want power and control, and we won't give it to them."
The democrats, he said, have undertaken the mission of "protest and resist".
"And you yourself have seen it in the last four days," he pointed out, calling the democrats "wonderful, evil, naughty and false."
He named the Senator of the Senate's Committee on Justice's Democrat Party Dianne Feinstein, to whom the audience responded with loud cries.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Hmm, what are we talking about?
No, hmm, wait -- it was really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer ready for diversity.
It is intolerant of the open
It was no wonder that Momentum activists in my local party wanted me to be censored.
After all, I am the last Labour Party MP to date, who said that he was not desirable, because we do not hide our opinion.
My colleague in the parliament, Joan Ryan, was similarly offended because she took a firm stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the movement criticised me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of economically responsible policies, of national security, of Europe – ironic, but these were issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the Labour Summit in the eastern part of Nottingham says on Friday that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Most of the meetings that took place during my career as a Member of my local Labour Parliament were exactly that.
Unfortunately, the atmosphere in many meetings today is different and promises of a "kinder, more gentle" policy have long been forgotten, if any.
It has become increasingly clear that the Labour Party does not want to tolerate different views, and any view is judged according to whether it is acceptable to the party's leadership.
It started soon after Jeremy became the leader: colleagues, who I think have similar political views, began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and accept views that I would never have agreed to in other cases, whether they are national security or a single EU market.
When I speak publicly, and basically it doesn't matter what I'm saying, I'm following a tide about using social networks, calling for a ban on standing in the next elections, exposing the centre's policy, claiming that I have no place in the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments against me are usually political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a stream of sexist and racist insults every day, but never try to escape silently.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how normal exploitation has become.
Jeremy Corbin said last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer an organisation that is ready for diversity of views and with every expression of distrust or change of selection rules, the party is shrinking.
In the last two years, I have often been advised not to jump to the harrows, think what I'm talking about, and then "everything will be fine" with me.
But that's not why I decided to get involved in politics.
Since I joined the Labour class 32 years ago as a student in response to the neglect of the government in Tescher that had literally led my integrated school class to collapse, I set out to fight for better public services for those who need them most, both as a member of the local council and as a minister of the government.
I have never concealed my political views, nor in previous elections.
No one in the East of Nottingham had reason to doubt my position on political matters and in areas where I disagreed with the existing government.
To those who made the proposal on Friday, I can only say that at a time when the country is moving decisively towards Brexis, which will harm households, companies and our public services, I do not understand the desire to spend such time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But basically the only thing I want to announce is not for Nottingham's Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are Labour Members: I am proud to be able to serve you, and I promise that no threat of disqualification or reminders that no one is irreplaceable in politics will stop me from doing what I think is best for all of you.

"Ayr" 38 - 17 "Melrose": Unmanned "Ayr" reaches the highest line in the table
The last two attempts are possible to some extent split the final result, but there is no doubt that "Ayr" deserves to triumph in this amazingly exciting match of the Scottish Championship today.
Now they're at the top of the table, the only unscathed team of ten.
After all, it was both their great protection, as well as a much better use of the opportunities that led the owners, and coach Peter Murchie has every reason to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in all our games and we're still not defeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
"Melrose" Robin Christie: "All respect for "Ayr", they used their opportunities better than we did."
Grant Anderson's attempt at 14 min, by Frazier Climo, raised Ayr, but the yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, where Warriors was awarded, changed the numbers of Melrose, and Jason Baggot grabbed an unrealized ball.
Klimo increased the management of "Ayr" with punishment, right at the end of half-time, he scored points, then realized the solo attempt, so "Ayr" went out by 17-5.
But Melrose started halfway with a good game, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which Begot implemented, reduced the gap to 5 points.
Then there was a long break, because Ruaridh Knott suffered a serious injury and was taken away from the field to the stretchers, but when the game resumed at Ayr, it moved rapidly forward when Stafford McDowall made an attempt that was carried out by Klimo.
The captain of Ayr, Blair Macpherson, then received a yellow card, and again, after intense pressure, Melrose used an excess player, with Bruce Colvine, an attempt that was not realized.
However, the landlords fraught, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for grabbing Klimo without a bomb, from the penalty corridor, McFerson carried out a tachdaun at the back of the Ayr jetty.
Klimo carried out the ball, as before, almost from the resumption itself, after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong's kick field and sent a flagging player to Gregor Henry's fifth attempt.
Still Game star seems to plan a new career in the restaurant business
Ford Kieran, star of the "Still Game" series, seems to be planning to enter the hospitality business because he has been identified as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show he is creating and participating in with his old partner in comedy Greg Hemphill.
Duet has announced that the next ninth season will be the last show, and Cyrennan is apparently planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official information, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, even though the Scottish Sun source pointed out that Kiernan planned to enter Glasgow's "fashioning restaurant business".
"The sea belongs to us!": Bolivia, trapped on dry land, hopes that the court will open its way to the Pacific Ocean
The seamen patrol the Flotte State in La Paz.
Public buildings have raised the blue flags of the ocean.
Fleet-based ships from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are decorated with the motto: "We have the right to the sea.
It's our duty to get it back."
In the dry country of Bolivia, memories of Chile’s bloody conflict of the 19th century about the lost coastline are still alive, as is the longing to sail back into the Pacific Ocean.
These expectations have probably been highest for decades, as Bolivia awaits the judgment of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of review.
"Bolivia is developing, it is united and peaceful in its spirit, and, of course, with positive thoughts awaits the outcome," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many booliers will watch the International Court of Justice's judgment on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague Tribunal will decide in favour of Bolivia's request that, after several decades of interruption in negotiations, Chile's duty is to discuss the granting of a sovereign sea exit to Bolivia.
The charismatic president of the Bolivian local origin, Evo Morales, who is awaiting a controversial fight for the re-election next year, is also very interested in Monday's judgment.
"We are close to recovering the Pacific Ocean," he excited at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the judgment in favour of Bolivia is unlikely, and if it is adopted, no major change is expected.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no mandate to grant Chilean territory and its representatives have said that they will not determine the outcome of the negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice is passed just six months after the final examination shows that the case was "not complicated" explained by the international normative expert Paz Zárate from Chile.
And the last four years have not moved the Bolivian case forward, but on the contrary, they have delayed it.
"The question of access to the sea has been misappropriated by the current Bolivian administration," said Zarate.
Morales' militant rhetoric has stifled the rest of her good will, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will sometimes continue to negotiate, but after this it will be very difficult to maintain a discussion.
Both countries have not exchanged for envoys since 1962.
Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, former president, Edwardo Rodríguez Veltzé, did not agree that the court ruled at an unusually fast pace.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and the opportunity "to put an end to 139 years of conflict that will benefit both sides," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used sea issues as political cops.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"This decision is an opportunity to understand what needs to be done to overcome the past."
North Korea will give up nuclear weapons only when it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that his people would never first remove their nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
He spoke on Saturday in the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to live up to the promises made during the meeting of the leaders of both countries in Singapore.
His comments were made at a time when it seems that the US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, is ready to resume the stalemate diplomatic efforts to prevent the nuclear war, more than three months after the meeting with North Korean leader Kim Chenun.
Ri claims that it is a "fantasy" to hope that the US has still not lifted the sanctions and the unwillingness to declare the end of the Korean war will ever make North Korea kneel.
Washington is cautious about agreeing to the declaration before Pyongyang will take significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
However, many are sceptical as to whether Phenjana really wants to give up armaments that the state probably sees as the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo intends to visit Pompeo next month to prepare for the next Kim's meeting with Trump.
Paris Fashion Show presents the latest massive headset line on the way to the nearest High Street
If you want to increase your hat collection or block the sun completely, then you are in the right place.
Designers Valentino and Tom Browne presented the audience with a row of absurd, huge head-to-head items in the 2019 Spring/Summer Season Collection, which dazzled against the backdrop of the Paris Fashion Week style.
Very impractical hats have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their stunning achievements to show fashion.
Valentino’s most outstanding design was a magnificent beige hat decorated with a wide edge of feathers that devours the heads.
Among the massive accessories were precious watermelons, magic hat and even pineapples — but they are not designed to keep your heads warm.
Tom Brown also showed a strange selection of masks, just before Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sewn lips, and they served Hanibal Lector rather than the high fashion.
One of the formations resembled the diving, tube, and glasses of breathing apparatus, while another resembled a melted ice cream cone.
And if you want to continue with massive fashion, it's time.
Style observers believe that huge fescues are possible on the way to High Street closest to you.
Large - scale hats immediately became popular after "La Bomba" appeared — straw hats with two feet (~60 cm) wide appear to have worn all from Rianna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The status of very impractical hats as a cult object in all social networks led to another big product on the tongue — a straw beach bag, almost as big as a swimsuit-dressed model that carried it.
Red-yellow Rafia bag, dressed with Rafia fringes and equipped with a white leather handle, took a special place in the 2019 spring/summer season collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera at the Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage explained to FEMAIL: "I expect large hats and beach bags to appear in central business street stores next summer, because the designer has left the impression that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for huge-sized accessories."
John Edwards: Knowledge of languages is vital for the citizens of the world
The Scottish independent schools have a reputation for excellence and have maintained it in 2018, when outstanding exam results were once again obtained, which are further enhanced by individual and collective achievements in sport, arts and music and other social events.
These schools, attended by a total of 30,000 students in Scotland and represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to ensure the best level for their students and their parents.
Independent schools have set the goal of preparing their students for further and higher education, their careers and their lives as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can develop and implement special school programmes, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable subject in our schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to a person in a language that he understands, it stays in his consciousness.
If you speak his mother tongue, it remains in his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot simply rely on English when we want to establish relations and gain the trust of people from other countries.
In view of the recent results of this year's exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the largest number of exams passed in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who taught foreign languages reached the A.
The Scottish Council of Independent Schools data on 74 schools show that 72 percent of students scored A in Chinese and 72 percent in German, 69 percent in French, and 63 percent in Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language, as an optional subject, is now valued as highly in independent school programmes as subjects of the science-technology-engineering and mathematics group.
A 2014 survey by the British Commission for Employment and Skills revealed that 17 percent of employers reported a lack of language skills as a reason for not being able to fill vacancies.
As a result, language skills are increasingly becoming compulsory to prepare young people for their future careers.
With increased job opportunities requiring language skills, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of their chosen career, learning a foreign language will bring them a real future advantage from such a long-term learning.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically improve the competitiveness of a multi-language specialist.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in Britain, 75 percent did not know the language well enough to keep the conversation going, but the French was the only one with a double-digit number of people, 15 percent.
That is why the contribution to language teaching is important for today's children.
A number of languages, especially in developing countries, will provide children with better opportunities for meaningful work.
Schools in Scotland differ in terms of the languages taught.
Some schools will focus more on the most common modern languages, while others will teach languages, such as Chinese and Japanese, which are considered to be the most important for Britain's future, in line with the plans for 2020.
Whatever your child is interested in, independent schools will always be able to choose from several languages and teachers will be specialists in the field.
Scotland's independent schools are committed to providing a language environment that will equip children and provide them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future may be.
At the moment, in the global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still vitally important for the future of the country, therefore this fact must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be regarded as "the skills of international communication".
Independent schools will continue to offer Scottish young people this choice, diversity and excellence.
Il faut bien le faire (It must be done).

Lebron will debut in "Lakers" composition on Sunday in San Diego
Fans have finally waited for Lebron's first game to take place as part of Los Angeles "Lackers".
Walker coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play on Sunday before the opening of the season against Denver's Nuggets San Diego.
But there is still time to decide how many minutes he will play.
"It will be more than one, but less than 48," Volton informed "Lakers" on the official website.
"Lakers" reporter Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James would probably play a limited number of minutes.
Continuing his practice this week, James was asked about his plans for a series of six pre-season "Lackers".
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season games to prepare," he said.
Tramp rally in West Virginia, YouTube
President Donald Trump is launching a series of rallies today in Wyling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five Trampla's scheduled rendezvous next week, including stopping in friendly places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since the vote on his choice to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court has been suspended, Trump's aim is to gain support in the forthcoming interim elections, as there is a risk that the Republicans will lose control of Congress after the votes were cast in November.
At what time is Trump's meeting in West Virginia going to take place today and how can you watch it online?
Tramp is scheduled for seven evenings, after ET today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Tramp in West Virginia online on YouTube.
It is expected that Trump will talk about hearing this week in the case of the candidate of the Supreme Court Bret Kaveno, which has been made tense by indictments in sexual crimes, and a vote of the Senate is expected to postpone confirmation for a week while the FBI will investigate.
However, the main aim of this mission is to help improve the situation of the Republicans, who are expected to hold elections in November.
President Trump's campaign therefore shows that this five-team next week's mission is "to activate volunteers and supporters, while the Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority they own in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to "Reuters".
"Congression control is so important for his agenda that the president will visit as many states as possible, because we are launching an active campaign season," the campaign representative of Trump, who did not want to reveal his name, said, "Reuters".
This evening's event at Wesbanco Arena in Wesbanco Arena will probably attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and this will be reflected in the Pittsburgh media," says West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month when Trump will visit West Virginia, the state in which he won with more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia senator's candidate Patrick Morrisey, who lags behind according to surveys.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the President has to come to help improve his results in polls," said Simon Haeder, professor of political science at West Virginia University.
Rider Cup 2018: The United States has demonstrated its determination to fight to keep high expectations for Sunday singles
After three sessions in the "common words" Wednesday afternoon game format "foursome" was possible exactly what is needed for this Rider Cup.
Athletes love to talk about the fluctuations of success, and they really believe that, especially in competitions like these.
So, what side do they think is luck now?
"They were in the lead with six points, but now with four, so I think it means in a way that success has turned to us," said Jordan Spieth when he went in his course.
Europe, of course, has priority, because it is in the lead with 4 points, but 12 more will be played out.
Spite explained that the Americans believe that the wind blows in their sails and that they have cause for optimism, of course, also in the person of Spit and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long, and each of them can be proud of three out of four points.
The hoove has been destructive from the place of the first blow to the lawn, and is an example of the winner.
Those wise victories became more louder when his round continued, a decisive blow was made in the hole to achieve four times the same number of strikes when he and Thomas had fallen behind two after two.
His blow in the hole, which achieved their victory in 15, was perceived by a similar cry, of them, of his belief that the American team has not yet been excluded.
"There is really a need to dig deep, and worry about your match," spite said.
That's all that's left for these players.
18 holes to succeed.
The only players who have scored more in the last two days than Stoe and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who will undoubtedly enter the history of this Rider Cup.
Europe's strange but attractive couple lags by four points and will not be able to harm.
Molivud was the only couple who lived without bogie on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogies on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and nine of the last pits on Friday morning.
This process and the way their energy flows to this crazy crowd and back convinces them that they are players to win on Sunday, and Flietwood with Molinari will be the most popular players who can ensure a potential European victory when the sun comes down over the Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different pits.
However, the talk of European triumph was premature.
Babba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly coped with this morning's hero in "fourbals" format Sergio Garcia, who played with Alex Noren.
Boggy and the two double fronts led the Spaniards and Swedish troubles, and they were not even near to get out of it.
On Sunday, however, there is no one to help.
In the formats of "fourball" and "foursome" games, it is so exciting to watch in the vicinity because of the interaction of couples, to watch what advice they give, and what not, and how the strategy can instantly change the situation.
Europe has played better as a team up to now, and has been a long lead before the last day, but this competition in the form of "foursome" showed that the US team is determined to fight for which many, especially "Stateside", have questioned.
European team on the last day of the Radera Cup leads 10-6
The European team will start the last day of the Rider Cup in a pleasant lead after the Saturday fourball and foursome race ended in lead with 10-6 against the United States.
The inspired couple Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari were lead by two victories over the hardworking Tyger Woods, which increased the score of the Le Golf National to four.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, to save the trophy lost by "Hazelin" two years ago, dominated over the imprecise American team in the morning race in "fourballs" format, and the series score became 3-1.
The United States resisted more vigorously in the form of "foursomes", winning two matches, but failed to close the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needs 8 points on Sunday 12 single-games to save the trophy.
Flietwood is the first European first-year-old to win four points in a row with Molinaris, called Molliwood after a sensational weekend, only the second couple in the history of the Rider Cup, who scored four points in the first four matches.
In the "fourballs" format of defeated Woods and Patrick Reed, they defeated tired Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with an even more sympathetic score of 5 & 4.
Woods, who won two games on Saturday, occasionally showed a great game, but he has lost 19 out of 29 matches in "fourballs" and "foursomes" formats, seven in a row.
Justin Rose retreated before the morning games "fourballs", returned to partner Henrik Stanson's "foursomes" to defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka with 2 & 1 in the world ranking.
Europe failed to fully catch up, even though the day in the south-west of Paris was a pleasant and light wind.
The winner of the three - time top golf competition, Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas, set a benchmark for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They extorted 2&1 against Spanish John Rahm and Ian Poulter in "fourballs" format and returned later to defeat Polter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 "foursomes" after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of Riders Cup, the team has played back 4 point in deficit singles, but, as the owners, Farikas (Furyk) team is enough with a draw to save the trophy.
After being in the second place for two days, as it looks, Sunday's counterattack will be problematic.
North Korea stated that in the "nothing" case will not disarm unilaterally, without trust
The North Korean Foreign Minister informed the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions deepened its distrust of the United States, and North Korea will not unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho informed the World Organization's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant steps of goodwill" over the past year, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of a nuclear testing site and the promise never to spread nuclear weapons and technologies.
"However, we don't see a proper US response," he said.
"If there is no confidence in the US, there will be no faith in the security of our country, and under such circumstances we will never unilaterally disarm the first."
Although Ri repeated the well-known criticisms of North Korea about Washington's resistance to a "gradual" approach to denuclearisation, according to which Korea will be rewarded for the gradual steps taken, his statement made an impression because it did not automatically reject unilateral denuclearisation, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Chenun and Donald Trump at a first-ranking meeting of the US President and North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work towards the "denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula" and Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has tried to officially end the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States has stated that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also failed to give in to the call for a relaxation of the serious international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The U.S. insists that "denuclarisation must be first" and increases the level of pressure imposed by sanctions to achieve the goal by force, even opposing "the declaration of the end of the war", said Ri.
"The idea that sanctions could put us on our knees is empty fantasies cherished by people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions only deepens our distrust."
Ri was not talking about the intentions of Kim's second meeting with Trump, which the US leader had mentioned in particular during his speech at the United Nations this week.
In his speech, the Minister highlighted three meetings with South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If South Korea were the other half of this issue of denuclearisation, rather than the US, the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead end."
However, Ri's tone of speech was dramatically different from what he said last year when he declared in the UN General Assembly that pointing North Korea's missiles to the U.S. mainland was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "missile" in a suicide mission.
This year, in the United Nations, Trump, who had threatened to "destroy" North Korea in the past year, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps towards disarmament, but stressed that there was still a long way to go, and sanctions should be maintained until North Korea is denuclearised.
On Wednesday Trump announced that he had not planned a specific time, stressing that "it is not important whether it will take two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia stress that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for what he has done.
However, the US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council's sanctions must be vigorously continued, without making mistakes, until definitive and convincing denuclearisation is achieved."
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions since 2006 in an attempt to bring the funding of the Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic weapons programmes to an end.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the United Nations General Assembly and then informed that he would again visit Pompeo next month to prepare for the other meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip was not successful.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made, but in just a few hours North Korea accused him of "deserving demands".
North Korea's meeting with Mun this month committed to dismantle the weapons landfill and also the nuclear complex if the US takes "appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim had informed him that the "appropriate measures" that North Korea wants to see are the security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and the steps to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard University students will learn a subject about how to relax enough
A new subject at Harvard University this year has made students sleep more, and it is an attempt to counter the increasingly popular brutal culture of caffeine-filled study all night long.
One teacher found that students at the best university in the world often do not even have a basic knowledge of how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, as well as a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a subject that he considers to be the first such subject in the United States.
Inspiration to create a new subject for him arose after speaking about the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
"In the end, a girl came up to me and asked, "Why do I have this story only now that I am in the last year?"
She found that no one had ever explained to her the importance of sleep — what surprised me was what he said at Telegraph.
This year, the first study subject released for the first time, provides students with basic information on how good sleep habits contribute to the achievement of learning and sport, as well as improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, and the executive director of the university’s health services, reported that the university decided to introduce a course of training after learning that the students suffered a serious lack of sleep during the week of study.
The hour-long training process includes a series of interactive tasks.
One of the parts is a picture of dormitories doors, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books to learn about caffeine and light effects and how performance in sports is affected by lack of sleep and the importance of a bedtime routine.
In another part, students are informed about how prolonged lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
Then the student campus map with interactive icons invites participants to rethink their daily routine.
"We know that this will not change student behaviour immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know. Just as you have the right to know how smoking cigarettes will affect your health," said Professor Cheisler.
He said that a culture that boasts the ability to learn all night still exists, and he added that modern technologies and increasing pressure on students meant that lack of sleep became an increasingly serious problem.
He explained that sufficient quality sleep provision should be a student's "secret weapon" to combat stress, overload and anxiety, and even to prevent weight gain, because lack of sleep turns the brain into starvation mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheysler develop a subject after attending one of the professor's lectures last year, in Harvard's first year.
He said that the subject had opened his eyes and inspired him to make the course available to the whole student campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask students who obtain post-graduate education to acquire a similar programme before going out to enjoy competition.
Professor Cheysler recommends that students install an alarm clock not only for the time they get up, but also when you go to sleep, as well as keep in mind how people are harmed by the "blue lights" emitted by electronic devices and LED lamps, because they can disrupt the rhythms of the day, making it difficult to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Ranger: Menga's gates overthrow Gerard's men
Another sad game was hit by Ranger when Dolly Menga beat Steven Gerrard's confused team decided to lose 1-0 against Livingston.
The team of "Ibrox" hoped to win the first race since February 4:1 triumph "St Johnstone", but the team of Gary Holt brought Gerard his second loss in 18 games since he became a club manager, and his team is 8 points away from the leader of the Scottish Championship "Hearts".
Menga hit the ball at the goal seven minutes before the end of half-time, and the lack of inspiration of "Rangers" did not look like an attempt to smooth the score.
Ranger falls to the sixth place, while Livingston steps to the third, and in terms of the difference of the gate, it only surpasses Hibernian.
And another problem may arise for Ranger, because Judge Assistant Calum Spence needed medical assistance due to head injury, which was apparently caused by the object of the far-reaching death.
Gerard made eight changes to his team, which quickly left behind the Ayr, reaching the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livingston 11 players who took one point from Hearts last week, and he would be happy to see his well-made team oppressing opponents in every episode.
It is possible that Ranger managed the ball more often, but Livingston made better use of what they did.
They had to get a goal two minutes after the beginning, when Menga's first hand sent Scott Pittman to the Allan McGregor Gateway, but the centre player missed his big chance.
Then a distant Keaghan Jacobs hit Captain Craig Halkett but his partner in defence, Alan Lithgow, was able to send the ball only far past the rear pole.
Ranger took control, but the impression was that playing in the last third is hoped, not believed to happen.
Alfredo Morelos doubtless believed that he had to be beaten at 15 minutes, after he had been in contact with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected the request of the Colombian.
"Ranger" made only two hits at the target in the first half of the time, but the former "Ibrox" goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not particularly interfere with, neither Lassana Coulibaly's head hit, nor the modest end of Ovie Ejaria's attack.
Although what began at Liwingston in the 34th minute might have changed the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it already for their efforts.
Ranger couldn't handle Jacobs' long planned combination again.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher was broadcasting the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept balance and chose Menga for a simple end.
Gerard switched from Kulibali to Ryan Kent, and this almost immediately affected the game, as the midfielder sent the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly from his line stopped blocking immediately.
But Liwingston continued to make guests play as they like, doing one long hit after another by Litgov and Halket.
Holt's team could have continued to lead at the final stage, but McGregor played well by stopping Jacobs before Litgov kicked his head from the corner.
Ranger's substitute, Glenn Middleton, asked for another hit late in the game, after he had been in contact with Jacobs, but Tomson ignored the request again.
Almanach: Inventor of Geiger Meter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning almanah: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today... one day Johannes Wilhelm's Hans Geiger, who grew up as a physicist, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of measuring and measuring radioactivity, the result of which was, after all, a device known as the Geiger counter.
The science-based and preserved Geiger numerator has taken his place in pop culture as well, for example, in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, where externally unconvincing cowboy scientists Rogers and Dale Evans played their main roles:
Man, "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger meter used to find radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you'll be able to hear how the atoms released by these minerals work."
Evans: "Really, it really pops."
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention named after him continues to live.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "see" the evil cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "see" the evil cells and kill them
Vaccines in the treatment teach the immune system to recognise evil cells
Using this method, the patient acquires immune cells that are converted into a laboratory
Then they would be able to "see" a protein that is characteristic of many malignant tumors, and will be injected back into the body
The test vaccine has shown promising results in patients with various types of malignancy.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that taught her immune system to recognise the bad cells had lost more than 18 months of ovarian cancer.
The method is to obtain cells from the patient's immune system, convert them into a laboratory to be able to "see" several tumours of the protein HER2, and then inject these cells back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, at the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Merilland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes the growth of several types of malignancy," including breast, ovarian, lung and colon and rectal cancer, explains Professor Berzovskis.
A similar approach to the patient’s acquisition of immune cells that were ‘instructed’ by attacking cancer cells has been effective in one form of leukaemia.
After a visit to the SNL, Kanye West, dressed in a maga hat, attacked Trump’s critics.
It didn't end well
Kanye West was pulled out at the "Saturday Night Live" studio after an incoherent performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and announced that he would stand for the 2020 presidential election.
After finishing that evening's third song, titled Ghost Town, during which he wore the Make America Great hat, he began to barge loud phrases about democrats and repeatedly stressed his support for Trump.
"So many times when I speak to the white people, they ask, "How can you like Trump? He's a racist!"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
"Saturday Night Live" began with a parody with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's Judicial Committee on the charge of Christine Blasey Ford in a sexual attack.
Although it was not broadcast, the material was loaded on social networks by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to mock Vest in this way.
And Vest lamented the audience that he had been mistreated behind the scenes because of his headlace.
"They ridiculed me behind the scenes!
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat in your head!"
They mocked me!
And they said I've lost touch with reality," said West, according to "Washington Examiner".
The West continued: "Gribath to see what happens when you lose touch with reality?", and promised to put on "your Superman cape", because it means you can't tell me what I do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love!"
"Variety" reported that his comments caused the whistles of the viewers at least twice, but the team members of the show looked confused, and at least one person told the press: "There was complete silence in the studio."
Vestus was invited at the last minute to replace the singer Ariana Grande, who had died a few days ago by a friend rapper Mac Miller.
The vest confused many with the song (I Love it) he performed in a champagne bottle suit.
Vestus was supported by the conservative leader of the group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "One of the strongest people in the spirit: PATEICOS, THAT DO NOT EXPECT A DRUTH!"
However, the conversation director Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West simply "was what he is, and it's wonderful."
"But I choose not to reward a person (buying his music or clothing, or supporting his 'art'), who, I believe, supports and barns with ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And we too," she added.
Before this show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he had now become "a presence previously known as Kanyi Westu".
He is not the first artist to change his name, and acts in the same way as Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper Snoop Dogg used to be Snoop Lion, and, of course, the legend of late music Prince, changed his name to a symbol, but then to a "view artist, formerly known as Prince".
Indicted in attempt to murder for stabbing at the Belfast restaurant
A 45 - year - old man is accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed on Friday at a restaurant in eastern Belfast.
The police informed that the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The accused is expected to appear before the Magistrate of Belfast on Monday.
The prosecutions will be examined by the Public Prosecution Service.
Kit Harrington, the star of the Throne Game, is fighting against the toxic manliness
Kit Harrington is known as the sword-blowing John Snow HBO's cruel medieval fantasy series "Trone Games".
However, a 31 - year - old actor has turned against the stereotype of a brutal hero, saying that such characters on the screen often make young boys think that they should be strong to be respected.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kits explained that he thought he had "a problem" and asked how to deal with the toxic manhood in the #MeToo era.
Kitt, who recently married his "Trone Games" partner, Rose Leslie, also at 31 years of age, admitted that the problem was important to him.
"I couldn't think of what mistakes we made with our husbands right now," he said.
"What do we teach young men in terms of this problem when they grow up in view of the existing problem?"
Kits believes that television with his very masculine characters may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic manhood.
He went on to say, "What is inherited, but what is taught?
What is being taught on TV and the streets that make young boys feel that they need to be perceived as men?
I think this is one of the most important issues of our time: how can we change it?
Because there are clearly problems with young men."
In the interview he also admitted that he would not participate in any follow-up to "Trone Games" or prīkvela, after the series will end next summer, stressing that "the battlefields and horses are tired".
Starting from November, Kit will play a key role in the restored "True West" by Sam Shepard, which is a story about the film producer and his brother robber.
The actor recently admitted that he considered his meeting with his wife, Rose, to be the best thing that happened to him as a result of the Throne Games.
"I met my wife on this show, since it somehow provided my present family and my life from that moment on," he said.
The fantasy series won by Rose Emmy was played by Kitt's personality John Snow's favourite Igrit.
A couple married in June 2018 in the family property of Leslie in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reported a rapid increase in the number of its people living with HIV and AIDS by 14%.
Health officials report that more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The majority of new cases were the result of sexual relations, indicating a change.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly to some parts of China as a result of transfusion of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has fallen to almost zero, with Chinese health officials reporting at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, from one year on, the number of people living in China with HIV and AIDS has increased to 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual relations is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT people is common.
In view of the conservative values of the country, research estimates that between 70 and 90% of men who have had sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many cases of transmission of sexually transmitted diseases are the result of under-protected sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that the employee leaked the data of the Republicans senators, turned against "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, Maxine Waters, the US House of Representatives denied statements that her staff member had published personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on the websites of Wikipedia legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat insisted that the claims are distributed by the whiskeys and Internet sites of the "ultra right".
"Believes, lies and even more contemptible lies," said Watersa in her statement on Twitter.
The information leaked has been reported to include residence addresses and telephone numbers belonging to the U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Haatch from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, it was published by an unknown person from Congress, at the time when hearing about charges of Brit Kaveno nominated to the Supreme Court in sexually immoral conduct took place in the group of the Senate.
The leak occurred some time after three senators had interviewed Kaveno.
Conservative, web sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the origin of the records was linked to the Waters office, and revealed information about the staff of Waters, informed Hills.
"This unsubstantiated statement is absolutely false and utter lies!" insisted Waters.
"My staff member, whose identity, personal information and security are compromised because of these fraudulent and false claims, shall in no way be liable for any leakage of information.
This unsubstantiated statement is absolutely false and utter lies!"
The Waters announcement soon triggered criticism online, including the criticisms of the former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This is an angry denial," Fleisher wrote.
"This leads to the conclusion that her temperament does not correspond to a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of what he has not done, he should not be angry.
He can't be wary.
He may not comment on the motives of the accused.
He must be calm and calm."
Fleisher's job was to compare Waters' reaction with that of the Democrat to judge Kaveno, who was accused of being overly angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a candidate for candidate Republican candidate to get Waters to lose her chair in the interim elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
"Great if true," he wrote.
In her statement, Waters informed that her cabinet had warned the officials and law enforcement bodies of these fraudulent allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be revealed," she continued, "and that they will be recognised as legally responsible for all their work, which is destructive and dangerous to any of my personnel."
Johnny English 3 Review of Rovan Atkinson's parody on spy films left half-wheel
It has become common to look for associations with Brexis in any new film with a British taste, and that seems to be the case with this, which has revived, Johnny English's pardoning adventure comedy franchise, which began in 2003 with "Jonny Angli" and was reborn in 2011 with "Jonny Angli coming back".
Is it tempting to clean up on ourselves, on how obviously hopeless we are, is it a new export opportunity for our nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny Englishman has the right to create a chasm after the second resurgence — his name more than anything else signals that he is a full - range comic character designed for areas where consumers do not speak English.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent who, despite his strange claims for charming sophistication, is a little Kluzo, a little Mr. Bine, and a little bit of the guy who plays one note in the "Charriots of Fire" theme music at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
He is also based on the traveler and the incomprehensible international character that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads where he left chaos on his way.
The latest Johnny English adventure has at least one or two nice moments.
I liked the place where Johnny English goes to the helicopter dressed in a medieval armored outfit, and the propeller blades shook against his helmet for a moment.
Atkinson's abilities to visually create a comical impression are well visible, but humor is quite weak and strange superficial, especially because "serious" film brands like "007" and "Mission impossible" themselves use comedy with conviction as one of the ingredients.
Humor gives the impression that it is dedicated to children rather than adults, and in my opinion, the absurdities of Johnny English are not as creative and purposeful as the tricks of Atkinson's silent films in Bina's skin.
As usual, everything is based on Britain becoming in serious trouble.
Cyber hacker has hacked into Britain’s super-secret spy internet network, revealing the identities of all British agents in this area, to the dislike of an active agent — the miserable role of little Kevin Eldon.
It is the last straw for the Prime Minister, the pompous and a conflict-created person who has already lost its full political popularity: Emma Tomsone is doing something, with Teresa Mea's partially similar personality, but in the scenario there is not much to work with.
Her intelligence advisors say that because all the active spies have been exposed, she will have to call for someone who has already retired.
And this man is the inexhaustible Johnny Englishman who now serves as a teacher in a fine institution, and quietly teaches how to work as a secret agent (a couple of fun jokes), because the Englishman offers to learn the spy profession from the very foundations.
The Englishman is brought back to Vaithola for an extraordinary meeting and is merged with his former many injured assistant Bo, which is also played this time by Ben Miller.
Bo is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, a fun person who becomes important only at the end of the film — a role in which Vicki Pepperdine has not been fully exploited.
So Batman and Robin have returned to the secret service of Her Highness and meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful fateful woman, Ofelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Ministers have been dangerously bullied by the charismatic technology billionaire, the evil Jason Walt, who is being portrayed by Jack Lacy, and he claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problem.
The Englishman and Bo begin their wild odyssey of fun: camouflaged by the oficians, they set off a fine French restaurant; they create confusion to smuggle into Volta's luxury yacht; and the Englishman causes absolute chaos, trying to use virtual realities on the head of the display to get acquainted with the interior of the Volta building.
Everything is done for the final stage, but no matter how attractive and crazy the film is, it has many children's television elements.
A lot of moderate elements.
As in the case of other Johnny English films, could I not wonder whether the British film industry could give Rovan Atkinson a role that would make full use of his talent?
The Labour Party denies plans that the British will work four days a week and receive a salary for five days
Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour Party is going to discuss a radical plan under which the British will work four days a week and receive a salary of five.
It is reported that the party wants the executives to give the workers another holiday through the artificial intelligence revolution.
In this case, employees will be able to enjoy a three-day weekend, while receiving the same salary as before.
The sources say that the idea will "respond" to the party's agenda for the economy, and plans to change the economy for the benefit of the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week has been supported by the Trades Union Congress, which believes that it is an opportunity for workers to benefit from economic changes.
One of the senior Labour representatives informed The Sunday Times: "The policy changes are expected to be announced by the end of this year.
"It will not happen in one day, but the four-day working week is an idea that is in line with the party's goal of balancing the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as with the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised to introduce a four-day working week into the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party as such does not support this desire at the moment.
The Labour Party representative said: "Four-day working week is not part of party politics, and the party does not consider it."
The Shadow Cabinet Minister John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to give shape to his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonell explained that he was determined to take power away from the "mass of directors" and the "spectuants" of public services companies.
The shadow cabinet is also planned by the Minister to mean that the existing average shareholders in the water companies may not recover their entire package, as the Labour Government could implement a "deduction" due to the injustice.
He also approved plans to include employees on company boards and to set up an exclusive Ownership Funds to allocate 10% of the capital of private sector companies to employees who would receive up to 500 pounds per year in dividends.
Lindsey Grem and John Kennedy respond to 60 Minutes, or the FBI investigation in the Caveno case might change their opinion
The FBI investigation has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least one week, and raises the question as to whether the findings of the office could force any Republican senator to withdraw his support.
On an interview on Sunday, Scott Pelley, a correspondent of 60 Minutes, interviewed the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about whether the FBI could discover something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy left a more open impression than his South Carolina colleague.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said, turning to the hearing procedure, I said I had spoken to Judge Kaveno.
I called him after it happened when the charge became known, and I asked him, "Did you do that?"
He was determined, direct and clear."
Gramm's vote, however, is apparently in stone.
"I've made a decision on Brett Caveno, and will need a disruptive accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Grem added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of her names was able to confirm it.
The event is 36 years old.
I don't think there's going to be any change."
What is the World Citizens' Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the World Citizens' Festival, an annual music event, will take place in New York, with an impressive number of stars and an equally impressive mission: to reduce poverty in the world.
This is the seventh year of the festival, and tens of thousands of people will attend the World Citizens' Festival, who will gather in the Great lawn of the Central Park not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Repere Kardi B (Cardi B) and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true goal of the event, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an event created by the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to put an end to poverty by attracting more and more people who are actively fighting poverty.
In order to receive a free ticket to this event (unless there was a desire to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert visitors had to perform a series of tasks or "activities", such as doing voluntary work, sending an e-mail to a world leader, making a phone call or any other important activity to raise awareness of ending poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen movement been?
Is the idea of a free concert award a good way of persuading people to act, or is there just another case of so-called "cliactism", where people feel they can really influence something by signing an online petition or sending a Twitter message?
The Global Citizen movement states that since 2011 it has registered more than 19 million "activities" from its supporters in pursuit of different goals.
It reports that these actions have helped global leaders to declare commitments and policies equivalent to over USD 37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group referred to 390 commitments and statements stemming from its activities for which at least USD 10 billion has already been disbursed or funded.
The Group estimates that up to now, nearly 649 million people worldwide have been directly affected by the funds allocated.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "helping children grow up fully", promising to provide Rwanda with USD 35 million to help put an end to poor nutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 Twitter reports from the world's citizens.
"With the support of the UK Government, donors, other governments and citizens of the world like you, we can leave the social injustices of malnutrition in history," said Tracey Ullman, representative of The Power of Nutrition, at the April 2018 concert in London.
The group also mentioned that following the launch of more than 5000 events calling on the UK government to provide mothers and children with better nutrition, the government announced funding for the "Power of Nutrition" project, which will provide nutrition for 5 million women and children.
Answering one of the most frequently asked questions on your website – "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
"Global Citizen" commented: "It will be a long and long road, where we will stumble and suffer failure at times.
However, just as the great civil rights and anti-Aparteid movements have done before us, we too will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York, led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the war fleet for "blocking" to impede Russian energy exports, according to the Minister of the Interior
"If necessary," Washington can use its war fleet to prevent Russia's energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, as stated by US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, as quoted in "Washington Examiner".
Zinkke claimed that Russia’s activities in Syria, especially in areas where it operates under the legal government’s invitation, were a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"In my opinion, the reason why it is in the Middle East is that it wants to supply energy in the same way as it does in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe," he said.
And in the opinion of the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States through its Navy can ensure that sea routes are open and, if necessary, block them so that Russia cannot bring its energy to the market," he said.
Zinke approached the public, who had come to attend an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organisation that calls itself "the voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with the situation in Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are actually the same.
"The economic opportunity of Iran and Russia is more or less the use and replacement of fuel," he said, at the same time referring to Russia as a country whose economy is mainly dependent on fossil fuels.
It is claimed that the Trump administration is promoting the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, thereby replacing Russia, the much cheaper option for consumers in Europe.
For this reason, Trump's administration officials and the US President himself, Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, would make Berlin "dependent" to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasised that the 11 billion-dollar Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which would double the capacity of the existing gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington's zealous resistance to the project is simply based on economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"In my opinion, we agree that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier," said Alexander Novak, the Russian Minister of Energy, after the September meeting in Moscow with the US Minister of Energy, Rick Perry.
The US has expressed its opposition to Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
The leading German industry organisation, the German Industry Federation (BDI), has called on the US to refrain from engaging in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I feel a big problem if a third country intervenes in our energy supply," said Dieter Campf, head of the German Federation of Industry (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, the senator of Massachusetts, will seriously consider her candidacy for the 2020 presidential elections
Elizabeth Warren, the senator of Massachusetts, announced on Saturday that she was seriously considering standing for the post of President after the mid-term elections.
During the City Council meeting in Holioca, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering standing for the presidential election.
"It is high time that there were women in Washington who would "repair" an incomplete government, which also means a woman-president," so her words are reflected in the newspaper "The Hill".
"After 6 November, I will carefully consider my candidacy for the US Presidential elections."
During the City Council session, Warren referred to President Donald Trump, claiming that he "leads the country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren has openly criticised Trump and his nominee for the Supreme Court, Bret Kaveno.
On Friday's Twitter report, Warren said: "Of course, before the elections, an FBI investigation is required."
However, a survey published on Thursday revealed that the majority of the supporters of Warren do not believe that she should stand for the 2020 elections.
Fifty-eight percent of the "possible" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not stand for election, according to the results of the poll of the political research centre/spoken newspaper "Boston Globe" of the University of Sufolk.
Thirty-two percent supported this decision.
The results of the survey revealed that the former Governor, Deaull Patrick, had received greater support, receiving 38 percent for the election and 48 percent for the election.
In addition, the names of high-profile Democratic Party leaders such as former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont Bernijs Sanders appear in relation to possible candidacy in the 2020 elections.
The news agency "Associated Press" informed that Biden has undertaken to make a formal decision by January.
Sara Pailina quotes Treka Peilina PTSS at Donald Trump's rally
Trek Peilin (26) spent a year in Iraq after being called into military service in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and accused of domestic violence.
"What my own son goes through, which he goes through upon his return, I can apply to other families facing the consequences of PTSS and the vulnerability of certain doses that our soldiers return to," she said to the public at Donald Trump's meeting in Tuls, Oklahoma.
Pailina called his arrest "an obvious problem that everyone turns a blind" and said about her son and other war veterans that "they return a little differently, they return hard, they return to thinking about whether they respect what their fellow soldiers and pilots, as well as all the other members of the military field, have given to this country".
According to Dena Bennett, a representative of the Vasil Police Department, he was arrested on Monday in Vasila, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman and of keeping a gun under the influence.
18 states, Colombia region challenges new asylum policy
Eighteen states and Colombian states support a legal challenge for a new US policy that denies shelter for victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
The representatives of these 18 states and the District of Colombia submitted a brief statement to the court counsel in Washington on Friday to support the asylum seeker faced with the obstacles created by this policy, reports to the NBC News.
The applicant's full name in Grace v. Sessions' case launched by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August is not open.
She claimed that her partner "and the sons of his violent gang companion" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her request for asylum on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state attorneys who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers in the United States come, as countries where gangs and domestic violence are a common problem.
The new US asylum policy changed the 2014 decision of the Appeals Board of Immigrants, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
Karl Racine, General Prosecutor of Colombia, announced on Friday that the new policy "ignores the state, federal and international laws introduced by decades".
"Federal law provides that all requests for asylum are examined according to the facts and circumstances of the claim and such an obstacle violates this principle," said the court counsellor's brief statement.
In addition, the lawyer mentioned in his statement that policies that prevent immigrants from entering the country are detrimental to the US economy, as these immigrants are likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary workforce".
Advocate General Jeff Sessions in June addressed immigration judges with a request to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang abuse.
"Shelter is available to persons who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear related to their race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion," he said in his statement on 11 June regarding politics.
Asylum has never been designed to solve all the problems, even all the serious problems, that people face every day in the world.
A desperate rescue effort in Palu, with the number of deaths doubling in the search for survivors
The situation of survivors was getting worse.
"The situation is very tense," said 35-year-old Riza Kusuma, consoling his hectic baby in the evacuation center of the ruined Palu city.
"One minute's the ambulance brings new victims.
Clean water is a deficit."
The people were visible when they returned to their destroyed homes and overcrowded their water - burning items, trying to save everything that was found.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals that had suffered from the 7.5 - magnitude earthquake were overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who had broken his spine and shoulder, lay outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were taken care of out because of the constant strong post-wars.
His eyes were full of tears, remembering how a powerful earthquake began to shake the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to escape.
I think I was printed into wall ruins," said Haris to the Associated Press news agency, adding that his family had arrived in the city for wedding purposes.
"I heard my wife call for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of attempted intimidation through propaganda ads
One week after the official Chinese newspaper released a four - page ad, highlighting the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China on a daily basis, the US Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to distribute propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the annex paid by China Daily in the most sold newspaper Des Moines Register in Iowa, accusing China of trying to interfere in the 6 November US Congress elections, but China denies it.
Tramp's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US elections marked what US officials said to the news agency Reuters, namely that it was a new stage in the growing Washington campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is perfectly normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently caught in an increasing trade war, resulting in a series of tariffs on each other's imports.
At the beginning of the trade war, Chinese repressive tariffs were directed against exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported the Trump Republican Party, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, the US Ambassador to China and the former long-term governor of Iowa, who is a large exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote his opinion to the Sunday edition "Des Moines Register", claiming that China "now doubles this intimidation by placing propaganda ads in our own free press."
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using to its advantage the tradition of freedom of speech and free press so important to America by placing a paid ad "Des Moines Register," wrote Branstad.
"In contrast to the usual Beijing news kiosk, you will find a limited number of different opinions and will not see such a true reflection of different opinions that the Chinese people may have in connection with China's alarming economic trajectory, given that the media are under the strict supervision of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most influential Chinese newspapers avoided publishing" his article, but he did not mention which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn of Republicans alienating female voters from mid-term elections involving the Kaveno scandal
As many leading Republicans support and defend Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, against whom several allegations of sexual violence have been made, analysts have warned that in the forthcoming mid-term elections they will experience a negative reaction, especially from women.
The emotions involved have been extremely high, and it is evident that most Republicans have already been ready to give their voice.
Such things cannot be withdrawn, "that Saturday's article in The Hill was told by Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell School at Siracus University.
Reecher doubts that the last-minute invitation by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to conduct an FBI investigation will be enough to appease angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday. They will not forget it tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and representative of the state, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning protestors in the hallway of the Senate demonstratively sang "November coming!" when Republicans, who are responsible for the Court Committee, chose to continue with Kaveno's nomination despite the testimony given by Dr Christine Blasey Ford, reported "Mic".
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be at a very high level," said the independent political analyst Stu Rothenberg to the news portal.
"People say it's already at a high level, that's true.
However, it could be even higher, especially among convoluted voters living in suburbs and younger voters (aged 18-29), who often do not go to the elections even if they do not like the President."
Even before Ford's public statement, in which she outlined allegations of sexual violence on the part of candidate for the post of the Supreme Court, analysts mention possible failure if Republicans continue to nominate this candidacy.
"It has become a messy mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former Chairman of the National Committee of the Republicans, according to "NBC News" at the beginning of last week.
"It is not just about the committee's vote or the final vote, or about whether Kaveno will be sentenced, it is also about how the Republicans have dealt with the situation and how they have treated him," said Guy Cecil, director of the "Priorities USA", who is chairing this group, which helps to elect democrats.
However, it seems that the Americans are somewhat divided as to what to believe by the testimony of Ford and Kaveno, somewhat more inclined to believe in the latter.
The new "YouGov" survey shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or mostly tend to believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say that they are certain or mostly inclined to believe in the Kaveno's testimony.
In addition, 38 percent claimed that Kaveno may or may have lied about his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
The Guardian reported that the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, following the encouragement given by Fleek.
Last week Ford showed in the Senate's Committee on Justice that Kaveno was drunk at the age of 17 against their sexual assault.
Ramireza claims that the candidate for the post of a judge of the Supreme Court during his studies in Jeila in the 1980s has shown her his genitalia at a party.
Global Web inventor plans to launch a new Internet to take over Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, a global web inventor, is launching a project that could compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project "Inrupt" is a company based on the "Solid" open source platform of Burners-Lei.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people are allowed access to any information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Burners-Lee joked that the hidden intention of Inrupt was to "domine over the world".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "personal online data repository" or PTD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, as well as other personal and professional tools.
It's like if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slick and Spotify were all available in one browser at the same time.
The personal online data repository is unique in that only the user determines who and what kind of information can be accessed.
It is referred to by the company as "personal authority using data".
According to company manager John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to provide the company with resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently has a security platform purchased by Burners-Lei, Bruce, IBM, some freelance developers hired to work on the project, and a community of voluntary coders.
From this week onwards, technology developers around the world could build their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Burners-Lee said that he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether to make complete changes within a single night, completely inverting all their business models.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a Saturday's article published by the Platform Medium, Burners-Lee said that "The mission of Inrupt is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid".
In 1994, Burners-Lei transformed the Internet by creating a Global Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Burners-Lee has been influential in discussions on net neutrality.
Even after launching Inrupt, Burners-Lei will remain the founder and director of the Global Web Consortium, the Global Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am really optimistic about this new web era," Burner-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Marking the Victoria cross for a clergyman during World War I
For 100 years, its home city has been celebrating the occasion when the only clergyman of the Church of England received Victoria’s cross during World War I as a fighter.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Ven received this award on 29 September 1918 in connection with the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaukorta.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper, so he never knew about the highest British military award he had won.
On Saturday's parade in Rashden, Northamptonshire, two grandsons revealed a memorial stone dedicated to him.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was "excellently symbolic", that such a stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather had received a significant award.
According to the newspaper "London Gazette" on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Ven led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through very thick fog and gunfires and machine guns."
Later, he hurried to the shooting line, and with the greatest courage he led the line ahead of the cannon zone, where three teams were defeated.
Lieutenant Colonel Ven was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Wen (72) said that his grandfather's actions were "something that I could never do, and that at the same time is a very humble act."
He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid the crown after the parade, accompanied by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Ven claimed that he felt "honored to participate in this parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is evidenced by the support given by many people".
MMA fans waited all night for Bellower 206, but instead they welcomed Piggy Pop
Imagine spending the whole night at the top to see Bellator 206, but in the end, you're denied this main event.
In San Jose, 13 battles were included, including six on the main map, which were broadcast live throughout the night on UK Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were about to confront each other, the United Kingdom was shocked by the switch-over to Piggy Pepu.
Some were puzzled when they stayed awake all night until early dawn, waiting for the fight.
A fan on Twitter described the transmission of children's cartoon as a "failure joke".
"The government has determined that after 6.00 this kind of content is unacceptable, so the transmission was switched to the children's programme," explained Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of Bellator on marketing and communication issues.
"Pump Pepa," "Yes."
Scott Cooker, President of Bellower, said that he would work on scheduling so that future viewers in the UK could see these broadcasts.
"Thinking about repeating the broadcast, I think we can sort it out," Koker said.
"But the clock there is six on the morning Sunday, and we will not be able to solve this problem until Sunday after our time and Monday after their time.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, a lot of texts appeared after switching, and they were not positive.
We tried to prevent it because we thought it was a technical failure.
But it wasn't, it was controlled by the government.
I can assure you that there will be no such problems next time.
We're going to stick to five fights instead of six (as it has been up to now).
It's a bad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Dalley didn't feel good enough because of his sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley claims that he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old man didn't realize that "not everyone is like me" until he started attending high school.
Visiting the first Radio 4 program, "Desert Island Discs", led by Lauren Laverne, he mentioned that he was beginning to talk about homosexual rights to give others "hope".
He also mentioned that becoming a parent made him less worried about winning the Olympic Games.
The permanent manager of the long-term programme, Kirsty Young, has gone for several months as a result of illness.
As he appeared as an outcast from the society in the first Laverne program, Dale said that he felt "less" than others as he grew up, because "the society has not assumed that both girls and boys can enjoy it".
He said, "Until today, the feeling that I am not as good as others, or that I am different, has been the main driver that has given me strength and endurance to succeed."
He said you wanted to prove that there is "something" not to disappoint people when they finally learn about their sexuality.
The double bronze medal winner of the Olympic Games has become the leader of the high-level LGBT campaign and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to invite even more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said that he decided to address the public, because he felt happy to be able to live openly and without complications, and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said that his in love with his husband, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, was "surprisingly unprepared".
Dalley married the 20-year-old winner of the Oscar Prize last year and claimed that the age difference was never an obstacle.
"When you've gone through so much at such a small age" (his first Olympic Games were at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone at your age who would have experienced similar peaks and falls.
The couple became parents to their son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Dalley claimed that his "all perspective" had changed.
"Everything I cared about a year ago was getting a gold medal," he said.
"Do you know what? There are more important things in life than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son Robert has the same name as his father, who died in 2011 when he was 40 years old from brain cancer.
Dalley mentioned that his father did not want to accept that he died, and one of the last things he asked Dalie was whether they had tickets for the 2012 London Olympics, in which he wanted to be on the front row.
"I couldn't tell him that she won't be anymore to be in the first line," he said.
"I held his hand until he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and was dead, I finally admitted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Dalley took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I just knew that it was what I had dreamed of all my life — to dive in front of the householders in the Olympic Games. There was no better feeling about it," he said.
It also inspired the selection of his first song — the "Proud" performed by Heather Small, which resonated with him on his way to the Olympics and still drives goose.
The "Desert Island Discs" program can be heard at the BBC Radio on 4 Sundays at 11.15 after British summer time.
Mickelson, who left the form, in a reserve stand on Saturday Rider Cup hand
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday, playing his 47th Rider Cup match, but he will have to change his strategy to avoid an unfortunate turn of events.
For the 12th time, Michaelson, who is participating in the championship every two years, was set by Jim Furyk to reserve the bench for the Saturday four ball games and two pair games.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as has so often been the case with US teams, the five-time winner divided his day, acting both as a supporter and as a player in his game with the hope of correcting what stifles him.
Since the 48-year-old golfer has never been the most accurate player even at the top of his career, he is not the most suitable candidate for the tough fight in Le Golf National's rough square, where inaccurate kicks are regularly punished.
And if the game itself is not frightening enough, on Sunday's ninth match Michaelson will fight with the precise British Open Championship winner Francesco Molinari, who has joined forces with young Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If Americans who lag four points when starting 12 single-game matches successfully take the lead, Michaelson’s match could play a decisive role.
Furik expressed confidence in his teammate.
"He was fully aware of his role today, rolled my back, put his hand on me and told me that he would be ready tomorrow," Furitz said.
"He is very sure of himself.
He is an outstanding athlete who gave so many to these teams earlier and this week.
I don't think I've imagined him playing in two matches.
I imagined more, but everything changed in the way that changed, and that's what we'll take into account.
He wants to be out there, like everyone else."
Mickeyson will pass the Nick Faldo record for the most played matches at the Rider Cup on Sunday.
This could mark the end of the Riders Cup career, which has never really coincided with the heights of his individual record.
Michaelson has won 18 wins, has lost 20 and seven single games, even though Furicus claimed that his presence gave the team certain intangible benefits.
"He's fun, sarcastic and witty, he likes to amuse about people, and he's a great teammate," he explained.
"I think the younger players liked to piss him this week too, which was fun to watch.
He gives much more than just a game."
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows that the leading position can quickly disappear
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows from experience that a significant leadership in the fight for the Rider Cup in the last day's single-games can easily turn into an unpleasant situation.
Dane debuted in 1997 in Walderram, where the opposing team, whose captain was Save Ballesteros, scored five points above the Americans, but only now got to the finish line with a very small score, namely, winning with 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we were prominent in the lead in Walderram; we took the lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Walderram, where we won, but only with a small majority," said Bjorn (in the picture), watching the 2018 graduation group victory with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, taking the lead with 10-6 golf course "Le Golf National.
Thus history will show me and every member of that team that it is not over.
Tomorrow, you will give yourself everything.
Go in the field and show your best performance!
It will not be over until the points are visible on the screen.
Our goal is to get this trophy and let us concentrate on it.
I've been saying all the time that I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're very aware of what's facing us on the other side -- the world's greatest players."
Facilitated by the performance shown by his players at the golf course, Bjorn added: "I never rejoiced too early.
New challenges await tomorrow.
Tomorrow is intended for individual games, and that's a completely different thing.
It is great if you have a partner next to you when everything goes well, but your golfer skills are fully tested in individual games.
This message must be passed on to your players, so that they give themselves all to the game next day.
Now you leave your partner, and he must also go to show his best performance."
Unlike the opposing team of Bjorn, Captain Jim Furik will make sure that his players show their best performance in the individual rather than partner games. The exception is only Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furik himself has been on both sides of these significant last days tournaments, both as part of the winning Brooklyn team and as a result of the defeat when European teams achieved sensational success, which later was also known as "Miracle at Medinah" in the world of golf.
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to Ben Crenshaw, captain of the 1999 team, united his players in the last day of the fight.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you'd like to get straight to the fast-start you experienced in Brooklyn, like you were in Medina.
When such impulses are transmitted in the same direction, it puts great pressure on the mid-term games.
Accordingly, we made our own composition and ranked the guys in the way we thought they were right. Let's try to do some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to try to lead a counterattack, and he ranked Rory McIlroy for the main game and Europeans Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter in the first part of the list.
"I rank the guys in this order, because I think it fits best in the course of the tournament," said Bjorn to the selected single players.
Re-entry into service of a new German warship
The latest fleet of German warlords was to be put into operation in 2014, thereby replacing the ageing Cold War war ships, but this will not happen until at least next year due to erroneous systems and rising costs, it was reported by the local media.
The entry into service of the main ship of the Baden-Württemberg frigate class "Rheinland-Pfalz" has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, reports the newspaper "Die Zeit", quoting the military representative.
The ship had to join the warfloft in 2014, but the unpleasant post-delivery problems had an impact on the fate of the ambitious project.
Four vessels of the Baden-Württemberg class ordered by the caraflotte in 2007 will replace obsolete Bremen-style frigates.
They are expected to be equipped with powerful cannons, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some sensitive technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other essential features include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible to place the new frigates for up to two years away from the ports where they are registered.
However, the continuing delay means that the latest technology warships, which would allow Germany to demonstrate its power in overseas countries, will have become obsolete by the time it comes into operation, in the note "Die Zeit".
The failure of the F125 fleet in the last year was evident in all the headlines when the German corps officially refused to put the ship into service and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the caraflor returned to the shipyard after the ship had been delivered.
There were little known about the reasons for this, but the German media mentioned a number of significant "software and equipment failures" that would invalidate a warship if it were used in a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were a particularly important factor, as ships of the Baden-Württemberg class will be operated by a crew of around 120 seafarers, which is only half of the senior Bremen class frigate personnel.
It also appeared that the ship is too heavy a weight, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the caraflot to make its improvements in the future.
The 7 000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz ship is believed to be twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by Germany during World War II.
In addition to faulty equipment, the cost of the whole project (including crew training) also became a major problem.
It is said to cost EUR 3.1 billion instead of the initial EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems associated with the new frigates are becoming particularly significant in the light of recent warnings about the decline of German naval forces.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartel, head of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, admitted that the fir-flotation really "become running out of usable ships".
The official claimed that over time, this problem had been greatly exacerbated by the withdrawal of old ships from service without the delivery of new ones.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg fregatés had joined the Caraflote.
National Trust listens to the lives of secret bats
The new study, carried out in a Scottish highland property, aims to discover how bats use the landscape in their food search.
The findings are expected to bring new clarity to the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and to contribute to their protection in the future.
Scientists of Scottish National Trust will study dwarf bats, pygmy bats, brown longs and water bats in Invereves gardens in Westerros.
Special recorders will be placed in the main locations, which will track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Sound experts will analyse all records in order to determine the frequency of bat calls and which species carry out the activities.
A habitat map and a report will then be developed to create a detailed landscape view of bat behaviour.
NTS Nature Conservation Adviser Rob Dewar hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are the most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management such as the creation of meadows and how best to preserve forests for bats and other associated species.
The bat population in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined significantly over the last century.
These lands are threatened by construction and development works affecting bat hiding and the loss of residence.
Wind generators and lighting can also pose risks, as can mush paper and chemicals for certain building materials, as well as cat attacks.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes during hunting.
They use a sophisticated echo-location method to find insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for maintaining more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes the bat problem very seriously.
The organisation has at its disposal ten trained experts who regularly carry out surveys, testing of bat skiing sites and sometimes even rescue work.
The organization has even created in Scotland the first and only special bat reserve owned by Threave in Damfrisa and Galowey, where eight of the ten species of bats found in Scotland live.
The property manager David Thompson claims that the territory is ideal for bats.
"Here's a great place for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many ancient trees and generally suitable habitat.
But there are still a lot of things we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us to understand better what they need to survive."
He stressed that it was important to check that bats were not staying in the site before the maintenance work was carried out, as it could happen that up to 400 females and their pups were killed because of the unintentional destruction of one female hiding place, possibly destroying the entire local population.
Bats are protected animals and must not be killed, tortured, disturbed or destroyed by their hiding places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a member of the Scottish Bat Conservation Trust, has called on the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about bats, and for a number of their species, we just don't know how they're doing."
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape by ordering lawyers to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has condemned the charges of rape against him as "false news", claiming that people "want to pay attention to themselves" using his name.
His lawyers have been ordered to sue the German news magazine "Der Spiegel", which published these allegations.
Portuguese origin and Turin Juventus football star is accused of rape by the American woman Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
It's said he paid a woman $375,000 to keep her quiet about this incident, it said "Der Spiegel" on Friday.
A few hours after making these statements, Ronald, 33, approached his 142 million followers via Instagram's online video, calling this information "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," said the five-time winner of the "Ballon d'Or" award in the cell.
"They want to become famous using my name.
This is normal.
They want to become famous at the expense of my name, that's part of my work.
I'm a lucky man, and everything is good," the player added smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronald's lawyers are going to sue the Der Spiegel magazine for the allegations they have made as "an unacceptable provision of information on grounds of suspicion in the area of privacy".
The lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would claim compensation for "moral damage to an extent commensurate with the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of the rights of the person in recent years".
This incident happened in June 2009 in the hotel "Palms Hotel and Casino" suite in Las Vegas.
According to the documents submitted to the Klarka District Court of Nevada State, Ronald and Majorga went back to the player’s hotel room, where they raped a woman an anal.
Majorga claims that after the incident, Ronald fell on his knees and said that he was 99 percent "good boy", but fell on the temptation of this "one percent".
According to the documents, Ronald confirmed that the couple had sex, but this was done by mutual agreement.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and had taken pictures of injuries in the hospital, but later she agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "fear of revenge" and worried about "public humiliation".
A 34-year-old woman claims that she no longer wishes to accept the terms of this settlement, as the incident left a lasting injury.
At the time when these statements were made, Ronald was about to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid, but this summer he went to Juventus, Italy's Grand Graduation, for 100 million euros.
Brexith: The UK would "perpetually regret" the loss of car manufacturers
"The United Kingdom "will regret it forever" if, after Brexist, it loses its position as world leader in car manufacturing," said business secretary Greg Clark.
He is "disrupted" by the fact that Toyota UK has announced to BBC that if Britain withdraws from the EU without agreement, it will temporarily stop production at the Burnaston plant near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese carmaker said that delays at the borders in Brexis could be at stake without agreement.
Last year, the Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota models Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150 000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will be stopped at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are concerned about leaving the EU without a treaty and how cross-border trade will operate.
For example, BMW claims that after Brexis, he will close his mini factory in Oxford for a month.
According to the car manufacturers, the main concern is that the supply chain is at risk if no agreement is reached after Brexis.
The Toyota production line operates according to the "tapping time" principle, where every 37 minutes of custom-made cars arrive in parts from both UK and EU suppliers.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, there could be disruptions at the border, which could lead to some delays and shortages.
According to the company, Toyota would not have been able to detain equipment worth more than one day at its Derbyshire plant, so it would have to stop production.
Mr Clark said that the withdrawal plan (Chequers) drawn up by Theresa May for future relations with the EU is "accurately calculated to avoid such border checks".
"We need an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that would allow, as I would say, not only to benefit at the moment, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he said on "BBC" Radio 4 in "Today".
"Certification of this not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers is that we need to be able to fully pursue the very successful strategy of supply chains."
Toyota was unable to say how long production could be stopped, but warned that, in the long term, rising costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately put jobs at risk.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and working in the factory as a union coordinator, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "I can say from experience that as soon as a post disappears, it does not return."
The government representative said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, reports White House
The important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein may be "stayed for another week", because the fight in relation to candidate for the post of the Supreme Court judge Breta Kaveno continues, it was reported by the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the special advisor Robert Mueller, who investigates interference in the Russian elections, the link between the funds used by Trump and Russia, as well as the possible violation of the rule of law by the President.
For months now, in Washington, we have been gossip about whether Trump will fire the Deputy Attorney General and thus threaten Miller's independence.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed entering a conversation with Trump and the possibility of suspending the President with Amendment 25.
Rosenstein denied this information.
But last Monday he went to the White House, where he gave talks about his resignation.
Instead, a Thursday meeting was announced with Trump, who was at the time at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Trump said that "want" not to let Rosenstein down, but then the meeting was postponed in order to avoid a clash with the hearing of the Judicial Committee of the Senate, which showed both Kaveno and one of the women who accused them of committing sexual abuse — Dr. Kristīne Bleizija Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges raised by Kaveno, continuing to delay the Senate's vote.
Tramp press secretary Sarah Sanders visited Fox News Sunday.
She said: "The date of the meeting has not yet been set, it could be this week or postponed for another week, taking into account all the cases that take place around the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always want to inform the press about the news."
Some reporters contest this assertion: Sanders has not organised a White House press briefing since 10 September.
Head Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of breeze is not due to the dislike of the TV reporter's "Love of Praise", even though she added, "I don't want the fact that they're craving glory."
She then suggested direct contact between Trump, which would lead to an increase in press interest.
"The President takes part in more questions and answers sessions than any president before him," she said, and said, "We've been interested in the number of them."
Sanders claimed that the briefings will continue to happen, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States questions directly, it is undoubtedly better than to talk to me.
We are trying to do a lot of it, and you can see that we have done a lot of it in recent weeks, and it will take place instead of press briefings when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Tramp regularly answers questions by leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences attended by important persons.
Individual press conferences are rarely held.
Perhaps the President demonstrated the reason for this in New York this week by devoting an unchecked and at times strange expression to the crowd of reporters.
Minister for Health writes EU staff on Scottish NHS about Brexis-related fears
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working in the Scottish National Health Service (NHS) to express his gratitude and wish us strength after Brexis.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter to MSP less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government is already committed to covering the costs of permanent status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Frieman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations continued between the United Kingdom and the EU on the withdrawal which led to the decisions to be taken this autumn.
However, the UK Government is also preparing for a possible scenario if no agreement is reached.
I know this is a very restless time for you.
Therefore, I would like to emphasise once again at this point how much I appreciate the involvement of every employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from both within and outside the EU provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the healthcare service and benefit our cared patients and communities.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we really want you to stay here."
After a head injury, Kristien Abercrombius undergoes emergency surgery
The protector of Tennessee State Tigers, Christian Abercrombie, had an emergency operation after a head injury, which he won in a Saturday game, with a score of 31-27 yielding to "Vanderbilt Commodores", reported Tennesseen sports reporter Mike Organ.
The Chief Trainer of Tennessee’s State Team, Rod Reed, told the reporters that the trauma was gained shortly before half the time.
"He came to the side line and so to say collapsed," said Reed.
While Abercrombius was on the side line, the trainers and medical staff gave him oxygen, then put him on the stretchers and brought him to the investigation.
An official in Tennessee told the reporter Chris Harris at the WSMV, Neschville, that Abercrombius had been removed from the medical centre of the University of Vanderbilt.
Harris added that, for the time being, "there is no information about the type/heaviness of the injury", and the team in Tennessee is trying to understand when this injury occurred.

Before leaving the Saturday game, he had made a total of five blocks, which totalled 18.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher state fees when buying property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher state fees when buying property in the United Kingdom and the additional funds obtained will be used to help the homeless in accordance with the new "Tory" plan.
Such a step will counteract the efforts of Korbin to attract new voters.
The increased excise duty will apply to non-taxable persons in the United Kingdom.
The Treasury foresees that up to GBP 120 million per year may be collected to provide assistance to the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher state fee when buying property in the United Kingdom and redirecting the additional funds obtained to help homeless people, it will announce Teresa May today.
This is seen as an attempt to counteract Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract new voters with promises to provide housing at better prices and to address the wealthier part of society.
The increased excise duty will apply to non-taxable persons and businesses in the United Kingdom, with additional money being allocated to government efforts to combat the problem of homelessness.
The premium included in the current national levy, including the higher level of charges introduced two years ago for the purchase and rental of a second home, could amount to as much as three per cent.
The Treasury foresees that such a step can add up to GBP 120 million per year to its budget.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of the newly built London properties are purchased by non-residents, thus tapping prices and making it difficult for first buyers to get to their home.
Many of the territories of the wealthy country, especially in the capital, have become "fashion cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers, who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy was introduced only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the state fee so that more young people could afford to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by grabbing the land but not using it, and urged Mrs. Maya to give up quotas for affordable housing in order to deal with Britain's housing problem.
Mr Corbina has proposed a series of attractive housing reforms, including a reform on the control of rents and evictions without reason.
He also wants to give boards greater powers to build new housing.
Madam May said: "Last year I mentioned that I would use my Prime Minister's position to restore Britain's dream: every young generation must have a better quality of life.
And that means putting the housing market in order, which we are shattered.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and arrange their lives here.
However, it is not right that housing can be purchased as easily as foreign companies and people who do not live in the United Kingdom and the hard-working British people.
For many, the dream of home has become too distant, and the harsh problem of homelessness is still acute."
Jack Ross: "My biggest goal is to lead Scotland.
Jack Ross, the leader of Sunderland, claims that his greatest goal is to become the head of Scotland at some point.
Scott, 42, has accepted the challenge of restoring the North East Club, which currently ranks third in the first league with three points from above.
This summer he moved to the "Stadium of Light" after re-directing St Mirren back to the Scottish Primer League last season.
"As a player I wanted to play for my country.
I got the B Cup, and that was all," said Ross for the Scottish BBC broadcast at Sportsound.
"But I grew up watching Scottland games with my father in the Hampden Park, and it's always called me back.
However, such an opportunity would only appear if I was successful in running the club."
Ross' predecessors at Sunderland Club are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former director of Alloa Athletic claims that he has not been alarmed by following the footsteps of such a large club's recognized leaders, previously rejecting the offers made by Barnsley and Ipswich.
"My success will now be judged by whether I can return this club to the Premier League.
Because of the structure and possibilities of this club, it undoubtedly fits into the Premier League," he said.
"Returning the Club to the Premier League will not be an easy task, but I will most likely believe that I will be successful here only when this task has been accomplished."
Ross is in his career phase for only the third year, previously working as Deputy Director in Dumbarton and spending 15 months as part of the "Hearts" coach.
He then helped the club "Alloa" to recover from the fall to the third level and in the same season helped St Mirren to win the title of the champion.
Ross claims that he feels much more comfortable than during his player's career in the clubs "Clyde", "Hartlepool", "Falkirk", "St Mirren" and "Hamylton Academic".
"It was probably a true crossroads," he recalls, taking responsibility for Alloa.
"I really believed that leadership was my real call, much more appropriate than playing.
Sounds strange, because I was successful, I could live from it and enjoy some heights.
But playing can be difficult.
We have to go through a lot of things every week.
I still feel it because of work-related stress and pressure, but management is my field.
I've always wanted to lead and now I'm doing it. I think I'm in the right place, I haven't felt so good all my life."

The survey found that the best time to enjoy the pint is at 5.30 p.m. on Saturday afternoon
The summer heat wave has caused Britain’s less popular pubs to shrink, but it has increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The aggregated data revealed that in July the sales of pubs and bars had increased by 2.7 per cent, but in restaurants they had decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, who represents the business consulting agency CGA, who collected the data, said: "Continuously, the sunny weather and the long-standing participation of England in the World Cup meant that in July there was a similar trend as in June, i.e. the profits of the pubs had increased by 2.8 percent, while the restaurants experienced a drop.
Restaurants, whose sales dropped by 1.8 percent in June, experienced an even more severe situation in July.
The situation in the drink pubs and bars was most grateful, as they experienced much greater growth than the restaurants experienced downhill.
Food - based pubs also suffered from the sun, but not as dramatic as restaurant workers did.
It seemed that people just wanted to go outside for a drink.
In pubs and bars, monthly sales of drinks increased by 6.6 percent, while food sales fell by 3 percent."
RSM leisure and hospitality analyst Paul Newman said: "These results continue the trend observed at the end of April.
Weather conditions and the impact of extensive social or sporting events are the main factors determining the turnover outside the home market.
It is not surprising that the restaurant groups continue to fight, although the drop in sales by 4.8 percent compared to the corresponding period of the previous year will be particularly painful for the additional constant pressure of costs.
As far as food providers are concerned, the long and hot summer could not come at an even more inappropriate time, and the time will show whether the more moderate temperature that we usually experience in August will provide much-needed respite."
The total increase in sales among pubs and restaurants, including new firms, reached 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the decline in brand sales.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the UK sales supervisor for the pub, bar and restaurant sector, collects and analyses data from 47 business groups with a total turnover of over GBP 9 billion and this is an integrated industry criterion.
Every fifth child has a secret social media account that he hides from his parents
The survey reveals that every fifth child, some of whom are only 11 years old, has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a false increase in Instagram pages.
These reports have raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" account to show to their parents.
One in five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, creates social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed that Instagram, a photo-sharing site, is rapidly increasing the number of false profiles.
These reports have raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "clean main" account to show to parents, and also private accounts.
One mother who struck her 13 - year - old daughter’s secret site discovered a teenager who encouraged her to rape others.
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent School Leaders' Conference (HMC) revealed that 40 percent of pupils aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and only half of them admitted to maintaining private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, HMC manager, said: "It's scary that so many teenagers make online profiles where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilide Doyle will be a "light voice" on the Scottish Athletics Board
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board.
Doila is Scotland's most prized tracker and outdoors, and President Ian Beattie described this step as an excellent opportunity for those driven by sport to take advantage of her extensive experience at international level over the last ten years.
"Eilides is being given great respect throughout the Scottish, UK and global community of athletics, and we are confident that Scottish Athletes will benefit enormously by involving them in the board board," Beatty said.
Doila said: "I would like to act as a "light voice" and I hope that I can really get involved and help drive this sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200-meter and 400-metre race at the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games, won the four Olympic gold medals in total, and is currently a regular BBC pandit, was unable to pass after a transient ischaemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "This day a month ago I experienced a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time would show if and to what extent I would recover.
It was a terrible job, but I fully recovered, learned to walk again and can do good exercises today!
Thank you for your inspiring words!"
Opinions are shared about advertising a breast milk pump that compares mothers with cows
The breast-milk pumping company has taken care of shared views online in relation to advertising comparing nursing mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of the so-called "world's first quiet portable breast pump", the consumer technology company "Elvie" released an advert for a sticky reed to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump offers to breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a wall-filled cow barn next to a song, the words of which are like this: "Yes, I wipe myself, but you don't see any tail" and "if you didn't notice, they're not udder, they're my breasts."
The singing continues: "Shut up, suck up, I feed the babies, I suck up, I suck up, I milk my ladies."
However, an advertisement published on the company’s Facebook page has produced a wide online resonance.
The video, which has been viewed 77 000 times and commented on hundreds of times, has received a lot of feedback from the audience, and many say that it highlights the horrors of the dairy industry.
"A very wrong decision to use cows for advertising the product.
Just like us, they have to become difficult and give birth to milk, but their babies are taken away from them a few days after they were born," somebody wrote.
Elvie breast milk pump is inconspicuously part of breast-feeding women (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment says: "I understand that this is traumatic for both mother and baby.
But why not use it to advertise the breast milk pump to mothers who can keep their babies?"
There was also this opinion: "The creators of advertising did not know what they were doing."
Others defended the ad, and one woman admitted that in her opinion the song was "funsome".
"I think it's a great idea.
I'd buy one if I were breast-feeding.
Milk sucking made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I understood its idea.
This is a genius product," said one.
Another commentary states: "It's a fun advertisement, for mothers who have milk removed (not in the workplace or toilets) and feel like a cow.
It is not advertising that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the advertisement, a group of women discovered that they all danced with the unobtrusive pumps placed in their bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the observation that many women who have milk removed say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump pump is completely quiet, has no wires and pipes, and it is unobtrusively part of the breast for lactating women, allowing them to move freely, keep babies and even participate in events outside the house.
Anna Balarin "Mother" partner and creative director commented: "Elvie Pump" pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves bold and provocative placing on the market.
By pulling the parallel between the women who milk milk and the dairy cows, we wanted to pay attention to milk withdrawal, while demonstrating in an entertaining and intelligible way the stunning sense of freedom that the new pump will bring."
It's not the first time Elvie pump has come to the centre of attention.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the tongue at the Marta Jakubowski show using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp near Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has increased rapidly, although relatively many people cross the border each month as before, partly by harsh rhetoric and policies by the Trump administration that have made it difficult for children to be accommodated by sponsors.
Generally, most sponsors have also been undocumented immigrants themselves, fearing that if they openly apply to admit a child, this would jeopardise their ability to stay in the country.
The risk increased in June when federal officials announced that potential sponsors and other members of their households would have to be allowed to take fingerprints, and this data would also be transferred to other immigration-related authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, Senior Official on Immigration and Customs Enforcement, before the Congress, showed that the Agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsors of unaccompanied minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not been punished in advance.
"Almost 80 percent of those who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors are staying here illegally, and a large part of them are criminal foreigners.
That is why we continue to persecute such persons," said Mr. Albens.
According to asylum officers, in an effort to deal with children's cases more quickly, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear before the courts within one month of their detention rather than after 60 days, as required by the previous standard.
Many will use the possibility of a videoconference call rather than coming in person to defend their legal status before a judge on immigration matters.
Persons who will be considered unfit for release will be expelled quickly.
The longer children are kept in custody, the more likely they are to become restless or depressed, which may lead to violent attacks or attempts to flee, reported according to information and evidence provided by asylum workers which have been retrieved from the system in recent months.
Lawyers claimed that these concerns would be exacerbated in larger sites such as Tornillo, where signs of child suffering are more often overlooked due to their breadth.
They added that moving children to a tent camp without giving enough time for emotional preparation or allowing them to say good - bye to their friends could cause injuries that many are already struggling with.
Syria forces the US, French and Turkish "Occupants' Army" to immediately withdraw their troops
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country has been going on for the eighth year.
Moualem, who is also acting as Deputy Prime Minister, claimed that foreign forces are illegally present in Syria under the pretext of combating terrorism and will be "addressed accordingly".
"They must immediately and without any conditions retreat," he said to the Assembly.
Moualem insisted that in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died and millions have been forced to leave their homes since 2011, "the war on terrorism has almost ended".
He announced that Damascus would continue to fight in the holy war until all Syriac territories were cleansed, both from both terrorist groups and from "any foreign military presence".
The United States has deployed some 2 000 soldiers in Syria, who mainly train and advise both the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs, who are opponents of President Bashar Al Assad.
France has sent over 1,000 men to this war - torn country.
With regard to the issue of refugees, Mualem stated that the circumstances were great for their return and blamed "certain Western countries" for spreading "irrational fears", which made refugees unwilling to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"These people are politicising what should be just a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive aid for the reconstruction of the country before an agreement is reached between Asad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats explain that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last pillar of the rebels in Idlib has created an opportunity to speed up political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented the Russian-backed Syrian forces from attacking a province of three million people on a large scale.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement "has set deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against the jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda affiliated group "Jabhat al Nusrah", who would be "destroyed".
The UN envoy, Stafan de Mistura, looks forward to convening the first meetings of the new committee, which will include government and opposition representatives, in order to prepare the Syrian constitution for the post-war period and pave the way for the elections.
Moualem laid down the conditions for the participation of the Syrian state in the committee, stressing that the group's work should be limited to a "review of the existing constitutional articles" and warning of interference.
Why Trump will be elected for a second term
From this point of view, Mr Trump will be re-elected for the 2020 elections, if only, and perhaps many liberal observers, impressions and scandals are hoping for this, will not put an end to his Presidency prematurely.
And in that case, "it will be the most dramatic Presidency final of all time!"
At the moment, there is no sign of any relaxation.
Since 2014, the ratings have more than doubled at the most favourable CNN broadcast time, reaching 1.05 million viewers, while MSNBC has almost tripled to 1.6 million viewers.
At Fox News's most favorable time, 2.4 million viewers, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, are reported by Nielsen, while MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" is in the highest position on cable TV with 3.5 million headlines in the evening.
"It's a fire that attracts many people, because it's an incomprehensible thing for us," explained Neal Baer, the support of ABC drama "Designed Survivor". This drama tells of the secretary of the Cabinet, who becomes president after the attack is destroyed by Capitol.
Nell Scovell, comedy writer-veteran and "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club" author has her own theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The leader told her that he would vote in favour of Mr Trump.
She wanted to know why.
"He said, "Because he laughs at me," said Ms.Skovel.
Chaos is somewhat entertaining.
Of course, unlike everything else that appears on TV, news from Washington could determine what will happen to the Roe v Wade judgment, whether immigrant families will be able to unite, and the state of the global economy.
Ignore is a luxury that only the most privileged observers can afford.
And yet it's more than being informed to the citizen when we discuss at six o'clock how Bob Woodward has used unnamed sources of information for his book "Fear", Paul Manfort's 15 thousand-dollar bomber-type jacket from ostrich feathers and leather ("the suit from which arrogance is sucking," declared "Washington Post") and the role of Stormy Daniels in the passionate description of Mr. Trump, so to say, the anatomical details.
I, for example, will never again perceive Super Mario like before.
"Part of what he does, which creates the impression of reality show, is that he endowed you with information every day," Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the show "Pawn Stars" explained the changing team of Trump's show and everyday developments (glorification of the dog by N.F.L., Kim Chenun).
You can't afford to miss just one episode, otherwise you'll fall behind.
When I got to Mr. Fleiss that week, the time on the north coast of Kauai was sunny,80 degrees (~27 degrees Celsius), but he was sitting in a room where, without waking his eyes, he watched the MSNBC show while recording CNN.
He could not stand down, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to appear before the Committee on Justice of the Senate and his future in the Supreme Court is threatened to break apart.
"I remember the times when we made all those crazy shows and when people claimed that "this is the end of Western civilisation," told me Mr. Fleuse.
"I think it's such a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Money flows from the outside into the most intense parliamentary interim election pre-election campaigns
It is no wonder that the 17th Congress constituency of Pennsylvania is seeking money thanks to the transformation of the Congress districts, as a result of which two existing Members will fight for one place.
This recently redesigned area of the outskirts of Pittsburgh is linked to the democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his place in a special election last spring in another area.
Lembs will fight with another current Member, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January decided that the old districts were unconstitutionally divided in favour of the republicans, the maps were revised.
Competition in the new 17th area has led to a fight between the main financial groups of the parties: the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (Democratic Campaign Committee) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (National Republican Committee).
Lembs became known in Pennsylvania when he won the popular March elections at the 18th Congress District of Pennsylvania with a little clout.
This place had been held by the Republicans for more than 10 years, and President Donald Trump won the area with 20 points.
Policy experts give democracies a little weight.
The United States was considering punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but then rethinking
The diplomats acknowledged that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing without much pressure from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, and he stayed at the hotel in Panama until partners left behind the team of Trump's organization management.
The officials of the Department of State decided to withdraw the heads of the United States diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, on the grounds of "the recent decision not to recognise Taiwan anymore", its department representative, Heather Nauert, stated in the statement earlier this month.
However, penalties were considered to be limited to El Salvador, which received approximately 140 million in 2017 from America, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which would include a reduction in financial assistance and a targeted reduction in visas, would be painful for a Central American country where unemployment and murder rates have reached their highest levels.
In the course of internal meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity, which would have followed a similar meeting last year, which was recognised as a step closer to preventing migrants from moving to the US.
In mid-September, the highest officials of the country made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, essentially by putting an end to the considerations of punishing El Salvador.
The diplomats informed that Vice-President Mike Pence now decided to participate in the conference planned for mid-October to show how seriously the administration emphasises the meeting.
And three American ambassadors returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new and serious statements or penalties from Washington.
The representative of the White House, who spoke on behalf of Mr Bolton, did not wish to provide more information on the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to negotiate in-house, if their anonymity was maintained.
Their story was confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on the condition that his anonymity would be preserved.
Studying History
The second stone garden could be the report by the special prosecutor Robert Mueller that Mr Trampa may have obstructed justice, which has a great deal of evidence at the public's disposal.
It is claimed that Mr Miller will also investigate whether the Trump campaign has colluded with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the other party wins over the Congress, Trump will have to answer this body and perhaps his peers' jury just at the moment he is going to meet the voters again.
There are many "buts", and I do not claim that the fall of Trump is inevitable or that it will happen to his fellows in Europe.
There are choices that will have to be made by all of us on both sides of the Atlantic, and these choices will show the length of the battle.
In 1938 German officers were ready to take a coup against Hitler if the West had opposed him and supported him in Czech Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid years of carnage.
History revolves around such turning points, and the unstoppable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans now have to deal with a number of such turning points.
What are we going to do if Mr Trump fires General Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr Miller's investigation?
It has been difficult for Rosenstein since it was reported that last year he suggested secretly recording a conversation with the President and wondering about his unsuitability.
Mr. Rosenstein says that The Times's story is not accurate.
"How can we respond if the inquiry of the FBI on Bret Kaveno that has just been requested is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed as a judge of the Supreme Court in spite of his unfair testimony and credible accusations of sexual assault?
And, most importantly, will we vote in the interim elections in Congress, which will hold Trump accountable?
If we do not pass all these tests, democracy will end in a long winter.
But I believe that we will succeed by referring to what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jewish woman who was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once lived in my embassy.
She survived, emigrated America, and 60 years later sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the table with swastika.
How can I not be optimistic about our future if I have such a legacy?"

Ranger star Graham Dorran feels optimistic about fighting with Vienna Rapid
"Ranger" will take Vienna's "Rapid" on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians after the impressive draw game in Spain with "Villarreal" earlier this month will allow them to stand stable to qualify from the European League's G Group.
The trauma of the road did not allow the center attacker Grem Dorans to resume taking part in the season's games with 2:2 with Villarreal, but he believes that this result can be used by "Rangers" as a springboard to achieve even more.
"We can be happy about it because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old footballer.
"We went in the game believing that we would be able to make good progress, and got this point.
Perhaps we could have defeated them in the end, but overall, the tie is an honest result.
They may have been better at the first half of the time, but we were in the second half of the time and we were a better team.
And there will be another important night for Europe on Thursday.
Hopefully, we will gain three points, but this will not be an easy game, because they got a good result in the previous game, but I am sure that, with the help of our supporters, we will be able to continue to fight and get good results.
The last year, with all my injuries and changes in the club itself, was clearly heavy, but now there are new bouts that I feel good about.
The team is great, and the guys enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope we can continue the fight, leave the past season behind and succeed."
Women are unable to sleep because they worry about their pension savings
Although the respondents clearly knew what kind of care they wanted, few had discussed the matter with the family.
About half of the individuals in a national study indicated that they were not talking to a spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said that they had talked to their children about it.
"People want family members to care for them, but they don't do anything to pronounce it," says Holly Snyder, vice president of the State Life Insurance Agency.
Here's where we should start.
Talk to your spouse and your children. You cannot prepare your family for needing care if you do not know your wishes well in advance.
Work with your consultant and family to discuss where and how to get care, as these choices can be an important factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial consultant. Your consultant can also help you figure out how to cover these costs.
Your ability to provide financing for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid insurance policy with a monetary amount to cover these costs, or a guarantee through your property, the most important thing for you to have the money.
Work out your legal documents. Avoid legal battles before they begin.
Conversate an authorised person on health matters so that you have a reliable person who will supervise your health care and ensure that specialists act according to your wishes if you are unable to express it on your own.
Consider also the possibility of giving a mandate in financial matters.
Choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf, who will take care of paying your bills if you are unable to do so on your own.
And don't forget the seemingly small details! Imagine that one of your elderly parents is being taken to the hospital for emergency care.
Will you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Please indicate these facts in a written plan so that such a situation does not surprise you.
"And it's not just about finances, it's also about who the doctor is," Martin said.
"What are the medicines used?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Make sure that such a plan is in place."
Male shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
The man received several shots with an air rifle, going home at night.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove Park in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen, and wrist.
The police described the shooting of the BST at about 2.30 p.m. as "a random".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries are not life threatening, and the police call for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to the government, a severe earthquake and tsunami that struck Pala in Indonesia on Friday have killed at least 384 people, and the number of victims is expected to increase.
Because of the ravaged communications, rescuers have been unable to obtain any information from the Dongal region, located north of Pala, closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 - magnitude earthquake.
More than 16 000 people were evacuated after the devastating natural disaster.
Here is the basic information about Pala and Dongal, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. It is estimated that in 2017 there were 379 800 people living there.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when an earthquake and tsunami broke out.
Dongala is an area stretching about 300 km (180 miles) along the north-west coast of the island of Sulawesi.
It is estimated that the province’s administrative region had 299 200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the economic pillar of the province of Central Sulawesi, especially in the off-shore Dongal region.
Nickel production also plays an important role in the province, but is mainly concentrated on Morrowali, Sulawesi's opposite shore.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Prevention Agency, Palu and Dongal have suffered several tsunamis in the last 100 years.
In 1938 the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongal.
The Tsunami also hurled over the western part of Dongal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismicly active Pacific fire ring, where earthquakes are regularly formed.
The following are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A severe earthquake on the western coast of the province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami affecting 14 countries, killing 226 000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of whom were in Aceh.
2005: A series of violent earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nia, near the shores of Sumatra.
2006: a violent earthquake of 6.8 magnitude erupted in the south of Java, the most populated island of Indonesia, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing almost 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7,6 magnitudes broke out near the city of Padang, the capital of the Western province of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magitad earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai off the shores of Sumatra, causing tsunami waves of up to 10 metres high that devastated tens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: An earthquake close to the surface of the earth struck the area of Piedie Jaya in Aceh, causing damage and panic, as it reminded of the destruction brought with it by the devastating earthquakes and tsunamis of 2004.
This time the tsunami did not develop, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapsing buildings.
2018: severe earthquakes struck the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily prevented hundreds of tourists from returning home.
Senior son of Sarah Palin arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Governor and Vice-President of Alaska, Sarah Peilin, has been arrested for indictment of the attack.
According to a Saturday report by the Alaska State Troopers, the 29-year-old Palin, who lives in Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence and resistance to arrest.
According to a police report, when an acquaintance-woman tried to summon the police to report crimes she claimed to have occurred, he took her off the phone.
Palin has been detained in Mat-Su's pre-trial detention facility and he has a $500 security deposit, reports KTUU.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where, when asked whether he found himself guilty, he declared that "it is definitely not guilty".
Peilin has been charged with three A-grade offences, for which he can be sentenced to one year in prison and a USD 250,000 fine.
He has also been accused of a B-grade offence, for which a day's prison sentence and a $2,000 fine can be obtained.
It is not the first time that criminal offences have been prosecuted against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father Todd Peylin.
His mother, Sarah Paileen, summoned the police and reported that an attack had taken place.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In 2016 he was accused of domestic violence, delaying the report on domestic violence and wearing a drunkard weapon in connection with this incident.
His girlfriend says he hit it with a fist in the face.
In 2016, Veterans' groups criticised Sarah Pailina for linking her son's violent behaviour to post-traumatic stress disorder, returning from the service in Iraq.
Tsunami in Indonesia caused by an earthquake: hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people have died after the earthquakes that struck Sulawesi in Indonesia on Friday.
The 7.5 - magnitude earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been destroyed and the number of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake broke out near the central part of Sulawesi, southeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Videos showing the moment of a collision are spreading on social networks.
Hundreds of people had gathered to the beach festival in the town of Palu when the tsunami struck the coast.
Federal prosecutors want to demand the execution of the rarely used person suspected of a terrorist act in New York City
Federal prosecutors want to demand the execution of Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected of a terrorist act in New York City when eight people were killed. It is a rare form of punishment that has not been committed in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
As it is claimed, 30-year-old Saipov used the Home Depot rental car to attack the bicycle road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October, where he hit pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
To justify the execution, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused a serious injury, as stated in the statement of intent to apply for the death penalty filed with the New York South District Court.
According to a judicial document, in both cases, the death penalty can be imposed.
Within a week of the attack, the Federal Grand Jury adopted an indictment of the prosecution of Saipov in 22 charges, which included eight charges of murder for extortion, commonly used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as an accusation of cruelty and damage to motor vehicles.
The attack required "considerable planning and pre-intention", explained the prosecutors, mentioning that the attack by Saipov was "false, cruel and inhuman".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov injured, harmed and caused damage to their families and friends: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Anna-Lori Dakadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlie, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejan Damnocco," states the announcement of the intention.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since the prosecutors of the Southern District Court of New York had carried out an accusation against the death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but eventually he was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2009.
The death penalty was last executed in New York City in 1953 on the federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who was sentenced to death after being accused of spying in the Cold War of the Soviet Union two years ago.
On June 19, 1953, Rozenberg’s couple were executed in an electric chair.
According to court documents, as days and months passed, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, did not regret the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the accusation article, Saipov told the officials that he was inspired to attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
The police informed him that he had also asked for permission to display the ISIS flag in his chamber.
He has rejected a 22-indictment article.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders of Saipov, said that he was "almost naturally dissatisfied" with the decision on the charge.
"We believe that the intention to demand the death penalty rather than to accept guilt in exchange for life imprisonment without the right to release will only prolong the ongoing injury to all parties involved," Patons explained.
In the past, Saipova's defence team has called on prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
The Conservative Member states that the management of Brexis' negotiations should be entrusted to NAIDZEL FARAGE
Nigel Faraž promised to "mobilise the army of the people" at the Conservative conference today.
The former leader of the British Independent Party stated that politicians should feel the anger of the Eurosceptics when one of the members of the House of Teresa May suggested that talks with the EU should be entrusted to him.
Peter Bone, a member of the Conservative rank, announced to Marsh Birmingham that Britain would have withdrawn if Mr Farage had been the Brexis minister for a long time.
However, the challenge that Mrs May will have to face in an attempt to consolidate her controversial party was demonstrated by the Conservatives, who are in favour of remaining in the EU and joined a separate urban protest against Brexis.
The Prime Minister is fighting to maintain her compromise plan on future relations between Britain and the European Union (Chequers compromise) and is being attacked by those who want to leave the EU, by those who want to remain in the EU and also by the EU itself.
The allies insisted that she would make a determined effort to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and would force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her offer and the haoss.
Mr. Bouna at the "Leave Means Leave" rally in Solihull, said that he wanted to throw out the May Plan in the Dye (to chuck Chequers).
He proposed to make Mr Faraža an ally and to entrust him with the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had spoken, we would have left," Boon said.
A Member of Parliament from Wellingborough added: 'I am going to support Brexis, but we have to throw away the May Plan!'
In support of his opposition to the EU, he said: 'We did not fight to have the crews!
We want to make our own laws in our country!"
Mr. Bouna ignored the assumption that public opinion could have changed since the vote in 2016: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is absolutely false."
Brexis' supporter Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the march, and the reporters said, "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is not popular with society, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and our supporters, who are actually doing all the work and electing us.
Please leave Chequers and start listening."
In the news of May, she added: "The Prime Ministers remain in place when they fulfill their promises."
Mr Farage said that politicians at the meeting must feel the pressure if they are to disregard the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is a matter of trust between us people and our politicians," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexis and we're here today to tell them that we're not going to let them do it."
In his message, he fills an enthusiastic crowd: "I want you to allow our politicians who are planning to pass on Brexis to feel the pressure.
"We will invite the people of this country who have allowed us to win the fight for Brexis, and we will never relax until we are independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the Stayers marched through Birmingham before a two-hour meeting took place in the city centre.
Unknowing activists greeted conservatives with Brexis banners after the group meeting this weekend.
The representative of the Workers' Party Lord Adonis ridiculed Conservatives on the security issues they experienced at the start of the party application conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they are able to maintain the order of the IT system and all their technology for Canada and yet, and yet, undivided, free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
"It's an absolute farce.
There is no such thing as a successful Brexith," he added.
Warren plans to carefully consider standing as President of the United States
The senator Elizabeth Warren says that she will "consider carefully" her candidacy in the US presidential elections after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, the Massachusett Democrat spoke about her future in the town hall of West Massachusetts.

One visitor asked her if she was planning to stand for the presidential election.
What Warren said is the time to "have women in Washington that will "find up" the imperfect government, which also means a woman-president."

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the title of world champion after the team lets him beat Sebastian Fetel
From the moment Walter Bottas qualified before Louis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercede's team's work would play an important role in the race.
From the start, Both began well and almost left Hamilton dry, defending his place on the first two trips and calling on Fettel to attack his teammate.
Fetel first entered the garage and left Hamilton in the driveways to deal with the rest of the world.
Mercedes' pilot filled a circle later and lagged behind Fetel, but Hamilton continued to take the lead after the zoning, which saw the Ferrari rider persistently leaving the inside free, risking to lag behind after the double maneuver to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstapen began from the back row and at the end of the first circle was the seventh on his 21st birthday.
Then he was leading a large part of the race, because he focused the tires to quickly reach the finish and overtake Kimi Raikonen in the fourth.
Eventually, he arrived in the garage in circle 44, but he could not increase the speed in the remaining eight laps, as Raikonen remained fourth.
This is a difficult day, because Walter did a fantastic job all weekend and was a gentleman.
The team did an extremely important job to get one two," said Hamilton.
It was a very bad body language
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diana Feynstein for her perseverance in her letter from Christine Blaysia Ford, in which she accused the candidate of the Supreme Court, Brett Kaveno, of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not speak directly about Ford's testimony given to the Legal Commission of the Senate, but commented that what happened in the Senate shows that people there are "bad, nasty and unreliable."
"One thing that can happen and something beautiful that has already happened in the last days in the Senate, when there is anger, when you see angry, evil, nasty and unreliable people," he said.
"When you read the press releases and leaked information, and then they say, "Oh, no, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diana Feynstein, did you leak the information?
Remember her answer to the question... did you leak the document?
Oh, no.
I didn't do it."
All right, hold on a second.
Did we do it...No, we didn't do it," he added, in the intonation of the senator.
In July a letter was sent to Feynstein explaining in detail what Ford accused Kaveno of, and the contents of the letter were disclosed at the beginning of September, but Feynstein denies that this had happened in her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't leak her story," Feynstein said to the commission, reporting "The Hill".
"She asked me to keep it confidential, and I did."
But her denial did not please the President, who commented on the situation at a Saturday evening meeting as follows: "I will tell you that it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the candidate of the Supreme Court, whom three women accused of sexual harassment, the President suggested that democrats use accusations for their own benefit.
"They are determined to regain power by any means."
Do you see evil, confusion, they don't care what they're hurting, what they need to destroy in order to gain power and control," says the president, "Mediaite".

Air traffic controller dies, allowing hundreds of people on board to escape during an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is praised as a hero after he sacrificed himself to take hundreds of passengers off land safely.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a severe earthquake struck Sulawesi Island on Friday, causing a tsunami.
The area continues with strong aftershocks and many are trapped in mud in the Palu town.
However, despite his colleagues saving their lives, the 21-year-old Antonijus Ganavanas Agungs refused to leave his job in the control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport at Palu Airport, which was rocking strongly.
He remained at his post to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321 aircraft on the runway at that time would safely take off in the air.
Then he jumped off the traffic control tower, thinking it could collapse.
Later, he died in the hospital.
A representative of Indonesian air navigation, Johannes Sirait, said that his decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported Australia’s ABC news.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Pala.
"We're really upset when we hear it," he fills.
Meanwhile, the public authorities are concerned that the number of deaths could reach thousands, the national disaster prevention agency claims that access to Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that beautiful will grow, because many more human bodies are under rubble, as well as many cannot access," said the agency's representative Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to six feet [6 m] high destroyed Pala, where a mass funeral would take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft continue to provide assistance and necessary supplies.
Riss Kusuma, 35-year-old mother, Sky News, said: "One minute's the ambulance brings new victims.
Clean water is a deficit.
The small shops are all over the place.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, CNN said: "The Red Cross of Indonesia is rushing to help the survivors, but we do not know what we will find there.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
On Sunday, the President of Indonesia Joko Widodo came to Palu and the country's military brought in said: "I ask you to work day and night to accomplish all the tasks relating to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Already this year, Indonesia was shaken by earthquakes in Lomboca, where more than 550 people died.
Flight disaster in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that one of the people is missing after the plane crash in the lagoon
The airline carried out a flight during which it fell on the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia and now claims that one of the people was missing, even though it had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from a sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini announced on a press release on Saturday afternoon when they could not answer for one of the passengers, a man.
The airline announced that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the missing man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
The local people helped save other passengers and crew by boating after the plane fell into the water, trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were hospitalized.
The airline stated that six people remained in the hospital until Saturday, and all of them were in a stable condition.
The causes of the accident and the sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. navy report that the aircraft fell into the lagoon shortly after taking off the runway.
Some eyewitnesses thought that the length of the runway was overestimated.
Bill Jane, an American passenger, said that the plane was very low.
"It was really very good," said Janes.
Janes says that he and other passengers were able to get out of a sinking plane using emergency exits, because the water was only up to the waist.
He said that the cabins were panicking and screaming, as well as that he had a light head injury.
The U.S. navy sailors who worked nearby to improve the quay also helped with rescue by using an inflatable boat to bring people to shore before the plane sank some 30 meters (100 feet) below the water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in PNG registered airlines in the last twenty years, none of them being linked to Air Niugini.
Psychoanalytical commentator explains the scene of the night in which a woman was burned alive
The accusation provided evidence on Saturday in the re-opened case, where a man is accused of burning a live woman in 2014.
Paul Rovlet, a psychoanalyst of the U.S. Department of Judicial Expertise, witnessed for several hours as a witness to an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used the information from his phone to put together the 29 - year - old Quinton Tale and 19 - year - old Jessica Chambers acted on the night she died.
Rovlet said he received location data from several phones, which shows that the Telis was with Chambers in the evening of her death, challenging his previous testimony, reported "The Clarion Ledger".
When the data showed that his phone was at Chumbers when he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford said on Saturday in the courtroom that he was not in town that day.
When the accusation asked if the Telis was telling the truth, claiming that that night there was Sanford's car, Sanford said he "melo because my car was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy was that the Tālis said that he knew Chambers only about two weeks after she died.
Your phone records show that they only knew each other for a week.
Rovlet said a little after Chambers' death, the Telis erased text messages, calls and contact details from his phone from Chambers.
"He erased him from his life," said Hale.
It is expected that the defences will give their final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the court proceedings to be handed over to jury later on the same day.

Black again?
A babysitter in New York has sued a couple for dismissal after receiving a "racist" message
In New York, a babysitter has sued a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she has received an erroneous text message from a mother who has complained that the babysitter is "black again."
A couple deny that they would be racists, likening the trial to "suppress".
Lindsey Plasco-Flaksman, a mother of two children, expressed her disapproval by learning that the young child carer, Gisele Mauris, was black when she arrived for work on the first day of 2016.
"NOW IN THE ENVIRONMENT, BLACK BLACK," Plasco-Flaksman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, she sent a message, not to her husband, but to Mauries, and twice.
Aware of their clumsiness, "miscious" Plasko-Flaksmana discount Mauris, pointing out that their previous nanny, who was an African-American, carried out a bad job and that she was expecting a Filipino, referring to the New York Post.
Mauritian was paid for her one working day and sent home with Uber.
Maurisa has now sued the couple, claiming compensation for dismissal, and wants to receive $350 a day for six months for work with secured accommodation, which she originally applied for, and without a contract of employment.
"I want to show them that such things are not done," she said on Friday, "Post", adding "I know it's discrimination."
A couple reject the accusation that they are racists, claiming that the termination of Mauritian employment was a reasonable decision because they feared that they would not be able to trust her after she was insulted.
"My wife sent her what she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco, husband, said, "Post."
"But would you entrust your children to someone you treated rudely, even if it was just a mistake?
Your newborn?
Think about it."
By comparing the court hearing with the "extortion", Plasko said that his wife had given birth to the little only two months ago and was in a very "complex situation".
"You really turn towards someone in this way?
This is unacceptable," said the investment banker.
While proceedings are still ongoing, public opinion quickly goes to court over social networks, demeaning them for their behaviour and logical thinking.
A new letter reveals that the publishers of Padington’s book were concerned that readers would not be able to associate with a talking bear
Bond's daughter Karen Jenkel, who was born shortly before the book was approved, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in someone's shoes," who reads the book for the first time before it was published.
It is very surprising to find out now what we know about the great success of Padington."
She added that the 60th anniversary of the book was "sweetly bitter" after the father passed away last year.
Speaking of Padington, who she calls "a very important member of the family", her father quietly boasted of her eventual success.
"He was a quiet, quiet man and was not boastful," she said.
"But because Padington was so real to him, it was like having a child who achieves something: you're proud even if you haven't done it yourself.
I think he looked at Padington's success in a similar way.
Although it was made by him and the fruit of his imagination, he always gave all the credit to Padington himself."
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone
After landing, her daughter was taken with the ambulances to Louis Pasteur 2, a hospital in Nice, where doctors fought for her life all the time.
"Ned called regularly and said that she was very bad and expected not to survive," said Ednan-Laperuza.
"Then I got a call from Ned, saying that she will die in the next two minutes and I must say goodbye to her.
And that's what I did.
I said, "Well, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicine that the doctors gave her to maintain her heart rate slowly stopped and left her body.
She would have died even sooner, and it all came to an end.
I had to sit down and wait, knowing that all of this was happening.
I could not cry or cry because I was in a situation where there were families and people around me.
I needed a lot of strength to control."
After all, then a daughter's loss in mourning, Ednan-Laperuza boarded a plane with other passengers who had no idea what she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I stabbed my head down and tears flowed all the time.
It is difficult to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt deep sympathy for Ned.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved him."
Inflammatory women attach cards on bridges to prevent suicide
Two women whose loved ones have committed suicide act to help others not to take their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hamfrey strengthen cards at the Welsh Bridge with an inspiring message and phone numbers so that people can call and receive support.
Davis’ son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and he committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to have to experience what I have every day," she said.
Davis, 45 years old in Lydnya, said that her son was a promising cook with an addictive smile.
"Everyone recognized him for a smile.
Everyone always said that his smile would "light up" always and everywhere."
But, he gave up his job before he died, because he was "in a very, very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found him after Tyler had committed suicide.
Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that this will have consequences."
Davis created cards, "to make it known that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
You don't have to sit in silence, you have to talk."
Hamfrey, a year - old friend of Davis, lost Mark, her spouse for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he would feel sad or be depressed or any quote would feel," she said.
"Some days before Christmas, we noticed that his attitude had changed.
He reached his lowest point on Christmas morning, when the children opened gifts he did not make eye contact with them or anything like that."
His death was a great trauma to the children, but they have to deal with it: "It hurts the whole family.
That's what makes us different.
But we must all continue and fight."

The future of Breta Kaveno hangs in the air as the FBI initiates an investigation
"I think if we could really get what he's asking for – in a limited investigation of time and scope – we could possibly achieve a small consensus," said Flake on Saturday, adding that he's worried that the commission "divids" between a fortified partisan vision.
Why do the supporters of Kaveno and his Republicans not want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their abstention is only a coincidence.
The interim elections are in five weeks’ time, on November 6, when the Republicans are expected to be ill, their attempts will be much weaker to elect a husband from among themselves in the highest court.
George W. Bush calls the senators, lobbying them to support Kaveno, who worked in the White House during Bush and thanks to him met his wife, Ashley, who was President Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI prepares its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 seats now belong to the Republicans and 49 to the Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kaveno can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pens, the Vice-President, to settle the vote and confirm him in the Supreme Court.
Kim's leadership has "reduced" North Korea's number of political asylum seekers
North Korea's number of political asylum seekers in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong came to power seven years ago, said South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Unity Ministry, said that last year there were 1127 political asylum seekers compared to 2011, when they were 2706.
The park said that stricter border controls for Star North Korea and China and high rates for smugglers are key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of political asylum seekers from North Korea end up offering South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that more than 30 000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of them go through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarisation Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China treats political asylum seekers as illegal immigrants and deports them forcibly.
The relations between North Korea and South Korea, which are still fighting technically, have improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the negotiation of delayed denuclerisation.
This followed a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jongun in Singapore, when, on a large scale, they agreed to cooperate to free the Korean Peninsula from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions since these negotiations had not progressed.
"If there is no confidence in the United States, there will be no faith in the security of our country, and under these circumstances we will never unilaterally disarm the first," said Ri at the UN General Assembly in New York."
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Caveno "histerical" and claims that he is unsuitable for work in the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, a minority leader of the Court, called Bret Kaveno the candidate of the Supreme Court "histerical" and claimed that he was not suitable for work in the Supreme Court because of her temperament.
Pelosi made comments in an interview on Saturday at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman behaved like this, they would call her "histerical," said Pelosi about his reaction to the testimony given to the Senate's Judicial Commission on Thursday in Kaveno.
Kaveno was emotionally denied charges of sexual harassment by Dr. Christine Blaisy Ford when they were both teenagers.
In its starting argument, Kaveno was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and smoking, talking about his family and high school years.
In particular, he condemned the Commission's democrats by referring to the accusations against him about "the destruction of a violent and coherent character", organised by the Liberals, who are angry at the loss of Hillary Clinton in the Presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believes that Kaveno's testimony is a justification for not being able to work in the Supreme Court, because it shows that he has a bilateral attitude towards democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with such claims and attitudes with which he targets Clinton and Democrats," she said.
Pelossi objected when she was asked whether she would try to question Kaveno if she was approved and if the Democrats got a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say that if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he is not suitable not only for office in the Supreme Court, but also to work in the existing workplace in the court," Pelosi said.
Kaveno, right now, is a judge at the Washington County Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a democrat is concerned about the possibility that Kaveno makes decisions against the "Affordable Care Act" or Roe v. Way, because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his appointment negotiations, Kaveno approached questions about whether he would reject decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It is not a good time for a hysterical and duressy person to work in court, but we would expect us to be happy to say, "Isn't it wonderful?!", said Pelosi.
But women must hold their hands.
It's a denunciation, and for months and years it's all accumulated "over the edge", but she's not allowed to get it all out of herself crying.
"We cry when we're angry," said Mrs. Steinema in 45 years.
"I don't think it's something unusual, what do you think?"
She went on, "Sometimes a woman who herself was a manager in a company who said that she also wept when she was angry, but developed a technique — when she got angry and started to cry, she said to the person I was talking to: "You can think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she kept going.
And I thought it was great."
The tear is only partially recognized as a type of discharge of anger, because it is misunderstood fundamentally.
One of my most vivid memories is from the oldest work, where the proportion of men was pronounced, when I cried once because of undisclosed anger, when I was caught by an older woman, a restraining leader (a woman), from whom I was always a little afraid, who drew me to the stairwell.
"Never let them see that crying!" she said to me.
"They don't know you've gone.
They think you're sad and they're just gonna be happy that you managed to "pour under your skin."
Patricia Schroeder, the U.S. Congress of Democrats from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his pre-election campaign for the president.
In 1987, when Hart, who was caught in out-of-marriage, left the ship, also called "the making of fools" and quit the elections, Schroeder, was deeply disappointed, thought that there was no reason why she could not stand for the post of president.
"It wasn't a carefully thought-out decision," she laughed at me 30 years later.
"The election was already seven other candidates and the last thing they wanted another one to show up.
There were those who called it "Snow White and Seven Dwarves."
She was late involved in the campaign, she was lagging behind in raising funds and promised that she would not take part in the elections unless USD 2 million was collected.
It was a lost fight.
She found that many of her supporters, who donated $1,000 to men, donated only $250 to her.
"Do they think I'm getting discounts?" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was very emotional — grateful to the people who supported her, disappointed the system that made it very difficult to collect money and speak to the voters rather than to the delegates, and angry for sexism — in which she was 'killed'.
"You'd think I had a breakdown of nerves," Schroeder recalled the way the press reacted to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor."
I remember thinking what they're gonna write on my tombstone.
"She cried."
Why the US-China trade war can be beneficial to Beijing
The main excuses as to how the trade war between the US and China began are hidden and until the battle is over, the differences between the countries can be favourable to Beijing in the long term, according to experts.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning at the beginning of this year, taxing the main Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation began this week with new rates affecting the unit worth USD 200 billion (GBP 150 billion), immediately imposing half of the goods exported to the US from China.
Beijing also "kind" answers every time, the youngest is five to ten interest rates on 60 billion-dollar American goods.
China has announced that it is committed to responding to the US one-to-one and it is questionable that in the near future, the world's second largest economy could be mined.
In order for Washington to withdraw, it would have to agree to certain requirements, but it would have been too shameful for Chinese President Xi Xi Xi Jinping to bow to the US publicly.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the pressure of the US trade war can have a positive effect on China in the long term, reducing the interdependence of the economies of both countries.
"The fact that a quick political decision, either in Washington or Beijing, could create uncontrollable economic conditions in any country that are really more dangerous than observers have previously recognised," said Abigail Grace, a researcher at New American Security, who focuses on Asia.
Syria is a ready for the return of refugees, declared the Foreign Minister.
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild a country that has been ravaged by war for more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Almualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation on land is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists to their normal state.
There are all the conditions for refugees to return voluntarily to a country that they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that had an impact on their daily lives and earning a living.
The UN assumes that 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
A further six million people still live in the country and need humanitarian aid.
Almualem said that the Syrian regime would accept aid for the reconstruction of the devastated country.
But he stressed that the state would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that helped sponsor the riots.
European golf team sensationally wins Rider Cup in Paris
The European golf team won the 2018 Rider Cup, surpassing the US selection with a score of 16,5:10.5 "Le Golf National" outside Paris, France.
The United States has lost six times in a row in Europe and has not won the Raider Cup since 1993.
Europe regained the cup when a team led by a team led by the team of the team, Thomas Bjorn, scored 14.5 points, which was needed to beat the US sample.
The U.S. star Phil Michaelson, who had a hard time running all over the tournament, hit his T-tree in the water at about 3 16th pod, getting into the match at Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari brilliantly played in all his stages, becoming one of the four players who have ever managed to score 5-0-0 since 1979, when the tournament is played according to the existing format.
The American Jordan Spite with 5 to 4 sensationally lost European teams, by rating, to the lowest player, Thorbjörn Olesen, from Denmark.
The world's best player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 Ian Polter from England, for whom this was probably the last Raider Cup.
The veteran of the eight Raider Cups, Spaniard Serhio Garcia, became the best European player of the time with 25.5 career points.
"I don't cry normally, but today I can't hold tears."
This was a difficult year.
I am grateful to Thomas for taking me out and believing in me.
I'm very, very happy we've recovered the cup.
This is the merit of the team and I am glad that I was able to help," Garcia commented emotionally after the victory of the European team.
He goes on to give his compatriot John Rams, who won the US golf legend Tyger Woods on Sunday with 2 to 1 singles.
"The pride I feel when winning Taigeru Woods, I grew up following the course of this player," said 23 years young Ram.
Woods lost all his four matches in France and now he has a career record with 13-21-3 in Rider Cup.
Unusual statistics for one of the best players of all time, who won the 14 top-level golf tournaments, being the second behind Jack Niklas.
The U.S. team fought all weekends to find their opportunities, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golfing throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furitz said for his poor performance: "I'm proud of the guys, they fought.
This morning was the moment when we were able to put a little pressure on the European team.
We fought.
With all due respect to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played a very good game.
We will restructure, I will work with the American PGA and the US Rider Cup Committee and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You need to hit your hats.
We won."
