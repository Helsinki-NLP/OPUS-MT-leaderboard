New questions about the California water supply project
Critics and state legislator say that they want to know in more detail who pays for a US 16 billion-dollar project supported by Governor Jerry Brown, according to a representative of the leading California Water Administration, that the Brown administration offers government funding to complete the construction of two huge water tunnels.
Critics claim that the government funding described by the Los Angeles metropolitan water administration may run counter to the long-standing claims of the state that various local water administrations, not California itself, would pay for Brown's vision to dig two equal 35 miles long tunnels to drive water south of the Sacramento River, mainly to Central and South California.
Initial expenses for the construction of tunnels amounting to USD 248 million, which, although still subject to the approval of the supervisory authority, is already the subject of a federal audit.
On Wednesday, the state legislators also commissioned a state audit on the costs of building tunnels.
On Thursday, State Speaker Nancy Vogel said that despite the Los Angeles Metropolitan Water Management account, money from the general budget would not be used to complete the current planning phase of twin tunnels.
However, tunnel opponents and a group of taxpayers were critical on Thursday, and a representative of the Assembly, Susan Ega, one of the state legislators behind this week's audit, asked the state for explanations on Thursday.
"It's a game with a penny," said David Wolf, legal director of Howard Gervis's tax payers' association.
In my opinion, this coincides with yesterday's audit (request): there are many more questions than answers.
The tunnel project has been approved by Brown and some politically influential water authorities and water consumers in Central and Southern California.
Supporters claim that the tunnels will benefit the environment and provide California with safer water supplies.
Opposers say that they are worried that the State will use tunnels to divert too much water from the Sacramento River and the Gulf of San Francisco, causing damage to Northern California and further endangering local species.
Metropolies and other water supply agencies intended to receive water from tunnels still have to make a commitment to pay for them because of their insecurity as to whether investing a lot of money will actually bring enough water to make it pay.
The same water supply authorities also announced this year that they would not pay for the completion of the current preparatory work unless the project would first obtain the approval of the monitoring body.
On Thursday, the monthly report on the tunnel project published by the Los Angeles water supply authority states that "the state has indicated that additional funding for the completion of the planning phase will be provided from the state or federal budgets."
After all that local water authorities have spent on the project, including USD 63 million from his water supply authority, "it is expected that the state will use public money to complete planning," said Bob Muir, spokesman of the Los Angeles water supply authority.
Next, he directed questions to Wogel, the State Speaker.
Vogel said that the state plans to allocate money to complete tunnel planning from the fee for the existing half a century old water network, the State water project.
However, the opponents of tunnel construction point to a regulatory framework issued in 2009 which, according to them, prevents the state from spending money on tunnel construction, while the water supply authorities that will benefit from it will not be obliged to pay for them.
"The project contractor has promised to pay for this project and they have used financial tricks to circumvent these commitments," said Patricia Šiferle, an environmental consultant and an ancient opponent of the planned tunnels.
This raises questions about where this money was suddenly found.
Opening of the business group to China Cybersecurity Law
The coalition of international business groups has appealed to China to change the proposed cyber security rules to warn that they will harm trade and isolate the country.
The letter to the Chinese Prime Minister Li Kecjan has been signed by 46 groups from the USA, Europe, Asia and Latin America, demonstrating the global concern that regulations could restrict or suspend access to the Chinese information security product market.
Signatories include the US Chamber of Commerce, the European Service Forum and groups from Japan, Korea and Mexico.
The proposed rules require suppliers to show the Chinese authorities how security products operate and how information about Chinese citizens will be stored in the country.
The last letter, dated Wednesday, says that this could make it easier and lessen access to Chinese customers.
Chemical explosion in Tianjin: a year has passed since the tragedy
Zhang Mengfan claims that society deserves to know what happened in Tianjin.
The Chinese leaders are planning silent commemorations to commemorate the first anniversary of a large-scale chemical explosion, which killed 173 people, but not everyone agrees.
John Sadworth reports from Tianjin.
Almost anywhere else in the world, the anniversary of a disaster of this magnitude would be a moment to be remembered and commemorated by the people.
However, not in China.
Although there is a memorial service to commemorate some dead firefighters in the town of Taidjan, such commemorative events are excluded elsewhere.
The Communist Party's controlled media have been told what they can and cannot say, and some survivors, as well as family members of the victims, have been warned not to speak to the foreign press.
However, 23-year-old Zhang Mengfan does not want to remain silent.
"This anniversary the public should somehow find out what happened," he says to me.
I don't want silence.
On August 12, last year, Zhang was a radio operator at a military fire brigade just a mile away from the explosion epicentre.
"The call was received that night at 22.53 p.m., and we started sending my teammates," he says.
They could arrive at the event within 10 minutes.
Also teams from other parts of the city rushed to extinguish the vast fire in a chemical store.
None of them drew attention to the fact that large quantities of volatile and toxic substances were unlawfully stored, well above the permitted levels and without proper monitoring.
The fire began when it was allowed that a batch of nitrocellulose - a chemical used in nail polishes - dries out and then ignites in the summer churning.
Then it spread into a huge area - 800 tonnes of ammonium nitrate fertiliser.
The windows and fire station, where Zhang Mengfan waited for radio remote news from the scene, invaded the roof.
No such information was received.
"When I saw the mushroom cloud, I fell in despair," he tells me.
I knew what that would mean for my friends.
Of the 26 firefighters of his unit who were sent to the bombing site that night, eight never returned.
Many others suffered serious burns and other injuries.
The largest of the two major explosions was likened to an earthquake, and the wave of explosions was felt many kilometres away.
The total loss is estimated at over USD 1 billion, including over 300 destroyed buildings.
A total of 173 people lost their lives, 104 of whom were firefighters.
The remains of eight people have never been found.
The official governmental investigative bodies clearly blame corruption, political contacts and official collusion, which allowed circumvention of the rules and disregard of security systems.
First of all, such a warehouse should never have been built close to residential buildings.
More than 100 officials and representatives of the company’s management have been subject to disciplinary or criminal investigations.
Thus, while the government can point to the progress that has been made: thousands of homes assembled in order and compensation for the population, these sensitive issues remain topical.
The tragedy has revealed gaps in a system where rapid economic growth is a priority and the lack of independent supervision is a fact.
That evening’s courage and sense of duty are beyond doubt, and yet without the image of a firefighter as a hero, there is a rather encouraging picture.
It has a fireman as a victim who has been sent without prior knowledge to fight a man-made disaster that could have been prevented.
Zhang Mengfan is no longer working in the fire service, but will attend the memorial service in Tianjin.
He will carry the message of his dead companions in his heart.
Most of all I want to say to them: I have visited your parents and are doing well for them.
Leave your parents to me.
Now I'm a member of your family.
I'll do your job as sons.
Cold spring could affect the shooting season of Scottish roubles
The shooting season of Scottish roubles will start later, as the number of birds has dropped this year due to cold weather.
In several properties shooting has been postponed, as many of the new rubles have not survived in the cold spring conditions.
Marking the beginning of the season, the Scottish Game Organizers Association (SGA) says that shooting roubles provides more work than the Edinburgh festivals.
However, the animal protection charity OneKind calls for an end to the "gross killing of birds".
The director of the organization, Harry Hytton, said: "The work that is being invested in providing a large number of game birds for shooting is huge and undoubtedly involves some very controversial activities."
It is no surprise that society is turning away from this so-called sport and calling on the government to ban the cruel, unnecessary activities enjoyed by only a very small part of the Scottish population.
The landowners, however, insist that they commit themselves to keeping the number of birds and that the shooting of roubles is important for the development of the rural economy.
SGA President Alex Hog said that the industry provides 8 800 full-time jobs a year in remote regions and that it has been a "rich work patch" in uncertain times.
He said, "In comparison with many European countries, Scotland is not so deeply rooted in "hunting" culture, and some people do not know at all how shooting seasons affect the country economically."
Hog said that the number of jobs provided during the shooting exceeded the number of jobs created at the Edinburgh International Festival, the Friedzi Festival, the tattooing festival and the New Year's Eve celebration together.
He added: "The employment situation in Scotland is currently quite worrying, especially in the oil and gas sector, so game organisers and their families want to see the industry flourish.
We want to work with the Scottish Government to ensure that hard-working people can rely on these jobs in the future.
RSB Scotland believes that at least eight golden eagles have been killed in the vicinity of the life of the rubles.
Many game organisers admit that rubble shooting is not universally popular, but SGA claims that the industry "has taken significant steps forward in terms of best practice."
The opening day of the Roebian shooting season is traditionally known as the Holy Twelve.
However, there is still much discussion about this sport, and the management of rubble shooting sites is linked to the persecution of some of the offenders by nature conservation authorities.
On Thursday, RSB Scotland said that in less than five years, eight ringed golden eagles had disappeared in the mountains of Monadliata, southeast of Invernesa.
The Nature Conservation Charitable Foundation considers that they have been illegally killed near rubble shooting sites and their satellite bracelets have been destroyed.
The Scottish Minister for the Environment, Rosanna Caningham, said that these reports are "very worrying and disappointing."
Mrs Caningham asked the officials to analyse the evidence of about 90 surviving and missing eagles with transmitters in order to determine whether there is a trend in criminal activity.
The Scottish moor group blames the RSB for trying to stir up the feelings of gunfire before the beginning of the rouble season, and said that there is no clear evidence that the birds even died in the area of the Monadlit Mountains.
Rio Olympic Games 2016: Briona Paige wins silver tram jumps for Great Britain
British Peige wins silver tram jumps
Brioni Peige has become the first British woman to be awarded a medal at the Olympic Games in the form of tram jumping, and Rio has won silver.
Paige (25) missed 0.425 points to gold, because Canada's representative, Rosanna McLenana, won the second Olympic title in a row, with a score of 56.465.
The World Champion, China's representative Lee Dana, got to the bronze, while the other British finalist Katherine Dricole finished the sixth.
I can't believe I've won the Olympic medal.
I'm so happy," said the emotional page clearly.
I had no idea that it was a medal, but I was able to show the best performance, so I was so happy that all training and hard work had paid off.
I am so happy that I was able to take part in the finals together with Keta, that the participation of one representative in the finals would be historic, but we were there two.
Prior to the Olympic silver competition, Peidge’s highest achievement in international competitions was the fifth in the 2015 World Championship in Denmark.
Trampling was included in the Olympic Games in 2000, and this is the first time that British women have managed to get to the finals.
Response to the medal.
A British team representative, Nathan Bailey, the only representative in men's competition for tram jumping on Saturday, was an ecstasy.
Hannah Velana, who is taking part in the Olympic Games for the second time, quickly began to praise the achievement of the Peidsha.
Paige has won a bachelor's biology with excellence at Sheffield University.
Rio 2016: Fiji fans celebrate the regbia-7 gold medal
12-year-old boy to see the game,skien half a mile both for cane fields to the nearest television set
Fiji, after the first Olympic gold medal in its history, marks an unprecedented celebration
Banks closed, shops closed and celebration took Suvas streets, dancing, singing and rejoicing
Fiji won a gold medal, at the deodoro stadium rugby-7 final with 43-7 destroying Britain.
Thousands of people throughout the island country stopped their work to watch the historic game.
Fiji celebrates its first Olympic medal in its history
Many fans were dressed in Fiji’s colors and rugby’s shirts, carrying the national flag and encouraging the team.
When the end of the game whistle was shattered, the thrilled celebrants went to the streets, enjoying and dancing.
"Some people even stopped their vehicles on the crowded streets of Suva and joined the celebrations with Fiji's flags, without addressing the small congestion they created," reports the Fiji Times.
The celebrations will certainly continue during the weekend and next week.
Irish Premier League: Finn Harps 0-5 Derry City
Aaron McKenef hit two first half-time penalty kicks for a guest team in Finnpark.
Derry City has ascended to the second one in the Premier League, winning a convincing victory with a score of 5-0 in the fight with Finn Harps.
Aaron McKenef put forward a "candy stripe" under the leadership of two first half-time penalty strikes that were granted for violations against Lucas Schubert.
Nathan Boye hit the goal at the beginning of the second half, and Schubert beat his opponent in the fourth quarter before Keith Ward's late pass, closing the opponent's breakup in Finnpark.
Derry is on one point in front of Cork City, and both teams will meet in the crucial game Monday evening in Brendivel.
It was Derry's first victory over its north-west competitors this season, and they were disturbed by me on the HARPS side.
In 17 minutes after Cyran Cole's move against Schubert, McKenef saved the game's launch, even though the infringement turned out to be out of court.
There was no doubt about the second punitive blow, when former "Caramel Strip" mid-guard Barry Molloy made Schubert fall to the ground and McNef achieved the result 2-0 in the third minute after the break.
Boye put an exact point after Dine Gervis's hand with his foot inside the eighth minute after restarting the game.
The Derry City goalkeeper, Gerard Doherty, had a peaceful evening, but he managed to protect the gate perfectly, beat David Scully at the best opening of the game.
Schubert knocked the ball past Kol before the show in 83 minutes, and this was soon followed by Ward's smart rebound over Harp's center guard Richard Brass.
It was Derry's biggest victory in the race series and a great preparation for the closing game with Cork.
Test after massive tests at the University of Highlands and Islands (UHI) course of Invernes College
The entire course of 20 students could have failed in the test of the Inverness College UHI's highest media course.
Most of them were students aged 17 and 18 who were hoping to take advantage of the grade they received in their studies to join the university.
The Inverness College UHI claims that quality assurance processes are being applied, adding that the Scottish Qualification Authority (SQA) is investigating the case.
The SQA press secretary said that the 2016 highest media rating available throughout the country is "as expected".
Twenty students signed up for the course offered and evaluated by the Inverness College UHI.
Many of the students were young people living in rural areas who were taught online, but they often had to go to the Invernes College from their places of residence, such as Locheibera.
One student’s father said that after his daughter’s publications in social media that she did not receive any assessment of her work, at least 10 others also announced that they had not received any assessment of her course.
He said to BBC News Scotland directly that about five more people who attended the Inverness College last year and who managed to communicate with, said that the same happened to them.
The situation means that his daughter cannot provide a place at Glasgow University, but she will be able to accept the offer of another university thanks to the qualifications obtained at school.
However, her father said that there were others who attended the college's organized media course, who failed and who were now in "forget" and insecure about whether their course work would be reviewed and evaluated with a mark so that they could join universities.
Inverness College UHI is part of the University of Highlands and Islands.
Diana Rovlinson, head of Inverness College UHI and executive director said: "We have exam results and student success very important."
This is confirmed by the excellent review of Her Majesty's Education Inspectorate (HMIE) received this year, as well as by the improved attainment levels in both further and higher education compared to last year.
As every year, we carry out an overview of all published results, comparing them to the forecasts of each student.
In the case of this particular course, standard quality assurance measures were taken and the evaluation body recently reported "significant improvements in the delivery and management of this assessment" and confirmed that "assessments were in line with national standards".
SQA is currently investigating the case at our request.
SQA press secretary said: "We are pleased that the evaluation of the highest media in 2016 has been carried out as planned and that candidates had the opportunity to show their understanding of the subject."
Many candidates have shown good performance and there was a slight increase in the A-C score compared to the same qualification last year.
It was developed according to previous and model documents and according to our course and assessment specifications.
The brothers were put into prison for a sammary sword "bloodbath" in Kilmarnok
Jason Braden was attacked by a samurai sword, a knife and a nunchak
Two brothers were imprisoned for killing a man with a samurai sword after drug-related theft in Airshire, which turned out to be a "blood-bath".
Sacrifice Jason Braden (38) was stabbed several times in his home in Kilmarnok on 5 July 2015.
In the High Court in Glasgow, James Clark (36) will be sentenced to at least 22 years in prison after being convicted of murder.
His brother John (38) was sentenced to 10 years in prison after being sentenced to less severe charges of unintelligence for murder.
Judge Bill Dunlop told the brothers that they had committed "a cruel, cruel and savage attack."
He rejected any assumption that Mr. Braden had slept and waited for them, armed with a samurai sword.
Judge Danlops added: "You plan together to enter illegally with at least one knife and nunchaks."
Jason Braden may have been a drug dealer, but he was a son, a father, and a friend.
You killed him.
After imprisonment of both men in prison, the criminal police inspector, who led the investigation, said: "The violent and terrible actions of Jon and James Clark have led to the death of Jason Braden."
At the age of 38, his life in his world is in such terrible conditions that the family has to survive.
The court heard earlier that the brothers from Kilmarnoc decided to take away Mr. Braden’s gold bracelet they had given him in exchange for drugs.
Both of them, under the influence of alcohol and drugs, went to his house, camouflaged their faces with scarves and armed with a knife and an eastern fight nunchaks.
It is believed that the sword used in murder belonged to the dead.
Neighbors said they saw Clarkas attacking Braden when he sat on the couch near the window and heard him screaming.
The prosecutor Richard Godard said at the hearing: "The attack on this man was enduring, chaotic."
Then the place of murder was described as a "blood-bath".
In addition to injuries from knife stitches, Braden suffered a severe injury with a blunt object during the attack.
Three days later, he died at Kilmarnoca Crosshaus Hospital.
Both brothers didn't admit to murder.
In providing evidence, James Clark, who has already been tried 38 times before, including the attempted murder, said, "I didn't want it. It was an accident."
John Clark, who had already been tried 23 times before, said that he was just engaged in helping a brother who, according to him, was attacked by Braden."
A man has been sentenced to prison for the search and killing of his infant’s son
David Sinkler confessed his guilt for killing a child at his home in Eastkill in 2012.
A man who shook and killed his baby in an outburst of anger because he didn't want to eat, sentenced to seven years and three months imprisonment.
David Sinkler shook four-month-old Joshua when "for a moment lost control" at their home in Eastkill Broadcast, South Lancashire, on 6 December 2012.
The cause of death was determined only by a medical examination.
Sinkler (34) was originally accused of murder, but was found guilty of murder without a prior intention.
In the High Court of Glasgow, when he was sentenced to prison, Judge Lord Breiseidl Sinkler said: "You attacked your infant son by shaking him, causing injuries from which he died."
When you were shaking him, you had to know it, but you didn't reveal it.
Only after a thorough medical examination have you confessed what you have done.
Your wife believed you.
Now she feels betrayed and can no longer support you.
Lord Breiseidl described the consequences of Joshua's death as "catastrophic" for everyone and said, "Nothing will return Joshua."
Previously, the court had found that on the day of his child’s death, Sinkler and his wife, Cursey, had gone with Joshua to swim and shop in Eastkill Broadcast.
At 17.30 C. Sinkler went to see her mother and sister.
Just 11 minutes later, Sinkler called her, who sounded "shocked."
He said to her, "I don't breathe properly, come home right now."
Then he finished the conversation and called 999.
The infant was taken immediately to the hospital of Hermair, where he died.
The cause of Joshua’s death was initially unclear, but he was examined by a team of forensic experts who identified the consequences of injuries in the eyes and brain that occurred shortly before his death, and such injuries could not be caused by chance.
One of the experts, Dr. Peter Richard, counseling child neurosurgeon at John Red Cliff Hospital in Oxford, said: "This is because the child has been shaken and has been injured, as well as touched by more force than in everyday life."
The defence representative, Jan Dougid, told the court that Sinkler "repents" what he did.
Rio Olympic Games 2016: Chloy Tatone Threatens Julia Jefimova's Positions
The British representative Tatonis slips out of her hands in a 200-meter bronze bath
The British representative, Chloy Tatone, criticises the controversial swimmer Julia Jefimova’s participation in the Rio Games after the Russian representative overtakes him in a 200-metre swim.
Jefimova, who was allowed to participate in the games following a complaint against a doping ban, wins silver, leaving Taton in fourth place.
"I would have liked them to be completely clean games," then said a 20-year-old Welsh swimmer.
It's not me who's in there.
I'm not happy with that, but that's what it is.
Jephimova, who won the second prize, learned about her participation in the games only three days ago.
I do not want to see people leaving the sport, but I do not think that is really right.
She did not have to take part in the race, and a 20 - year - old British representative had to win a medal.
Rie Kaneto won Japan's seventh gold medal in 2016 in Rio, surpassing Jefimov, who was awarded the silver medal.
Chinese representative Ginling This was at the bronze, just six hundredths of a second ahead of the fourth single Taton.
Her British teammate, 20 - year - old Molly Renšov, finished her sixth.
"The fourth place is a little disappointment, no matter what you have in front of you," Tatone added.
It's a great experience and I'm a little disappointed at the fourth place.
I'm so close to a medal, and that would have been a dream.
However, the finalisation itself is a great experience that I will take with me in the coming years.
It was a little disappointment, but in the long term, it will make me strong, and it makes me increasingly seek a medal, so hopefully I will get closer to it next time.
Tatone was only 0.01 seconds behind the British record women's 200 m swimming finals.
"Every person must be given a second chance," - Jefimova.
Jefimova, who said that she was tired of answering questions about her doping past, defended her right to participate in Rio.
In 2013, she was banned from 16 months after her body had found traces of anabolic steroids.
The Sports Arbitration Court (CAS) established that athletes cannot be denied participation in Rio games because they have been sanctioned in advance.
CAS dealt with my complaint, and I won.
If someone doesn't like it and has a different opinion, they can turn to CAS," she explained.
I do not support doping, and I have never used it.
In the second case, it was certainly not my fault.
Every person must be given a second chance.
When you're coming and writing you a penalty bill, nobody's putting you in jail.
Ben Prieds wins 50 free-style swimming places
Previously, a British record was set up to win the 50 m men free-style swim finals.
Union champion Praud (21) floated in 21.54 seconds to qualify as the fifth fastest on Friday's final (02:44 BST Saturday).
Your delegation is shameless and rude
The Indian Sports Minister, Viyay Goel Rio, has had a rather striking personality at the Olympic Games, often seen in podiums, encouraging Indian athletes, and taking selfies after their start.
However, he and his extensive company have apparently provoked the anger of the Olympics' organizers because of their uncontrollable behaviour, repeatedly trying to break up to the race zones without adequate accreditation and rudely reacting, being tested, says the Indian news agency Press Trust of India.
Vijay Goel, photographed in July, justifies his behavior.
On Wednesday, the organisers of the Olympic Games threatened to withdraw Goel’s accreditation if his behaviour did not improve by sending a warning letter after he and his company tried to enter restricted areas at the venue of the gymnastics competition and the arena where the fairytales and steakvandos take place.
"We have received several reports that your Sports Minister has tried to enter accredited competition areas with persons without accreditation," says Sarah Peterson, continental manager of the Rio 2016 Organizers Committee.
When the staff tried to explain that it was not allowed, the people together with the Minister became aggressive and rude, and sometimes broke past our staff.
"If our protocol team becomes aware of any further cases of such behaviour, your sports minister's accreditation will be revoked and his privileges in the Olympic Games will be abolished," said the letter.
The leader of the Indian delegation called this case "an elephant blown out of the fly", and Goels himself said that he had done nothing wrong by writing it all down as "a misunderstanding".
He wrote on Twitter: "As far as I know, we have complied with all the rules.
We maintain the spirit of the Olympic Games and support our Indian athletes.
Otherwise, the Olympic Games are rather gloomy for India, and there are no medals yet.
Lost fans of hope in social media pointed out that Michael Phelps has won so many medals - 26 - like India in its history.
Several prominent candidates have already been excluded, including the shooter Abhinavs Bindra, who won the gold medal in Beijing in 2008.
This time he remained fourth.
Money and opportunity have been launched in the wind," the author and author of the column Shoba De wrote in sardonian tweet.
However, some bright expectations remain, as there will still be a boxing, golfing, tennis, athletics and, yes, badminton.
The only Indian gymnast Dip Karmakar will compete in the finals of jumps on Sunday, showing her scary double-speed "Death Jump", Produnova jump, which only a few other gymnasts have tried.
In a country where 1.25 billion people live, the low number of medals fought by India has always been a cause of indignation.
Analysts say there are countless reasons for this.
National passion is a cricket, which is not an Olympic sport.
India has not invested heavily in infrastructure and Olympian training - Karmakar's first exercise tool was made of spare parts of an old scooter.
Parents have always stressed the superiority of academic knowledge over sport.
And the authorities responsible for sport have been overtaken by corruption.
The International Olympic Committee has suspended the Indian Olympic Association for violations of its statutes in 2012 because it elected leaders who are prosecuted.
In Sochi, three participants of the Indian Winter Olympics were even prevented from representing their country, carrying a flag, or wearing anything with national symbols.
They competed as independent athletes.
When people get injured, JetBlue's jet, shaken by turbulence, is forced to land on the Boston-Sacramento route in South Dakota.
The JetBlue plane was forced to make an emergency landing on Thursday evening after 22 passengers and two crew members were injured during turbulence, reports CBS Sacramento.
Flight 429 from Boston to Sacramento landed in Rapid City, South Dakota, shortly before 19:30 p.m. local time.
The airline says that the injured people have been taken to the hospital for inspection.
JetBlue claims that it has sent staff to help the injured, a spare aircraft has flew to Rapid City to take the rest of the passengers to Sacramento.
Drug Control Agency (DEA) misses the opportunity for medical cannabis
The answer is, unfortunately: unlikely.
This is a missed opportunity, which may further delay the provision of treatment to countless people.
Until today, there is only one source of approved medical cannabis use for scientific purposes at the University of Mississippi at federal level.
In apparently slightly more positive news today, DEA also announced that it would now allow other places to apply for permission to do the same.
It is hoped that the amount and diversity of marijuana available for scientific purposes could increase.
Although it will attract attention as a emphasis in favour of the study, it will be largely symbolic, because no matter how much marijuana is available, if access is still difficult, it does not matter.
Imagine a product that is in great demand, but is stored behind closed doors.
In response to the demand for goods, someone makes a difficult-to-understand decision to produce more, but to get and it never opens the door.
This product is marijuana and its presence on list 1 is this locked door.
A medical marijuana is in such an unpleasant situation.
As marijuana is a substance on list 1 (i.e. by definition it "is not currently authorised for medical use and has a high potential for unforeseen uses"), there are significant barriers to closing doors.
Potential researchers usually first turn to DEA because it authorises the launch of scientific research.
Even if an authorisation is granted for the investigation of substances on list 1, the authorities must comply with very strict safety rules and set up a high level of safety systems, which may be costly.
There is also an even more subjective consideration of obtaining authorisation from their academic institution to carry out research on substances in List 1 above all.
Even if some of the faculty's representatives want to carry out this study, university management may be reluctant to have a problem or some potential side effects due to negative press reports.
This was the case at the University of Arizona, when Dr. Sue Sisley was released from his post after trying to move medical marijuana tests forward.
In the end, she had to seek private funding for her project, and only in April, seven years after the initial project was initiated, her project became the first medical marijuana test approved by the DEA for post-traumatic stress prevention veterans.
Then, after years of struggle with bureaucratic obstacles, the National Institute of Drug Addiction has been at the key to the last lock.
At present, it is the largest federal public funder for the exploration of marijuana, and it is the only supplier of marijuana itself.
Even if more medical medicine is released into free circulation, the Institute will still have to approve all the research financed by it.
However, the problem is the word "abuse" in its name.
Dr. Donald Eybram, a representative of the University of San Francisco, interviewed for his documentary "Marijuana", says that the Institute's main task is to study substances in the context of their potential dependence, not as medicines.
Abram draws attention to an important fact.
Even if the study overcomes all the obstacles listed above, the door may still be closed if the intention is to study the benefits of medical marijuana rather than its harm.
Note: In a quick (and, admittedly, unscientific) search, the U.S. National Medical Library found 1 434 works on medical cannabis in the last five years.
In the same quest, only 57 works were about the benefits of medical marijuana.
Most of the studies were about harm caused by marijuana, such as "A bad trip due to the anticholinergic effects of marijuana", "Marijuana-induced pancreatitis" and "Marijuana use and risk of lung cancer."
Such disproportion creates a rather distorted picture.
The path to medical marijuana is paved with surprises and hypocrisy wherever the view opens.
While DEA takes up the status of List 1 without looking at the medical effect, the U.S. Department of Health and Social Affairs at the same time retains the cannabionid patent for large-scale medical purposes.
DEA continues to put marijuana alongside heroin and LSD as a drug with a high potential to develop addiction, although the main judge of administrative law in DEA itself, Francis Young, opposed it.
In a strict medical sense, marijuana is safer than many widely consumed foods.
For example, eating 10 fresh potatoes may cause toxic reactions.
By comparison, it is physically impossible to eat enough marijuana to lead to death.
Marihuan is one of the safest therapeutic active substances known to mankind in its natural form.
By rational analysis, marijuana can be used safely in medicine by appropriate monitoring.
Again, it was proposed by the judge of the DEA itself.
But almost 30 years later, little has changed.
Whether we are aware of it or not, we all accept a certain dose of hypocrisy in our daily lives.
Maybe we don't always have the energy to say it out loud, or we're so dumb or stunned that nobody seems to have noticed it.
As far as hypocrisy is concerned in the context of federal medical marijuana policy, there must be strength to present the facts in a permanent manner.
The lives of patients, such as Charlotte Fiji, whose seizures are reduced by the use of medical marijuana, and many others depend on it.
For the fact that the plant can bring so many benefits and still be behind closed doors, it is worth talking at a higher level.
Bloody Beetroots: Donald Trump's "blond Berlusconi"
Bloody Beetroots is known in the context of electronic dance music
Musicians say Trump dominates the media like Berlusconi
You know, we're used to Berlusconi in Italy, and for me Trump looks like blond Berlusconi," the founder of the electronic music punks association "The Blood Beetroots" said CNN.
The candidate for the post of President of the Republican Republic and the Italian media magnate, who has become a politician, both known for his exaggerated personality, the ability to attract press attention and altered stories in the media.
"Bloody Beetroots" is known for its electronic dance music and has collaborated with various artists, starting with the legendary Sir Paul McCarthy and ending with the electro-pop singer Greta Svabo Bechu in 2013 in the song "Chronicles of a Fallen Love."
Rifo was born in the Italian city of Basano del Grapa, near Venice, in 1977, which coincides with the time when the punk rock was born, and the numbers "1977" are tattooed by the musician on his chest.
"English is not my mother tongue, so I don't understand everything about your world," Rifo said, hiding behind the black fee that he is familiar with.
I'm trying to explore, and I've tried to improve my understanding of your culture.
Rifo invited Americans to watch "Videocracy", a documentary that examines the monopoly of Berluskoni over Italian media.
The documentary is about how "The Berlusconi made Italy crazy," Rifo said, adding that Trump had a similar influence on America.
"You see how a person can completely turn the system and fold everything out... on his own," he said.
I think Trump is not good for this country.
Two Turkish sailors were imprisoned in a drug case of over GBP 500 million
Two Turkish men have been convicted of smuggling cocaine worth over GBP 500 million on board in the North Sea, each sentenced to at least 20 years in prison.
Mamin Sahin and Emin Ozman were found guilty of trial in the High Court in Glasgow after about 100 miles from the coast of Aberdeen on the deck of MV Hamal were found three tons of A-class drugs.
Detention in 2015 is the largest cocaine seized in one step and has ever been detained at sea in Europe.
Mamin Sahin and Emin Ozman were sentenced to prison for his role in a large-scale drug transaction
One of the largest drug shipments found on board in British history
The drugs were found hidden in a specially arranged ambush on a tugboat registered in Tanzania that sailed from Istanbul to Tenerife and then to the North Sea.
It was stopped by the British navy Fregate "HMS Somerset" and the border vessel "HMC Valiant".
Sahins (47) was sentenced to 22 years, but Osmans (51) in the Supreme Court of Glasgow is sentenced to 20 years.
Judge Lord Kinkleiven said to men that the amount of drugs was "not only substantial but ambitious", and drug trafficking has a "destructive effect" on people and the surrounding society.
He said, "You were involved in the most commercial operation, including the transport of cocaine by ship, an operation that crossed international and truly intercontinental borders."
He said that the captain of the ship, Sahin, was not "the tip of the drug tree", but he played a significant role in the crime, while the other master, Ozman, played "something less".
Inspectors climbed onto the Hamal deck after being enticed by the French customs authority DNRED, and when it landed in Aberden, they drilled through a steel plate, accessing a secret compartment where 128 bundles of cocaine of 3.2 tonnes were found, with an approximate value on the black market of 512 million pounds.
MV Hamal last year was inspected by the royal fleet.
Three tonnes of cocaine were carried on board.
Inspection of ships found that its ballast tanks were fused into tons of Class A drugs
The ship was on its way from the Bosporus Strait to South America before it was stopped in the North Sea.
Access to this place was opened under the closet in one of the crew's crew rooms, and the gap was cemented.
Sahin and Ozman were found guilty of transporting and hiding cocaine on board during the period from 20 February to 23 April last year and of supplying cocaine between 21 April and 23 April last year.
The two previously unpunished men who have worked in the shipping industry since graduation continue to claim not to be guilty, but still make the jury's verdict.
There is no evidence of accusations against four more men.
Sayin's lawyer Jonathan Crov, said that married father of two children is a "glorified mule".
He said, "Someone who was involved in drug trafficking."
Someone who was able to drive the ship.
Looking at the drug hierarchy, Sahin is certainly not at the tip of the drug tree, but somewhere below.
The huge amount of cocaine on board means that it had to be built on a crane
The police went through the entire ship for days before the drugs were distributed through these boxes
She asked questions about his captain's work at "Hamal" in February 2015, the court heard.
Mr. Krow said that he was "shocked" about the fact that important events of his daughter (9) and son (13) should pass and "simplely want to go back to Turkey".
Both men have not seen their families since their arrest in April 2015, as the families are still struggling to obtain visa approval.
Ozman's lawyer Di Moor said that he "will desperately" want to see his family, but knows that in the foreseeable future it will not "be possible".
Speaking after today's judgments, Scottish Public Prosecutor David Harvey said: "International drug trafficking has no borders, and we, who have the task of destroying it, are working more and more closely together to make sure we are one step ahead.
"The success of Scotland in the persecution of criminals is indeed at global level, and in this case we have caused considerable economic damage to organised crime."
Drugs were packed in all gaps on board, including under the floor.
Inspectors of these smuggled parcels found hidden in the ship's laundry room
Mr. Harvey added: "Hamal" was identified by intelligence instructions from the French authorities, and after rapid cooperation with the General Prosecutor of Tanzania, where the ship is registered, who also permitted to board.
"Our investigation then came from Guiana, which provided access to relevant data on shipments, to Spain, which provided us with very valuable information on the ship's stops in the Canary Islands.
We also worked with colleagues in Denmark, Norway and the USA to put together specific evidence elements.
Despite the thorough intelligence that Hamal carries a large amount of drugs, British authorities could not climb on board in international waters without the permission of the Government of Tanzania - something that they had never granted before.
Suu Peiten, Head of International Justice and Combating Organised Crime at the Royal Criminal Prosecutor's Office (CPS), said: "In a quick and precise manner, the Criminal Advisor of the CPS managed to obtain permission from the Tanzanian authorities to board the ship within 24 hours of receiving the intelligence information.
Under international maritime law, British officials shall not be entitled to climb in international waters on board a ship flying the flag of another State unless that State grants special legal permission to do so.
Without the swift action of our criminal advisor, there would be a great risk that the ship could escape and that we could never bring these people to justice.
Photographer Brian Romeyjn perpetuates the failed "Eastern Express" train
Photographer Brian Romeyjn from Rotterdam has taken photos of this abandoned train in Belgium
Figures show the rusting inside of the train, torn seats, dust-covered windows and narrow driver’s cab
It has already been called the East Express wagon, but it belonged to the Belgian national railway company
The city explorer has taken these remarkable photographs of the lost remains of a passenger train that has once been one of the best ways to travel.
Its flower times have long passed, and the train wagon and locomotive have been left to blow up the train depot in Belgium, where they have become a popular attraction for photographers and adventurers.
Photographer Brian Romeyjn, 40, has taken these frightening photographs showing the rusting inside of the train, torn seats, dust-covered windows and compressed driver's cab
The train wagon and the locomotive have been left to blow up the train depot in Belgium, where they have become a popular attraction for photographers and adventurers.
These trains were a symbol of luxury when they operated under the legendary name between 1883 and 2009.
The Locomotives were used by the Belgian national railway company about 50 years ago.
126 years later, the last train running under the name of the Eastern Express went from Strasbourg to Vienna in December 2009, concluding the famous historical period.
The Eastern Express was famous on the route Paris - Istanbul.
When it was launched in 1883 (operator - La Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits) it was known as "Express d'Orient" in French.
It became the Eastern Express in 1891, and until 1930 it already had regular routes throughout Europe.
It should not be confused with the private "Venice Simpson-Orient-Express".
Very few luxury wagons for "Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits" remain.
In the narrow driving cab in which the equipment rustes, measuring instruments and exposed wires are still installed
Romeyjn said that the driver's cab was "in its own way claustrophobic, and the noise of the locomotive was probably unbearable."
The abandoned locomotive and the wagon have become a popular attraction for photographers and adventurers.
After visiting the forgotten train in Belgium, Romenj MailOnlineTravel said, "I really could feel how it was used in its flower times."
For wealthy gentlemen, the high hats join the ladies in beautiful dresses.
Grim's artisticity Katherine Galloway is turning into the Arrested Development series in Baster Bluth
Thanks to her impressive makeup skills, reviews and transformations, the Texas and YouTube censone Kathleen Galloweja have reached the fan army.
However, her latest transformation into Baster Blut from "Arrested Development" is quite unbelievable by any standards.
In a three-minute-long video uploaded on her Kiki G YouTube channel, Galloy slowly and continuously turns herself into a failed image with a hook instead of a hand.
Even at the end of the video, she uses an audio recording from the show in a terrible but at the same time great performance.
The talented make-up artist starts her video in her image, a black woman.
Then, with the help of slow photographs, she slowly turns into a brimstone, which already has hair retreats, and who is Tony Heil Baster Blut.
Galloway does it with colored contact lenses, shading and pulling contours around her nose and eyes, as well as drawing the face of Baster on her head.
Wise methods: Using the slow photograph wisely, she slowly turns into Tony Heil Baster Blut.
During her video, she also takes over the personality and manners of the image of cult TV, drawing the chin accordingly.
Klipu, which has been placed on YouTube, has been watched more than 45,000 times, and quite quickly comments of the makeup artist's skills appeared:
"You're extremely talented," a person wrote a video under Galloween.
During her video, she also takes over the personality and manners of the cult TV image
"I like how you stay in the image when you do all this," said someone else.
The videobloger Kathleen Galloway had previously successfully turned into a "Parks and Recreation" image of Ron Svenson.
She told her YouTube followers that she was hoping to make make makeover every week in the future.

In Lancashire, father is expelled from children's school for carrying T-shirt with lame words
The father of two children expelled from the school for the arrival of their sports day on the T-shirt with an offensive inscription.
Craig Macbeth (36) of the town of Lancashire, Berne, says that he "adjourned" his shirt with the inscription "Laijam un dr.am!"
However, despite the fact that when he noticed his mire and wore the T-shirt vice versa, the next day he found that it was forbidden for him to enter school territory.
The lone father, who for four years worked as the head of the Park’s primary school in Kolne, Child, could not come after the children because of the ban, and the staff even summoned the social services and the police.
Craig Macbett (36) of the Children says that he is not admitted to the school territory after he had arrived at an offensive T-shirt for a day of sports for children.
Mr. Burnley accuses the headmaster of the school, Sarah Midgie, of overreacting.
He says he has been unduly punished for having put on a T-shirt before going to watch his two-child race by mistake.
My father, who is no longer working as a head of school, said, "It was a mistake and carelessness on my part."
I don't think about sports day and I rushed when I put it on.
We had a father's race closer to the end of the event, and the director noticed my T-shirt and told me that it was not suitable.
I apologized and cut it off, and that ended the case.
However, a 36-year-old man said that he had received a letter from the heads of school that night inviting him to a meeting with the director the next day, but he did not see the need to do so because he had already apologized.
"Then the school director called me and told me that I was banned from entering the school territory," added Mr. Burnley.
I learned that after the day of sports, some parents had raised the alarm on the Facebook site and that many people were interested in it.
Any person with a good mind would say that this is exaggerated.
Mr Macbeth, editor of the online magazine Love Mini, said that, in his opinion, he could not even come after the children on the last day of the semester because of the ban.
However, this was the reason for the call from school and social services.
On the T-shirt was the image of Craig Charles Lister of the BBC cult comedy Red Dwarf, with one of his iconic expressions "Laizam and Dr.am."
He commented: "I told them that I wasn't there because I was forbidden to go to school.
Then I was called from the social services and asked why I was not after my daughter.
The school also called the police because I hadn't come after my daughter for about 40 minutes."
Mr Macbeta claims that he was told that he could no longer come to school and that the ban would apply until further statements are made.
He also said that he had been warned that he could be fined GBP 500 if he was caught in violation of this rule.
Sarah Mydley, the director of the Park’s primary school, said that the case had now been closed.
Sarah Mydley, Director of the Park Primary School, said: "I can confirm that Mr. Macbeth has resigned and is no longer the head of our school."
This case is now over, and I hope to return to my normal school life in September."
The child’s city adviser Joe Kooney said that the school had clear policies and guidelines.
"We must all bear in mind that when taking up posts such as counsellors or managers, you are subject to higher standards, and unfortunately this time he did not meet these standards," he said.
Counselor Jonathan Nixon added that he did not think that the school should have been banned and that an elephant was blown out of the fly.
Mr. Nixon added, "The wearing of such a T-shirt was silly, and he apologized for it."
The Lancashire police confirmed they were calling from school, but they didn't come.
Recently, the premises of the former VEF factory, located in the Brīvības gatve, have been renovated - there are several IT companies, the industry has already begun to call this area the local Silicon Valley.
The rest of the VEF area, including Berzaunes, is also developing.
Development and construction of the 2nd stage project of the University of Latvia Academic Centre Tornakalns will cost 21 million euros.
The procurement announced by the University of Latvia for the development, construction and author supervision of the technical project of the Academic Centre in Tornakalns, Riga, is concluded, according to the announcement on the website of the Procurement Monitoring Bureau.
The procurement takes the form of a negotiated procedure without prior publication of a contract notice.
The contract will be concluded with the general partnership LNK Industries group, which has undertaken to carry out these works for 21 186 560 EUR.
As explained by LU, the University, when launching the European Union fund for the planning and implementation of the 2014-2021 planning period, continues the design, author monitoring and construction of the next stage of the Academic complex - the Science Centre building, according to the Skiči project and the updated construction meta.
The science centre's building is similar to the one designed and constructed in the 1st edition of the Academic Centre of Natural Sciences and its activities, which are similar according to the most important technical and technological parameters, as well as in terms of the scientific and academic staff and number of students in the building.
The project of sketches developed by SIA Sixth style was added to the terms of the competition, which already provided all potential suppliers with information about the development vision of the University of Latvia Academic Centre in Torņkalns, including a list of the objects planned by the University of Latvia Academic Centre, indicating the name of each particular object, the estimated area of the object, the planned year of commissioning of the object and other information.
At the end of 2015, SIA Sixth style made adjustments to the previously developed territory of the Academic Centre of the University of Latvia Torņakalns building complex, as a result of which the location of the buildings of the Academic Centre and their interlinking, as well as transport organization in and around the territory of the meta.

Ombudsman: Demagogy on compulsory health insurance model with additional financial burden on citizens does not hold any criticism.
Any demagogy on compulsory health insurance, which would impose a direct and heavy payment burden on citizens, does not hold any criticism, considers the Ombudsman Juris Jansons.
Jansons met with Health Minister Anda Chaks today to discuss the situation in the health sector.
After the meeting, Jansons told journalists that the financing model proposed by the Minister for Health was sustainable and developed in the health care system, making it more accessible to patients.
He noted, however, that in this case there was a need to talk about additional funding for healthcare, which is currently insufficient.
Jansons also stressed that any demagogy on compulsory health insurance, which would impose a direct and heavy burden of payment on citizens, did not hold any criticism, especially when calling on the Dutch model.
Jansons said that the Netherlands devotes 11% of gross domestic product to health, while Latvia only 3%.
The Government and Parliament must therefore be responsible enough to understand that this freezing point must rise, the Ombudsman said, and added that otherwise the model proposed by the Ministry of Health (MH) would not work.
Čakša thanked the Ombudsman for his support and pointed out that the main concern is that the patient should receive a doctor, which in turn means that the healthcare system needs additional funding.
The Minister pointed out, however, that with the additional EUR 35 million planned next year, it will only be possible to do the most acute cases regarding oncological patients and the remuneration of maternity specialists.
As a result, the MoU has developed a plan and submitted a request for an additional €41 million to be allocated to health care in order to reduce the waiting lists for specialists and for examinations.
"The question of priorities whether or not it will have the means," said Chang.
This amount, however, does not include an increase in the remuneration of medical professionals.
Commenting on the fact that the medical profession is not thrilled that all three options of the healthcare financing model, including the one which provides for an additional payment to patients, are being driven by the MM for government scrutiny, he said that by driving all three models, the government is being given the opportunity to choose.
Jansons also added that by directing all three models, it is possible to clearly show that Latvia is not ready to impose additional burden on the population.
As already reported, the Ministry of Health will defend the option of the health care financing model, which does not envisage an overall increase in the tax burden, but requires a part of the social tax to be passed on to health, says the conceptual summary of the report "On the change of the financing model of the Latvian health care system".
At the same time, the Ministry indicated that the best version of the model for financing health care will be chosen as a result of discussions by the end of September.
Local watermelons are ready.
Arbūzi has given up this year, admits the owner of the Arojas Rolands Dambis in Grobiņa municipality Medze municipality.
Watermelons can already be purchased in the Liepaja market.
Several early varieties have begun to be produced, but the late ones have left well, according to the regional newspaper Kursa Time.
"This year the watermelons are growing better than last year", says Artis Ķūsis, a grower of large berries in Rucava district.
In terms of weather conditions, too, this summer is much more favorable than the previous one when it was cold and windy.
Liepāja theatre guest performances in Riga begin.
On 12 and 13 August Liepaja Theatre will visit the Daile Theatre in Riga, offering the audience performances nominated for the "Spēlmaņu nakts" award, as well as a bright intrigue - the solo show by Herbert Lukštein, director of the Liepaja Theatre, the portal Delfi informs the theatre representatives.
On the evening of 12 August, the human drama "Zilonman" will be shown to the audience by Laura Groza-Ķibere.
It's a story of a real historical person, John Merica, who lived in London of the Victorian era and his crippled, inborn illness's deformed body, was called Blueman.
In the study the title role is represented by the actor Egons Dombrovskis, who has received the nomination "Accomplice of the Year" for the representation of Merika's role.
As the critic Normunds Akots described his work, Merik plays a "heart-swept" role in which the image born cannot be repeated.
On 13 August the audience will be offered a production "Portraits".
The performance has received six nominations of "Spēlmaņi nakts", including "The show of the big form of the year".
The director made the production as a peculiar portrait gallery, giving equal importance to every image of the play, so each of them is both a center and a background.
The performance consists of a series of mini shows, which, at the end of the show, combine into a single whole.
It is an observation of human nature, where the main conflict is between true emotions and cold-blooded calculation, revealing how a person changes in different situations – each of the heroes is sometimes a wolf, who, due to his greed and his own benefit, crushes the surrounding, sometimes a sheep, which is broken by someone else.
On both of these dates, the Small Hall will feature the solo performance of the director of Liepaja Theatre Herbert Lukštein "Man who avoids lift" in the direction of Gaļina Poliščuka.
It is not a sad, but humorous story about how the elevator becomes the only friend of a person.
Despite the cemetery stylistics that dominate the visual image of the performance, the dominant intonation of the production is still bright and even optimistic.
"A man who avoids an elevator" is not about the fate of loneliness and age, but about the fact that life is worth loving.
Even if you don't think there's anything about," wrote Līga Ulberte about the performance.
Tickets for all productions can be purchased in "Biļešu paradīze" box offices and online.
Detective Olga: My work is not serial, but real life.
Olga Zelika - owner and investigator of "Riga Detective Agency" awaits me halfway.
She laughs loudly and leaves a very positive impression.
She's dressed in white trousers and white jacket -- a very elegant woman who overturns all my ideas about what a woman-detector should be like.
She's waiting for me with a champagne that I'm kind to refuse.
I'm telling you I'm addressing her because I found it interesting that a woman is doing such an unusual thing.
It's always a male job.
Olga has a higher legal education - master's degree.
He used to work in the criminal police.
Realizes that he wants something his own and founded his own business.
That's enough knowledge.
"I really didn't want to return to Poland," Olga says.
It's a routine.
There, in the criminal police, we investigated the cases, we gathered information.
We work with suspects.
"This year we celebrate the ten-year anniversary of the Riga Detective Agency".
She calls for an anniversary celebration: "There will be no drinking."
Everyone is a man of promise.
When asked about her business, Olga says, "Business is very specific."
I had a team for the first five years.
Then I realized that working in a team is sometimes dangerous.
It's a business that, if someone works unprofessionally, can get into a very bad situation.
If journalists have the fifth power, then we are the second.
Of course, the sphere is not simple.
Many try to set us up because we are cheating on our mate.
Let people think that!
Many come and ask whether they can apply the buggy equipment to attract dogs.
Many have seen films.
Detectives' business is serious.
"It's collecting information", Olga says.
If there is a crime by law, I have to warn about it.
We're making green tea and laughing, at least to have a cup to hold on to and negotiate with.
I've had a client whose husband was constantly hit.
She was looking for protection, of course.
We also have security.
Her husband was a maniac.
At first everything is always beautiful and good, but then begins.
"It's the worst," Olga says.
Psihe is broken, and it happens that you can be treated like an animal.
This may end bad.
Don't give it to God, with suicide.
This is very dangerous.
People are victims at some point.
"Many women are trying to go away from their families and then return again", she says.
I gave up my last order.
"It happened for the first time in my life", reveals Olga.
There was such a strange situation.
The woman was married, she had a son.
"His husband beat her son and made her disabled," Olga remembers.
I believe that a woman has a mother's instinct and, above all, must protect her children.
When all of this happened, she came to me and asked me to get rid of that man.
Some people are obsessed with revenge.
The most terrible thing is that the mother turned her eyes on it.
I can't understand that.
Her child is now disabled.
We could not find a corpse once, and the dog was very helpful.
The drug department cannot do without dogs at all.
"I understand that there are decent people and there are people who don't have a whole psyche," she says.
Of course, the facts of fraud are topical.
Or a divorce takes place in the family and information needs to be collected.
The responsible party shall be identified.
The last thing I've ever had on the subject is that my friends have deceived other friends.
It's interesting because once men smothered, now women.
Even the best friends are fighting!
Women "put" friends for 100 and more thousands of euros.
Women need to be careful when going abroad because they can be sold into slavery.
"Latvian women are intelligent and trust too much", Olga believes.
There have been cases when couples go abroad to get married a second time.
It's not legal.
Olga says that she had a husband who was like Jesus Christ.
Long, long hair.
When I was 22 years old, a tragedy occurred.
He had a severe head injury.
He returned as a completely different man.
"I pulled him out," Olga remembers.
It can be compared to hell, it was terrible.
When asked what is the most unusual thing that has been encountered, Olga says, "Everything is special, but it's the worst thing to use trust."
When a girlfriend throws a girlfriend.
Take it away and don't give it back.
If you have a lawyer education and experience in the police, you can work as a detective.
"One thing is to feel like a detective, the other one to be," Olga says.
Situations of mistrust are quite crazy, because women are often not prepared to solve the situation.
They are not prepared to accept the result.
This is an unpredictable situation because a person is not ready to lose his family.
Not every woman is ready to accept reality.
Often young girls who feel the taste of money use wealthy married men.
One man who traced his wife said that she could not have a lover because all the wives had cheated her.
"He was married three times", Olga remembers.
Well, that's probably a man's problem if all the wives cheat on him.
Olga relates the case of a woman leaving a man with all her children, and she asked him if he had ever raised his hand against him.
Actually, I constantly beat him, he answered.
In such cases, I refuse to work.
I find it interesting how things are solved - whether photographs are taken and shown to a spouse if there is evidence of fraud.
How is this happening?
"The protection of personal data exists in parallel for detective work", Olga says.
This is a provocative question.
One law allows you to do everything, the other law doesn't allow anything.
For personal interests we may take such photographs and videos, but not for public viewing.
If material is submitted to a court that does not comply with the law, then there may be major problems.
In order to become a detective, education and experience are not enough, there must also be mental health and compliance with the criteria.
We're not taking fingerprints, the police are dealing with this.
I'm telling clients, shut off the series, here's real life!
In fact, when I worked in the (police) system, I had to use dogs too, they helped a lot.
"The drug department can't do without dogs at all," Olga says.
Some clients are addressing me in connection with the investigation of murders, but I don't like taking such things.
These are very difficult things.
Now there are more and more clients for men, because women tend to mock men.
It used to be different.
Now women are entertaining, but men are sitting at home with children.
"Of course, decent people suffer the most," says Olga.
I like Dale Carnegie.
He says stop worrying and start real life.
We all know that if you hit one face, you have to turn the other, but you can't!
I have to tell you it's unpleasant.
This cannot be done.
Do not be afraid to lose the things that hinder life!
You shouldn't become a little hit, and what we're allowed to do with ourselves is happening to us.
Yes, my first case was directly related to her husband's mistrust when a woman was not prepared to accept the fact that her husband was cheating on her.
She called all the time and asked what she should do.
"I'm asking all the clients if they're ready to accept a situation when they find out that their husband is really cheating on him," Olga says.
It's not entertainment, it's life.
If you come and hire a detective, you have to take responsibility.
It's not a theatre, a show, but real life.
I'm also a rakes specialist.
It is a heart thing and associated with Japanese medicine - hand treatment.
It's a very interesting thing.
Why am I starting to do that?
This is due to a large amount of adrenaline, and you need to calm yourself down somehow.
Reiki not only calms down, but restores energy, illuminates.
"People leave my office positively and satisfied", Olga says.
She has rake marks on the wall of the office, and Olga says that they are written not with the help of a brush, but with her fingers.
I didn't just get to that, the book about rake literally fell into my hands.
I felt it as a sign.
However, this is very personal.
Find out more about the raids here.
Olga sings, too.
It's her hobby.
We were all afraid of creativity.
From 11 years on, I played guitar.
I've written songs and clips.
I'm positive and smiles, but you have to rest to revitalize.
Others are saved by alcohol, and I'm relics.
Alcohol is sinking.
It is used a lot in the police because the work is stressful.
"It causes aggression, and moves can be unpredictable", she says.
I'm interested in sport and rheics.
For 15 years, I worked with tennis.
Another thing I liked was riding horses.
I cut off in nature, write articles, I'd like to write a book.
Detective work has a fine limit when work comes into your life.
"It's a job that shouldn't be put into life," she says.
When asked how you can combine work with private life, Olga says, "My beloved person is in Italy."
We have very strong feelings.
It must be the most love I have in my life.
I have enough to think about him, and I feel better.
Detectives usually don't trust, but he's taken my job.
In fact, I separate my work from my private life.
I haven't got into this business anyway.
Reiki has guided me.
Already when I was a child, I saw more than others.
Thanks to the rheics, intuition opens.
There are many detectives, but few actually working.
In any case, it's working with the brain, and it's hard to shut down.
You also need rest.
"Other you can't recover," Olga admits.
The most serious case I have been dealing with is the story of Constanţi.
I've been working on that thing for a year.
The man literally mocked that woman.
I did so that the child and his mother left for England - further away from danger.
There were no other options.
We must not pity ourselves.
We're looking for sympathy.
You can't do this.
We have to be happy about every day we have.
Thank God.
Three good things have to be said every day to someone else.
You have to do a good job or devote a day to yourself.
We can't do that with men.
That is a big mistake.
It must be understood that we have a man, not a child, and need him to take care of us.
If it's not okay, turn around and go away.
You can go to church, it has helped me a lot.
Don't be fanatic, but do what likes and helps.
Nothing will change if there is no change, you have to leave and change your life.
Under no circumstances should we put ourselves and our children in danger.
You don't have to sit down and wait for something.
Humans have been created to do good and to support each other.
If God created us, we are already needed and not in vain in this world.
Never sit on the ground!
How to prepare for the family photo session.
The summer is still in full swing, and immediately another school year, which families tend to capture in photo memories, comes.
To make the pictures look happy and beautiful, it is worth considering how to prepare for the photo session in advance.
Ihappymama's advice is provided by the mother of many children Aleksandra Nesterenko and the professional photographer Marina Levickaja.
You have to take pictures of nature, because it is much more natural and harmonious.
The study makes it much harder for children to feel and relax.
It is recommended to choose a uniform dress style for the whole family, preferably in the same colour range.
For example, Alexandra says that she chooses clothing for all six members of her family so that the clothes are no more than three shades of color and as few inscriptions as possible on the clothing.
Don't forget about the mood.
Enjoy joking, playing, but never yelling or psychiatism if the children are not as obedient as they would like.
And here's the next advice from a professional photographer's douche!
You have to understand exactly what you want to capture during the photo session and tell the photographer about it.
For some, they will be beautiful, neat children and an ideal family picture, for others – "life is what it is like", namely, a desire to see real, genuine emotions in the pictures, or, as a photographer loves to say, "refugee backs", "eyes closed", "stretched nose".
Of course, it happens that someone also wants "two in one", but this happens rarely.
In any case, when you go to the photo session, you have to understand that it's just a couple of hours from your life, and the less you get a sign, the better.
You're yourself -- there's no strong mom who's working, cooking, raising, and so on, and not an old dad who's constantly talking on the phone.
And neither is the man who lives in you behind some unknown shell.
Be family, remember how great it is to hug each other, smile at your own and joke.
And then the photographer's task will be to capture the right moments for the emotions that prevail among you.
If you have chosen a photographer, trust him.
Stop 250 times asking for a show of what has happened, listen to his advice in choosing clothes, a place for better shots.
Tilt and iron all the clothes you need in advance so that you do not need to do so on the day of the photo session.
Plan the route and think about how much time you will need to get to the place of the photo session (especially if the photography takes place in the studio and the time is limited).
If you have little children, then choose the time of the photo session that corresponds to the day of the baby’s day so that it doesn’t happen when the baby sleeps.
And, of course, do not forget to take with your children food, cookies, water and a favorite toy (use the sweets and sweets only in extreme situations).
In preparation for Dad, he may need to wear his socks, but this is not usually written in such tips, and only photographers know what the problem is, admits Marina.
Don't drink a lot of water before you take a photo session and sleep well before that.
And it would be advisable to have some entertainment together after the photo session.
Go to the amusement park, eat some ice cream, take a ride with roller skates, which family likes more.
This will give you great pictures and pleasant memories of the day spent together.
Krasnopurovs and Fadejeva: raising the minimum wage - a miracle or a brake for the economy?
The question of raising the minimum wage in public debates has almost the status of holy cow: either support the raising or mention of some unspeakable, general phrases.
In view of the significant increase in the risk of economic stagnation (we barely avoided technical recession), it is important to stress that raising the minimum wage is not a miracle that will reduce income inequality with one hint, bring Latvian salaries closer to the level of Western Europe and fill the state budget.
On the contrary, if the minimum wage is raised too much, it does more harm than good because raising it reduces the competitiveness and employment of businesses, especially in sectors and low-income regions.
At first glance, it seems that, despite several increases in minimum wages in the post-crisis period, the minimum wage in Latvia is not so high that raising the usual number of tens of euros per year would significantly weaken the competitiveness of companies - just 370 euros, while in some European Union (EU) countries the minimum wage is around one and a half thousand.
However, a different picture can be seen if we compare it with the average salary in the country (%) - the minimum wage in Latvia (44%) exceeds the EU average.
Since Latvia's share of minimum wages is substantially higher than in neighbouring countries (Latvia - 17%, Lithuania - 11%, Estonia - 6%[1]), a similar rise in minimum wages is binding for most companies.
According to the results of the survey of Latvijas Banka companies, one in five Latvian companies replied that, as the minimum wage increased at the beginning of 2014, it was important or very important for it to increase the prices of products.
This means, firstly, that the rise in the minimum wage was partly financed by consumers (i.e. residents of Latvia); secondly, the rise in prices for several companies meant loss of competitiveness both in the domestic market and abroad (i.e., increased imports and limited exports).
Due to weaker competitiveness and shrinking production volumes, it was important for almost every fifteen Latvian companies to lay off their employees (which means higher unemployment and emigration).
In addition, almost one in eleven companies replied that, as a result of raising the minimum wage, it was important for him to limit the recruitment of new employees.
It is worth remembering that in 2011-2013 the minimum wage in Latvia did not change.
Therefore, even if, when assessing the raising of the 2014 minimum wage, one in five companies noted the improvement of productivity as important, this does not mean that a similar result could be expected in 2017 as well (the fourth increase in the minimum wage in a row could reduce productivity growth opportunities).
Another important result is that, as a result of the rise in minimum wages, it was also important for several companies to increase the remuneration of employees earning more than the minimum wage.
Thus, the impact of the minimum wage was significant even for companies where no employees received the minimum wage.
In recent years, the rise in minimum wages in all three Baltic States exceeded the increase in nominal productivity (real productivity + inflation).
Thus, a further increase in the minimum wage (even though the overall rather low level in terms of the euro) which is not justified by productivity growth will have a negative impact on the competitiveness and employment of enterprises.
When assessing the justification for raising the minimum wage, it is not enough to analyse the average economic indicators.
It is also necessary to assess whether raising the minimum wage is "obstructable" in the sectors and regions where the minimum wage is most commonly used.
The results of the survey of the Bank of Latvia show that the highest concentration of employees with minimum wages is in small companies (the number of employees is between 10 and 19 employees; 25%).
At the end of 2013, the share of employees with minimum wages was higher in industry and services sectors (16% and 19% respectively) than in trade (15%), construction (11%) and financial and insurance sectors (2%).
On the other hand, for Latgale, where the minimum wage is 64% of the average wage (and more than two thirds of the average wage in the private sector), its further rise may be more damaging by reducing labour demand (i.e. maintaining already high unemployment) and promoting the sustainability of the shadow economy.
There are some signs that the significant rises in the minimum wage implemented in 2014-2015 (by 27% in total) have slowed the development of Latgale.
For example, Latgale is the only region in Latvia where unemployment was higher in 2015 than in 2013.
It should be noted that there is no region in Estonia and Lithuania that is so far lagging behind in terms of average wages from the rest of the country.
In Estonia, for example, the average wage in all regions is at least twice the national minimum wage.
In Lithuania, the lowest wages are in the Taurage region, but also there, the minimum wage in 2015 was 54% of the average wage (after two rapid increases in the minimum wage in 2016, this figure could reach 58%).
The public debate has occasionally called for the minimum wage to be raised to 68% of the average wage in the country (see, for example, here) lacks economic justification, and this cannot be achieved either in the short term or in the long term.
Firstly, such a high figure from the average salary, or even as close to it, is not in any EU country.
Secondly, it would mean raising the minimum wage above the average wage in several sectors of the economy (which would mean the bankruptcy and mass redundancies of companies in these sectors), for example, in the production of clothing, leather products, fish processing, catering services, as well as in veterinary services; moreover, it is more than the current average salary in the private sector of Latgale.
Raising the minimum wage from January 2017 to EUR 400-410 per month, as currently proposed by the Ministry of Welfare, would make the minimum wage in Latvia (% of the average wage) one of the highest in the EU.
If nominal productivity increases by 4% and the minimum wage at least twice as fast, this has clearly negative consequences for the competitiveness and employment of businesses.
Such negative consequences will be most common in sectors and regions where the current minimum wage level is often used, for example, in Latgale.
The fact that a substantial rise in the minimum wage cannot currently be tolerated means that other mechanisms should be used to support low-wage recipients.
An immediate effect can be achieved by travelling with a non-taxable minimum of personal income tax (within the limits of the budget).
Insufficient level of education, inadequate education and poor quality of education, as well as unsatisfactory health status (often due to the cost of medical services and long queues) are among the real causes of income inequality.
During the survey 521 replies of the Latvian company were obtained on the response to the rise in the minimum wage that took place in January 2014.
The survey was carried out within the framework of the Wage Dynamics Network (WDN) project.
These figures represent companies with a minimum number of employees of 10.
This also explains the low proportion of employees with minimum wages in construction.
During the past day 11 fires were recorded in Latvia, according to operational information of the State Fire and Rescue Service (VUGD).
In terms of Latitude, the biggest fires had taken place in Ogre district Ogresgala, where a one-storey residential house was burned in 80 square meters and railway malas street in Jēkabpils, where a shed of 30 square meters was burned with open flame.
On Thursday, firefighters also went to calls where waste, tyres, two cars, the building wall and ceiling, barns, the roof of the living house, and unattended food.
In 24 hours, the service has also participated in 21 rescue operations.
Deaths, victims or rescued persons are not reported.
In total, during the last day, the VUGD responded to 38 calls, six of which were misleading.

The Vice Prime Minister of Russia meets with the ministers of the ZZS secretly in Riga.
Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev Arkady Dvorkovics last week met three ZZS politicians at the factory Kaija - finance minister Dana Reizniece-Ozola, transport minister Uldis Auguli and agriculture minister Jānis Dūklavs, writes portal "see.lv" on Friday.
According to the portal, none of the parties involved had informed about such a meeting, but the fact of the meeting was confirmed by Reizniece-Ozola, who was responsible for organising the secret negotiations to Dūklava.
In his turn, the Minister explained that the organizer was Russian Ambassador Alexander Vesnyakov.
The Minister of Finance has discovered that negotiations have been on the possibility of lifting sanctions on fish processors, as well as whether Russia will continue to "beat" gas in the Inčukalns gas storage.
Dvorkovičs has explained that this is not a question of the government, but of the energy company.
Contrary to diplomatic practice, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not been involved in the conversation.
Dūklāvs has argued that he has not seen such a need, because "it's the Foreign Minister's tak on vacation", writes the portal.

The Huffington Post is abandoned by the legendary editor, Hafington.
Arianna Hafingtone, co-founder and editor-in-chief of the U.S. media holding The Huffington Post, announced his departure after 11 years of work.
The Huffington Post, which was founded in 2005 and awarded with the Pulicer Prize, offers both serious political and economic journalism on a daily basis and provides an entertainment coverage of internet sensations, is seen as a driving force for media development at a time when digital technology solutions are rapidly evolving.
The media, starting in 2005, offered innovative and interactive content solutions for their time, in conditions when there was no Twitter, but feisbuk gained popularity only among students in national colleges.
Shortly after the re-election of the representative of the Republican Party, George Bush, as President of the United States, Hafingtone did not hide that media journalists represent liberal values, and with such a world view will also prepare news materials.
Now Hafingtone has discovered on Twitter that after leaving she is going to start a new business - she plans to create a startup "Threve Global" to deal with employees' health and congestion issues.
It is not yet known who could take her place under the leadership of The Huffington Post.
During her work, the portal gave up anonymous comments, stressing to Hafington that freedom of expression is given to people who stand up for what they say and who do not hide behind anonymity.
Also under her leadership in the summer of 2015, it was decided to publish the news of the U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trampa in the news section.
It is true, at the end of 2015, that Trump's rhetoric is dangerous to the US public, the news of an odious candidate was again published in the policy section.
It has been reported that in 2011 the U.S. Internet Media Group AOL decided to purchase the fast-growing news website "The Huffington Post", which at the time of the transaction visited almost 25 million readers every month.
The deal amounted to $115 million.
In 2015, the telecommunications giant "Verizon" bought AOL for 4.4 billion US dollars.
Also, in 2016, "Verizon" bought the Internet business parts of "Yahoo".
With these deals "The Huffington Post", once a powerful and independent medium, became a small part of a giant corporation.
Currently, the content of the famous brand media is available in nine international versions, with a total monthly unique number of visits of 81 million.
Four people killed in an explosion in Thailand.
Nine explosions have occurred in the Thailand resort town of Huahin and the southern provinces of the country over the last 24 hours, killing at least four people and several dozen injured, declared the authorities on Friday.
In southern Thailand, two explosions took place around eight o’clock local time in Suratthani province on Friday.
One bomb exploded in a flower pot in front of a sea police building, killing a municipal worker and wounding a man, declared Governor of Suratthani Province, Wongsiri Promčana.
"I think it's related to the explosions in Huahin," said the Governor.
The second explosion took place in front of the provincial police station.
On Friday morning in southern Thailand, two explosions took place on the tourist’s favorite island of Phukutta.
On Friday morning, two bombs exploded at the bell tower in Huachin, killing one and wounding three people.
It has already been reported that on Thursday evening shortly before midnight, in the resort town of Huahin, there were two explosions, killing one woman and injuring 19 more people, including foreigners.
The woman killed in Huahin on Thursday was a Thai woman.
Of the 19 injured three were in serious condition, and seven of the injured were foreigners - four women and three men.
The bombs in Huachin were hidden in two flower pots, 50 feet [50 m] apart.
The bombs were detonated by mobile phones with a half hour difference.
Before that, on Thursday one person died in an explosion in the Tran province of southern Thailand.
The police rescue the baby from overheating in the car; the parents are threatened by court action.
In Riga yesterday, municipal policemen rescued the baby from a hot car, while the parents threatened the police with court works about the broken car glass, LETA informed the Riga Municipal Police (RPP).
Yesterday, a excited man came to the patrol, who told him that he noticed a car in the Spice parking lot in which an infant was present for half an hour without the presence of adults.
On arriving at the scene, an eyewitnessed car was found, standing in the sun.
In the front passenger seat there was a child seat in which the infant was present.
It was the rays of the sun that shone on the child.
The baby screamed loudly, breathed intensely, and his face was red and sweaty.
Given that the owner of the vehicle was not present on the spot, an immediate decision has been taken to break the rear glass of the car in order not to endanger the health and life of the infant.
The child with the entire seat is highlighted from the hot vehicle, and called medical staff.
The child breathed the shallow, the skin was reddish and hot, so until the doctors arrived, the guards placed a cool compress on their forehead.
Medical doctors and parents arrived almost simultaneously at the scene.
When the baby’s father saw the broken window on his vehicle, he remained aggressive and the medical staff were not allowed to reach the child.
Discussions with parents explain that a child under the age of 7 is forbidden to leave one unattended.
In addition, the child was left in a life - threatening environment.
After the discussion, the medical staff looked at the victim and found that hospitalization was not necessary.
The children’s parents refused to give any explanation about what had happened and threatened with judicial work on the broken car glass.
There was no indication that they were under the influence of alcohol or could otherwise harm the child during the conversation, so the baby less than four months old was taken to care for both.
The case materials have been sent to the Children’s Crime Prevention Division, whose employees will assess parental responsibility.
The RMP reminds us that even if the outside is not very hot, a car left in the sun heats up very quickly.
If a child or a pet is left in such a car, it can endanger their lives.
LPF members could request the suspension of Poni.
The members of the Latvian Swimming Federation (LPF) could in the near future request that its current head Kaspars Poni be removed from the position of president of the Federation, and the agency LETA was told by the former vice-president of the Federation Jānis Dzenis.
He said that, in view of the criticisms voiced in recent days about Poni and his activities in the Federation, several members of LPF have signed a letter asking for a general meeting of LPF, which is the highest institution in the Federation, and it is entitled to decide on any question raised at the General Assembly of LPF.
Members of the Federation are not satisfied with Pone's leadership style, moreover, his departure to the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games, which, in turn, were not able to go to the Latvian record in Olympics by the swimmer Alon Ribakov coach German Jakubovski, was considered unethical and disrespectful by the President.
Mr Dzenis pointed out that LPF members, as well as the General Secretary of the Federation Aivars Platonovs, have done a lot of work for the federation and the sport, but the contribution of Pones to the federation is not very welcome.
A drone who worked in the Federation for a long time explained that there was a noticeable attempt in the Federation to concentrate power in the hands of one person.
As a result, the members of the federation could also request amendments to the statutes governing LPF’s activities, which would exclude this possibility in the future.
The Dzene explained that dissatisfaction with Pones' work had existed in the Federation for a long time, however, the events of the last few days have served as members of the "last castle" federation in order to decide that action should be taken.
The former vice-president of the Federation stated that during the activities of Pones the activities of the Council of coaches and judges were greatly reduced.
He explained that in order to ensure faster process and decision-making in the federation, LPF members had decided at a general meeting to allow the board of directors, consisting of Pone and two vice presidents, to lead the federation.
However, as Dzenis admitted, Pone deceived the members of the federation.
Members of the Federation trusted Pontus, believing that it would be possible to make decisions in the Federation more quickly.
"He deceived his members' trust, because he practically took power in his hands, making an unethical step," Dzenis pointed out.
"This attitude cannot be from a person who should serve as an example to other sports representatives," said Dzen.
He tried to satisfy his ambitions in the position of President Pone, which, in turn, does not honor him as President of LPF.
The long-term secretary-general of LPF, Vladimir Maslovskis, told LETA that a letter to the federation could be submitted next week, so that LPF's general meeting should be held within one month.
In his opinion, the general meeting had to "speak all the painful questions" and decide on the way forward.
On Friday, Mr Pone had not been informed that LPF's members intended to convene a general meeting to decide on his dismissal.
I don't know anything about calling such a meeting at the moment, so I don't have any comments.
So far, there has been only one case of fellow Members who have been dissatisfied with my work, with coach Jakubovski, mentioned earlier, when some dissatisfaction has been expressed.
Before the London Olympic Games, when Ribakov was not approved among the participants, he appealed to the International Federation of Water Sports (FINA) and called on Latvia not to send any athletes.
"After this case Jakubovsky lost the position of senior coach of the sample, because his actions were not in line with the interests of LPF", said Pone.
He also stressed that LPF had not received any accusations at the general meetings of its members, where he reported on the progress made.
"On the contrary, we have received recognition that the quality of the federation's work has improved", said the President of LPF.
Pone also explained that the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro were not having fun, but working.
The majority of people in Latvia do not understand the role of the presidents of the federations.
People do not understand that we are volunters in these positions, and, for example, unlike the leaders of the Latvian Olympic Committee (LOK), we do not receive wages.
At the same time, we must make sure that the sport federation has enough funding, because only 10% of the necessary amount comes from the national LPF.
During the Olympic Games, I have had formal and informal meetings with representatives of the international federation and various international programmes, including international sponsors.
"The same talks have been entered and I worked on one of the stages of the World Cup in Riga in 2018," said Pone.
According to data from the portal "Firmas.lv", in 2015 LPF revenue totalled 249 444 euros, which is almost 36 000 euros more than in 2014.
About 40% of this amount last year was made up of earmarked grants received, the amount of which, compared to 2014, increased by approximately 10 000 euros.
Similarly, in the form of members, accessions and other annual contributions, LPF received approximately 43% more revenue or 109 442.
Last year, the Federation received 35 532 euros in the form of donations and gifts.
Last year, the Federation's expenditure had increased by around 70 000 euros compared to 2014, with a total of 263 876 euros spent in 2015.
The biggest expenses were not related to cash payments to persons, material expenses or salaries - 215 733 euro is presented in the statement as "other expenses".
In cash payments, people spent EUR 20 549, while wages paid EUR 14 684.
The Commission therefore concludes that the measure constitutes State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) of the Treaty.
As reported, the Ministry of Education and Science requested clarification to the Latvian Olympic Committee (LOK) on LPF President Pones' participation in the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, which, in turn, has not been visited by the coach of Latvian swimmer Ribakov Jakubovsky.
Latvian nationals have not suffered from the explosions in Thailand, according to a social record of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Twitter.
The Ministry indicated that according to the information at the disposal of the honorary consul of Latvia in Thailand, Latvian nationals have not suffered in the explosions.
LETA has already announced that the CSS invites travellers to regularly follow information on the development of the political and security situation in the country, as well as to verify the security of the place of stay, indicating that there is a high threat of terrorism in the country.
The Latvian State Officials encourage to avoid meeting places, to be particularly careful and attentive when staying in public places, and to follow the instructions of local authorities.
Travellers in Thai resorts or planning to go there are invited by the Ministry to contact tour operators or airlines, specifying whether the journey will be carried out as planned.
The Ministry also invites travellers to regularly monitor information on the development of the political and security situation in the country, as well as to verify the security of the place of stay.
There is a high threat of terrorism in the country.
In view of the fragile security situation in the country, the Mission does not recommend to travel to the border area of Thailand and Cambodia, as well as to the provinces in the border area of Thailand and Malaysia - Patani, Jal, Narathiata and Sonkhla.
In case of emergency, the Ministry invites to contact the 24-hour host of the Consular Department by phone +371 26 33 77 11 or e-mail palidziba@mfa.gov.lv.
It also strongly recommends that anyone travelling abroad should purchase a life and health insurance policy, which also provides for repatriation in the event of sickness or death, as well as to register in the Consular Register.
However, the Messi will not leave the Argentinian football selection.
The football superstar, Lionel Mesi, after a little while of reflection, decided to return to the Argentine National Unit, announced on Friday by the player himself.
In July, the Argentinian team failed for the second year in a row in the finals of the Copa America tournament, re-accepting Chile’s superiority in the decisive match.
Immediately after the loss, Messi announced that he would end his career in a state unit, but then he was reported to return to the sample.
"I thought about leaving the sample, but my love for Argentina and the sample is too great," said 29-year-old Mesi.
The Spanish gram Barcelona attacker Mesi in the ranks of the state unit in 112 matches scored 55 goals, which is the best indicator ever.
Messi, a group of adults, has not been a great success, although Argentina became a world vice-champion in 2014.
Mesi five times called the world's best footballer.
Chinese Dzeliņš and Dzeliņš double weight in Rio 20 km walking distance.
On Friday, Chinese marchers Van Dzen and Cai Dzelin won a double podium in the 20 - mile [20 km] Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
The Olympic Champion was crowned by Drone, who made the distance in an hour of 19 minutes and four seconds, at the finish by 12 seconds ahead of Dzeliņš.
The bronze was won by Australian gourmet Dein Bērds-Smits, who lost 23 seconds.
Kai Bondham, a favorite of the house, corrected the Brazilian record, but he missed five seconds to climb on the podium.
Four years ago, he won the bronze prize in London.
He also has two silver medals in the world championships on the same distance.
Judo coach Baskin: Ņikiforenko is not the heavyweight.
Oleg Baskin, a Latvian judistian coach, admitted that Artūrs Ņikiforenko at the Rio Olympics had little chance to beat the much heavier Azerbaijani athlete Ušangi Kukauri.
In practical terms, there was no chance, only minimal if he had managed to catch him on a method or parter.
We had already predicted that this would be the case.
He was prepared right, and he fought right, but the opponent was stronger.
The opponent was well known because Nikiforenko had already fought against him twice and both were lost.
He's heavier, though.
Artūrs is artificially thrown into the heaviest weight category to get into the Olympic team.
The weight category of up to 100 kilograms was already occupied, so Artūrs used the European quota in the heavy weight category.
Arthur, with a weight of 100 kilograms, fought a judista, who is 140 kilograms and who has won serious tournaments a couple of times.
There are very few random moments in the heavy weight category at all.
If there are all kinds of turns in the light weight categories, then in the heavy - very rarely.
When asked whether it would be better for Ņikiforenko to fight one degree in a lighter weight category in the future, Baskin replied affirmatively.
I think yes - Arthur would better fight in the category of up to 100 kilograms.
It's his real weight category.
He's not the heavyweight.
65% of Venezuelans want to suspend Maduro, the question is whether they are prepared to fight for it.
Two of the three Venezuelans want to suspend President Nicholas Maduro, but the question is whether they are prepared to fight for it.
The day after the National Electoral Board announced that "there is no time" for the withdrawal of this year's vote, with which Chavismo will be in power until 2019, people on the streets of Karakas continued their normal day course as if nothing had happened.
"I didn't hear the news because I watched the Olympics and how Michael Phelps got two more medals," said Raphael Dian, a 36-year-old officeman who rested on Wednesday in Altamira Square.
Altamira Square, located in the east of Caracas, was the epicentre of intense unrest in protest against the Maduro regime in early 2014.
Now, however, when the opposition has to exert more pressure than ever before in order to achieve a referendum this year, people across the country are no longer showing this kind of energy.
"I want a referendum, but I'm not going to take part in the protests for security reasons," said Deian.
Others, more informed, want to mobilise in the future, but admit that Venezuelans are less motivated.
Chairman of the Electoral Board Tibisejs Lusen comments on the claim that the government is delaying the withdrawal process.
I will protest whenever the opposition calls for protest, but I know that some of my friends are afraid," Roberto Reyes (60), said Fox News Latino.
So, in addition to all the barriers that the government has built to prevent a referendum, the opposition is now facing a new challenge: to motivate people to go to the streets and protest.
Until recently, the referendum initiative had broad support: during the process of collecting signatures, people arrived in an unprecedented number.
However, when it comes to protest against the government's moves to block efforts, the number of people coming to the meetings is considerably lower.
"Some people focus on creating food rows, while others after arrests and deaths in 2014 are afraid of many," said Cipriano Eredia, the opposition legislator.
After Lusen announced that, until the next step in the referendum process - even more signatures across the country - will have to wait until October, those who are against the socialist government say that President Maduro and his followers are simply trying to take away the courage of the Venezuelans, making them believe that this year's vote is practically impossible.
According to the Constitution, if a referendum were held in 2017, Maduro could be suspended, but he would be allowed to name the next president.
If he were to be suspended today, he is obliged to announce general elections.
The U.S. Department of State addressed this issue in a Thursday afternoon statement calling on the Venezuelan authorities to guarantee respect for Venezuelan constitutional rights.
"The other steps towards the President's abolition of the referendum must be made clear, concrete and immediate, thus contributing to a rapid and effective resolution of the current political, economic and social difficulties of the country," it said.
Luis Salamanca, a political analyst who was a member of the election board between 2006 and 2009, that changes are not expected so soon.
"I think there will be no referendum this year unless social unrest and protests become even stronger," he said in FNL.
He said that Lusen and the government are breaking the law, but as a result they will achieve their goal if people do not protest loudly.
The opposition in September called for a broad manifestation. First of all, in Karakas, to demand an acceleration of the process, so that the withdrawal could take place this year.
We want people from all over the country to be mobilised in the capital this day.
The government will be under pressure," said Eredia.
Salamanca, on the other hand, believes that the situation cannot wait so long.
"They should respond to Lusen's announcement faster and stronger, because it practically kills a referendum," said the expert in FNL.
Congressman Eredia admitted that some opposition parties want to make manifesto faster, while others want more time to organise.
The opposition now needs to be cautious.
If people feel insecure in this situation, there is a risk that the activity of the second campaign for collecting signatures will be low," Salamanka said.
The referendum process for it to be activated must receive support from twenty percent of the national voters, which is almost 4 million people.
Salamanca and other analysts are convinced that even if the withdrawal takes place in 2017, Chavismo will be saddened.
However, some people are less optimistic.
Our party wants political change today.
"If the government closes the way to the elections, we will have to explore other legal possibilities," Eredia said to the FNL.
The Director of the LNSC, A.Pukite, shall be suspended temporarily from his post.
At the extraordinary meeting of the Lielvārde Regional Council on 12 August, the majority of the members supported the dismissal of the director of Lielvārde Regional Sports Centre (LNSC) Ainara Puķītis from the performance of his duties for the duration of the service verification.
In the near future, it is planned to find out the circumstances that a visitor to the gym wrote about in his application to the municipality.
Namely, during the visit to the gym the LNSC client suffered a head injury.
The Lielvārde Region Sports Centre is blamed.
Taking into account the gravity of the situation and the possible recourse of the client to the court, a commission has been established by order of Vita Volontes, Vice-Chairman of Lielvārde County Council.
Its task is to carry out an inspection of the service at the Sports Centre and to give an opinion by 16 August this year.
An extraordinary meeting of the City Council is scheduled to be re-convened next Tuesday to decide on further action.
It should be noted that during the specific accident A.Puķītis was on vacation.
The director of the Sports Centre is the deputy director of the training work Oksana Grimaluka-Nazarova from Friday for a probationary period.
For Ogre seniors, sport is a celebration.
Today, the Ogre pensioner's association Sports Festival was held at the Ogre Sports Centre Stadium.
Sanita Tauriņa, the organizer of the Sports Development Work at Ogre Sports Centre, welcomed seniors at the stadium, who had prepared a special programme for participants of the Sports Festival.
This time individual results will not be evaluated individually, but sports festival participants will be divided into four teams.
"The contributions of each participant will be summed up as a result of the team", explains S.Tauriņa.
Participants will have to perform four tasks - basketball speed, construction of Eiffel Tower together with memory game, florbola agility relay, summer skiing.
In order to successfully start in all four disciplines of the festival, participants had to perform warm-up tasks - "The Circle of Unity", "Riņķis dancis", "Izpletnis", as well as three relays - horse riding, the elements of Frisbee and badminton have to be completed.
All tasks were prepared in attractive form, and sports festival participants performed them with joy, smile and fun comments, supporting each other.
The summer skiing, which took place in the clothes prepared by the organizers, was particularly thrilled.
The competition was followed carefully by volunteers of Ogre Sports Centre, who led the tasks, recorded the results and did not prevent advice.
There was also Ogre symbol Čiekurs everywhere, who inspired the participants of the Sports Festival.
Ogre seniors proved that they are quick enough, attractive and in good sport.
The representative of the Green Team Pēteris Zeps in one minute threw the ball into the basketball basket eight times precisely, only one successful pitch was left behind by his teammate Jānis Staugžs.
Pensioners are active in Ogre.
The tours are always full of buses, and about 300 people arrive at the parties.
"We meet twice a week at the Family Support Centre, where we can play novus, table tennis, use simulators", says Jānis Staudzs, Chairman of Ogre Pensioners' Society.
At the end of the sports festival all participants received thanks for their participation, but the greatest benefit is movement in fresh air, good mood and time spent together.

Guardian journalists predict heading 14 (Watching: it's not just Alan Smith's forecast, but our journalists' council as a whole)
Heading 14 of last season
The odds of winning the league (with Oddschecker) 1000-1
Until last week, it looked like a new season, such as the old Bromwich Albion: The 2016/2017 season will again be a struggle for satisfaction or stagnation, depending on how empty a glass is, under the guidance of Tony Puliss, even more pragmatic.
However, Jeremy Pies then sold 88 % of his club's shares to Guochuan Lai and Pulis, in archetypically safe hands, which the bookmakers immediately made a favourite in the unpleasant role of the first dismissed manager.
The situation has undeniably changed in the Balack Country - and not only the Hawthhorn, but also a few miles to the north-west of Volverhampton, where young Chinese owners, without wasting their time unnecessarily, gave up the services of Kenya Jaketta.
Pulis, however, To confirm that his work is not immediately threatened, the entrepreneur has also expressed his wish not to change the culture of the club.
"I don't want to change the club's virtues or start unsustainable fun," he said when he took over his duties.
I want to be a good owner and invest in this club in the long term.
First of all, our aim is to ensure that we stay in the Premier League and then go further; I would like to see the club standing up at the top of the division.
I think it is the best league in the world, and I want to take this club as far as possible.
That is what Pulis has achieved, and the first aspect should not be difficult.
The next goal is to break to the top of the table, but it will be important for the new owner and more and more divided fan base to hope for a quick breakthrough in the table up to realise that this is an extremely difficult task, given the hard work that has recently been invested by other teams in the middle of the table.
In order to move beyond the 14th place of last season, more work will definitely be needed to get up.
Only Aston Villa, which is at the bottom of the table, hit less of the gate, and it is worth recalling that at Christmas Albion, on average, made less than one blow through the gate in 90 minutes, almost the worst score of the division.
They failed to score a goal of 13 out of 38 games, and to hit more than one goal only in nine games.
Of their 10 victories in no game failed to score more than one goal, and seven games ended in 1-0.
As expected, a dozen from a total of 34 gates were drawn from standard positions.
No wonder Hawthhorn was dissatisfaction in the team, perhaps the most noticeable after the shocking 0-0 draw by Villa at the end of January, when the guest team looked better.
On the other hand, only the six best teams had better defence performance - although no club has been able to list four centre semi-guards.
These guards are often undervalued, especially Johnny Evans, who wants to be Arsenal in view of their recent crisis in terms of injured players.
The international team of Northern Ireland experienced a great start in the European Championship, and Albion will have to spend a lot of money to sell.
Ben Foster is reliable at the gate and they are well completed in the middle line.
Darren Fletcher, much like Evans, demonstrated to a large extent that he was still able to play at a high level at the age of 32, and Claudio Jacob is undervalued.
It is disturbing for all parties that the long and smooth story of Saido Berahino's future is still unclear.
Pies was the owner of the stakes from Stoke and Crystal Palace was refused, but they still remain calm and Mark Hughes is ready to wait.
After the last season, close to liquidation, it is worth all the parties involved to take action.
The attacker is, of course, talented, but, as Pulis has said several times, he has been taking him to one side, here to the other, it has been seen for a long time that such a relationship does not work.
Albion insists that it is necessary to sign the papers on the change before allowing the former U-21 team member of England to go, but their 15 million pound march with Diafro Saho broke out a few days before taking over, claiming that he passed a medical examination and had an agreement on everything, but he had a back injury, which would mean that he would have to skip the beginning of the season.
This puts a great deal of pressure on the Venezuelan Salomon Rondon, who last season looked very hopeful, but he has to improve his nine-gate performance, especially if Ricky Lambert continues to be so inefficient.
The decision to release Victor Anichebi and Stefan Sesegnon in retrospect also looks strange.
Pulis throughout his career is sadly famous for his slow young player moving up and three teens - Jonathan Leko, Sam Fehld and Tyler Roberts' appearance in the last game of the previous season with a draw 1-1 with Liverpool, I don't think it's going to be the norm.
He will return to those who have already been tried and tested, but it is worth keeping an eye on Leko.
The 17-year-old attacker took part in five games in the previous season, becoming the first player born in 1999 in the Premier League, who is also highly valued in the English youth football system.
Matt Phillips, with a 5.5 million contract with Queens Park Rangers, will be fast, but he is the only new player who took part in the first weekend.
It would not have been boldly said if the end could be quite hasty.
"Everything," Pulis last month said Express and Star about what should be improved.
Every position you see.
We need to strengthen the back players, mid-field players and front-positioning players.
The goals are, we know what we want.
It turns out to be much harder to get them than expected, mainly because of the uncertainty about the takeover process.
The season could be determined by how they have started, with seven largely winning games before the difficult race with Tottenham, Liverpool, Manchester City and Leicester from mid-October.
During that time, the pressure on Puliss will be reduced or unbearable.
And who knows, maybe even Berahino will have found a new club.
Tata Steel UK closer to the rescue transaction after the authorised changes in the pension aid
Behind Tata Steel UK, the pension trustees said that the scheme could be restructured without participating in the Pension Protection Fund (PFF), increasing the company's chances of concluding a rescue transaction.
The pension scheme for the British steel sector has a liability of GBP 15 billion and an estimated deficit of at least GBP 700 million, creating a serious impediment to the conclusion of a rescue transaction between Tata Steel UK and Port Talbot Steelworks in Wales.
Tata Steel is increasingly convinced of securing the future of the British business, which employs 11 000 people, following negotiations with the Minister of Economy and the pension regulator.
The company plans to combine its European activities, including the British business with ThyssenKrupp, a German conglomerate.
However, the conclusion of the transaction depends on whether the pension scheme of the British steel sector will be restructured and the government will provide financial support.
Alan Johnson, the president of the pension commissioner, said that this scheme would avoid PPF if the benefits received by the employees were modified.
Although this is well financed compared to other schemes, with a deficit reduced to GBP 300 million for certain measures, Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp wants to control its liabilities.
Johnson said that the trustees admitted that this was "not real" for the joint venture or any buyer of Tata Steel Uk to take responsibility for financing the current and future deficits.
The modification of the benefits of the scheme was a much more binding option than to join the PPF, he added, where employees should adopt less favourable conditions.
The sources of Tata Steel warn that it could still sell to Port Talbot.
The company has consistently refused to guarantee the future of steelworks since negotiations on the future of its British business began in March, and this has been used as a trump card in negotiations with the British Government.
Kushik Chatterier, Executive Director of Tata Steel Europe, said that the Indian conglomerate wants to make its steel business more "sustainable".
Speaking at the annual meeting of Tata Steel in India, Chatterier said that negotiations on the restructuring of pension schemes were moving forward, but he insisted that the scheme was well funded.
"We are talking to various stakeholders, including the British Government and other stakeholders, such as the Welsh Government, etc.," said Chatterier, reports the Times of India.
There is a belief that pensions have a certain impact on the business of goods such as steel, so we need to find a structural solution that does not prevent the business from moving forward.
Tata Steel will support the willingness of pension agents to cooperate in the negotiations on the restructuring of the scheme.
Potential changes to the scheme include shifting the measurement of the annual inflation-based increase in benefits from the retail price index to the lowest index of consumer prices, as well as limiting pension payments to the statutory minimum in the future.
Johnston added: "The authorised and its advisers have provided Tata Steel, the government and the pension regulator with evidence of the scheme's ability to pay modified benefits for an indefinite period of time and with low risk outside the Pension Protection Fund.
Our investment strategy has meant that the financing position of the scheme has not been affected by the recent decline in the stock market in the same way as in other British pension schemes. We are still convinced of the scheme's ability to provide benefits at a self-sufficient level.
CBS commentator confuses Michael Phelps and Ryan Lohti throughout the competition
The commentator of the CBC Olympics in Canada caused anger on Thursday evening by mixing Michael Phelps with his rival Ryan Lohti.
Elliot Friedman mixed both with the entire 200 m individual swim, where Phelps won his 22nd Olympic gold medal.
When Phelps crossed the line, Friedman held him as Lohti, Phelps’ compatriot and a long-standing competitor at the top of the world’s swimmers’ tops.
Friedman exclaimed, "He's going to do it."
Ryan Lohte will beat Michael Phelps in this race!
Phelps might not even get to the podium.
However, Phelps won, but Lohte finished fourth.
Immediately after Phelps got to the gold, there was silence in the CBS broadcast.
Friedman miraculously immediately admitted his mistake.
I'm sorry, I mix the tracks.
Phelps with gold," he said.
The Canadian commentator, whose professionalism was appreciated on a large scale by mistake, once again admitted his mistake in the hours following the event and apologized to the audience on Twitter.
I'm sorry to everyone.
I was surprised.
"No excuse," he wrote.
In the meantime, Phelps surpassed the record of 2 168 years old as the winner of the greatest ever Olympic victory.
The previous record belonged to Leonidas from Rhodes, who had won more Olympic titles in the ancient Olympic Games than anyone else.
The Russian hackers have attacked the computer of the former NATO force commander.
The hackers have published general Philippe Bridlow's lists and data on the work of one of the Soros Foundations.
The same hackers, who might have attacked U.S. Democrats' e-mails some time ago and published their lists, could also be responsible for a new series of attacks, reports agent Bloomberg.
According to its findings, these cyber-attacks have attacked the correspondence of former NATO European Force Commander General Philip Bridlow and the services of the Open Society Institute, which is part of the projects supported by the millionaire George Soros.
The attackers have published the information obtained at DCleaks.com.
It contains correspondence from Brīdlov and data on the functioning of the Open Society Institute.
Hackers have been reported to have had access to the fund's computers for about a year.
The news agency claims that this is about the same hackers who attacked the computers of the U.S. Democratic Party and are led by the Russian Special Service.
A year ago, the U.S. intelligence service warned the Congress' high officials about a possible hacker attack on the Democratic Party.
The news agency Reuters says that it has information that special services have told a number of politicians that cyber attacks are coordinated by two Russian intelligence services or by organisations controlled by them.
However, Congressmen have not been able to pass on this information to the victims of cyber attacks because it has been secret.
The scandal of attacks on computers of the Democrat Party started after some 20,000 e-mails were published on the Internet, written by the party representatives during the US presidential election campaign.
The party candidate, Hillary Clinton, announced that the leaking of these letters was organised by Russian special services.
The press secretary of the President of Russia, Dmitri Peskov, has stated that Russia has nothing to do with cyber terrorists.

Parking in the happiest place on Earth will be even easier in the future.
The Disneyland has presented information about its long planned parking space structure, which consists of a transport hub and a new pedestrian bridge on the eastern side of the amusement park.
The project, located in the east of the amusement park 5 at Freeway, includes 6 800 parking spaces and a transport hub where buses, buses, taxis and other vehicles can skip the park visitors.
A pedestrian bridge over the harbour boulevards connects the leisure park with the parking area structure and the transport hub.
This structure, together with the planned Star War on 14 acres of the land, is part of the USD 1 billion investment promised to the city of Anaheim in exchange for a 30-year exemption from the entertainment object tax.
The construction of the project, which synchronizes with the East Gate, will start next year.
The parking structure will be created above the Public parking area of the Disney Hero, which is approximately 1 300 places.
The transport hub will replace the commercial property purchased by the amusement park in 2014.
The project is expected to be launched in 2018.
"Eastern gates are part of our substantial investments in the city of Anaheim, which will provide additional parking places for visitors and help to reduce congestion in the vicinity of the leisure park, while we continue to expand the Disneyland Recreation Park," said Suzy Brown, the representative of Disney.
On Saturday and Sunday, the coast will be closed, which must be taken into account.

In Liepaja, the insulation of the house will have to agree to two thirds of its inhabitants.
If the owners of the apartments are very harsh and talk specifically about the technical condition of the building, if there is such a possibility to receive support and arrange the building in all possible ways, then it is rather easy not to use it.
One of the most significant changes is that the EU will be able to co-finance any apartment building from this year, but the condition is that the facade of the building should be insulated.
In advance, it was allowed to use only serial apartment houses.
The biggest concern for house managers, though, is the organisation of meetings of apartment owners.
An important problem where this process is currently delayed is that 67% of the owners of apartments require consent.
"It was necessary to 51% in the previous programme", says Toms Cīrulis, project manager of SIA "Liepājas nams" (LNA).
"Of course, it is very difficult to ensure this because in a large part of general meetings such number of apartment owners does not arrive", says the project manager of the company "Namu serviss APSE" Gints Ločmelis.
The largest house managers in Liepaja - "Namu serviss APSE" and LNA, which serve around 900 buildings, plan to renovate at least 50 apartment houses in the new planning period by 2020.
They do not exclude the possibility that it will be difficult to convince people to vote for renovation works at the beginning of the work, but with each project implemented, the attitude of citizens should improve.
I had to get a bank loan, too, and I needed 76% of the home population.
"Speaking, explaining what will be - I got the signatures," says Vita Iesalniece, the oldest energy-efficient building in Latvia.
Jānis agrees with her, who also lives in a warmer building.
Well, you can't make up a party, and the other side plus one person doesn't agree.
"No, of course, it is important that everyone agrees with the whole event", says Jānis.
Such a change of rules has been initiated by representatives of the financial institution ALTUM.
They explain that with 51% of the votes in banks it is not possible to attract the necessary funding, which has been experienced in the last programming period.
In most commercial banks, two thirds of the evidence from the owners of the apartments was required.
Anda Lagzdiņa, Head of the European Union Funds Division of the Ministry of Economics, mentioned the opportunity to introduce the citizens with the existing examples and various benefits of renovation of the building, for example, energy saving.
As a young man, Aaron was persistently angry with the world for the death of his mother.
The arrest operation of a potential suicide bomber in Canada was worthy of a spy movie.
Everything began when the Canadian police received a video recording intercepted by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Very early in the morning, Canadian Royal Police has received reliable information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Among other things, it contained a so-called "moto" video recorded by an unknown person, who was clearly in the process of preparing the last attack.
"And he was going to do it with a self-made bomb," said Mike Caban, Deputy Chief of the Canadian Police.
A black masked man in English and Arabic threatened Canadians and promised revenge for everything they had done to Muslims.
In about three hours, using facial and voice recognition software, the Canadian police have recognized this man.
It was 24-year-old Aaron Driver.
He was already under the supervision of the probation service for praising the ideas of terrorism and radical Islam on the Internet.
The court decree prohibited the Driver from doing so in the future and from engaging in any radical organization.
Until then, however, the authorities did not consider Draiver to be a physical danger to others.
When the police came to his home in Stratroy, ontario, the young man came out and sat in a taxi.
At that point, the police tried to arrest him, but the driver had activated the bomb while sitting on the back seat.
To prevent the second bomb from detonating, the police shot the young man.
He's dead from his injuries.
The taxi driver hasn't suffered.
In an interview with the neutralized terrorist, Wayne Drayer said to Canadian television that his son had turned to Islam as a teenager.
It had initially helped him to cope with drugs and alcohol.
However, Aaron was a problematic teenager who had long been angry with the world for the death of his mother, adding his father.
Only when I saw that video on the news today did I realize how far he had gone.
I had no idea that he was so radicalized.
"And I didn't know he could speak Arabic so well," says Aaron's father.
The Canadian police admit that if they had arrived a few hours later, the developments might have been quite different.
Radēvičs will go to Rio as a tourist and will support Latvian athletes.
The former Olympic Olympian and Athlete Ineta Radēvičs said in the Olympic studio of LTV that the performance of the seven-fight athlete Laura Ikauniece-Admidiņa on Friday in the first two disciplines is not bad, given that the athlete was traumatized.
On the other hand, in high jump Laura made the kick with the right leg, not as usual with the left.
Radēvičs pointed out that it is comparable - just as a person who is used to writing with the right hand would suddenly be forced to write with the left.
Therefore, the result of Ikauniece-Admidiņa, taking into account the injury, is not bad.
Radēviča discovered that she has not yet contacted Ikauniece-Admidiņa, but is actively following her start and sympathizing with her.
Ineta learned about Laura's trauma recently and expressed her support for the athlete, pointing out that the athlete did not start making airbags for herself, but showed the character and spirit of the fighter.
Speaking of other sports, Radēviča believes that the Olympic rules are very high, so one of the Latvian athletes is accused of going to Rio as a tourist, and it is incorrect.
She remembered that also when she went to the first Olympic Games, where she won the 13th place, she was called tourists, and this creates negative emotions.
Ineta sometimes remembers her starters, not just the Olympics.
"I like to remember my emotions, not the results", remembering her experience in sports revealed Radēvičs.
She told me that it was always important that there was someone in the stands who would give the energy of coercion.
This year Radēvičs himself will be a tourist - she will be going to Rio next week to support Latvian athletes in person.
She points out that she'll definitely go to the athletic competition.
Ineta Radēviča won the European title in 2010.
In 2004 she took 13th place in the Olympic Games in Athens in the distance jumping and 20th place in the triangle jumping, but in the Olympic Games in 2008 the athlete did not graze because she was waiting for her son.
In London, as already mentioned, Radēvičs had 4th place to jump.
The Murjāņi will show the film "Quantum Code" with physicist Kashcheev in his main role.
The annotation of the film says that in parallel with electron fission in the laboratory Kaščejevs is a dreamer, teacher, socially active and civicly-minded man and father, who is looking for a connection with Visvareno.
The film's character in the Latvian Television programme "Rīta Panorama" pointed out that taking the film had been an interesting experience for him.
I learned about how cinema is made, how it is filmed, how it is recorded.
"And actually a fantastic job," said the physicist.
He admitted that the film was made in two years.
The biggest disagreement with the directors has been about the name of the film.
I am categorically opposed to this name.
There is no quantum code.
"There is no secret that you could find out when watching the film, and everything is clear," added the Associate Professor of the University of Latvia.
Kaščejevs admitted that he liked the fact that the premiere of the movie will take place in Murjāņu open-air cinema evening.
They are organized by friends from the Foundation "Viegli", and these cinemas will take place every night until 9 September.
In Thailand four people died in bomb blasts in tourist attractions
After the Thai people voted in favour of the adoption of the military-supported Constitution, a series of bomb explosions took place on Thursday and Friday in five southern provinces of Thailand - popular tourist destinations - in which four people died and many people were injured.
The first two explosions landed at the seaside resort in Huahin on Thursday evening, next - Friday morning.
The city is located about 200 kilometers south of Bangkok.
The police reported that one Thai woman died in the first explosion and 20 people were injured, 10 of whom were foreigners.
The authorities confirmed that other explosions blew down in the southern cities of Phueket, Tranu and Suratthani.
Two bombs exploded in the suburb of Phukeeta in Patong and two more in Phanna province - the tourist region north of Phukeeta.
In the last 24 hours there have been 11 bomb blasts in Thailand.
On Friday, Colonel Krisana Patanacharoen, the Royal Police Officer of Thailand, declared that the explosions were not related to Islamic extremists and were considered to be local sabotage acts.
"It is still too early to draw conclusions," he said.
"But we definitely know that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, in fact it is local sabotage, and we are trying to find the perpetrators."
On 12 August 2016, following a small-scale bomb bombing in Huahin, investigators collected evidence from the scene of the crime.
On 12 August, officials announced that four people had been killed in a series of bomb explosions in Thailand’s important tourist areas.
There are no conflicts in the country that could lead to terrorists in the country.
"So we can say that these incidents are not terrorist attacks," he continued.
No group has yet assumed responsibility for the attack and no specific group has been accused by the competent authorities, but the bombings took place the same week that Thai voters approved the new Constitution.
All three southern provinces - Huahina, Prüketa and Phanna - rejected the referendum supported by the military, and more than 6 500 people have died since 2004 in unrest in southern Thailand, where the majority of the population is Muslims.
The explosions took place on the birthday of Queen Siricita of Thailand, which is a public holiday in Thailand.
Huahin is located in the royal palace of Klai Kangwon, or "the castle far from the worries", in which often reside Thai royal family.
King Bumibol Aduljade was the longest reigning monarch in the world.

Porghie and Bess - what we deserved for a long time!
There are so many operas that have never sounded in Latvia.
There's something that sounds very rare.
However, it seems strange if, since the 1970s, George Görshin's opus Porghie and Bess are neither staged nor played, except for the periodical passing of the chresttomatic solo numbers such as Summertime on stages (including as a titled work at the summer festival hosted by Inese Galante), individual student projects, guest performances and so on.
There are reasons for this - since Latvia is a civilised Western world country, it is bound by the Gērshvin family heirs regulations and copyright licenses that apply to Porghie and Bess until 2030.
Harmonisation procedures are not simple.
In addition, by creating a full production, the author wished that all fourteen soloists should be black.
Of course, the discussions and contexts around this opera in the United States are little known in terms of race and the composer's desire to fulfil would be difficult.
The concert performance with the help of four artistic black American soloists and their Latvian brothers and sisters, which was created on the compromise road, was brightly presented on August 6 at the 10th anniversary of the Cesis Art Festival, recalling the charming sound recording by Gērshvin, intertwining European classical music traditions with American jazz rhythms, gossip, early 20th century fashion dances and memorable hits, telling the lofty coup d'état Porgi of Ketfischrow and the lightly art of the Taurent Bes's love story in musical quality, which would deserve documentation for the annals of the history of music life.
Firstly, because of the LNSO and the conductor Andra Poga.
Despite the complex spatial layout of the concert performance in the open-air park of Cesis Castle, the orchestra was on the stage next to the stage, where soloists worked and sang (and danced!) choir While the overall sound was stylistically nuanced, contrast-rich and precise in both strings and metal wind instruments, as well as in the piano party (Mārtiņš Zilberts).
Secondly, because of the great team of soloists.
The charismatic drama baritone Lester Linch (Porghie) is a favourite singer in Europe and America, with both the baritone and basbaritone parties in their repertoire, especially in Verdi operas.
Porgy's role has been sung countless times, including Krauna several times - he felt like a fish in the water in this opera and inspired stage partners even to conjure the emotional atmosphere of solidarity of the poor people of the fishing village in the concert performance.
Letyon Moore in her second concert performance in Porghie and Bess (the first one was held in 2012 no more, no less than with Berlin's Philharmonic and Sir Simon Retla) was revealed as a vitally plastic combination of different vocal styles with dramaticly toned tembra and fantastic piano in the upper register.
It is not for nothing that she is one of today’s most outstanding Aids.
The attractive Japanese tenor, Jermein Smith, which Andris Poga used to look at in Boston's production, the image of the drug dealer Sportinlaiff is the company's role on four continents.
In it he demonstrates his simultaneous dance and singing skills as a well-trained musical actor.
Smith is one of the rare nuggets whose voice seems to be still hiding undetected vocal possibilities, as it was 15 years ago when the opera voice was accidentally held in a caricature to ridicule peers.
Unbelievable, even from line 24 and in relative darkness, Germain Smith's expressive gesture language allows him to see the dust bag of happiness in his hands, even if it's not there.
How can poor Bess not follow such a mephistofelisic tempter, who makes us believe in the illusion of a wonderful life in New York City in an empty place?
The tembrally generously endowed Rodney Clark played a role.
The biggest vocal surprise in the Latvian soloist team Cesis's production was Sirina, represented by Sonora Vaice, a luxurious upper register, skilful balancing between spoken and sung text, with a corresponding change in voice position, vocal acrobatics and dramatism performance, both in Sirina's pitiful My Man is Gone Now and in the stylised foreskin's amplification of Oh, Doctor Jesus.
The voice of Margarita Wilson sounded well in the role of Clara, but at the very beginning the iconic Summertime expressed a little bit of a loud and nervous feeling, gaining its true character in reprisals.
The parties entrusted to Mikhail Čulpajev, Rihards Machanovskis, Andris Lapins (especially the Crab seller placed on the walls of castle ruins in response to the soprano thesis of the soprano seller of the Irma Cooke).
Bright characters in Ilona Bagell, Rihards Miller, Emīls Kivlenieks' characters, as well as in the spoken roles, where Ivo Martinson's investigator and the director and actor Juris Žagars, who was unexpectedly presented to viewers in the image of the white lawyer Archdale.
In the spatial concept of the concert performance, created by Viesturs Kairišs, the choir worked on steps, soloists - mostly in proscension, rarely arriving or leaving stairs.
In the dynamic activity enough, a little comical situation was done in the hands of the Latvian soloists of the sheet music folder.
Their presence, however, has quite a prosaic explanation.
First of all, some soloists sang several episodic roles (which sometimes caused difficulties in tracing their stage identity).
Secondly, in Porghie and Bess there are many dialogues, words inserted into the conversation, rejoinders, which are easier to trace with notes in front of them.
The audience was greatly helped by the titre machine to go into the details of the opera action in Cēsis.
The weather did not spoil, and the first part of the concert performance fell long enough.
However, it did not stop most listeners from staying until the end to cheer up the artists.
Nine at night is a rather late start time for a full-length opera, especially if a longer way from Cēsis is expected, yet opera Porghy and Bess have returned to the Latvian musical circulation and will most likely become one of the most outstanding musical adventures of this summer.
Also in Liepaja, where it was said yesterday evening, as well as in quite other acoustic conditions.
In Riga, a man in the playground has frightened children with a ax.
Yesterday, on August 11, at about eight o’clock, the State Police received a message from a frightened child's grandmother who was worried that on Lomonosova Street, one of the children's squares, there was a man who and axes the children.
The law enforcement immediately responded to the call and arrived at the place of the event, where he also met this man with the ax, who at the moment of the event was very heavy under the influence of alcohol - 3.07 promiles.
It was found that a man born in 1962 had frightened his children in advance so that they would not noise.
This time, however, the aggressive man used the ax to beat the children’s field equipment.
The man was arrested.
In the context of the incident, a criminal proceeding has been initiated for gross disruption of public order, which manifests itself in obvious disrespect for society or shamelessness, ignoring generally accepted norms of conduct and disturbing the peace of people.
Such a crime shall be punishable by deprivation of liberty for a period of up to two years or by temporary deprivation of liberty, or by forced labour, or by fines and by probation monitoring for a period of up to three years.
The presidents of the federations usually use guest accreditations in the Olympic Games.
The presidents of the Sports Federations usually arrive at the Olympic Games for a few days and use guest accreditations, which can change their names, so they have several owners during the competition, and the representative of the Latvian Olympic Unit (LOV) Marita Vilciņa told LETA.
On Wednesday, the great aziotage arose after the comments of German Jakubovsky, the coach of the Olympic swimmer Aļona Ribakov, who revealed that at the last moment he decided to go to Rio de Janeiro Olympiad, the head of the Latvian Federation of Swimming (LPF), Kaspars Pone, while the coach should stay at home.
Later it became known that Pone arrived in Brazil with the accreditation of a coach, about which the president himself expressed surprise, because "it is not possible to get in anywhere".
According to Vilciņa, only the presidents of two federations - Pone, as well as Guntis Zālītis, the head of the Latvian Athletics Union (LVS), have lived in the London Olympic Games in the village of athletes.
There are athletes living in the Olympic village, as well as official persons, including, for example, coaches, doctors, the administration of the delegation.
Consequently, it is likely that Pone had a coach accreditation in London as well.
"The other presidents of the federations arrive as guests, and they have their accreditations changeable - they arrive for a few days and after that someone else uses it", says Vilciņa, explaining that the presidents of these federations do not live in the Olympic village either.
Pone arrived in Rio de Janeiro at the end of July and Brazil will leave on August 13, so he is likely to be the longest presidents of all the national federations.
Significantly, Latvian athletes participated in swimming only one day - on 10 August.
Latvia In the Rio Olympic Games will be represented in 11 sports, and LETA's calculations show that the presidents of six or seven federations will attend the four-year most important competitions.
The hall will arrive in Brazil on Saturday, the President of the Latvian Cycling Federation (LRF) Igo Japins will be on the next week's planned BMX competition, the President of the Latvian Windsurfing Federation Ansis Dāle has planned to fly to Rio de Janeiro on 16 August, when both Katti Birzulei startis will be finished, and the President of the Latvian Fight Federation Dzintars Urbančiks – the day before.
The next week the President of the Latvian Shooting Federation Kārlis Krēsliņš has also planned to arrive, when the start of Dainis Upelnieks will be completed.
Raimonds Rublovskis, President of the Latvian Giudos Federation, at least during the Latvian athletes' competitions, did not find Rio de Janeiro, even though his arrival was planned, the Latvian Canoe Federation currently has no president, but the Latvian weightlifting society is still in conflict and its athletes are invited to international competitions by the Latvian Olympic Committee.
Meanwhile, the President of the Latvian Volleyball Federation Atis Sausnītis and the Head of the Latvian Tennis Union Juris Savickis decided not to appear in Rio de Janeiro.
Vasiljevs appreciates the natural breasts of Latvian women.
The world-famous Russian fashion historian, interior decorator, stage designer, book author, lecturer and collector Aleksandrs Vassiljevs has visited Latvia very often in recent years.
In the finals of "Mis un Misters Latvija 2016" he evaluated contestants and admitted that Latvian beauties, unlike representatives of the Russian beautiful sex, can be proud of their natural breasts and lips, which have not been improved with silicone and botulinum injections.
In a conversation with "Vakara Ziņi" Aleksandrs Vasiljevs told that he has been the president of the jury in the popular "Mis Russia" beauty competition for many years.
That is why he has also engaged with great interest in the evaluation of the participants of "Miss and Misters Latvija 2016".
Asking that the standards of Latvian beauty competition differ from similar competitions in Russia, Vasiljevs stressed that Latvians and Russians have very different figures: "Russian beauty competition participants have bigger breasts than Latvians."
However, Latvian young women are beautifully dressed and saffroned, as well as can be proud of their natural beauty, not the miracles of plastic surgery.
Therefore, I especially congratulate the Latvian beauty contestants for their natural beauty.
In relation to his professional activities in Latvia Vasilev has large plans.
At the moment, the exhibition of the collection of fashion historians, "Adranged Nature", is on view at the Museum of Decorative Arts and Design.
In turn, in Ventspils, the Livonian Order Palace, the exhibition "Wedding Clothes 1860-2010" is on view.
Vasilev loved Ventspils so much that for a few days he also enjoyed the city's hospitality and went for a walk along the sea.
I like it very much in Latvia.
Especially now that there is a terrorist threat across Europe, there is a real paradise corner here.
"It is a pleasure to spend time and relax in Latvia", admitted the fashion guru.
Moreover, on 23 November Aleksandrs Vasilevs will open a private fashion museum in Old Riga.
Ask me to help you!
Please donate to treat our son, brother, grandson.
We Rinald's family are grateful to fantastic people around us and God that there was a chance to save Rinald, but unfortunately, there is no way to fully cover the medical costs on our own.
Rinald Grinberg is an 11 - year - old adult who was diagnosed with brain cancer at the end of July.
This year he graduated from the 4th class in Milzkalne Primary School with excellence, a strong athlete and a very talented artist.
I think everything gave up to him.
A healthy, happy, persistent, diligent and active boy.
Always smiling and kind.
July 26 will remain in our family memory forever.
The last few weeks were suffering with nausea, headache, but the doctors put it on the belly virus.
And at first it seemed that it was.
Because who could have imagined that such "innocent" symptoms had something more serious to blame, which is beyond the mind.
On July 26 we received a diagnosis - Rinald has a brain tumor.
There is a rapid accumulation of fluid in the brain, but everything doctors can help in Latvia is to perform a bypass operation to remove excess fluid, because for direct surgery the tumor is practically not available.
It is also not possible to determine whether the tumor is benign or malignant.
Further state-paid plan: start radiation and watch what's going on.
It seemed like a bad nightmare -- we're going to take stock here, look at the results.
Fortunately, it was possible to show the results of Rinalda's examinations to doctor in Spain.
He is Vice President of the World Neurosurgery Association, one of the leading neurosurgeons in the world.
He undertook to carry out an operation, and he also found it necessary to operate immediately.
The tumor exerts enormous pressure on the brain, and the risk of complications is too high.
It is also urgent to understand whether the tumor is benign or malignant to develop a plan for further treatment.
Without thinking for a moment, the parents chose to go to Spain to save their son.
As early as August 8, Rinald and Mama Evija were in Spain and were operational on August 9.
A very complex operation lasting more than 6 hours was performed.
The operation took place at Santa Elena's clinic.
It was successful to remove most of the tumor, reduce the pressure, get analytical samples.
Rinalds is now getting out of bed and like a good teenager, asking for fries for dinner.
Now just wait for the results of oncological tests.
Thanks to Dr. Araez and Clinic leadership, who understood the situation and operated urgently without receiving full payment for treatment before surgery.
By trusting that the remaining amount would be paid, they only demanded the first instalment of EUR 10 000 in order to operate and save Rinald's life.
The parents managed to provide EUR 6 000 by selling the machinery, but the rest of the necessary amount for travel, living, and the first contribution of the hospital managed to borrow from relatives and friends.
But at least another EUR 24 000 is needed to pay for the first phase of treatment in Spain and return the money we have borrowed for the first instalment.
Please help us pay back this surgery, Rinald's so important for health.
Each euro is important to help cover the costs of the operation that has already been carried out and to enable Rinalda to continue its treatment successfully.
The signs of anxiety in Ukraine raise the question: What do Vladimir Putin think?
It is possible to judge the truthfulness of these claims.
Ukraine denies them, while the US and the European Union claim that Russia has not provided any evidence.
The Open Analysis Group, Digital Forensic Research Lab, has found some signs of Saturday shooting, but quite little to be able to hinder Moscow's big plans.
Russia is known for its distorting or misinterpreting of events for political purposes, in particular in the context of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.
This does not mean that all Russian claims are unfounded.
Members of the Ukrainian resistance forces damaged last year the electric pilons supplying Crimea, and some of them are also involved in criminal activities and human rights violations.
The attempt to attack Crimea is still a topical issue, although there are very few grounds for suspecting that the Ukrainian Government would sponsor a scenario of such events.
Whatever happened, the images found by the open source analysts show that Russia has been increasing its military presence since at least last Saturday before the anticipated attack took place.
They show the passage of heavy arms convoys along the peninsula, including missile systems designed to protect the coast.
Disturbingly familiar Russian escalation
Some reports show that Russian forces in Crimea had already planned rotation around this time, which could help explain activity, although it would be a great coincidence that it just happened to happen in one of the most tense times of tension since the annexation of 2014.
Whatever has become known during the weekend, Mr Putin has undoubtedly focused even more on Ukraine in his remarks, choosing to use this episode, however realistic it may be, for a greater purpose.
Analysts point to alarming parallels in the way Russia behaved just before previous military actions against Ukraine.
In February 2014, a cover was provided with similar speeches and military manoeuvres for Crimean volunteers to accept the peninsula, which at that time was still controlled by Ukraine, just to reveal that, in fact, it was Russia's special units that launched the military occupation.
In August, when Russian-supported separatists failed in Eastern Ukraine, Putin deployed forces along the border, warning that they might be needed for the "protection" of ethnic Russian civilians in Ukraine, who, according to him, are being attacked.
He arranged a relief convoy to a region that, according to NATO, was only a cover for Russian invasion forces.
What does Mr Putin intend to do in Crimea?
Some have guessed whether Moscow alone is planning another military intervention.
The fighting in Eastern Ukraine has intensified, as it was before the invasion in August 2014.
But this supposed parallel could be the point where fear of military activities is supposed to be introduced, not of actual activities - this will give Putin a trump card in both relations with Ukraine and with Western countries.
Mark Galeotti, a professor at Nujorka University studying Russia, pointed out that Crimea would have little significance as a point from which to start military action against Eastern Ukraine, which is bordering on the Russian land area rather than Crimea, and that the rest of the country is better protected.
"There's a little chance if the Russians really plan a large-scale offensive," said Mr Galeoti.
Rather, "we can observe a classic Russian strategy in creating a pressure."
International peace talks about Ukraine, which once was a mechanism with which Putin forced contacts with Western leaders who ignored him because of the annexation of Crimea, are increasingly seen as unsuccessful and irrelevant.
By promising that there is a danger that the conflict may flare up again, Putin gives the negotiations a new meaning: to get him off the edge of the abyss.
"It's the standard Putin Tactics - he wants to try to start from the position of power," Galeotis said about the next peace talks scheduled for the beginning of September.
"And the only strong side is to say, "If I'd like, I could make everything much more, much worse."
Reaching an agreement with the West
Putin also said this week that during the tensions in Crimea it was not very important to continue negotiations, making other parties convince him to return to the negotiating table and to come to the centre of the process.
What does it actually give him?
Firstly, it allows Russia to continue to consolidate itself as a world power, even though its economy is smaller than that of Australia.
Secondly, it positions Moscow as the owner of a veto on the sovereignty of Ukraine, leaving the country to some extent under Russian control.
It can also benefit Putin's long-served hopes of a large-scale agreement with the United States, which would resolve their disputes on the issue of Ukraine and Syria, with favourable conditions for Moscow, naturally, also by ending Western sanctions against Russia.
Putin's hints about this objective since the country's economic situation deteriorated in 2014, have been expressed several times, mainly due to the decrease in the value of its oil and gas exports.
Since his invasion of Syria last autumn, he has repeatedly called on the Western powers to join him in the great coalition against extremists.
However, the Russian leaders may think that they would need to secure such an agreement before January, when President Obama's mandate expires.
Russian officials basically believe that the next president will be Hillary Clinton, who is more hostile to Moscow.
Donald Trump, although noticeably friendly to Russia, is still considered unpredictable.
Obama, in turn, is considered to be "seeking solutions, not conflicts," said Galeoti.
So it makes sense to close the window of opportunity to get something done quickly.
In the meantime, if no agreement can be reached on a large scale, Putin seems to be satisfied with maintaining Russia's weak neighbour by mentioning what will be further.
In the earlier version of this article, the year when Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine was wrongly indicated.
This was in 2014 and not in 2013.
At the impasse of the Congress, the White House diverts funds to fight against Zika’s virus
The Obama administration said on Thursday that USD 81 million would be diverted from biomedical research and anti-poverty and health-care programmes to pay for the development of a vaccine against Zika virus by resorting to emergency measures because Congress did not approve new funding to combat the virus.
Silvia Matthews Barwell, secretary of health and humanitarian services, in a letter to the participants of Congress indicated that without the resources diverted, the National Institute of Health and Biomedical Research and Development will remain without money to fight the disease transmitted by mosquitoes until the end of the month.
Therefore, it would be necessary to stop the development of the vaccine at an important moment, as the number of Zika acquired in the country increases in Miami.
Last week, 7 350 cases of Zika virus were reported in the United States, mostly in Puerto Rico (according to disease control and prevention centres).
Mrs. Barvel said that 15 infants were born with Zika’s virus birth defects.
The virus can cause brain development abnormalities and other serious defects in the babies born to infected mothers.
The prevalence of the disease in the continental part of the United States, where the first cases were recorded at the end of last month, has increased the political rates by the reaction of the federal government.
Hillary Clinton stopped on Tuesday as part of the campaign in Vainwood, in the Miami area, where there was an outbreak of Zika virus transmitted locally, and pressure was put on Congress to return from its five-week break to confirm emergency funding to fight the virus.
President Obama and the Republicans of Congress have had conflicting thoughts on most of the annual Zika virus issues.
In February, Obama demanded USD 1.9 billion in emergency funding.
The Republicans suspended it by requesting a more detailed account of who the money will be spent on.
The legislators have been arguing for months about how much money should be allocated and how it should be spent.
Last month, the democrats blocked the examination of the measure proposed by the Republicans, when the USD 1.1 billion would be allocated to the fight against the Zika virus, but included provisions prohibiting the allocation of funds for family planning for the provision of contraception in connection with the virus that can be transferred to the sexual path.
Because of this impasse, the White House in April was forced to direct USD 589 million to fight against the Ebola virus. About two thirds of the funding is intended to be used within the country.
On Thursday, Mrs Barvela said that her department had spent most of the money and that it would be spent in full by the end of August.
"The failure to decide on emergency funding for the fight against Zika virus has led the administration to choose between postponing the important vaccine development work and resorting to other valuable national programmes to temporarily avoid this postponement," Barvela wrote.
The democrats committed themselves to this statement in order to blame the Republicans for not giving additional money to fight the Zika virus.
At the news conference, Nancy Pelosi from California, the leader of the minority, invited Paul D.Riena, Speaker of the House of Representatives, to remind Congress of the progress of this event.
"All opportunities have been exhausted, and now we turn to the National Institute of Health," said Mrs Pelosi.
Mr Ryan's advisers say that channelling funds is a step that has long been taken and which the Obama administration has taken away in order to push out the maximum political benefit of the Zika virus problem.
Last week, the National Institute of Health announced the launch of clinical trials on vaccine against Zika virus in 80 people and looks forward to the launch of the second phase in the Zika virus epidemic countries in early 2017.
However, as the officials stated on Thursday, the study will stop without immediate additional funding.
She said that she would direct USD 34 million from the National Health Service to search for cures for other diseases, including cancer and diabetes.
A further 47 million will be transferred to the Biomedical Research and Development Authority, which supports the development of medicines and vaccines in response to public health emergencies.
This money will come from a number of accounts, including 19 million US dollars from a programme providing heating fuel oil subsidies to low-income families, and 4 million US dollars from substance dependence programmes, such as opioid dependence.
Even then, as Barvela said, the extra money will only be enough for the next month, when the agencies will have to "size them down thoroughly" in the fight against Zika's virus if Congress does not act.
Over the last four months, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention has spent USD 60 million to help states protect pregnant women, USD 25 million to strengthen their preparedness and plans for the Zika virus and to help them develop data-gathering systems to quickly detect microcephaly and other symptoms associated with Zika virus.
Thai leader links attacks on tourist attractions with constitutional changes
The head of the junta in Thailand on Friday called on the people of the country to be patient until the investigators find out what is behind the series of deadly bomb explosions in Thailand this week.
General Preyut Chan-och, the head of the junta and the Prime Minister, said that criminals were 'bad people' protesting against the new Constitution, which was approved by the voters in a referendum held on Sunday.
"There are still bad people, and they worked before the referendum," he said to the people.
Four people were killed and dozens injured in bomb blasts in five provinces on Thursday and Friday, including in Phuket and Huahin, among tourists in popular places.
The authorities claim that attacks by combustion plants elsewhere in the country are linked.
Analysts claim that the aim of the bombings was not to kill many people, but to harm the tourism industry, one of the bright points of the Thai economy.
At least nine foreign tourists were injured in Huanhin.
"No matter what the motives are, the explosions and attacks of the burners overturn the junta's claim that the post-referendum situation will be stable," said Sunai Fask, senior researcher of Human Rights Watch.
These attacks have a discrediting effect on the authorities, terrorise society and harm the tourism-based economy.
Photo Thai rescue staff cares for the injured on Friday bomb explosion in Huahin.
The police claim that in their view these explosions are not related to international terrorism or prolonged Islamic unrest in southern Thailand.
They regard attacks as "local sabotage" and not terrorism.
The timing and location of the attacks chosen has a strong political symbolism.
The explosions took place on Friday when people were prepared to celebrate Queen Siricita’s birthday, which is considered Mother’s Day in Thailand.
Four explosions blew down the royal residence in the city of Huahin, about 125 miles from Bangkok, where there was also the majority of wounded.
The constitution drawn up by the military will reduce the influence of political parties and give the military greater powers, even if the government is once again under the control of civilians.
Hunta helped to secure its victory by preventing opponents from campaigning against it.
Murray Hiebert, a South-East Asian expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., pointed to the suspicion of the militants that the attacks were carried out by people who were dissatisfied with the vote.
Explosions were " precisely coordinated, but obviously aimed at creating fear and anxiety, not mass damage and damage and injuries," he said.
Last year, in the explosion in the popular Yerevan sanctuary in Bangkok, 20 people were killed, mostly tourists from China.
Thai officials associated the explosions with Uighur fighters who were dissatisfied with the return of more than 100 Uighurs to China.
General Preyut, who has been running the junta since 2014, when the civilian government was quickly suspended, said that this week's explosions "relief the hearts of Thais."
Why now that the country is doing better, when the economy is going better, and in the tourism sector is doing better?" he said.
We have to ask why and who did.
Gold reaction: What the historical moment of Simone Manuela looked like
When I started fighting tonight, I supposedly tried to take off the black community's weight from my shoulders, which is something that I just brought with me in that position.
I hope, however, that all this will be gone.
I am more than happy about the fact that I can serve others as inspiration and hopefully diversify this sport.
At the same time, however, I would like to have a day when we have more, and it is not Simone, a black swimmer, because the designation of a black swimmer makes it look like I shouldn't be able to win a gold medal or that I shouldn't be able to beat the records.
That's not the case, because I work as hard as everyone else, and I love sports and want to win like everyone else.
Fight for defending students - lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (L.G.B.T.) - in Colombia
Two years ago, the 16-year-old Sergio Urrego died, jumping from the shopping center in Bogota, before leaving the message of his suicide on Facebook, quoting Pink Floyd's song Goodbye Cruel World.
His death was the origin of the contradiction that broke out this week in Colombia, where efforts to expand L.G.B.T. rights were viewed in the wider political struggles that have divided the country into two camps.
After his death, Urrego's mother, Alba Reijesa, lodged a complaint with the court against the school officials to blame them for the exclusion of her only son when it was found that he and his classmates had an intimate relationship.
A year later, the Colombian Supreme Court issued her a positive verdict calling on schools throughout the country to develop a clearer policy to prevent discrimination.
The decision was part of a series of legal victories of the Colombian gay rights movement. Some time ago, this movement celebrated the adoption of a decision on same-sex marriage legalization.
This week, however, they faced an obstacle in their fight for equality, because Jean Perody, the Minister for Education, who is openly gay, got into a scandal about the application of this provision in scandal.
The scandal began when, in the social media, sexually exposed content from pornography began to circulate, spreading to people that it was part of a handbook published by the Ministry of Education.
Perody was quick to expose it.
Although the Ministry offered schools assistance on issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity with the idea of helping them to pay attention to the rule, it has not tried to impose standardised rules.
"What we want for schools is the tools for conflict resolution," said Mrs. Perdodia in her interview on Thursday.
The discussions began before the national debate on the future of a country where peace talks between the government and the revolutionary Colombian armed forces, or the FARC, were held in the partisans group.
The coalition of politicians and the leaders of the Catholic Church in the opposition to the government have mobilised extremely quickly in accusing the government of the Presidency, Juan Manuel Santos, of one-sex union and the promotion of gender change.
In order to make everyone even more difficult, a government delegation engaged in negotiations with FARC in Havana recently reached an agreement on gender and L.G.B.T. equality, calling on the government to adopt more inclusive policies.
Government criticism and peace talks put on the 42-year-old Perodiy, Colombia's rising political star.
They demonstrated pawns in myths and some have also threatened violence against him and her partner, Cecilia Alvarez-Korrea Glena, former trade ministers.
Perody maintained an amazing peace for the whole week, trying to correct the mistake and reopen the debate on constructive terms.
"Partly what makes me stand and keep my head clear is the awareness that there are children who will only be revealed," she said.
This is a very tight field and a very lonely time.
She also pointed to the link between the peace process and the debate on L.G.B.T. students.
While the Colombians continue to assess the benefits of a deal with the FARC, which would be an earthquake-like milestone in the country, they have to think about the origin of the conflict, she said.
"Is it a peaceful country that promotes inclusion or exclusion; is it one in which everyone has the same opportunities?" she asked.
Although this week she has not been pleased to be the target of insults and accusations, she is pleased that in today's Colombia gay students can take an example from her and think that they can also one day try to become ministers.
"For me, it is very important that they are calm and aware that they can fully realise their potential," said Mrs. Perody.
We cannot expect a new suicide to start making a difference.
Keep the vote cyber-secure - The New York Times
"The U.S. is looking for ways to keep hackers away from the ballot boxes" (news article, August 4)
The Minister for Internal Security, Jech Johnson, says that the Obama administration is thinking about further protection of the security of the national electoral system.
These changes may be necessary and should be considered immediately.
Cyber threats in various forms and the recent discovery that external forces, perhaps national states, are increasingly interested in influencing our elections, require the federal government to pay additional attention to the provision of our electoral system and perhaps see it as part of an essential infrastructure for our country.
Johnson should immediately contact thousands of national jurisdictions that help to conduct elections and offer assistance, advice and guidance to the Department of Homeland Security.
While the diverse and diverse nature of our voting infrastructure hinders efforts to ensure this, this tells us that we need to start the process as soon as possible.
The writer, a democrat from Mississippi, is a senior member of the National Security Committee.
In Pennsylvania a boy injured in carousel, this week already the third case in amusement parks
On Thursday, a boy fell from a carousel was injured and taken to the Pittsburgh hospital. The ambulance and park officials say that this week this is already the third accident in the U.S. amusement parks where children have suffered.
A child whose name is not disclosed was just taken to a children’s hospital in Pittsburgh about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of the Aidlvailda and Soukzona amusement park in Laijaoniera, Pennsylvania, said a representative of the West Murland area emergency services.
The three-year-old boy, who went with his brother while he was being helped on the spot, was conscious, informed in an e-mail the park's representative, Jeff Krušon.
Krašors said that the "Rolo Coaster" attraction will be closed for the duration of the investigation of the event.
Children must be at least 3 feet (91 cm) long in the aydlvald to travel in the carousel and those less than 4 feet (122 cm) must be accompanied by adults.
According to the information published on its website, it was built in 1938 and the State Department of Agriculture indicated that it had been checked in August.
The hospital representative refused to comment on the boy’s state of health.
On Sunday, a 10 - year - old boy died from the world’s highest water mountain in Kansassy, Kansas.
On Monday, three girls, 6, 10 and 16 years old, who fell from more than 30 feet (9 metres) in height, were taken to the hospital, overturning the cart of the giant wheel during the fair in Greenville, Tennessee, reports local media.
The Japanese Prime Minister, Abe, will not attend the temple on the anniversary of the Second World War, honoring the memory of those who have fallen in the war: Jiji
The news agency Jiji reports that the Japanese Prime Minister Sindzo Abe will not visit the controversial Tokyo sanctuary on the occasion of Japan’s defeat during the Second World War.
On Thursday, Jiji reported that Abe was planning to send a ritual gift in honor of the anniversary to Jasukuni shrine on Monday.
The sanctuary also honours the memory of 14 Japanese military leaders who have only been convicted as war criminals, and China and South Korea regard it as a symbol of Japanese wartime militaryism.
Abe has not visited the sanctuary since December 2013, when he announced that he had visited it to show respect to those who died for their homeland.
The new Japanese Minister for Defence, Tomomi Inada, has not answered the question of whether she will visit the shrine, explaining that it is a matter of conscience.
Inada, a close ally of Abe and a supporter of Japanese pacifist constitutional amendments, has visited Yasukuni regularly in the past.
The news agency, Kyodo, reports that the Minister for Reconstruction of Japan’s disaster-stricken territories, Masahiro Imamura, visited the shrine on Thursday and said that he was praying for Japan’s peace and prosperity.
The relationship between China and Japan, the two largest economies in Asia, has become more tense following the growing presence of Chinese coastguards and other state vessels in the disputed islands in the South China Sea, which is referred to as Sencaka in Japan, and Diaoujah in China.
Two suspects detained in the planning of terrorist acts of the Rio Olympic Games: police
On Thursday, the police detained two people suspected of supporting the Islamic state of the group in planning a possible attack during the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Prior to the operation on Thursday, the police had already detained 12 persons, all suspected of cooperating with Islamic state fighters.
According to the Brazilian Federal Police, three more persons were interrogated and later released.
The two arrested on Thursday are Brazilians, but the police do not disclose their names and other information.
Although there have been no conflicts in Brazil’s history with known militias, the government reports that the Olympic Games have made the country a more topical target, especially since the countries fighting the Islamic State are taking part in the games.
Its fighters control certain areas of Iraq and Syria, and the US-led coalition has conducted air attacks against them.
The group has supporters around the world who have shot and bombed civilians.
The young suspect is formally accused of murdering the French priest
As part of the investigation into the murder of the French priest last month, there have been official charges against the man arrested on Monday, and on Friday, Reuter reported to the police as a source of information.
The 21-year-old suspect is being investigated for cooperation with terrorists, and he was planning attacks on people, mentioned the source of information.
The man was in telephone contact with Adel Kermič and Abdel Malik Petitjan, who terminated the church service in Stétienne du Rau, West France, on July 26, and cut his throat to 85 - year - old Roman Catholic priest, Father Jacques Amel.
Both were shot by the police.
The suspect had come from his home near Toulouse to St.
The young man, who had not had a criminal record before, admitted that he had spent the night there, but told the investigators that he had left the next day because he had no good relationship with Kermitch and Patitjana, said the source of the information.
Investigators seek to find out whether Kermitch and Petitjan had accomplices in France and whether they were associated with an Islamic state that has assumed responsibility for the attack.
Pattyjan's cousin was subject to pre-trial detention at the end of last month.
Doruss de Vries undergo medical examinations before moving to Celtic
Nottingham Forest Club goalkeeper Dorus de Vries has arrived in Glasgow because he hopes to conclude an agreement to move to Celtic.
De Vries was photographed, entering the Roshola Hospital before medical examination after Hoops agreed on the conditions with Sky Bet Champions Club.
Parkhead club leader Brendan Rogers is looking for an experienced center guard so that the current first issue of Craig Gordon is competitive.
However, Roger trusts 35-year-old de Vries because he has worked together with the Dutchman at the Swansea club.
He played 51 games in Swansea, which they won in 2011 under Rogers' leadership to move to the Premier League.
He changed the Welsh form to join Wolves in summer, and since 2013 is City Ground.
He has also played in Scotland during his career after the Diunkermline season, after returning in 2006.
His stay in the Eastend Park ended with disappointment, however, when Pars experienced a double agony, being "sent out" from the highest level before the loss of the Celtic Scottish Cup.
The gatekeeper had a year left in the Forest under contract, and it was reported that Celtic would only have to pay a nominal fee to get his signature.
Macy's will close 100 stores.
The supermarket giant Macy's on Thursday announced its plans to close 100 shops, which is a dramatic step towards helping the store chain to get ahead of the potentially meticulous problems: in America, it claims to be an online shopping era for too many stores.
Macy's regularly reduces its store portfolio, often closing several dozens of under-performing stores immediately after the annual holiday fever.
However, with its summer announcement that it will close 15 per cent of its 728 outlets, the chains of stores seem to have taken a much more aggressive stance than many similar retail players in terms of reducing the number of their shops, adapting to a very changing shopping environment.
Pedestrians and buyers go past the Macy's store in New York.
The retail giant announces that he plans to close 100 shops.
Macy's has many reasons to try to change something: many of its shops are located in small regional shopping centres, as the number of buyers has been particularly affected by the boom in e-commerce.
The retail sector as a whole has faced more difficult times, as buyers increasingly prefer lower price retailers such as T.J.Maxx and fast fashion players such as H&M to buy clothes.
These factors, along with short-term difficulties such as ever smaller international tourist spending and seasonal weather conditions that Macy's has placed in a fragile situation that has already lasted for more than a year.
On Thursday, the company announced that its comparable sales in the last quarter had dropped by 2.6 percent, a rather weak indicator, which was nevertheless an improvement given the very poor 6.1 percent drop in the year-on-year, which was found in the previous quarter.
The retailer's income was USD 5.87 billion (7.64 billion Canadian dollars), 3.9 percent less than in the same period last year.
Macy's stated that closing the shops would cost it about USD 1 billion in terms of annual turnover.
And closing such a large number of shops at the same time could be seen as a recognition of the collapse of the retailer.
However, the value of the company's shares dropped by 17 percent on Thursday, which indicates that investors perceive this move as a proactive measure that tells about a stronger future for Macy's.
In a way, the fact that Macy's reduces the number of stores should not be a surprise.
The Director-General of the retailer, Terry Lundgreen, said earlier that there are quite simply too many shops in the chain.
Top managers have for some time said that they have adopted a new strategy, which places particular emphasis on 150 of its most profitable shops, trying to achieve higher sales in already profitable outlets.
Jeff Janette, director of Macy's, who has been appointed instead of Lundgren since 2017, said in his statement almost all the shops that the company intends to close are those where sales and profitability slide down.
"We are aware that we do not yet get an adequate return on investment in these outlets, and there is often no level of customer shopping experience that reflects our efforts in relation to the Macy's brand," Janette said.
The company announced that it would present a list of shops that would be closed later.
Macy's said that it was still decided on the closing shops and that therefore it was not yet clear how many workers would be made redundant.
The retailer will not leave the main markets where it currently has shops completely, but it will think about closing those shops that are located in less active places.
This move is unlikely to be of interest to the managers of shopping malls who take into account such large tenants as Macy's to attract and retain other smaller shops in their shopping malls.
Are there dangerous bacteria in your water bottle?
According to a new study, drinking from refilled bottles can be "a lot worse than licking your dog’s toy", considering how many bacteria you will have to face.
The Treadmill Reviews commissioned EmLab P&K to test 12 bottles of four different types of water - with a screw cap, a flip-off cap, a pressurised cork, and a straw.
Each bottle was taken by an athlete for a week without washing.
Your refillable water bottle can be as dirty as a dog toy.
"With 12 bottles of water tested by us, we found that there may be an alarmingly high number of viable bacteria in reusable drinking containers: more than 300 000 colony forming units per square centimetre (CVV/q.cm.)," says Treadmill Reviews.
The bottles with flip-off caps showed the highest amount of microbes, more than 900 000 colony forming units per square centimetre (CVU/q.cm.)
The bottles contained microbes that can cause skin infections, pneumonia, or blood poisoning.
Bottles with press-in caps were the next worst with 162,000 CFU/cm., while containers with screw-in caps contained only slightly less than 160,000 CFU/cm.
"Drink water from such bottles may be worse than eating from your pet container", is indicated on the website.
A well better picture can be seen for straw bottles where only part of the bacteria in other bottles was found - only 25 CFU/cm.
This could be because the water drops to the lower part of the straw instead of sticking to its edges and thus attracting moisture-loving microbes.
The microbes in the bottles with straw are described as "mostly harmless."
"Based on the results of our test, we recommend to choose a bottle with straw, both due to the small number of bacteria and the absence of harmful microbes," mentioned on the website.
We also know that when it comes to bottles and bacteria, stainless steel is a better choice than plastics.
In addition, water bottles without cracks and hard-to-clean areas will have fewer microbes.
On the website readers are advised to wash the bottles after each use, ideally with a weak bleaching solution.
Religion Must Become Modern or Forget
In the United States, the Democratic Party has recently nominated Hillary Clinton as its presidential candidate.
If the results of the last polls prove true in the elections themselves, in January America will inaugurate its first president, a woman.
Last week, across the ocean, British Prime Minister Teresa May discussed Britain's withdrawal from Europe with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Women raised in Western society are brought up in such a way that they can be competent and successful in any field of professional activity through education, ambition and hard work.
And today, young girls can aim at a number of existing role models, working in the highest field of leadership.
So, is the real long and hard struggle for equality between women finally over?
Hillary Clinton is ready to be President of the United States at any time, but in the area of religion, women's leadership is still a controversial issue.
Okay, not completely.
In the religious field, women's leadership remains a controversial issue.
Last week, Pope Francis announced the creation of a new commission to assess whether women should be consecrated in a diacons round in the Catholic Church.
The Anglican Church consecrated Libya Lane as the first woman-bishop in January 2015, but it was only after a failed attempt in 2012.
While the reform of the Jewish movement has been used as a rabbinic for women since the early 1970s and in the conservative movement since the early 1980s, the concept of the female rabbinic is still very fiercely opposed in orthodox Judaism.
In November 2015, the American Orthodox rabbinic Council published a rather harsh message in its third attempt to halt the ever-increasing wave of support for the rabbinic treatment of Orthodox women that the concept of female rabbinic is contrary to the law.
Not without irony, when Hillary Clinton was nominated as President-in-Office of the Democrats, a group of American leading Orthodox rabbis opposed to female ordination launched a series of "discussions" on this controversial issue.
Why is there such a difference between secular and sacred?
Orthodoxal Judaism, like most other religions, is looking for stability in what it considers to be long-standing traditional values.
This is reflected in the ability to resist pressure to adapt to a changing society.
Those who oppose female ordination do so on the grounds that it is not "traditional."
However, taking over with the preservation of traditions in this way has a price.
And the price of such one-sided thinking can paradoxically undermine the tradition itself by taking away from the traditional community the oxygen it needs to maintain its vitality.
In the book "August Firearms", in the military history of World War I, Barbara Tachman emphasizes the danger of giving priority to the tradition of what has become known as "the tragedy of red trousers."
Until the outbreak of World War I, when war moved from war to more severe artillery from further distance, it became profitable to hide soldiers as long as possible.
British and German armies reacted to these changes by replacing their bright uniforms with boring grey and brown.
French soldiers, however, still wore the same red hats and trousers that made them easy for purposes.
The French Minister of War Affairs, Adolf Messymi, suggested that the armies under his command could do the same, was treated with ridicule and opposition.
Red trousers reflected the pride and prestige of the army, and the military traditionals were not prepared to give up.
Speaking in parliament, former Minister for War Affairs Eijens Etyens spoke on behalf of France.
"Rejecting the red pants?" he exclaimed.
Never!
"It's the inexpressive and idiotic appendix at the most visible of all colors," then wrote Messy, "it was supposed to have a bad effect."
Faith leaders who are fighting for the inclusion of women in leading religious roles could fall into the same trap.
Focusing solely on "traditional" religion, rather than asking the important question: "What changes are needed for religion to flourish?" they risk losing about 50 percent of their followers.
They also take away from the whole community the talent, skills and enthusiasm that women would otherwise bring.
To insist that men continue to wear trousers when it comes to religion may be traditional, but as the destruction of red trousers shows, it may not be worth it.

The children of Roja district learned new skills in the camp.
From August 1 to 6, the Children's and Youth Initiative Centre of Rojupe hosted the camp "Varavik Bridges", during which participants creatively demonstrated, sports, as well as acquired new skills.
We arrived at the camp on the closing day when the children were enthusiastic about painting glass jars.
Māra Folkmane, a youth initiative specialist at the Rojaupe Children's and Youth Initiative Centre, told that this was one of the activities the participants of which liked most.
A visit to the Einars Kalniņš carpentry "Mazbebiņi" was also a great pleasure.
The children were most impressed by the laser piano, as it was possible to see how the drawing, which is in the computer, is gradually applied to the board.
Mr Kalnins has told us what subjects to learn at school if he wants to work in carpentry, namely, the main thing is mathematics, especially geometry, computer science, as well as technical drawing and drawing.
He also stressed the need to work more with the brain than with the muscles in this profession.
There are individual orders in a small workshop, and it is important to plan everything first.
In order to get to know each other better, when the camp started, the participants participated in various games, as well as jointly formed the camp "gerbons".
On Wednesday a hike took place along the sea from Roja to Jocé, along the way natural materials were collected, which were later used to make cards.
Sports games were also held, which are of particular importance to the participants.
We went to the apartment house, where we have a sports and recreation area, and played football and a net ball.
Children like sports activities, we have a lot of boys playing football, basketball, and every time they ask for something sporty.
Girls like more peaceful activities.
On another day, with the help of a self-hardening mass, we decorated jars that could later be used as pencil holders.
There was also a talent evening, children chose with whom to speak, and one evening was devoted to performances.
Board games were also played, everyone could show their knowledge at the time of the photo orienteering, where by the pictures objects had to be found and photographed.
The task was to make different in every picture.
We also painted mandalas - some like it more, some less.
There will never be one lesson that everyone will like - sport is closer to one another, creative classes are closer to another.
"Now it looks like everyone works enthusiastically with painting glass," explained M. Folkmane.
At the end of the camp, diplomas for creativity, sports, as well as assistance were issued - several children helped directly in the economic works.
The name of the camp "Varavīksne tilti" has been created because children from three associations participate in the camp - Rojupe and Blacksila Children and Youth Initiative Centre, as well as the multifunctional centre "Strops" of Roja district.
These are the unifying bridges.
If the Rojeants figure out something faster, we borrow ideas; if the other way around, they borrow from us.
We share our experience.
This year, 30 participants took part in the camp - children who were active during the year.
"We had expected 30, and so did it," says Mr. Folkmane.
The camp was held for the fifth year.
It started in 2010, when Roja region social service decided that large families and children of poor families needed to organize camps in summer.
In the meantime, however, the situation in Roja has improved, and now the camp is intended for residents of the region who come and operate in youth centres.
The goal is to have a meaningful and comprehensive leisure time.
In the past, two camps took place and 20 children participated in each of them, while at the moment, due to the overall decrease in the number of children in the country, only one camp is organized.
During the rest of the year, similar activities take place.
Children draw, paint glass, and Einārs Kalniņš, who taught how to burn wood, how to make machines from wood, we saw different shapes with a saw.
There is also a new technique - encaustics, it is painting with hot wax chalk.
Master Ilze Šelkovs led a class in forming of polymer material, we formed culons and various dishes.
We make paintings from natural materials, interesting mandalas from beans, peas, linseed, in autumn we collect leaves.
We try to use what we have around us.
The youth centre works from 15.00 to 20.00 in winter, and from 14.00 to 20.00 in summer.
"On average, 15 children visit the youth centre daily," says M. Folkmane.
She stresses that Roja County Council is very supportive, which understands the need to allocate funds to children because they shape our future.
Charlton Athletic fans "can only get a seasonal ticket if they sign a behavioural contract" and agree not to criticise the club in social media.
Although we acknowledge that everyone has the right to his or her personal opinion, publishing confusing comments on such websites is not good.
The manager of the administration was then told that he would have to receive a ticket personally from the former police senior inspector, Cliff Eger, who joined the club last month after 35 years of his career in the police force.
The letter goes on: "I must inform you that the award of a seasonal ticket will be renewed on the condition that you sign the "Harmonized Contract of Behaviour" (ABC), which will stipulate that you will refrain from publishing abusive or confusing comments about people representing the club or club on all social media websites, or any other kind of behaviour that could be considered antisocial."
In the case of Daily Telegraph, the fan described how he called the club after payment of the seasonal ticket, which was never received, and two days later a letter was received by post.
Yesterday he went to a meeting at the club and said, "They told me that I was too much "tweeted", making others tweet as well, which is ridiculous."
Cycling holidays on the Dalmatian coast
What do you mean by the word "gry"?
I am coming here with all my strength," said Kolina, a former U.S. naval commander who has just travelled 25 miles of biking along the central part of a rough Croatian island, leaving nothing there, except a bucket of sweat and grass in the juicy sailors' expression, abducted in hostile mountains.
Some cyclists sing hymns or kindergarten poems to make it easier for them to reach the mountain.
Colin's friend Petti recommends the Little Engine That Could.
Others count grims or simply suffer in silence, thinking about what it requires to enter a trance-like state that is spoken of by hardened cyclists.
Colin’s lameness is more poisonous than varied.
To drive a few yards ahead of her is like after Hugh Grant as at the beginning of the film "Four wedding and one funeral".
Her and my mission is a week-long "luxury" yacht and cycling along the Croatian coast of North Dalmatia and islands organised by Freedom Treks.
Cycling in summer heat in such a steep mountainous place as Croatia may not correspond to everyone's understanding of luxury, but it is said that North Dalmatia is easier to drive than South Dalmatia, our saddles are soft, and when we filled the booking forms, freely and convincingly before all those months, there was a window that we didn't note, which could have provided us with a battery-charged e-bicycle.
The luxury part of the deal is our floating house for a week, brand new "Melody".
At the end of the trip, we can throw our bikes in a pile at our guides Ivan and Ivan and jump at the stern of the ship to hear in the blue water, without touching sea hedgehogs, sharp stones and other people on the narrow stone barons called the beach.
In June, the temperature of the sea is perfect, everyone agrees: cool enough to cool, but not cold.
On the "Melody" are located masks and breathing pipes and some kayaks, if either someone feels energetic after a heavy morning on the saddles.
Instead, most of us are returning to our cabins with air conditioners, where Helen, the ship's masseur - I am not kidding - will have already covered our beds, supplemented our minibars and left a new box with chocolates on the table.
Ivan says that stretching after cycling is very important, and in the afternoon we learn to stretch on our beds or with pillows on the top deck together with the bartender Antonio, who is always ready to cook one of his cocktails.
"Melody", 42 m long with 15 cabins and half a dozen crews, is not a popular superjacht, but a stylish small cruise ship.
It turns to a small island port between fishing boats and fleet holiday yachts, and we are proud to be part of it.
Colin and Petty belong to the group of friends of Meetup.com from Washington (Colombia Region): sports and social activists after 45, as they call themselves.
Last year's barges and bicycle holidays in the Netherlands were so successful that they decided to try something more richer, and that's how they are in Croatia.
The competing chapel from their church is a boating and cycling holiday in Provence, and every afternoon the air is concentrated in a competing Facebook publication ping pong rally.
The element of holiday adventures can be exaggerated, because our schedule is nothing if there is no specific regime.
"The breakfast and dinner are at eight," Ivan told the new participants at the opening meeting when we started our way from the beautiful old port of Trogir, near Split.
One of the ship’s bells indicates that the buffet is open, while the other calls for silence at the end of the meal and for further information to be carefully heard.
"Good morning!" is a cultural context that is probably lost everywhere, but not in the British continent.
What a difference - fun has already grown up, jokes fall like a horn of abundance, while Ivan distributes the daily excursion maps, but we all pretend that we are frightened by swinging, the blurring of contours and profiles with climbs and falls, although anything else would surprise Croatia's bicycle ride, which starts and ends at sea level.
"It's like a heart monitor," says Ivan.
Completely smooth is not recommended.
Ivan leads the information meeting in parallel, freely switching from English to German.
There are weeks when he has to deal with a dozen different nationalities, but we are a simple group: the Swiss, the Germans, the Americans and the British, who easily sit at tables at mealtimes, where two speak English and one talk German.
We're all friends on the road.
Cycling contributes to membership, and the only competition is within, i.e. with itself.
I do not remember when the group's dynamics would have been more harmonious and relaxed.
Soon we are on Ivan's wave.
A slight rise is a slope that should not be confused with roughness, which is a good thing.
The hairpins are serpentines and straight forward means straight: simple, but not always easy.
Cycling instructions are always the same: "To drive one by one, to take a distance, and that's not a race.
I'll see you on the beach at nine.
All right, five couples, I forgot you're on holiday.
Take plenty of water with you.
From Trogir we will go on a two-day cruise north through Kornati archipelago, where we will visit Dugi Ottok - the Croatian "garo island" - almost all the way, and after a small sum of money, we will go for a walk in the Telašcica Nature Park to admire its steep cliffs and salt lake, which flows sea water through the underground canal.
It is said that those who swim in it because of its power are getting younger.
If we walk through it, will our feet feel younger and stronger?
On the small island of Molata, we turn to the south again, jumping from the continent to the nearby islands seemingly by accident.
Most of our trips are on empty small roads on the outside of the country with wide sea views and varied vegetation: olive groves, vineyards, sharp plant breams, Mediterranean aromas in the air, and countless butterflies in flight.
As we go forward, there is always a breeze, but when Ivan stops, there is always a big shadow, and the small puddles are a reward for those who arrive faster.
Sports and social activists travel a lot on weekends, and they know the standards of behaviour, sending warnings in line and leaving space for motorists to make overtaking manoeuvres much safer.
"You almost hit," one cyclists says to the other after the truck driver decided to make a overtaking manoeuvre in an opaque bend and braked rapidly.
Fortunately, the brakes worked.
Ivan divides us into three groups every piece of short section for driving on the main roads, with Ivan at the very back to encourage and "give pace", as Ivan says.
If we have to cross the main road, we all gather together, step away from the bikes and safety after switching with our bikes on the other side as we have been instructed, not before.
"Do you think Ivan knows that he doesn't talk to a group of children?" asks the Swiss cyclist when we stand on the side of the road and wait for the signal when we can cross it.
Not the whole afternoon, we can devote ourselves to a pleasant rest.
The city review reveals a Roman forum and a sea organ playing music that sounds like a mob of a trapped marine monster, through pipes embedded in a stone in promenade and open water.
The famous sunset of Zadar falls perfectly between the main course and the pudding, and after dark we return to the sea organ and watch the wave-powered lamp games in the glass trotuit, which is actually a dance floor.
When "Melody" starts its way early in the morning to the vibrant Biograd resort, the organ song is nothing more than a whisper.
On the fifth day we are completely free from cycling.
A trip up the river Estuary of the Krka River to see its waterfalls; then an afternoon excursion in Sibenica, where we look at the thought cathedral, the masterpiece of the Dalmatian Renaissance, as well as a twilight-time walk along the peaceful island of Zlarina, looking for its local treasure coral, makes this day interesting.
Lurda is about to pick up pilgrims in the shadow of attack
During the annual Catholic pilgrimage, people gather at the Sanctuary of Lurda Our Lady.
France’s security forces are very alert, since thousands of Catholics gather at Lurda’s annual pilgrimage in the shadow of several acts of terror.
On August 15, each year, tens of thousands of people gather at the temple at the foot of the Pyrenees Mountains to celebrate the arrival of the virgin Mary in heaven.
This year's pilgrimage takes place at a time when Catholics have been shocked by the murder of an elderly French priest on 26 July by two Islamic extremists who invaded a church in the north of France during the Mass and cut his throat.
Jacques Amel's murder took place two weeks after a Tunisian -- investigators say he's been radicalized by Jihadists' online videos,--embled by a truck in the Bastille Day crowd of Riviera, Nice, killing 85 people.
After three major attacks in 18 months, many French people are cautious about attending public events.
The number of tourists fell dramatically, and the authorities feared that the number of pilgrims this year would fall rapidly.
However, fear of mass withdrawals did not materialize -- and some organisers say that even the influx of visitors' applications at the last minute has been observed.
Around 25 000 believers are expected to arrive, including a delegation from large groups from Italy and Belgium and about 200 from the Eastern Brethren, the Orthodox.
Many pilgrims have declared that they will not be intimidated.
"We do not intend to stop living," a 66-year-old visitor Christian said to AFP, describing prayer as "the only weapon" in the fight against violence.
"It is important to show that life continues," said Matier Gvinar - one of the coordinators.
We will not give up our faith, our beliefs, and our way of life simply because some fanatics are trying to sow fear.
Due to concerns about safety in France, a number of large-scale measures have been lifted since the attack in Nice, including the huge stock market in the northern city of Lille and the European cycling championship on the highway, which was due to take place in Nice in September.
"Last week I lived in fear that my phone would call in a single call to withdraw applications," said Fabien Légersne, a priest in charge of official pilgrimage last weekend.
"On the contrary, it seems that the attacks have mobilised the believers," he said and announced the inflow of last minute applications.
The head of the professional association of local hotel workers, Christian Žel, confirmed an "enhanced interest" in pilgrimage after the attacks.
Around the sacred place where the virgin Mary appeared in 1858 to the poor shepherd Bernadete Subiru, there were extremely strict security measures.
Some 250 policemen and two dozen soldiers have been assigned for protection, including bomb neutralization experts and explosives search dogs.
The bags were checked at the entrance, and the number of access points was reduced from twelve to three.
Catherine Simcox, who traveled from northeastern England to Lurda at the beginning of this month, described the increased security measures.
"By Thursday morning there were armed guards in the shrines, and then through the gate (with metal barriers) could enter only one by one, as well as were searched bags," she said in The Local.
"This all frightened my three children who were used to Lurda, and it was hard not to frighten them when they asked why it was so," she said.
It has not ruined my impressions, but it saddened me that it was necessary, and I realized that many people were comforted by these measures.
The Friday opening procession route has also been shortened – instead of starting in Lurda and moving on to the shrine, it will begin and end in the shrine.
Other measures include the closure of the airspace for flights over Lurda, the closure of streets near the traffic shrine and the replacement of waste bins for transparent plastic bags.
On Saturday, the French Minister for the Interior, Bernārs Kazenevs, will check security measures.
About six million people travel to Lurda a year, making it one of the largest Catholic pilgrimage destinations in the world.
Many visitors lead relatives who are ill or disabled and who come to swim in a spring cave where Bernadette had seen Mary, believing in the healing properties of water.
Thierry Castijo, one of the organizers, described this year's gathering as "a little unusual" in view of "the threat as the roots seem to lie in France."
However, he claimed that this would not affect the quality and depth of their experiences.
François, a 58-year-old volunteer who helped sick pilgrims, admitted that in her opinion the presence of soldiers dressed in civil clothing was "a little depressing."
However, if it calms everyone down, it is good.
Saragosa shopping center shoots two wounded
Two people were seriously injured after a man fired in a shopping center in Zaragoza, northeastern Spain.
The incident took place at 11 a.m. on Friday morning at the full Aragonia shopping center in Zaragoza.
Preliminary reports show that the shooter might have shot a woman who might have been his former partner.
After the shooting, the armed criminal fled, and now the police are looking for him.

The opening of the waterfowl hunting season is approaching.
Each year the waterbird hunting season is opened on the second Saturday of August.
This year it will begin at 16:00 on August 13, therefore the State Police invites both hunters and residents to be particularly careful and to comply with security regulations.
Hunting of waterbirds takes place not only in hunting grounds but also in public water bodies, and although weather conditions do not promise heat as for other years, it is acceptable that these water bodies will also be used by holidaymakers together with hunters.
Both hunters and holidaymakers and those living by watercourses are encouraged to be particularly careful in the vicinity of lakes and rivers and to comply with safety rules, thus not endangering themselves or others.
As in previous years it has been observed that during the first days of the season, a large number of hunters are involved in the hunting of waterbirds, the State Police in cooperation with the State Forest Service will also carry out enhanced hunting control this year.
Law enforcement will focus on compliance of movement of weapons and ammunition with the law, as well as will ensure that hunting takes place without the influence of alcoholic beverages and intoxicating substances.
The police recall that the use of semi-automatic firearms with a total capacity of more than three patrons during waterfowl hunting is prohibited, including by drawing attention to amendments to the Law on the movement of weapons and special equipment, in particular Article 22 (91), which states that persons with long firearms or high-energy pneumatic weapons registered for hunting or sports, and during short stops for up to two hours when they are transported to or from hunting, have the right to keep the weapon and ammunition in the vehicle during hunting, but must be placed as safely as possible, so that the futral or other packaging containing ammunition or weapons is not visible from the outside of the vehicle, placed behind locked doors and fitted with an alarm device to ensure that they do not accidentally enter the hands of outsiders.
The police call for the safety of their own and their fellows during the hunting season and, if you make any offences or threats to security, we invite you to immediately report by calling 110.
In the event of any threat, the law enforcement authorities are ready to respond to the information provided by citizens.
The coast of New Caledonia is shaken by an earthquake of 7.2
On Friday, the coast of New Caledonia was shaken by an earthquake of 7.2 magnitudes, reported by seismologists, pointing out that there was no tsunami threat.
The earthquake epicentre was located at a depth of nine kilometres 109 kilometers east of New Caledonia at 1.26 Greenwich time (4.26 p.m. Latvian time), announced the U.S. Geological Research Centre.
The Pacific Cunami Alert Centre indicated that there are currently no warnings or recommendations in relation to the potential threat of tsunamis to the region.
"The landraces in this region, as is known, are not unusual, nor are activities recently unusual", said Senior seismologist Phil Camins of the research centre "Geoscience Australia".
It could potentially be felt on the islands of Vanuatu or New Caledonia, but I doubt that it is so powerful as to cause damage.
New Caledonia is located in "Fire Circle" - the area of Pacific tectonic activity, where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur frequently.
Colombia and Venezuela agree to open the border.
Colombia and Venezuela agreed to open checkpoints on the border between the two countries, which were closed on Venezuela's initiative a year ago, on Thursday by President Juan Manuel Santos and Nicholas Maduro of Colombia and Venezuela.
Initially, border points will be open only for pedestrians.
Starting from Saturday, five border points will be opened every day from 8 to 20.
It will be possible to open the border to transport after certain international agreements on security, trade and energy have been concluded, the Presidents indicated.
Last August, Maduro ordered the closure of the border in response to the attack by Colombian fighters on the Venezuelan border Patrol.
Three Venezuelan soldiers were injured in this attack.
This July, Venezuela unilaterally opened the border twice as a result of the sharp economic crisis: the venesques in poverty tried to break through the border in order to buy essential goods in border stores.
200 000 Venezuelan citizens took advantage of this opportunity.
This time it is time for our one of Latvia's prides, the sympathetic Madara Palameika.
Madara Palameika was born 18 June 1987 in Talsi.
She is a Latvian athlete who competes in spear casting competitions.
Her coach is Father Gint Palameick.
Latvia's record spear thrower.
Participated in the 2012 Summer Olympics, participated several times in the World and European Championships (the 4th place in the 2014 European Championship), won 3rd place in the 2015 Diamond League overall.
"Facebook" announces the fight against the blockers.
The most popular social network in the world, Facebook, has broadcast a kind of warning shot, suggesting that blocking advertising banners using special tools is unacceptable and that users will also have to watch ads.
The popularity of special-purpose blockers is increasing, but this means that companies whose main source of income is advertising are decreasing.
Facebook has now announced that it understands the annoying nature of advertising banners, but users will have to live with them anyway.
True, they will be provided with tools to be able to choose for themselves what type of material is being shown to them, reports the BBC.
"As we provide more and more control options for people, we will also start to show ads to those who use advertising lock-in software", said Andrew Bosworth, Vice-President of the Business of Facebook ads.
In other words, users will be able to choose what type of ads they see by selecting brands and industries that they find interesting.
"People don't like to see ads that don't apply to them or interfere with the content," said Bosworth.
Advertising blocking tools on mobile devices usually do not work, from which Facebook derives the biggest visit, but their reduction in banner exposure is also measured in billions of money.
According to the BBC, advertising blockers are used by around 200 million people.
As reported earlier in the quarter of the business year, Facebook's advertising revenues were USD 6.2 billion or EUR 5.55 billion.
It has to be said that this is not the first time Facebook has been actively involved in determining what network users see in their news streams.
As one of the last steps, Facebook has just started to take action to remove or at least limit from the news streams the headlines behind which are actually "empty" messages.
At night in Brivibas Street will perform asphalting works; traffic restrictions must be taken into account.
This night, asphalt installation works will be carried out on Brīvības Street from Bērzaunes Street to Gustavs Zemgala Gatve, thus drivers have to take into account limited traffic in this section of the street.
As the agency LETA learned in Riga City Council, traffic restrictions in this stage will start tonight from 21 AM and asphalting works will last until 12 PM7.
Traffic towards Juglu will be redirected along tram tracks.
Drivers have to take into account limited traffic at this stage and additional travelling time.
The municipality calls for understanding of the restrictions introduced and for compliance with traffic organization procedures.
The renovation started on the main streets of the capital city - Brīvības Street from Raina Boulevard to Lāčplēša Street and from the Air Bridge to Juglas Street, Lāčplēša Street from Salu Bridge to Avotu Street, Juglas Street from Klūle to Maliena Street and Lielvārdes Street from Dzelzavas Street to 84.vidusskola.
The construction works will last until the new beginning of the school year, and they are organized continuously, also during night hours, when mainly asphalt laying is carried out.
Medvedev Deputy in Riga secretly met several ministers of the ZZS.
Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev Arkady Dvorkovics has secretly met three ministers of the Greens and Farmers Union (ZZS) in a fish processing factory during his visit to Riga last week.
The informal meeting took place in the factory "Kaija", and the Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola, Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis and Minister of Agriculture Jānis Dūklavs have participated in it.
The fact that such a meeting took place was confirmed to the portal by Reizniece-Ozola.
She explained that during the meeting she was talking about lifting sanctions for fish processors as well as about Inčukalns gas storage.
Contrary to diplomatic practice, the meeting was held without involvement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The meeting was organized by the Russian Ambassador Alexander Vesnyakov.
The suspicion of more than €130 000 embezzlement is held by the accountant.
The State Police (SP) Economic Crimes Prevention Board (ENAP) has detained an accountant who has worked in the company for 20 years for 130 thousand embezzlements from one of the commercial companies of Riga this month, and Gita Gžibovska, the representative of the VP informed the agency BNS.
Current information shows that the suspected woman has committed illegal activities for several years and has, together, caused more than €130,000 to the company.
Given that the company's officials had not followed the cash flow closely and trusted their employee, they only learned about the machinations that were taking place several years later.
VP ENAP police arrested the suspect woman born in 1963 this month and carried out searches at the company.
Criminal proceedings for misappropriation, if committed to a large extent, have been initiated in relation to the incident.
For such a crime the law provides for deprivation of liberty for up to ten years, confiscating property or without confiscation of property.
The detained person is currently subject to a security measure that does not involve deprivation of liberty.
In Estonia antibodies to Zika virus were detected in nine people.
In Estonia, nine people have been tested for antibodies to Zika’s virus, which means that they may have been exposed to this infection, says the Estonian public broadcaster ERR.
According to the information provided by the laboratory, 121 samples were tested for Zika virus this year and nine of them were positive.
The first cases of Zika have been reported in Finland and Sweden in neighbouring countries of Estonia.
According to the Estonian Health Authority, no case of acute Zika virus infection has been recorded in the country and people do not need to test Zika virus in case of flu-like symptoms, but they should contact their family doctor.
We have found IgG (immunoglobulin G) antibodies that show that the subject is infected with Zika or a similar virus at some point.
"This does not mean that the patient has contracted Zika virus", explained Paul Naber, head of the infectious diseases department of the laboratory "Synlab".
Zika's virus is transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus Aedes.
Latvia has a problem with the development of high-quality car procurement, in an interview with BNS, said Ingus Rūtiņš, Vice-President of the Auto Association.
Whether the car industry has problems with dumped prices in its purchases, Mr. Rūtiņš replied in the affirmative.
Sure.
Car purchases, however, differ from service purchases where it is easier to manipulate prices.
In any case, the car must ultimately pay a certain amount because it has to be purchased from the manufacturer.
However, the problem is and can be classified into two groups.
Either the advertiser is incompetent and does not know how to create quality procurement, which often leads to "buy" without being aware of it.
"Well, very conscious procurement is being built to get something concrete, and there are all kinds of miracles," said the vice president of the Auto Association.
He pointed out that it is now popular to talk about moving away from the lowest bid to the most economically advantageous bid as a criterion for determining the winner of the procurement, but some of the public still have a misconception about these things.
Now it is very popular - let us go from the lowest price to the most economically advantageous offer!
However, the criteria must be established in both cases and, when they are taken into account and assessed, the decision is still taken on the basis of the lowest price.
In qualitative procurement, the technical criteria should be very precise and market-conform.
The points, on the other hand, do not mean anything that can be expressed in monetary terms.
Points should not be used to assess fuel consumption, emissions, service services and similar things.
You need to know the life cycle of the car, mileage, etc., then you can simply count everything together.
"The question then is only about which of the scenarios is interested in the customer himself?" explained Rūtiņš.
In turn, the project manager of the Auto Association Pēteris Rubulis noted that problems are related to the fact that often the same person creates purchases for cars, work gloves and food, and these purchases are derived from one model.
We have also been brought to the consultation for a model of procurement for spare parts, which, otherwise than a detailed absurdity, were difficult to describe.
"The problem is that the purchaser very often lacks any understanding of the subject matter of the procurement and the requirements are simply copied from somewhere", said Rubulis.
Rūtiņš added that the smaller the structure that announces procurement, the more problems tend to be.
"Of course it's precisely because there is a lack of human resources and expertise," said the vice president of the Associations.
Latvian volleyball players do not get up to the fight for medals.

Look at the photo of the festival market in Esplanade.
Die Antwoord is accused of stealing style.
On Thursday, the South African group Die Antwoord accused the film director Suicide Sqaud of using the group's unique appearance without permission, calling the respected director the "little frightened bitch".
The band's leading singer, Jolandi, in the mobile app "Instagram", has turned to the film studio "Warner Bros" director, saying, "That's exactly what David Ajer, you steal our style."
As she claims, the film stars Karas Delavinja and Jared Leto said that Ayer was impressed by Die Antwoord in the film field.
"But you didn't ask for permission to cheat us," said the singer.
A 31-year-old musician says that her group member Ninja has texted this question to Ayer, but he "never answered like a little frightened bitch."
Jolandi insists that Ayer has captured the scenes from the introduction to the 2011 Umshini Wam short film showing the South African hip hop duet.
She has also published a video that allegedly proves that Ayer's characters, Joker and Harley Quinn, have been removed from the appearance of both singers.
Letto himself insists that the image of the inspiring Joker is based on the image of rock musician David Bowley.
Jolandi has finally voted in favour of the harsh assessment of critics, which the film earned after the premiere.
Jolandi and Ninja, in the real words Henri du Tuata and Watkins Tudor Jones, gained fame with three rap studio records, promoting African Zef counterculture.

Melody's aglow, the special guitar sound, the irreproachable string vibrato, the long-lined interplay and the ensemble's feelings are the characteristics of why Rozenbergs have invited Randy Kraudorde, Lučāno Pavaroti, Shirley Bay and other world celebrities to join in their concerts.

Turkey seeks missing diplomats after the coup attempt
Turkey is looking for at least 32 diplomats who, after the coup attempt of 15 July, did not return with the withdrawn staff.
On Friday, Foreign Minister Mevits Cavušags said that 208 officials from the Turkish Ministry were withdrawn from the jobs around the world to Ankara during the coup investigation, and 32 have disappeared "without permission".
Some 18 000 civilians, military leaders and academics have been arrested or withdrawn from their positions in Turkey, considering them loyal to the U.S. official Fetulla Gulen, whom he accuses in the drafting of a government's electoral plan.
Gulens, who lives in Pennsylvania, is on the list of the most sought-after people in Turkey.
Kavosoglu said that the team of the U.S. Department of Justice will visit Turkey later this month to discuss his possible extradition.
This issue has become a problem in the US relations with Turkey, a NATO member state.
The United States opposed the tactics of the strong armament of Turkish President Regep Tayip Erdogan after the coup, and Turkey responded by seeking closer ties with Russia.
Kavosoglu said that the Turkish military attachés in Greece had fled to Italy, the attaché in Kuwait tried to escape to Saudi Arabia, but was sent back, and two generals from Afghanistan were caught in Dubai and sent to Turkey.
He also said that two officials fled to New York in Bangladesh, and one of Russia went to Japan.
Ankara's Daily Hurryiet newspaper, citing military sources, reported that Turkey's military attaché in Jordan was also missing.
The Wall Street Journal, citing a US official who is aware of this situation, reported that a Turkish military officer based in Virginia has applied for asylum in the United States.
There are those who have managed to escape.
There have been refugees among our diplomats, too," said the broadcaster NTV in an interview with Kavosoglu.
Since yesterday, time has come to an end for those who were originally withdrawn.
We will take legal action against those who did not return.
The organizers of the Olympic Games try to clean the greenish diving pool
The Olympic divers, who were scheduled for training on Friday, came to a closed pool because the organizers needed more time to clean the green - colored water before the first individual race at the Rio Olympics.
Water suddenly changed the color of Tuesday, synchronized diving in the middle of the race.
The organisers claimed that even after the larger pool for polo and synchronized swimming, the water race was safe, and it also stained lightly greenish.
Diving was not possible yet, when athletes arrived to warm up in the morning, although finally the pool was opened at 13.00 local time - only 2 1/2 hours before women 3 meters competition.
The color of the water looked closer to its usual color, but still with a greenish tint.
The American divers Abby Johnson, who competes on a trampoline, told her that she came to warm up just to find out that the pool was closed without any warning.
His twitter wrote that "#FixTheSwamp (repair the swamp) should be fashionable.
The British diver Tom Dalley, who won bronze in the synchronous diving of the platform, also commented on the condition of the pool in the Twitter record.
Hopefully, this means that we have not dived in the last few days as very bad!
Mario Andrad, the chief spokesman of the local committee of organizers, stressed that the pool for the races is safe, giving the green light to the 3 meters foreplay.
He agreed that some athletes were disturbed by water, but he said that it was the result of the cleaning efforts.
"We repeat again what we have said all the time--water in no way endangers the health of athletes," he said.
On the first day of such a water situation, one or two athletes complained that they had no eyes.
It was the result that the first reaction, when we saw water becoming green, was to use one of the chemicals - chlorine - it is used very often in swimming pools.
We reduced the quantity immediately.
We checked the water again, and that was perfectly in line with the parameters.
Simon Lengford, the chief spokesman of the Marija Lenka Water Sport Centre, said that the pool was closed for additional cleaning work.
He said that the decision was supported by the world's leading organisation, FINA (International Swimming Federation).
"The reason is that the water must be calm, so that the pool can get back to its blue color as soon as possible," Lengford said in his statement.
Andrada said that the deterioration of the basin had surprised the organizers without preparation.
"China is not an accurate science," he said.
Some things, as you can see, lasted.
Over the last few days, getting the paint of rain water in its normal state made it even more difficult.
"There's nothing to help," Andrada said.
He added that in the morning athletes had access to dry workouts, but admitted that it "was not perfect."
He explained that the change in colour of the pool was due to increased alkalin levels, as water from the aquarium may become green if not properly monitored.
When we started to do something about green paint, there was a discussion about the best chemicals.
We can't use too much chemicals in water, because athletes train in it," Andrada said.
We could certainly have done better at the beginning to prevent water from becoming green.
When it got green, we made a mistake again.
AP sports explorers Jay Koen and Steve Wade in Rio de Janeiro took part in the process.
Shanghai, Taipei, despite the cross-border suspension of communication, will nevertheless hold a forum
However, Shanghai and Taipei will host the annual city forum from 22 to 23 August in Taipei, announced by the Shanghai Municipality on Friday, despite the suspension of cross-border communication mechanisms.
High-level municipal official on behalf of Chailin Shanghai Mayor Jang Xionga will lead the delegation represented in the forum, announced the Shanghai Government in its official microblog account in Sina Weibo.
Both cities have been holding the Forum on a rotational basis since 2010.
The 2016 Forum will focus on the exchange of experience in areas such as health, electronic administrative services, culture and transport, seeking "to deepen the exchange of experience and cooperation in various aspects" between the two cities, as reported by the Shanghai Government.
The Taiwanese side has not recognised the 1992 agreement that strengthened the principle of one China since the new leader Tsai Ing-ven took office in May, which has resulted in the suspension of communication and consultation mechanisms.
Ma Ksiaoguang, the State Spokesman of the State Council of the Taiwanese Affairs Office on dry land, said on Friday that peaceful cross-border relations can exist while the Taiwanese side keeps to the political foundations of the 1992 agreement.
"We have an active and open attitude towards the exchange of experiences between cities on both sides," said MA stressing that the essence of cross-border relations and exchange of experience between cities should be interpreted correctly.
Ugandan President meets the Chinese Foreign Minister, looks forward to closer cooperation
On Thursday, in his meeting with China's Foreign Minister, Mr Vanga Ji, President of Uganda, Mr Joveri Museveni thanked China for its long-standing Ugandan development aid and expressed his hope for closer cooperation.
Museveni said that China is an old friend of Uganda and Africa, who supported the release of the African continent from colonialism and later supported the economic and social development of Africa.
The President mentioned the construction of the Zambian railway in the 1970s as proof of China's generous support, even when China itself was not very prosperous.
Museveni said that China has engaged in multilateral cooperation with Uganda through both investment in infrastructure and business and cultural exchanges, and added that this kind of cooperation contributes to the long-term development of Uganda more than simply financial assistance.
He hopes that China will be able to engage in various ways in the development of Uganda's infrastructure and the construction of industrial parks.
He also calls on the Chinese to invest more in Uganda and to travel around it.
Wang Ji commended Uganda's performance in the areas of industrialisation and agricultural modernisation and added that China would continue to be the most reliable and ideal partner of Uganda's cooperation.
Wang stated that China is ready to do everything possible to help implement Uganda's economic and social development and added that cooperation between China and Uganda is genuine and without any political considerations, because it is based on high-level political credibility and established friendship over time.
He said that China could strengthen cooperation with Uganda in the construction of infrastructure and industrial parks, as well as support the development of the energy and agricultural sectors of this East African people.
