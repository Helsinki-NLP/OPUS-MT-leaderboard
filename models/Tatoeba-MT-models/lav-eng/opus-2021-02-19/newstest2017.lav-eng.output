28-year-old cook found dead in San Francisco Supermarket
This week, a 28-year-old chef was found in the staircase of a supermarket who recently moved to San Francisco.
But the victim's brother says he can't imagine anyone who wants to hurt his brother, saying, "His life finally started to improve."
The body, found on Wednesday at Westfield supermarket, was identified as a 28-year-old San Francisco resident, Frank Galicia, said a representative of the San Francisco Medical Examination Office.
The San Francisco police stated that his death was recognised as a murder and that an investigation is under way.
The victim's brother, Luis Galicia, tells the ABC KGO station in San Francisco that Frank had previously worked as a cook in Boston, but six months ago he got his dream job in the restaurant Sons & Daughters in San Francisco.
The representative of Sons & Daughters informs that the news of his death shocked them and shocked them.
"We are a small team working as a united family and we're going to miss him very much", said the representative.
In these difficult times, we think with Frank's friends and family.
Louis Galicia says that Frank first stayed in the hostels, but lately life has improved.
"He went into a new apartment and met a girl," Louis tells radio station KGO.
Louis Galicia says he doesn't know who wants to hurt his younger brother.
He was a good man with a wide heart.
"He always spoiled his family by preparing a delicious meal and preparing lunch", said Louis Galicia
He never wanted to be involved in a dispute.
He was the brother who adapted to the others.
"Taking into account everything that went wrong in the world, he was like a rough diamond that glowed brightly every day," he says.
Anyone who has information about what happened is invited to call SFPD Information phone 415-575-4444.
New medical strike: invites to new protests
The representatives of the new doctors demand that their trade unions take up protests in the dispute over the new treaty.
The Committee of Young Doctors (JAK) of the British Medical Association (ALA) is preparing to request a Council to support wider protests at the beginning of September.
JAK considers that ministers have failed to dispel the doubts about the Treaty.
In July, new doctors and medical students rejected the contract offered by the AAL.
58 % of the members who voted against the Treaty voted against.
In the message published on Twitter on Thursday evening, Ellen McKort, a member of the JAK Council, points out that the government continues to remain silent on this issue and therefore the contract offer has been rejected.
She said: "In view of this, as a result of the JAK vote, the contract offer has been completely rejected and the decision has been taken to request new formal negotiations to discuss the most important issues."
In response to the silence of the government, JAK has today formally requested a meeting with the Council of the AAL to authorise the development of new contracts, which will enter into force in September.
As a result of the dispute, the new doctors took part in six strikes, including for the first time in the history of the NHS.
After the vote, which rejected the contractual terms proposed by the AAL and recommended by the BMA, Dr. Johan Malawi, the new medical representative of the AMA, resigned.
Before meeting 54,000 new doctors and medical students, he had told BMA members that the offer was good and would be accepted.
After the vote, the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, informed us that the contract would be concluded with English medical staff.
Russia and Turkey: An alliance excluded?
The gesture that brought an end to the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to break and announce eight months of name and economic sanctions at the end of the war.
However, Vladimir Putin’s greeting with the Turkish leader at St. Petersburg’s Palace gave the impression that this partnership was more necessary for Ankara.
However, they both knuckled.
Vladimir Putin’s smile looked dazzled and did not cause warm emotions, even considering his usual self - control.
On the other hand, Ranger Tajyp Erdogan named Putin his "Dear Friend" at least five times, says a review of the meeting.
I lost my count.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only improve to pre-crisis levels, but would become even stronger.
The next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan behaved as if nothing had happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm gives rise to conflicting feelings.
But the glowing coolness of Putin shows that the Russian leader has forgotten nothing.
The first thing he mentioned in his speech was the shooting down of a Russian aircraft on the Syrian border.
At that time, Moscow reacted harshly.
Putin accused Ankara of stabing the dagger on the back of Moscow.
The transfiguration was even more painful, considering that it came from a friend’s side.
Restoring true trust will be very difficult, perhaps impossible.
Russia's public position has changed since November.
For several months, government - controlled television spread aggressive accusations against Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that the Turks were guilty of everything.
The most serious were the allegations that the Erdogan family itself made profits from the illicit trade in oil with the Islamic State-controlled Syrian part.
He himself, of course, denied it.
But the main message of the St. Petersburg meeting is that it is time to forget the past.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received President Erdogan's apology.
Russia could see it as a kind of victory.
Ankara's benefit from peace reconciliation is obvious.
First of all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after the failed coup last month in which he was tried to be overthrowded.
His position has also been shaken by countless terrorist attacks.
The same is true of economic motives.
Russian sanctions have caused profound damage, especially the charter ban, which usually provides for the influx of millions of Russian tourists into Turkish resorts every year.
The number of tourists dropped by almost 90%.
Russian tour operators and charter companies will also breathe in with relief when regular flights are renewed.
They are hoping for a holiday fever in the Mediterranean in the end of the season.
Already this week, national TV predicts a drop in the price of fruit and vegetables, as imports of Turkish fruit and vegetables will be restored.
As the local newspaper Vedemosti quotes, "Tourists for them, tomatoes for us."
However, the visit also had other political motives on the part of Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for, in their opinion, a weak reaction to the attempted coup.
It is also possible to look at the dissatisfaction with the long-standing negotiations on EU accession and Putin's intervention, who is willing to take advantage of the situation that Turkey is alienated from the West.
The Russian leader undoubtedly obtained additional points in the eyes of Ankara, expressing his support for its elected government after the coup attempt.
Note that Moscow understands this well, because itself is deeply rooted in fear of regime change in the country.
The summit, which took place in this luxurious seaside palace, gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present what an analyst, an "disadvantaged alliance" called it, the two countries that feel excluded from the West join forces.
However, despite the publicly demonstrated unity, there are still considerable differences of opinion between the two countries.
The main differences concern Syria, where Russia presents itself as a peacemaker, but in fact Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
After more than three hours of initial negotiations, the two presidents announced at the press conference that they had not discussed the matter without wishing to disclose the information.
The President of Turkey was determined to avoid issues of disagreement between the two countries, while President Putin wanted to highlight them.
There is no clear consensus on how both countries could find a common language for Syria.
However, after months of openly hostile relations and potential disaster, when a NATO member Turkey hit a Russian battle plane, the situation has improved, as both leaders have at least resumed negotiations.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland
In future, SKB will play a supporting role by notifying the Bank’s Executive Director.
Outside Scotland, SKB will no longer be available.
Ross Makewan tells the BBC channel in Scotland that the brand of SKB was associated with the bank's ambitions on a global scale.
It has abandoned these ambitions because eight years ago the bank almost went bankrupt and needed financial assistance.
Meanwhile, branding strategy experts have used the SKB brand to protect other consumer financial brands.
The bank received millions of pounds from international sports sponsors, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon tennis champion Andy Murray.
However, it has now been decided to put other national brands at the forefront.
The Scottish Royal Banak will be available to Scottish customers, but it will not be initialised.
In England and Wales, all references of SKB, outside the head office and official stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Smaller private financial brands, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank, will now also be taken into account.
Makevan was interviewed during the trip with clients and employees through Invernesshirs.
He told the BBC to the Scotland Canal: "SKB will become our investor brand and with which our employees work, because now we become more a brand bank."
In time, the bank itself became a global brand and SKB became a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have global ambitions, we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in their industry and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
SKB has already announced that it will not continue sponsoring the Six Nations and will involve various brands in sports sponsorship.
"It is time to become a brand bank, because we have long asked ourselves how to become a better bank for our customers?" says the executive director.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical if we announced that we would become a great bank for our customers and develop these brands.
However, thanks to hard work and focusing on the needs of our customers, and not on our own, we have obviously made major changes.
We can revive these brands again, so I think that is the time now.
Frankie Detori wins 3000, winning first place in New Market with horse Predition
Detors uncampaign the champagne, winning their 3000. The first race in New Market is completed twice.
On Friday, Jackie Frankie Detori won his 3,000th victory in Britain’s history, winning first place in Newmarket.
He achieved it by winning the second victory in this race, which took place in his native city, riding with Predition, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth Jackey who has achieved this result in horse sprinting.
He has joined Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Pigot, Pete Edder and Willy Carson.
The three-time champion, Jackey Detori, who before that won with the horse Ghayyar, said, "It's something special."
I'm very moved because my family is here.
I'm very happy that this happened in New Market, because I've been living here for 30 years.
This is not a big race, this is not King Ascott, but a normal Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I feel relieved and very grateful.
After the victory Detori and Predition are welcomed with applause and cheer.
Two jockeys have reached this record in the race with obstacles - the champion Richard Johnson and the 20-time champion of his career, Sir Antony McKoy, who has set several records in his career, won over 4300 victories.
Lester Pigot, nine-time derbian winner, won 4493 wins during his career.
Frankie is one of today's best jockeys and it's not surprising that he has achieved something that few can achieve.
He is stylish and powerful, but his sense of tactics distinguishes him from other jockeys.
He is a fantastic racing representative, his enthusiasm and charisma years of attracting fans to this sport.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie that he would have won 6,000 if he had not participated only in the weekends and the big race.
To be serious, however, it is a real pleasure that Frankie has been winning the UK race regularly for 30 years.
He's happy, and he's great at the British race, and he's a great jockey.
Frank Detori noted this achievement with his brand - flying jump.
From finishing at wind speed to flying jump, Frankie Detori has been a British horse racing face for twenty years.
This has been a journey full of adventures.
He has won countless big races, including the famous 1996 Great Seventh in Ascott, and has also survived the plane crash and disqualification for the use of preparations.
Three years ago he found it difficult to return after six months of disqualification, but he demonstrated his power of character by challenging those who questioned him by returning to his best form.
And he could take part in the race for another time - Detori has previously said that he would like to continue to participate in the race until at least 50 years of age.
President Putin releases Head of Administration Sergey Ivanovo
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly released the head of the administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been among the closest people to Putin for many years.
The 63-year-old politician has now been appointed Special Representative for Nature and Transport.
The Kremlin's statement states that Putin "decided to release Ivanov from the duties of head of the Russian President's administration", without mentioning the reason.
He has been appointed Deputy to the post of Ivanov Anton Vaino since 2012.
The 44-year-old Vaino is a diplomat.
Vaino was born in 1972 in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MVSAI) and later worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
According to the Kremlin's website (in Russian), later he led the President's minutes and government administration.
After being appointed, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
In my opinion, the main task of the administration is to support your work as President of the State by drafting laws and controlling the implementation of your decisions.
On Friday, Putin told a Russian broadcaster that Ivanov himself wanted to leave his office and recommended Vaino as his substitute.
Do smiles convince you?
This step has confused Moscow.
Sergey Ivanov is an old and close ally of Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, worked in the Soviet security service of the KGB.
In this position he was one of the most influential men in Russia.
At the state television broadcast session, both men announced that Ivanov resigned on his own initiative.
But despite the smiles directed at the cameras, rarely such an explanation convinces, especially before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of a struggle for power?
Nobody knows that.
However, the official statement that the man, who was considered a potential president, suddenly wanted to be the leader of Russia's environmental policy, is perceived with great scepticism.
In the notes published on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov says to Putin: "It is the fact that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to entrust me with this difficult post, I could even say the problematic post, for four years.
It turns out that I have been in this position for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Formerly Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB National Security Service, as well as Putin.
In the late 1990s Putin headed the Federal Security Service, the successor to the KGB, Ivanov held the post of deputy to him.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusted most.
At the end of Putin's second term, Ivanov was considered a potential candidate for the post of President of Russia, as Putin's re-election to the third term would be unconstitutional.
But then another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev, became president.
Putin became Prime Minister, and after three and a half years he returned to the office of President.
The appearance of wild fish in a garden in the town of Banfa
A husband in Banfa asks for help to find out the circumstances of a species in his garden in Banfa.
Kevin Bane thinks that 75 fish could be sand eels that have arrived with the water room.
Mr. Bane, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, published a fish video on the Periscope website in the hope that someone could know how these five centimetres of fish were caught in his garden.
Queensphery crossroads: The bridge is now connected to the Faif.
At the moment, the GBP 1.35 billion project is expected to be completed in May 2017.
The engineers have connected the northern part of the Queensphery junction with the viaduct, which means that the bridge is now connected to the Faif.
The first of the four connecting parts is complete, which means that the construction of the bridge is coming to an end.
The structure of the faifa bridge is 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It consists of 10 000 tonnes of steel, 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 supporting cables.
The currently GBP 1.35 billion project is expected to be completed in May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keit Brown had come to the construction site today and was one of the first to climb on the bridge.
He said, "This is a symbolic and historic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Bridge."
In this project, we see an unparalleled engineering solution, where only the construction of this part uses more than 30 000 tonnes of cement and steel.
Despite the huge weight and size of the bridge, connecting the bridge with the viaduct is an extremely delicate process that requires enormous precision.
In total, more than 79% of the bridge deck has already been built and the last section that will connect the bridge with Rosita will be included today, which means that all parts of the bridge are ready for laying.
Michael Martins, Director of the Fourth Bridge Connection Project, says: "The first connection is a very important point in the construction of any bridge."
In this fantastic project, the first connection demonstrates top-class engineering.
After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the support of the northern tower, we were left to connect the northern section of the road with the part of the land, or viaduct.
This was done by moving the part of the viaduct of the northern accessway 700 millimetres south.
It was a huge and, at the same time, very delicate operation.
Huge, because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled at an angle of about 3%.
A delicate, because the tolerance in both directions with which the team worked was just a few millimetres.
Fortunately, everything went well.
Simón Bails is getting gold in gymnastics for women.
Forget the tension.
Forget the excitement.
Simón Bailes doesn't worry about it all.
Dynamic jumps.
I don't have any effort to do exercises on a log.
Unsurpassed on the floor.
Absolutely perfect.
And finally the Olympic champion.
On Thursday, an 19 - year - old American gymnast won a gold medal, demonstrating the complete difference between himself and the rest of the world on the Olympic stage.
Her total score of 62,198 was above the silver medal winner and her team member Aly Raismane and the bronze medal winner Aly Mustafin, Russian sportsman Aly Mustafin.
On Thursday, US athlete Simona Bailsa performed an exercise on a log gymnastics individual multi-fight final for women at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Bailsa became the fourth American in a row, who won the championship title and the fifth best gymnast, gradually strengthening his reputation as the best gymnast of his generation and perhaps the best gymnast in history.
When the end result was announced, she burst into tears, for the long journey to that point was over.
This achievement ranks him next to such unparalleled athletes as Michael Phelps, who raised his sports on a different level.
For the last three years, Bailsa has dominated her sport by obtaining 15 medals at the World Championships, including 10 gold medals, performing such excellent, precise and ambitious combinations of exercises that Mary Lu Røtte, the 1984 Olympic Champion, called her "the best gymnast she ever saw".
In Brazil, she was faced with the final test, where she had to compete to a large extent with the expectations placed on her rather than with other sportsmen.
She would be disappointed if she returned to her home in Spring, Texas, without gold medals.
The U.S. athlete Simona Bailsa (left) and Aly Raismane hug after winning a gold and silver medal in the individual multi-fight final for women at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which took place on Thursday.
The first gold medal was won by Bailsa on Tuesday, making a special selection coordinator Martas Karolji farewell party.
Although Bailes claims that he had not waited for anything like that on his long journey to the peaks of fame, it is not true.
Part of her performance in free movement, which includes her special acrobatics transition, is accompanied by Latin music that fits perfectly on the street next to the Rio Olympic arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl who was adopted by her grandparents, when she was still an infant, and who was discovered by the mother of coach Amy Bourman on a tour to the gym, where the Būrmane's penthouses were held, has now become a force to take into account.
She has not lost in the multi-fight race since the summer of 2013 and the winning series can continue as long as Bails wants it.
Although Mustafin took a little lead during two rotations, it was just an illusion.
The balance beam and free movement - the part of the race where Bails will defend his champion's title is still ahead.
She advanced with a score of 15,433 on the beam and strengthened the management with a result of 15,933 free movement
The Raismane gently hugged her while they waited for the results, which was only a formality and she burst into tears of joy when the dream that she had once written in her notebook came true.
Raismane’s result was a slight retaliation for four-year-old events, when she shared third place with Mustafin, but lost the fight for the bronze medal.
This time, a 22-year-old team captain called the American "grandmammary" came up with strong leadership.
After performance in free movement, which dispelled doubts about her return, she was able to devote air kisses to the crowd.
Meanwhile, the 19-year-old Bails' virtual Twitter recording r, which she published this week, now has a completely different meaning.
Six-year-old Mahay Brown's "loose-holed" lives in a gun in Philadelphia.
The police say that a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, pointing out that he is already the second six-year-old to be shot in Philadelphia this week.
Grandparents of the child confirmed to the news channel CBS Philadelphia that it was Mahay Brown.
Grandparents say that Brown was shot several times, including in the groin, leg, arm, and stomach, but was still conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
His grandmother Delorez Melendez tells television: "His little body was simply bullet-holed."
I can't believe it.
The boy in a critical state is placed in a hospital and has already undergone several surgeries.
The family reports that he will certainly recover.
He had to start at the first class in the local primary school.
Brown is one of the four people shot in the town of Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two 29 - year - old men and one 32 - year - old man.
CBS Philadelphia reports that one of the 29 - year - old men is in a critical position, while the remaining two victims are in a stable position.
The channel says that the child was found in the front seat of the car next to the 29 - year - old victim in a critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car, and the police were investigating whether any of them was an attacker.
The investigator told CBS Philadelphia that more than one shooter was likely involved in the shooting.
There have been found rounds of gun shells in place of the event, belonging to various weapons.
Looks like it's been a long fire.
Shells have been found on both sides of the pedestrian sidewalk.
"So it looks like there have been several armed shooters who have actively participated in the shooting," says Antony Ginaldi, the captain of Philadelphia police.
Damages have also been caused to several homes and cars.
No one has yet been apprehended and it is reported that the police are checking the camera records.
On Tuesday, a lost bullet hit a six - year - old girl in her hand while playing in front of her home in the Westowkin area.
She is gradually recovering, but the police are still looking for the culprit.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
I call it the Annual Women's Olympic Athlete Command for a number of reasons.
Firstly, I have been on all the summer Olympics since 1984, and the US team has never been so good.
Secondly, this team consists of three athletics, Simon Bails, Gabby Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, inspired by many young girls.
People can be proud that this team also includes Aly Raismane, a Jewish woman and Madison Cocian, who is a Catholic.
Finally, this team truly represents America.
It has also strengthened the participation of black and Latin American athletes in this sport.
For the past four years, the best gymnast is an American of African descent.
Last year Simone and Gabby took 1st and 2nd place.
These are impressive results.
In the previous Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas became the Olympic champion surprisingly, and America was able to rejoice.
Now the world has seen incredible exercises performed by the triple world champion Simon Bails, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, performing unprecedented but mastery exercises.
On Thursday, Simona became the fourth American in a row to win a gold medal for women.
Her teammate, Aly Raismane, won a silver medal.
We have seen the best that this sport can bring, but the situation in the rest of the country is completely different during the gymnastics hours.
Simón, Gaby, and Laurie were included in the Olympics, as were Allie and Madison.
They are "Olympical Five" because the next Olympic gymnastics team will have only four athletes, and this is the last year of the coach Martha Karola.
In fact, gymnastics are expensive sport. Gymnastics are mainly trained in private athletic clubs, and are supported by parents who pay for training, rooms, travel, uniforms, hotels (treeners, athletes and their families) and other expenses.
Most of these Athletics Clubs are located in urban areas that can afford this sport.
In these clubs athletes spend all of their workouts, and it is an expensive and long investment for an athletic family.
Amy Bourman - Simona Bailsa coach and Maggie Hainy - Laurie Hernandez coach have trained their athletes since both girls began to practice athletics.
We need to provide young girls who are inspired by Simona, Gabby and Laurie with cheaper exercise opportunities.
I founded my athletic organization 20 years ago.
My organisation is located in Harlem, and we offer more than 15 000 exercises for young people (mainly black and Spanish) free of charge or at low cost. We have also trained national and international champions.
In September we will open a branch in Detroit, my home city, to give local young people the opportunity to get to know this great sport.
Athletics develops strength, flexibility, and body coordination, as well as teaches hard work, discipline, and pursuit.
This combination provides a long life with good health and success both at school and at work.
This team will inspire thousands of young girls to train in athletics and it is fantastic.
It is very important to engage in this sport, especially for young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thank you Simona, Allie, Gabby and Madison for the excellent demonstration of the "Matians Force" by winning the gold medals of the Olympic Games and motivating countless young girls of different origins to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Following Jeremy Hunt’s rejection of the offer, the new doctors are planning more strikes.
The ministers hoped to put an end to the disagreement by agreeing to a change in the agreement with representatives of the British Medical Association, but it was rejected by 58 percent of the 37 000 new doctors who took part in the vote.
In July, Hunt announced plans to conclude a contract, indicating that NHS is in a fragile state and that further delays will only harm workers and patients.
The first new doctors have already signed the new contract, which provides for a change in the conditions of night shifts and weekends to improve working conditions during non-standard hours.
Yesterday evening, Dr. Ellen McCourt, the representative of the BMA Young Doctors, announced that young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it would exacerbate the labour crisis and it would not provide equal conditions for all doctors.
Eight weeks to the time when the first group of new doctors will sign the new agreement, so progress needs to be made as time is running out.
BMA's efforts to solve the problem through negotiation have been faced with the government's reluctance to engage and sometimes with complete silence.
This was despite the fact that Jeremy Hunt just last month said that his door was always open.
Jeremy Hunt must take immediate action, stop inaction and cooperate with new doctors.
If he doesn't, the new doctors are ready for new protests.
During the last strike, more than 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were postponed at the end of April, while nurses and counsellors tried to replace doctors who had gone in picket.
The ministers hoped to end the disagreement by reaching an agreement on changes to the agreement with the representatives of the British Medical Association.
BMA wants to raise the rate for working on weekends to 54 000 new doctors who would be covered by new contracts.
Daniel Mortimer, the NHS employment director, invited young doctors to avoid strikes.
Mr Mortimer explains that strikes do not solve anything, but only increase the pressure on the workers who are under pressure and worry, cause stress and delays for patients, carers and their families.
Over the last two months, we have talked to the new medical committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and other institutions, we have responded positively to their questions about guardians and whistleblowers.
Employers hope that active cooperation on other important issues, such as employee placement, flexible training, additional training for those returning after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of training programmes, leaving studies and gender pay inequality in medicine, shows that employers, English health education institutions and the Ministry of Health are seriously willing to implement the agreements concluded with BME in November, February and May.
Medicines of 2 pounds a day may reduce the risk of heart attack.
Thousands of patients who have had a heart attack may be treated with the medicine for up to 2 pounds a day, as official representatives recommend that they be used in more people and for longer periods.
Anti-clotting medicines Ticagrelor reduces the risk of recurrent heart attacks in people with heart disease.
This medicine is already prescribed for use 12 months after heart attack, reducing the risk of a relapse.
NICE, a member of the NHS, recommends the use of the product 4 years after heart attack to further reduce the risk of heart attack in people with cardiovascular problems.
However, currently NICE under NHS is recommended for 4 years after heart attack to further reduce cardiovascular risk.
Each year, about 140,000 people in England experience a heart attack and a quarter of them experience a recurrent heart attack or stroke.
Heart attack and stroke are caused by a build-up of fat in the walls of the heart leading to obstruction.
If the blockage breaks, it can cause a clot, blocking the flow of blood to the heart and causing a heart attack.
In turn, if a clot separates from the wall of the blood vessels, it can go further into the bloodstream and block blood access to the brain, causing a heart attack.
People who have had a heart attack are more at risk of having a relapse.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca, which is marketed under the name of Brilique, reduces the risk of blood clots forming.
New NICE guidelines, published today, recommend that people take 90 mg of Ticagrelor for 12 months and another 3 years of 60 mg twice daily with aspirin.
Professor Carol Longson, director of NICE Health Technology, explains: "Despite the availability of medicines to prevent repeated heart attacks, more than a quarter of people who have had a heart attack experience another heart attack or stroke, often with severe consequences."
Fear of repeated heart attacks can have a negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
Evidence suggests that Ticagrelor, in combination with aspirin, is effective in reducing the risk of recurrent heart attack and heart attack in people who have experienced it.
By provisionally recommending treatment with Ticagrelor, we are glad that we can expand the treatment options for thousands of people, who are thus the winners.
In view of the limited information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor, in particular the risk of bleeding when used for more than three years, the draft guideline does not recommend its use beyond this time limit.
A culture of political correctness promotes electoral fraud in Muslim communities
According to a report by the leadership, Lutfur Rahman, former mayor of the town of Tauerhamlet, was dismissed from office for corruption.
The government report reveals that a culture of political correctness turns a blind eye to large-scale fraud in Muslim communities.
Former government minister Sir Erik Pickl criticises the police, election supervisors and city councils for ignoring the signs of fraud in the electoral process because they "are afraid to offend ethnic and religious interests."
The former community secretary, who has now become the leader of the anti-corruption organisation, says that the intimidation of voters for religious reasons is so widespread that the police should be allowed to place guards at the polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He also suggested that voters should present a personal identification document when they vote to prove their true identity.
For the time being, voters must give only the name and address.
He even suggested that the fingers of the voters should be marked with a special ink to prevent a double vote.
The rapporteurs also need to provide more protection, says Sir Erik.
He felt that the press should have more access to Council documents and decisions taken by informal committees and working groups.
He says, "The goal is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to protect the local government from a wider culture of corruption and fraud that goes hand in hand with it."
The report was ordered by Dawning Street after the scandal in connection with the elections in the town of Tauerhamlet.
Last year, the Special Election Court decided to remove the mayor of the city, Lutfur Rahman, from the office of mayor of the city because of corrupt and illegal activities.
The Court found that Rahman "ciically distorted the religious view of his Muslim community and silenced his critics by accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
"Rahman has conducted his election campaign with a statement that it is the religious duty of religious Muslims to vote for him."
Some 300 votes were false or questionable because one man had voted several times.
Sir Erik also points out that there are signs of fraud throughout the country.
He pointed out that fraud in postal voting, where senior members of Muslim communities forced others to vote for their preferred candidates, was particularly worrying.
Sir Ēriks recommended a series of measures to improve the electoral system, including the presentation of a personal identification document to clarify the identity of the person.
His report states: "The evidence shows that vulnerable members of ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, are being forced to vote for senior candidates from the communities, particularly in the communities of Bangladesh and Pakistan."
"There is a concern that district authorities do not pay attention to these problems because of political correctness, because of the potential to offend ethnic and religious interests."
Sir Ēriks set out 50 recommendations on how to improve the electoral system, which also includes banning political activists from acting with voices handed over by post in order to prevent the "collection of votes".
The report, which is being examined by Teresa May, also calls for a more thorough check of registration in order to prevent the use of electoral lists for immigration and benefits fraud.
Consider requesting voters to produce a personal identification document before voting.
To select the fingers of the voters with a special ink to avoid double voting.
Systematic verification of the nationality of persons to verify that a person has the right to vote.
To set a three-year limit for requests for automatic postal voting.
Prohibit political campaigners and activists from working with votes cast by post and voting envelopes by post.
Ensure the police have the power to appoint a guard to the polling stations.
Make changes to the law to facilitate the prosecution of persons for intimidation under the 1983 Human Rights Act.
Prohibit taking pictures at polling stations.
To require the use of English only in polling stations (except in Wales).
Reinforce training to ensure that pollers go to the ballot box one by one.
Sir Eric strongly criticises the Metropolitan police, making it puzzled that there have been no charges against the Towerhamlet case.
He says, "The election court only disqualified Luftur Rahman and his representative for actions related to corruption and fraud."
He was conclusively convicted of the standard of criminal law evidence based on irrefutable evidence.
He also criticises the "check-up" of the inefficient voters of the city council at the polling stations.
Sir Erik says: "The court decision adopted last year is an alarm bell.
Our land is known as the birthplace of the parliament, but the alarming and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the institutional pretence that fraud does not threaten this good reputation.
The passion for the bicyclist - Kate's peer and other Rio Olympic celebrities
The fans of the 2016 Rio Olympic Games are thrilled by the French cyclist Paulina Ferrand Prevot, who the fans have found to be extremely similar to the Duke of Cambridge.
However, a 24 - year - old cyclist is not the only athlete who is fighting for gold this summer, who, according to the media, is proud of his peer in celebrity.
In honour of the Rio Olympic Games and all the famous faces that we now see on our screens, FEMAIL has therefore created a list of Olympic players, which is quite similar to the Hollywood stars.
Hunter and Wolf: Brady Allison, a team member of the U.S. ring shooter team, has been compared with Leonardo Di Kaprio since childhood on the left
Apart from Kate’s counterpart on the cycling track, many people on the Internet say that this bowman could be the brother of the superstar Leonardo Di Kaprio twins.
Brady Allison, a team member of the U.S. men’s team, caused a storm in the twitter when photographs were published, where he was very similar to Wall Street Wilk.
The athlete himself also noticed the storm in social media and admitted that he was compared with Leonardo Di Kaprio since childhood.
"I personally don't see much similarity, except for the beard," Brady tells Huffington Post.
"He's a handsome guy, so I see it as a compliment."
This year, one of the most popular pairs of fans of the 2012 London Olympic Games will undoubtedly gain even more popularity: the stunning similarity between the British long-angler Grega Rutherford and the popular actor Neal Patrick Harris.
The Russian Athlete Alija Mustafina, thanks to her large, expressive eyes, is compared with the Cuban-American singer Glory Estefan.
In terms of swimming, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burg has been compared with Matthew Morrison's "Created for the Stage" star for several years.
Changes: this user has noticed that Nathan is an actioner 'sportable version' of the film 'Inception' .
The tennis star Rafael Nadahl and actor Josh Hartnet, who has similar eyebrows and lips, are also ancient peers.
Russian silver medalist, swimmer Julia Efimova and actress Annalin McKorda can be proud not only of sun-burned skin and blond hair. Meanwhile, fans believe that the athletic U.S. athlete Nathan Adrian is like Joseph Gordon Levits.
Hard Women: The Football Star (left) Houpa Solo and the actress of the Dexter series, Jennifer Carpenter (right) have a similar face shape and eyes.
Not one: a Twitter user was pleasantly surprised to learn that others also see these similarities
Theory: this user believes that there may be a reason why both look so similar
Recently, a Twitter user declared with real pleasure that "other internet users agree that Houpa Solo and Jennifer Carpenter actually look identical."
The U.S. football star and serial "Dekster" actress really has a very similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons apply to Kerry Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of the actress Laura Linny. Also, the golden medal winner's athlete Gaby Douglas boasts a beautiful, broad smile, similar to the smile of the "Bring It On" star Gabriela Unijona.
The commentator of the CBC Olympics apologises for commenting that the Chinese swimmer is 'ending as a pig'.
Byron McDonald's analysis of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhas finish in the fourth place in a 4x200 m free-style relay for women, called indignation storm in the CBC spectators.
The Canadian channel CBC was forced to apologize, because one of its commentators made comments that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer from the race was "flagged out of the race that smelled alone" and "ended like a pig".
Commentator Byron McDonald thought that his microphone was off when the 4x200 m free-style relay for women at the end of the finals presented his personal opinion.
McDonald, who was included in the team of CBC commentators to give the comments liveliness, said: "It's a little 14-year-old from China who cannot keep up."
"Overrun, she flew out of the race, that she just smelled and died like a pig."
Thank you very much.
The 14-year-old Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhana score in the second stage was 1:57.79, which is 1.61 seconds slower than the Canadian Taylor Rucka score, allowing Canadians to catch up with China.
Audience throughout Canada reacted immediately to the Internet because they were shocked to hear such tone and expressions.
Emmet McFarlain wrote on Twitter: "Did a direct CBC commentator just said that a 14-year-old swimmer from China "ended like a pig"???"
The idiot did not realize that they were still in direct air.
Ai Yanha from China in the 4x200m freestyle final for women was named "a small 14-year-old from China who does not keep up."
The criticism of Byron McDonald quickly came into force, as many asked for explanations.
Twitter's users could not believe it by hearing Byron McDonald's insensitive comments.
Twitter user Sara Paradi wrote: "Oho, #ByronMacDonald.
Because of you representatives of CBC and Canada and you, we all sound like racists. #Unlikely.
Shortly after that, Scott Russell, who conducted the CBC live broadcast at that time, apologized for McDonald's comments, saying: "We're sorry that the comment on the result of swimming was made in direct air."
It was an unfortunate choice of words and we are very sorry that it happened.
The CBC apologised to over 90 people who had responded to this comment on Twitter.
McDonald's colleague Scott Russell had to apologize for him.
Then the CBC copied an apology to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comment.
The channel also quickly published an apology and a statement.
We very much regret that such comments were made and came into direct air.
Yesterday we responded immediately and apologized to all the viewers and followers of live broadcasts in social media.
For the sake of clarity, Byron's comments were made on the swimmer's performance and not addressed to her personally.
In any case, however, these were unprofessional and unsuccessful statements and Byron greatly regretted what had happened.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald personally apologized directly and tried to explain that he did not think that his comment would be perceived as a personal attack.
He said live on the CBC Olympics: "I would like to take a moment and apologize for the comment I made yesterday following the free-style women race."
I'm talking about the swimmer's performance, not about him personally.
Needless to say, I didn't mean to show disrespect, and I'm really sorry that it happened.
The buyers of Primark are shocked by a woman who shamelessly adjusts underwear in the middle of a store.
Buyers were embarrassed when the woman began to dress up to try pants in the middle of the shop.
To make matters worse, she tried to make sure that they fit her and then pulled her off, putting her panties back on the shop shelf.
She continued to look for clothes in the shop of Folkeston Bouverie Place shopping centre and tried four more panties.
Primark store at Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkeston – a place where this woman used to try underwear and then put it back on the shelf.
At the time, the mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, was in the store, saying that the unknown woman put her clothes on the underwear and left the store without buying anything.
She says that people couldn't believe their eyes.
Standing in the middle of the store, she took her underpants from the shelf, took off her tights and trousers and measured them on the spot.
She didn't even try to find a more discreet place to measure them, she just tried them on the spot.
Everyone looked at how she took off her panties and apparently did not like them, because she simply put them back on the shelf.
She measured three more panties until she decided that she did not like them and left the store.
It did not seem that he was worried that someone was looking at or thinking about the person who would buy the clothes she used.
Ms. Davidson (33 years old) from Kent says, "The idea of Derdza is that someone will buy clothes that have been tried by another person and that have not been washed off."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Miss Davidson adds: "I assume that the store staff removed those clothes from the store shelves after she left, which is also acceptable."
I can't imagine buying a new underwear and finding out that another woman used it and hadn't washed it.
Primark's representative indicated that Primark was aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday, 9 August.
The specific clothes have been removed from the store shelves.
How to protect yourself from firearms using Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer.
To find out how to protect ourselves at a close distance from attackers with a firearm, we talked to Krav Maga's grandmaster from New York, Ron Misrake.
Whether you are attacked from the front or the back, this video shows you how to protect yourself and win over the attacker.
Miscaki indicates that if the attacker strikes from the back, then first you have to turn to see the attacker clearly and avoid a shot path.
Then the weapon must be grabbed between your front arm and shoulder and hit the enemy's face with its free elbow.
Then there comes a shot with a knee along the groin and while the attacker freezes in pain, takes his weapon, hits his face with a gun's spade and retreats, continuing to force the weapon against him.
If the attacker approaches from the front, the situation is similar - to avoid a shot path, catch the weapon and fold it so that the evildoer cannot be fired.
At the same time, you have to put pressure on the weapon and hit the opponent through the chest and finally take the weapon away and step back to keep pointing at him.
Sounds complicated?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizaraki is doing.
But remember, if you're not the master of Krav Maga, then it's safer to give your money back to the loser.
The Wanda family decorates the social home of Saltash Cornwall and is put on the street.
The Wanda family has been put out of residence for the terrorisation of neighbours, causing damage to the social home of 50,000 pounds.
Tanja Skeldon and her partner Sean Trebilkoks are only small from the property in Saltash Cornwall because several complaints have been lodged against them.
After forced expropriation, the shocked housing officials found that the property was completely destroyed.
There were holes in the floors and walls, waste was thrown everywhere, and walls were covered with graffiti.
The family is now out of property and is likely to live in a private property.
Cornwall Housing Manager Donna McEvia says that there is a concern that it will not be possible to renovate housing.
She says that the people who lived here were extremely difficult, and she believes that people cannot live like that.
In this case, a number of factors need to be assessed, since this property will not be of good repute in Cornwall in the future.
This family is famous and their name is well known.
The couple had three sons who were periodically in possession, and the police said that their terror was violent, that they were tainted on the street with baseball sticks, that they were intimidated by the local population, that they were using drugs, that they were selling drugs, and that they were bullying and harassing.
The 47-year-old Skeldone, in whose name he was a property, was sentenced in June for antisocial behaviour.
Ramped waste has been found in a number of destroyed home rooms.
The house, where drugs can be sold in advance, also has several floor boards ripped off.
Neighbors say that they regularly climbed on the street and were constantly called the police.
The Cornwall Housing Service forced them out of property when they were given 11 weeks to move out of the house voluntarily.
The desperate neighbors were very happy to be evicted because their life was absolute hell.
One said, "They didn't care about other people."
We lived next to them for 20 years, it's always been crazy.
I can't believe how often we've seen the police here.
We couldn't sleep this morning.
We woke up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
Now that they are finally gone, here will be wonderful.
Adam Fitzpatrik, who is head of the Cornwall Housing Service Neighbourhood Protection, said that the family did not cooperate with local security authorities.
The family has lived here for 20 years and here regularly called the police.
Various old and unusable objects were found in the overgrown garden of the house.
He also said: "It is a great pity that tenants did not show any responsibility for their behaviour, because evictions from the house are always the last step considered by the Cornwall Housing Service."
This was a very difficult case, since their behavior was extreme and their neighbors had been very hard to watch in their behavior.
I appreciate the work of all my team, the Devon and Cornwall police and community members who were courageous and cooperating with us in providing the necessary information.
I hope that this event will make life easier for our neighbours and will show that anti-social behaviour is unacceptable.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived here in different periods of time, but they were all about 20 years old.
Dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the rooms after displaying.
The staff will now have to clean up the pile of garbage left in the house.
In 2014, the police searched the house and found more than 70 grams of marijuana, weights, accessories and 1 700 pounds in cash.
Skeldone is only found guilty of storing Class B drugs for the purpose of distributing them.
She insisted that the money was intended for a monument to her son Lee Scheldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being evicted, it has become known that they are now renting a private property in Plymouth.
Many of the walls of the house were drawn graffiti.
The police report that they will continue to lay out tenants who violate their rental contracts.
Angela Crow, representative of the Devon and Cornwall police, points out that this eviction is a clear warning to other tenants who continue to violate the rules.
She also said, "This is a warning to those who believe that they can behave as they want and will have no consequences."
The police in Devon and Kronvola do not accept criminal and anti-social behaviour, and the police will continue to work with our partners to protect local communities.
A willingness to spend can give impetus to the economy.

The mayor of the cannes banned the burkini swimsuits on the beaches.
The mayor of the southern French resort town Cannes has banned wearing on the beaches of the town burkini swimsuits, which almost completely cover the body of a woman and very resembles the immersion suit, declared local officials on Thursday.
The mayor of the Cannes, David Linar, has signed an order that "access to beaches and swimming is prohibited for anyone who does not have a swim suit that respects good customs and secularism" as a basic principle of the French Republic.
"Pludmale dress, which outwardly demonstrates religious affiliation at a time when France and places of worship are the target of terrorist attacks, may create a risk of public order disruptions (fragmentation, collisions, etc.) that need to be prevented", says the order.
"We are talking not about banning the wearing of religious symbols on the beach, but about outdoor clothing related to trust in the terrorist movements that are fighting with us", explained the municipal utility manager Thierry Miguls.
He added that the burkini swimsuits on the Cannes beaches have not been seen since July 28, when Linārs, a member of the centre-right "Republicans" party, signed the order and entered into force.
This week, the aquapark in Marseilles abolished a planned private event for Muslim women dressed in burkini swimsuits, because it was indignant by politicians from both the right and the left.
In France, the wearing of face-covering headgear of Muslim women is prohibited, but religious symbols or appropriate clothing are not prohibited.
On 14 July, 85 people were killed in a terrorist campaign organised in the nearby town of Cannes resort, Nice, for which the Islamic State Group took responsibility.
On July 26, two attackers who had sworn their trust in the Islamic State brutally murdered priests in the church in north-west France.

The festival "Kubāna" has begun in Lucavsala.
On Thursday, August 11, the evening in Lucavsala was given a start at one of the last festivals of this summer - "Cuban" will take place there until Sunday night.
On the first evening, teams like Enter Shikari from Great Britain, which was expected last year, but not noticed from the program disappeared, American punks "NOFX", DJ Maxim from the group "The Prodigy" and others.
During the next days of the festival, there are also noteworthy names - "Guano Apes" and "Garbage", the punk rock legend "Ramones" drummer Marky Ramone's Blitzkrieg, "Brutto&Lyapis" with Belarusian punk rock leader Sergey Mikhailoks, popular Georgian actor and singer Vahtang Kikabidze, Ukrainian "Vopli Vidoplyasova" and a number of other, but full programme of the event can be viewed here.
This is the second year when the festival "Kubana" takes place in Latvia.
Last year it suffered a financial failure and huge losses, but it did not stop the organizers from rehearsing - they added a spirit mark to the title, included a group of Latvians in the programme (Friday night 19:15 on stage will climb "All Day Long") and announced that now the festival has become "closer and has acquired local color alongside Riga symbols such as its panorama and cats".
Whether these efforts will prove to be successful, even prematurely, because the festival just ran, but, as Delfi Entertainment observed on the first night, at least so far huge crowds of people have not succeeded and the number of visitors was similar to last year.
The British trek cycling team doubles the Olympic record and wins the sprint.

The first Olympic record was corrected by the British in qualification, but in the first round of the competition it was re-corrected by the New Zealandans.
The British team met with New Zealand at the Sprint final, and the British took away the title of Olympic record owners from New Zealand, leaving them with silver medals.
The final British team won with a score of 42,440 seconds, outnumbering the New Zealanders by 0.102 seconds.
In the fight for bronze, the French team outpaced Australia.
It should be noted that the record was also corrected for the qualification of the women's journey - the British team corrected the world record, which is now 4:13.260.
President who remained in the shadow: Gustav Zemgal - 145.
Friday, August 12, is 145 years old, since the second President of Latvia Gustavs Zemgals was born.
The Zemgals proclaimed the state of Latvia, but it has remained undeserved in the shadow of the well-described first President of Latvia Jānis Čakste and the last President of the pre-war period Kārlis Ulmanis.
No one of our statesmen has defended democracy and the rule of law as much as Zemgale, according to Arnolds Auziņš, in his book dedicated to Gustavs Zemgals, published ten years ago.
In conversation with the portal Delfi Auziņš emphasizes that Zemgale is one of the few high-ranking politicians who have had a sense of humor.
The rest of the strings, always very right.
He taught not to be, but today it could be like Raimonds Vējonis.
"He was close to the people," says Auziņš.
Modern politicians do not know the history, they referred to Karli Ulmanis as good leader, but rarely does anyone know how bad he was.
In government sessions, the only person he did not scream at was General Balodis.
Even if in pictures he is kind and smiling, by nature he was hysterical.
"Zemgals, with his sense of humor and democracy, leaves exactly the opposite impression," says Auziņš.
Professor Aivars Stranga of the Faculty of History and Philosophy of the University of Latvia in conversation with Delfi agrees with Auziņa's assessment of Zemgale as a peaceful and balanced stateman.
He also notes that Zemgal will honour minorities, regularly invited Jewish representatives to the presidential palace.
"At that time, it was not the usual act, after the Zemgal Presidency, Alberts Kviesis took over this tradition," says the historian.
He was a quiet and sedentary man who had to be persuaded to become president for a long time.
He didn't seek it himself, he just didn't love it.
He was also quite critical of himself, because he did not know French, but he felt that the President should be able to do so.
"During the residency, the basics of the French language learned," explains Stranga.
The Zemgale did not allow himself to be repeatedly persuaded to stand as a candidate; he did not like such high posts.
In all respects, he is a very respectable person in the history of Latvia, and he was already in a serious position before entering the presidential palace - he was a very sought-after notary.
Zemgals also led the famous Zemgala cashier on Suvorova Street 3, where the association of savings and savings lenders was located, in which practically the Latvian state was formed in government talks.
He was always progressive.
He wasn't a big fan of Ulmanis, but he didn't object publicly either.
"In private conversations, however, it has sometimes been said that Ulmanis' actions are not really sympathetic to him", says Stranga.
After living a peaceful life, there is no suspicion of lawlessness or corruption.
How does Zemgale remember today?
It is a pity, but for a large part he only associated with a street in Riga.
He was an absolute democrat, he was a center.
"There were no major shocks in his time, namely, he could associate with such a truly stable Presidency," says Stranga.
During the Presidency of Gustavs Zemgals, from 1927 to 1930, Latvia also visited Sweden, which at that time implied full recognition of Latvia in a neighbouring country and integration into the family of democratic nations of Northern Europe.
On May 28, 1929, Zemgale visited Stockholm.
The Swedish King Gustav V's reply visit to Latvia took place on 29 June 1929.
The second President of Latvia was born in 1871, but died in January 1939.
Simple ways to help a child cope with anger attacks.
I often have to face the fact that the anger of a child, the onset of rage, is considered by my parents to be something wrong and insane.
When the child openly shows his anger - we don't know how to react, "Econet" indicates psychologist Jekaterina Kesa.
The specialist encourages a small conversation about these natural and human feelings - anger and anger that everyone periodically experiences.
Aggression - it is already a physical activity directed against another person, and it usually appears when you feel angry.
When we adults are angry, excited, we usually know what is happening to us and how to deal with it.
We can express our anger and anger within ourselves: express, suppress, hide, keep within ourselves, tell our friends or other relatives about it, we can be angry to kick a sofa, smoke a cigarette (this is not the best way to disperse anger!), go into a shower, hit it with a dress on the table and do other things that we don't usually do.
We do not take our aggression against others because we know various other ways of coping with these emotions.
Children do not understand what is happening to them, how to call them, and how to deal with them.
They can say, "Go away!", you're a fool, "Bad mom", "I don't see you", "I won't be friends with you" - and very rarely when I can say, "I'm mad at you."
Children live in a literal sense, they are completely here, at this point, they are spontaneous and true in showing their feelings, and often they are also held captive by various emotions.
It is very important that parents do not prevent the child from showing feelings, including anger, from being ashamed of it, and do not look, but, on the contrary, from helping the child.
Do you need a break in the relationship?
Long working day, in which everything has not gone exactly as you would like, or just in a bad mood - there are so many reasons why I would like for a moment, a day or even longer to "lock off" from all over the world.
Is it possible to experience the relationship for a moment and breathe a little bit?
Or does it show that each partner has a way to go?
In their opinions, the gentlemen share their views in different ages.
Jānis (23) is brief and concise: "In my opinion, if you need a break in a relationship, you are not with the right person".
Meanwhile, Eduard (30) has discovered a scheme that may be helpful to someone.
If you feel that a partner starts falling on your nerves for every detail, then surely it's the right time to look into other hunting fields to see if you miss him or not think about him in particular or even want to see him at all.
So the answer is, yes, holding a pause can help you save time and understand how important the other half is to you.
Kaspars (29) reveals his theory.
In my opinion, a break from each other should be included in the relationship, because if you spend time with a person 24 hours a day, seven days a week, then disputes are inevitable.
They are caused by the fact that you notice every detail the other does, and it begins to fall on the nerves.
People get tired of each other, especially if you are not even talking about anything anymore, just about what you've been doing in the day.
My personal experience makes me think so, so I haven't survived the relationship for more than a few months.
If you think at some point that it's better elsewhere or with someone else, why does this woman with whom you are with deserve a woman who can think that there is not good enough here and there are fields of paradise behind the mountains?
Thinking alone is a little betrayal.
If not, then not.
"I have, so slightly condemn those who don't have." says Edmund (46).
Carl (33) has almost the opposite view.
I think everyone needs a moment to breathe.
You can't look at each other's eyes every minute, all the time, from morning to evening, and enjoy the unfailing love.
Come on!
There are so many things - friends, work, parties.
Everything has its time.
Of course, also for a girlfriend or a wife, but if both can hold the balance between family life and the rest of the world, it can live to the edge of the grave.
All right, all right.
Mārtiņš (27) says: "There is something hard to say - need or not, may or may not take a break, but one thing is clear - there is nothing in the relationship of its initiator, something missing."
If this question is raised, then it must be taken into account that there will be any changes in the near future - for the good or the bad, it will depend on itself.
I mean, while you're still young and crazy, in the meantime, you need to have a break, even all the time, but when everything gets serious and the relationship goes into a completely different phase, then there can be no question of rest.
You decide to spend your whole life together!
"If you can't withstand each other's society and sometimes you need a fresh breath, then what will happen when you are pensioners who comment on how passing cats hover or argue about the day on which the garden needs to be mined," explains Kristaps (19).
All the names of the lords have been changed.
Rozentāls was the first to awaken the interest of the Latvian people in fine arts with his enthusiastic and enthusiastic personality.
"In this sense, he was the first love of the Latvian nation, which as such will remain forever unforgettable," wrote Romans Suta about the old master of Latvian painting Jani Rozentāls.
Also in 2016, when opening the large retrospective exhibition of the old master in the restored main building of the Latvian National Museum of Art, it is clear - Rozentāls is the first love of Latvian art.
The exhibition was opened on 12 August, but already from 13 August it is available to visitors and will be open until 30 October.
The Latvian National Museum of Art honours painter Jani Rozentāls (1866-1916) at the newly opened Great Exhibition Hall, whose one hundred and fifty birthdays are included in the UNESCO calendar of holidays on an international scale.
The retrospective exhibition, featuring more than 150 works, is one of the central events of Janis Rozentāls' anniversary programme.
The selection of artworks is mostly made from the collection of the Latvian National Museum of Art, which strongly represents the main stages and genres of classical creative activity, stylistic variability and variety of techniques.
In addition, exhibits from Akseli Gallen-Callel Museum, Literature and Music Museum, Liepāja Museum, Tukums Museum and several private collections in Latvia and Finland have been used.
The atmosphere of the turn of the century is revived by the presence of photographs, the mobile application of the exhibition reveals the interplay of individual works of art with photographs taken by the painter with his own camera for creative purposes.
The Finnish-Latvian Commonwealth Society "Rozentāls-seura", named after the Latvian classic, simultaneously offers the first stop of small informative travelling exhibitions "With a glance in Finland, with a heart in Latvia".
A similar exhibition with content in English, Finnish and Swedish will be opened at the Virks Gallery in Helsinki in autumn.
Matt Leblank is looking forward to returning to TopGear.
Matt Leblank, director of TopGear television broadcast, said that he was looking forward to returning to the car show in the second season, but admitted that he did not know what was expected in the future.
Nothing officially happens yet.
"If there is, then the BBC will announce it," Leblank opened the conversation with the television critics.
Doubts about the future of "Gaze in the Floor!" arose in July, when Leblank's partner Chris Evans announced that he was leaving the program.
After leaving, Evans admitted that Leblank and Gase in the floor are "as created for each other".
Evans describes the star of the former series "Friends" ("Friends") as a "real and good man", thus dispelling the rumors that the friendship of both people went down during filming.
When asked what he liked most in the show, Leblankm replied that travelling to other countries, such as South Africa, Morocco and Ireland.
The TV channel BBC says that the show does not intend to replace Evans in the new 24th season.

In Sigulda, Swiss Street, the State Police reports that there are two cyclists in contact with various injuries.
The accident involved men born in 1987 and 1990, both of whom were delivered to a medical facility.
A cyclist suffered in Koknese's fall as well.
In 1989, a born man fell on the 1905 street and was taken to the care of medical staff.
In 1989, in Dobele district, Naudīte parish, a motorcyclist was born trying to avoid a dog that ran out on the road and overturned.
He's in the hospital, too.
Last day, 71 road traffic accidents involving 16 people were registered in Latvia.
In some places it will get colder and cooler.
Also on Friday in Latvia temporary rain is expected in some places and will become another degree cooler, agency LETA learned about the Latvian Environment, Geology and Meteorology Centre.

In Riga, the day will pass without precipitation and the sun will shine mostly.
However, the air will not be warmer than +18 degrees.
In his interpretation, the U.S. model business behind the scenes has obtained a perverse glance of sophisticated photography and the inexorableness of a horror film.
In essence, a very provocative work on the balance of sophistication and banal vulgarity, which makes it difficult to draw border lines between the European art house film and the territory of Hollywood genre.
The film with Vigo Mortensen highlights the question of whether conceptually chosen models of life (ecology, vegetarianism, alternativeism and isolation from the glamour and values of consumer society) bring blessing or destructiveism to their children.
The father of six children, an idealist after the death of his wife, is confronted with questions about the correctness of choices and the true values.
A moving, lively film whose author Matt Ross won the Cannes Festival award for the directory this year.
Of course, sharks just do this as they attack beautiful girls - in Jooks it was a swimmer, in this case a brave surfer, represented by Blake Laivley.
Her work has required her great heroism.
This survival solarium can be compared to James Franco's performance demonstration in the 127-hour film and Ryan Reynolds' game in the film buried alive.
Possibly, there is also Mila Kunisa, who plays a key role, whose transformation from a model to a creative host and a close family value fantasizing seems only created by the fantasy of desperate Hollywood scriptwriters.
The Islamic State in Syria has captured a civilian population of 2 000.
On Friday, the U.S.-supported Kurdish and Arab Alliance and observers reported that the Islamic State fighters of the terrorist group have captured some 2 000 civilians who live as shields, fleeing from Menbiga in the Syrian Aleppo province.
"We didn't shoot at them because they took civilians with them when they fled to Gerabulus," said Kurds Menbige's Military Council spokesperson.
After two months of fighting, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (QSD), a US-supported Kurdish-Arab Alliance in northern Syria, announced on Friday that Menbiz was released from the Jihadists.
The Islamic state took Menbija in 2014.
QSD already last week expelled most of the Islamic State fighters from Menbiga, but part maintained and showed fierce resistance.
On Friday, however, they left the city, taking captives with them.
Islamists are going to Gerabulus, on the Turkish border.
The London-based Syrian activist organisation Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) also reported that the Islamic State had kidnapped about 2,000 people.
SOHR reported that Islamists had kidnapped the city’s citizens’ cars, forced people to step into them, and then taken them to Gerabulus.
The Islamic State's fighters have also committed mass kidnappings in the past.
In January, Islamists abducted more than 400 civilians, including women and children, in the province of Deir ez Zoras in the east of Syria.
Later, some 270 prisoners were released by Islamists.
How many Islamic state fighters have fled Menbiga is unknown.
A press representative of the Kurdish Menbige Military Council reported that QSD managed to rescue 2500 people held captive by Islamists in Menbiza.
Information gathered by SOHR shows that at least 437 civilian citizens, including 105 children, have lost their lives in the battle for Menbizi.
Killed 299 QSD fighters and 1019 Jihadists.
Koļegova refuses to stand for the post of head of SRS.
The Head of the State Environmental Service Inga Koļegova decided to withdraw his candidacy for the post of the Director-General of the State Revenue Service (SRS), the agency LETA informed the Ministry of Finance.
Koļegova points out that the discussion of her candidacy has increased the contradictions between the ruling coalition parties.
It seems that the real reasons for the discussions are related to the visible but more often invisible interests of politicians and have nothing to do with the assessment of my professional abilities.
"It is also unacceptable to me", emphasizes the applicant for the post of head of the SRS.
If her candidacy had been approved by the government, it was clear that it would not be a convincing vote and that it would not allow to work properly and implement the necessary changes to the SRS, feeling the support of the entire government.
Without this, it would not be possible to work fully, concludes Koļegova.
"I have repeatedly publicly emphasised that I do not want to be politically dependent, but now the whole process of my candidacy is too politicised", explains the official.
"Thank you for the trust and support I have shown, it is an experience that I consider to be a benefit", in the application Cooleguva writes.
The agreement on Wednesday stated that during the meeting with Koļegov "significant contradictions" were revealed between the candidate's explanations and the information available in public registers about the dividends paid by SIA Pallogs, because the publicly available decisions of Pallogs members' meetings envisage not to distribute profits.
Currently, Deputy Director-General Dace Grey is the head of the SRS.
Livani Police is involved in saving two small unattended children, informs the State Police Latgale Region Authority.
A report of unattended strollers with infants received on Friday around 7 a.m.
They were in Livani near the building of the former store.
The two little girls were immediately put in the hands of the medical staff for help.

In less than half an hour, law enforcement found out the possible location of children’s parents and went there.
When the woman arrived at the home of a civilian, the police found out that the woman was sleeping because she was drunk.
After initial information, the woman born last night in 1992 visited her friend, where she was drinking alcohol.
As she goes home after she sits together, she decided to leave her children at the shop under uncertain conditions.
The police immediately informed the orphan’s court about what had happened, which will also decide on the future fate of the children.
The Freeport of Riga has implemented all recommendations of the SAO regarding the Russian island project.
The Freeport of Riga Authority has implemented all of the five recommendations of the State Audit Office regarding the development of infrastructure in the Russian island for the transfer of port activities from the city centre, the portal Diena.lv informed the company.
The approval of the project is planned for the next meeting of the Board of the Freeport of Riga.
In order to implement the recommendations in accordance with the opinion of the SAO, when preparing the necessary documentation for implementation of the recommendations, the Riga Freeport Authority was guided by the conclusions of legal and operational audit carried out by the international auditor Deloitte in the Freeport of Riga administration and the recommendations given to improve the management of the project in the next stage of the project.
Information on the implementation of the recommendations has also been sent to the SAO today.
Despite the fact that the Freeport of Riga Authority does not agree with the opinion of the SAO on the feasibility of the Russian island project, we are very responsible for the implementation of the project and the provider of funding - the European Commission (EC).
I would like to stress that all the works planned within the framework of the project have been fully completed within the time limits and in the planned amount.
"In order to prove to all those involved in the implementation of the project, including the EC, the SAO and also the citizens, that the main goal of the Freeport is to successfully implement the project, we have fully implemented all recommendations of the SAO regarding the management and supervision of the project", says Sanita Kaire, the project manager of the Russian island.
The long-term action plan for monitoring and monitoring the achievement of the project goal was supplemented with the main planned activities of the parties concerned and the deadlines for the necessary decisions, the definitions of meetings and regular reports and their deadlines, the tools for monitoring the planned construction process, as well as the definitions of the most significant border points.
The approved action plan for the achievement of the project goal by 31 December 2018, in accordance with the recommendations of the SAO, is supplemented with performance monitoring activities, thus reinforcing the control of the duration of activities of other parties involved in the implementation of the project from the Freeport of Riga side.
A project management plan has been developed to improve project management and reduce potential risks, defining the project management areas and specifying the documents developed to provide a control and monitoring mechanism for each of them.
A project management organisational chart has been developed to increase project capacity, reflecting the planned structure of the project management team, the qualifications and functions of the employees.
In order to improve communication between the Freeport of Riga Authority and the parties involved in the project, a communication plan has been developed for the stakeholders of the project, which, in addition to the parties identified in the project action plan, defines the interested parties, the principles, types and periodicity of information exchange for the successful completion of the project.
On the other hand, in order to improve the control of the use of financial resources, further justification will have to be given for the need to conclude a service contract or to launch a procurement and for the rule of law.
Within the framework of the project, the port infrastructure in accordance with the world standards has been built on Krievu Island - four new deep-sea berths, railway connections, as well as engineering communications.
The construction works co-financed by the Cohesion Fund have been completed and put into operation already at the end of the last year, achieving the expected funding savings of EUR 10.6 million.
In Slovakia, security at airports has been strengthened due to threats.
Following the receipt of non-specific threats, Slovakia reinforced security measures at several airports on Friday, announced by the Ministry of Interior.
"In view of the threat, we have stepped up security measures at international airports in Bratislava, Poprad and Košice", a press representative from the Slovak Ministry of Interior told the news agency AFP on Friday.
"The National Security and Analysis Centre is currently analysing the information we have received", he added.
On 16 September, an informal European Union (EU) summit will take place in the capital of Slovakia, with the participation of all the bloc countries except Great Britain.
The meeting will discuss the consequences of the British Brexit referendum and discuss the future of the EU without Britain.
Slovakia holds the EU Presidency until January.
German researchers are discussing the number of "Berlin Wall victims".
According to a new study, the number of deaths at the former East German border of the Communist yoke could be much higher than previously thought, but doubts about the true number of victims have still not been dispelled.
According to data released on Wednesday by the Berlin Wall Museum Checkpoint Charlie, between 1945 and 1989, 1841 people have been murdered by the Western Allied Zones and the later Communist authorities of Western Germany, who have tried to get out of their controlled territory.
The museum has been studying border-related deaths for years and periodically adjusting the number of victims.
This year, 11 more deaths were added to the list, including among the victims a six-year-old boy drowned in an attempt to get his family to West Germany through Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
Among the new victims of the Berlin Wall are the Soviet army deserters.
"The ultimate extent of harm caused by the double evil of communism and socialism is not yet fully documented", admits the director of the museum Alexander Hildebrante.
"Our task is to ensure that the graves of those who died trying to escape from the Communist controlled state are maintained and not lost", stressed Hildebrante's statement.
However, other researchers have already questioned the new figures.
"The Light 1841 is inconclusive," Jochen Štate, an expert in the history of East Germany at the Free University of Berlin, claims in an interview with Süddeutsche Zeitung.
He, along with other researchers at the Free University of Berlin, is currently reviewing the alleged deaths at the border, and so far they have managed to confirm only 260 cases.
In the past, researchers estimated that only the Berlin Wall had the Communists murdered 138 people.
Taking into account those people who died trying to escape the Baltic Sea or get to the West through the territory of neighbouring countries, the number of victims could reach about a thousand.
However, it is still significantly less than 1841.
One of the different causes of the number of victims could be different methodologies.
The Checkpoint Charlie Museum also lists all cases of suicide of the eastern German border guards, whether or not they were directly related to their services.
The museum also accounts for deaths unrelated to direct violence.
"If seniors aged between 70 and 80 years died of a heart attack after having contracted border control, this must be the consequences of this "killer boundary", says Hildebrante.
However, Stent is convinced that a distinction should be made between the old people who may have died as a result of their treatment and those whose death was caused by long waiting on a bus at the border.
Apart from this, the record of victims is not easy, because the Communist authorities in East Germany did not collect such statistics, and researchers have to order documents in various scattered archives, states the State.
However, the Budget Group has recently come up with new documents and could therefore come up with a new estimate of the number of victims in the near future.
President of LPF Pone went to Rio with coach accreditation; for himself, that is a surprise.
In recent days, the president of the Latvian Swimming Federation (LPF) Kaspars Pone visited the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro with the accreditation of a coach, but he was surprised at it.
On Wednesday, the great aziotage arose after the comments of German Jakubovsky, the coach of the Olympic swimmer Aļona Ribakov, who revealed that at the last minute he decided to go to Rio de Janeiro to Pone while the coach was staying at home.
Initially, the list of riders included swimmers Alona Ribakova and Uvis Kalniņš, coaches Jakubovskis and Dave Collins, as well as the president of the federation Pone.
The Latvian Swimming Federation announced five participants for the Olympic Games, and even before departure Aldons Vrubļevskis claimed that Germans would be and were looking for tickets.
"However, apparently for objective reasons he was not", said Pone, saying that it did not affect the result of Ribakov.
At the request of the federation, Uvy’s trainer undertook to help her.
Pone, himself a member of the Executive Committee of the LOC, strongly criticised the activities of the LOC by blaming the Olympic sports supervisory organisation.
In my view, it is unethical for the Executive Committee of the LOC to confirm five persons and not to take one of them.
"I don't know why the Swimming Federation didn't have enough space," Pone said that the work of the federation and its presidents was not appreciated in the public, reminding them that the presidents of the federation do not receive wages.
Pone also criticised Jakubovski himself, saying that before the London Olympic Games, when Ribakov was not approved among the participants, he appealed to the International Federation of Water Sports (FINA) and called on Latvia not to send any athletes.
Pone could not tell why he was in the Olympic Games with a coach accreditation, which most likely had to come to Jakubovsky.
"I was announced as the president of the federation ("team leader"), but for unknown reasons I got coach accreditation and now I can't get in anywhere."
The situation changed daily, the number of accreditations available changed.
Until the last moment I thought there was going to be German, because I didn't have any other information.
According to the information available to LETA, a couple of days before Ribakov's start she had a conversation with Poni face to face, and after that, the swimmer had tears in her eyes, but the president of LPF himself said that it was an everyday conversation with the desire to start sportsmen before the start.
Pone recalled that LPF oversees five sports in the Olympic programme, and four of them also provide training for children in Latvia.
The President of the Federation said that the drowning issues are also very important in Latvia, and he also talked about such programmes, while he had been in Rio de Janeiro for almost two weeks.
He praised the work of the Federation and said that in 2018 the World Cup could take place in Latvia.
Being in Rio de Janeiro is not my vacation, I work here, I waste my time and I try to implement four-year programmes.
600 000 young salmon will be introduced into the Daugava River.
During the AS Latvenergo fish resource recovery program this week salmon and sea trout juveniles are released at Mangal Island, and this year more than 600 000 annual salmon and sea trout juveniles grown in fish farms of the scientific institute Bior Tomes and Doles are planned to be introduced.
Latvenergo Agency LETA informed that the release of fish will continue for the coming months – every year 6 300 000 juveniles and larvae of different species are introduced into the water bodies of the Daugava basin.
In spring and early summer 2016, pike and lamprey caterpillars will be released, in June - bustling, in July - one-summer salmon, in August and September - zandarts and vimbas.
Latvenergo Production Director Māris Kuņickis told that care about the environment is one of the cornerstones of the sustainable development of Latvenergo Group.
"Every activity is focused on environmentally friendly actions in close cooperation with the scientific institute Bior, as well as on the growing and placing of juvenile fish in the Daugava basin, as well as other activities," said Kunickis.
This year more than 600,000 annual salmon and sea trout juveniles will be introduced into the Daugava estuary.
For the second year, juvenile fish are marked before being introduced by cutting off the fat fin.
Today, there are 25,000 salmon juveniles with an average weight of 31.3 grams.
Each year, in scientifically justified compositions and numbers of species, juveniles and larvae are introduced into the Daugava River and its basin water bodies.
The reproduction of fish resources in Daugava and its basin water bodies shall be carried out by Bior in accordance with the regulatory enactments, on the basis of the assessment of losses caused to fish resources by Latvenergo as a result of its economic activity and giving a conclusion on the compensatory measures to be taken in order to ensure the diversity of fish resources.
The State Environmental Service, on the basis of the said expertise, decides on the amount and form of compensation.
Latvenergo has an annual compensation of EUR 1 035 000 in the programme for the recovery of fish resources.
In spring 2016, Latvenergo in cooperation with the association "We are for Fish" for the fifth year place 400 artificial fish spawning nest in Daugava near Kaibala and Ikšķile.
Cooperation with the association, promoting the natural spawning of fish, is an additional initiative supported by Latvenergo within the framework of the fish resource recovery programme.
The presence of artificial spawning nests in the reservoir is an important measure that contributes to the protection and reproduction of fish resources in Daugava.
At the festival "Sançais concert hall" there is a rural courtyard, forest, felling.
Sleep in the tent, eat as in the restaurant, walk in the keds and listen to an exquisite chamber music, enjoying the quiet peace of nature - such a combination is offered by the alternative chamber music festival in Sansai, which already for the third summer invites to Aknīste district.
The festival will take place in the courtyard of the former parish house, next to forests and fellings.
In three days - from 12 to 14 August - on five stages you can combine the carefree pleasure of nature and academic music.
Here music is encountered by theatre and contemporary circus, performances and installations.
Opera and academic music, especially in its latest manifestations, find new listeners in a free and open environment without the stiffness of concert halls.
The distance from here to Riga is about 150 km, but to smile in the face and ease in the legs only a few minutes.
"Please don't look for the program because we deliberately chose not to publish it before, so that people don't go to one particular event or artist, because the real taste of Sansais can only be caught by spending all three days there", invites the initiator and owner of the festival, opera baritons Armands Siliņš.
The festival's goal is Friday at 17.00, and the first concert is at 19.00.
Of course, there will be programs on the ground with all the information.
For those who have to choose one day, we recommend Saturday, because it is the most saturated - from 9.00 a.m. to the next dawn.
"The artists' names are available on the website www.sansusi.lv", told by Armands Siliņš.
For example, the magnificent artists' bouquet includes violinist Eva Bindere, cellist Kristīne Blaumane, opera star Inga Kalna, clarnetist Guntis Kuzma, trumpetist Jānis Porietis, pianist Reinis Zariņš, quartet Quadra and RIX, and even Estonian aerial acrobat Grete Gross, who together with Latvian musicians Ēriks Kiršfelds, Mārtiņš Zilberts and actress Ancis Strazda have created a contemporary circus performance Confines for the artist's inner struggle.
New works have been created for the festival.
In the performance for children "Kukainis", which according to F. Kafka tells the motifs of transformation are composed by Oļesja Kozlovska and Jēkabs Nīmanis, along with Armands Silinas, musicians and actors will participate entomologist (infants explorer) Uģis Piterāns.
Oskars Herliņš has written the first String quartet, while Anna Ķirse - Wood Opera, performance, whose main characters are Andris Kalnosol's director with Katrīna Neiburga's video projections and Andra Eglītis' scenography will be trees in three small clusters of three hectares of naked cut.
By singing with the voices of Laima Lediņa, Dinara Rudāne and Zigmar Graš, they will end up in romantic relationships, just like in a study by Swedish natural scientist Kārlis Linney of the Enlightenment Age.
The Rio Olympic Games are today launching one of the greatest hopes of the Latvian delegation, the seven-fight athlete Laura Ikauniece-Admidiņa.
Ikauniece-Admidiņa at 15.35 after the time of Latvia will start the race in 100 meters of barrier race, but at 16.50 a competition in high jumping is expected.
On the other hand, for Saturday at 2.35, the ball will be pushed until 4.05 - 200 meters sprint.
The seven-fight race will be concluded on Saturday, when long jumping, spearping and 800 meters race will take place.
Before the Olympic Games Ikauniece-Admidiņa, who won the bronze World Championship last year, was named as the candidate for the Olympic Games medals.
In May, the Latvian woman set a new state record (6622 points) and won the second place in the prestigious seven-fight race in the Austrian city of Gacissa.
Ikauniece-Admidiņa also participated in the 2012 London Olympic Games, when she won the ninth place with a repeat Latvian record.
In the last year and a half, the country's record has been corrected four times.
Today, at 16 a.m., the start is also scheduled for Latvian judo fighter Artūrs Ņikiforenko, who competes in weight category over 100 kilograms, leading the fight with Azerbaijani athlete Ušangi Kukauri in the first round.
This will be the first Olympic career for Juddist.
The agency LETA has already announced that on Thursday in weight category up to 100 kilograms lost already in his first fight Latvian judo fighter Jevgenijs Borodavko.
He gave in to the Japanese Hagu Ryunowski, who later obtained bronze.
In 2000, Vsevolods Zelonis brought Latvia the Olympic bronze prize, but in the next four Olympic Games, Latvian judiists won only one victory in seven battles, which was won in London by Borodavko.
At 16.30, after Latvia's time, Dainis Upelnieks will start a qualifying race in shooting, but the selection will be concluded on Saturday.
Upelnieks received the Olympic sign only on the day when the composition of the Latvian delegation was officially announced, but later he revealed to LETA that he had been quite safe for driving since April.
The athlete arrived at the Olympics as one of the first Latvian athletes, trying to make the most of the training opportunities in the shooting room.
At 19:05 the final three trips will be made by the debutant of the Olympic Games, 17-year-old Latvian sailor Ketija Birzule, who competes in sailing on the boards of RS:X class.
After three days or nine trips Birzule in total between 26 sports systems is currently located in 25th place.
On Saturday, the finals will take place on the medals.
Today it is finally planned to host a competition in academic rowing, where the Irish Latvian representative Sanita Pušpure must participate.
The competition was cancelled on Wednesday due to adverse weather conditions.
Pušpure will compete at 19.10 in C/D semifinals for single ladies, fighting for 13th place in Olympics.
On Tuesday, in a quarter-finals trip, she won the fourth place from the third position, which would allow her to continue the fight for the medal, behind a mere 0.65 seconds.
Pušpure won the 13th place in London four years ago, when she also represented Ireland.
Today, the Olympic Games will be divided into 24 medal sets - arch shooting, athletics, track cycling, riding, jogging, tram jumping, judo, academic rowing, shooting, swimming, tennis and weightlifting.
Reid claims that if Clinton is elected to the office of President, she will appoint Garland as the judge of the Supreme Court.
The leader of the Democrat Party of the Senate, Harry Reid, is convinced that if she becomes president, she will nominate Merika Garland as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
The Republican Party of the Senate has blocked the approval of Garland since March when he was nominated by President Obama.
Mitch Maconnel, the leader of the majority of the Senate, told that the next president would choose who would replace the current judge of the Supreme Court Antonina Skalia.
On Thursday during his conference, Reid announced that he was sure that Clinton would choose Garland.
Reid's representative later told him that he had not personally talked to Clinton on this subject and that it was just speculation.
He praised Garland and said that Klinton's team would not want to "swap a boat" with a different choice.
Garland is the chief judge of the U.S. District Court of Appeals.
Reid said that the Republicans who block the Garland nomination are "pots" and act in the interests of the Republican party presidential candidate Donald Trampa.
He also said that Trump was not suitable for the President's work.
Treats announces a naked photo calendar for women and men.
The magazine Tract will work with photographer David Belmer to create the 2017 calendar Pirrell in the style of the 1970s.
In its 2017 NU Music calendar, it is planned to demonstrate the new supermodels, not naked celebrities.
Early this year, Steve Shaw, president of Tracts magazine, announced that his erotic art magazine was different from the old-fashioned Playboy, because "Playboy is a men's magazine".
This magazine is for women.
Looks like he's talking about a calendar, too.
In the press release on calendar making, Shaw says: "We have to return to depicting a continuous and classic nakedness in pictures where the body of a woman does not confuse, but inspires both women and men."
Women will want to participate in this project, because it is a great piece of art.
Models can send your photo electronically or in person to the casting sessions in Los Angeles and New York.
The buyer rembates when testing the motorcycle.

Greenland shark is the longest-lived vertebrate - video review
Scientists claim that Greenland’s sharks have the longest life span of all vertebrates on our planet.
Shark explorer Julius Neilsen tells us that the long - life record belongs to a female who could be between 272 and 512 years old and five metres long.
The French court rejects the claim to demolish shops in the "Junglu" refugee camp.
The French court rejected the claim of the authorities in Calais to dismantle dozens of self-made shops and restaurants in the "Junglu" camp, where several thousand refugees live.
At the hearing in Calais this week, the authorities indicated that the State should dismantle 72 self-made shops where people sell different goods, such as cigarettes and energy drinks, hairdressing services, tea for 50 cents (40p) and simple meals for some euro in self-made restaurants.
The Prefect Office pointed out that these self-created companies should be dismantled as they form the shadow economy and do not pay taxes, as well as create fire and sanitary risks.
The representatives of the humanitarian group explained to the court that these small enterprises are essential because the food provided by the government and support groups does not meet the needs of the camp, in which the number of residents continues to increase.
They also pointed out that self - established shops and restaurants often offer free shelter and food to those most in need.
The Lille Court ruled that there is no legal basis for expelling people who have created 72 self-made shops, but it understands Calais's prefect's concerns.
Justice Jean-François Molla said that food, coffee and restaurants play a greater role than simply providing food for people living in "extremely small conditions".
He pointed out that these places were peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places at risk of demolition is the camp cafe "Jungle Book Kids", which provides more than 200 free meals a day, English and French language classes and provides advice on asylum issues to hundreds of vulnerable minors without being accompanied by adults.
More than 170 000 people have signed a petition on the protection of the children's cafe.
The letter addressed to the Guardian indicates that the liquidation of the cafe "will be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old."
On Friday two charitable organizations "Help for Refugees" and "L'Auberge des Migrants" announced that the number of residents of the "Junglu" camp has increased to 9,000 people, which is the highest rate since the rapid influx of migrants in the summer.
Great Britain wins the silver rugby-7 series when Fiji's state unit masterfully wins gold.
The impressive performance of the British team in the rugby-7 series ended on Thursday when, in the exciting finals at the Deodoro stadium in Rio Fiji, the national unit convincingly destroyed them with a score of 43:7.
Fiji demonstrated a master class in the management of the ball, the ball plays with its foot, the support game and the brutal force game, fighting gold, the first Olympic medal in its history.
The defeat brought a respectable comfort prize - the silver medal, which was Britain's third medal that day. The British team can be proud of its success in the first Olympic rugby-7 tournament in which they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The hard struggle in the semi-final, in which Boxing's team suffered defeat with a score of 7:5 days in the first half of the day, probably played off in the finals of Great Britain.
But in any case, Fiji’s team is now in its best form to win a team of 15 men.
Although unlikely, however, some consolation for Britain might be the fact that at least one British won a gold medal. It is Ben Ryan, the chief coach of Fiji's team, a former English coach from Wimbledon.
It was an exciting adventure for Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's leadership, they lost all the games in the rugby-7 series stage in Adelaide.
This time they lost only one game.
The defeat is painful, but growth is amazing.
Fiji spectacularly started a match by abducting Britain’s power for joy.
Captain Tom Mitchell and his companions were running on several opposite buses, and the World Series champions took the lead at 5:0 when Osea Kolinisau got the first landing.
In the last four minutes, Jerry Tuwai also increased the predominance by implementing the landing on the right wing.
The result is 12:0 and the British team hadn't even really touched the ball.
Michel’s excellent power did not allow the harrowing Leon Nakarava to score three points, but it had little effect on Fiji’s outcome.
In the seventh minute of the game Jasa Veremalua scored a landing in the right corner, strengthening the victory over Britain by 17:0.
After the overplay, Nakarava further increased the predominance and had more than a minute left... at the end of the first half of the time.
Vatemo Ravouvou avoided some clumsy British techniques and crossed the line to score points.
The landing resulted in a result of 29:0.
Fiji seemed to be born to play rugby-7 matches while the British were still studying.
In fact, that is also true.
The British team made a profound change in half-time, breaking the Fiji player line... full of four minutes, which was good at the first half-time standards, until Joshua Tuisov, after a fantastic team game, scored a few more points for the Fiji team.
Dan Norton managed to score points for the British team by landing in the left corner and scored 36:7, but the game was already lost, while the fans of South Sea islanders sang, waved flags and danced in podcasts.
Fiji’s happy life - style cannot be admired.
Mata Viliame made Fiji’s victory even sweeter with another landing at the end of the game.
At the end of the game, Fiji could celebrate, but the British were able to sit in the grass after the defeat.
In the first half of the day, Fiji won Japan with a score of 20:5, while the British were superior to South Africa, where the two teams won a very tough battle on the ground and the South Africans lost only a few points.
In the first half, Kyle Brown put up a boxing team, but in the second half, Den Norton, with his brilliant skill, crossed the line and took the ball between the poles, giving the British a victory.
Markus Watson, the brother of the English rugby-15 team player Antony, gave the team a victory and another silver medal at the end of the game.
The coach's fight with cancer inspired Helen Glover and Heter Staning to win the rowing race.
It will be the most emotional gold medal in these races, and it already speaks a lot.
From the first to the last cancer, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning’s golden moment played a special role in the Estacio da Lagoa track.
Although there are only two athletes in the boat, they were accompanied by Robin Williams' echoes, which inspired them to win the second Olympic gold medal for couples rowing women, becoming the first women in British sports history to achieve such success.
They were undoubtedly dominating, for the 39th time they won an unparalleled, unprecedented victory.
Both great athletes with the elegance of the swan glide on the surface of the water do not fully reflect this triumph.
Behind each gold medal, there is a whole team working hard to continuously improve their performance and the greatest contribution to their success has been made by a coach who just 30 months ago did not know if he would experience this day because he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to him, it disappeared as quickly as it appeared.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of those that can be operated and so happened.
If not, it would spread throughout the body.
And the situation would become uncontrollable.
It changes your vision a little.
Williams' cancer was discovered in December 2013.
This trio was lucky that William could start the recovery procedure at the beginning of the 2014 mid-season and reduce the duration of the break to a minimum, if you can say so.
I needed income, so I had to recover quickly.
This stimulated recovery.
I was in the hospital and went in distances of 6, 10 and even 15 metres, even though the doctor said that a few steps would be enough.
It all started.
Airing itself is a challenge, but this time it was even bigger.
After winning, the first idea was immediately about Williams, who was very worried all morning and talked more than usual under the influence of excitement.
Staning, who has served in the Royal Artillery Union in Afghanistan, said: "This was an emotional week, but it means a lot to me."
It just confirms how much it means to us and how much I, Helen and Robin have worked.
Helen and Robin have been great for three years.
Without Robin we would not have achieved anything, so huge thanks to him, he is the best coach in the world.
I can't imagine a better trainer or a better trainer.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost any race in five years.
A couple reach such a huge speed that competitors cannot compete with.
Even in the last 500 meters, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover were too high.
We felt every moment.
Helen shouted, "Keep the rhythm, keep the rhythm."
Do not lose concentration is really important.
We succeeded in a good start, but at the same time we did not have high expectations.
On that day, we didn't have the intention of overthrowing records, but just rowing well and winning the race, and we did.
A couple of years will rest to decide what to do next.
The next month will be the wedding of Glover and TV adventurer Steve Bashal.
For the time being, she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean this was my last race.
That would have been too much pressure.
It took me about six months in London to understand that I was the Olympic champion.
It was a new experience and I was very worried.
This time it took about four minutes.
She said, "The feeling is fantastic."

Koļegovu in the post of head of SRS "will be "to the last".
According to him, now Prime Minister Maris Kučinskis (Green and Farmers' Union) and Minister for Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Green and Farmers' Union) are already "essentially important" to confirm the post of the Minister of Finance Mr Koļegovs as Head of the SRS.
Rajevskis estimated that both Kučinskis and Reizniece-Ozolas in this government approval of the head of SRS is "the first big decision", which can affect their future as politicians.
If now it begins to change the position of the candidate for the post of Head of the SRS, then this will negatively affect their image in the state administration.
The agenda of the next meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers includes the issue of transfer of the Head of the VVD Koļegova to the post of the Director-General of the SRS, as evidenced by the government agenda.
Koļegovu was promoted to the post of Head of the SRS by Minister of Finance Reizniece-Ozola after Ināra Pētersone resigned from the management of the service and when the competition for the post of the SRS Director General ended without result.
On Thursday, August 11, in an interview with the Head of the SRS, Dace Grey, admitted that if she was offered to stand as a candidate for the post of Head of State, she could agree.
The Minister of Finance admitted that he did not consider other candidates for the post of Head of the SRS for the time being.
Raivis Dzintars, the head of the Saeima fraction of the National Association of Latvia, also admitted that the NA continues to support Koļegova under the guidance of the SRS.
In Spain, the failure to establish a government is putting at risk the potential for deficit reduction.
On 12 July a month ago, the European Commission (EC) expressed its opinion that Spain and Portugal had not taken sufficient measures to bring the deficit level down to the 3% of gross domestic product (GDP) required by the euro area.
Estimates show that despite the austerity measures implemented, Portugal's deficit at the end of last year was 4.4% of GDP and in Spain 5.1%.
The European Commission decided, however, not to impose economic sanctions on both countries, but at the same time to set fiscal targets for the coming period.
One of the reasons why the EC did not impose sanctions against these two countries is the growing Euroscepticism in many countries of the European Union.
Additional sanctions would only add to such a negative mood.
Critics point out, however, that the EC is not consistent in its decisions by agreeing on common rules from the outset and then failing to apply them in practice.
For example, the President of the German Bundesbank, Jens Veilmann, has pointed out that Europe is losing its trust in itself in this way, giving citizens the impression that the European Union's rules are recommending rather than binding.
The EC has now proposed, and all Member States have approved, to extend the deadline for correcting the deficit until the end of this year for Portugal and until 2018 for Spain.
The European Commission promises to examine the progress made by both countries in the coming months, while pointing out that both Spain and Portugal must be prepared to introduce additional austerity measures if circumstances require.
Initial forecasts indicate that the target for Portugal could be met within the specified time frame and that the deficit could drop to 2.5% of gross domestic product already this year.
This means that under the Stability Programme, this country's government must implement austerity measures of 0.25% of GDP this year.
These measures should be included in this year's budget, with an additional focus on the control of the costs of purchasing goods and services.
In the case of Spain, the situation is much more complicated.
This year the budget deficit should be reduced to 4.6%, next year to 3.1% and 2018 to 2.2% of GDP.
Moreover, over the next two years, consolidation measures should amount to 0.5% of GDP each year.
The fact that the Spanish political parties have not been able to agree on the establishment of a government for eight months makes it particularly difficult to achieve these objectives, and it is becoming more and more likely that Spain may have to hold early parliamentary elections for the third time in a year.
However, opinion polls show that the third elections would not change the political picture in the country substantially.
The most popular party is still the popular party led by the current Prime Minister, Mariano Rahoy, which would again receive almost 33% of the votes in the elections.
Only the Socialists have increased their popularity slightly, while the popularity of the Podemos parties against austerity measures or "Together we can" and "Ciudadanos" or "Citizens" has slightly diminished.
The People's Party wants to achieve socialist and "Ciudadanos" involvement in the government this month, otherwise it will not be possible to adopt and submit the draft 2017 budget to the European Commission for approval by mid-October.
According to Rafael Hernando, a representative of the Parliamentary faction of the People's Party, if the government fails and the parliamentary elections are held for the third time, Spain will become a laughing stock of Europe.
The cleanliness of beaches in the Gulf of Riga is critical.
After surveying the beaches for the fifth year, activists concluded that unfortunately the number of waste found is increasing each year, and most of the bathing sites are being blamed.
The most polluted bathing areas are located in Riga.
The capital city council explains that bathing areas are cleaned every day, but it is quite difficult to fight against dirty visitors.
In addition, waste left on land during rainfall can be washed into water, thus significantly impairing its quality.
With the exception of the Liepāja beach and certain places in Kurzeme, the purity of beaches elsewhere in Latvia is critical.
This is the announcement made this week by volunteers from the "My Sea" campaign.
While walking along the Gulf of Riga for the fifth year, activists concluded that the amount of waste left by residents has increased every hundred metres.
Unfortunately, this year this critical assessment has come in.
"We see that this will be a year when the amount of waste on the beach 100 meters may even exceed 200 units," says Jānis Ulme, representative of the expedition "My Sea".
The Latvian Radio called, he was on the beach of Tūja, where the voluntary march along the Gulf of Riga continues.
This year, activists have had to collect even fluorescent lamps left in the sand of the sea between various household waste and the remnants of picnics.
The participant and organizer of the tour Ulme says, it is the inhabitants who are responsible for the pollution.
"The main source is the beach visitors themselves, because more than half of the total waste is plastic, different waste, starting with bags, plastic pieces that are already in the process of degradation, they can no longer be identified, and for traps, bottles, corks," says Ulme.
Among the dirty beaches there are also bathing sites in Riga.
For example, in Daugavgriva, on average almost 800 waste units were collected every hundred metres, which is a critical lot.
The organisers of the campaign also explain that almost every step of the campaign is also subject to mockings and warning or prohibition signs.
"The average figures for all three bathing areas of Riga together - Daugavgrīva, Evening bulls and Vecķis - unfortunately come large and go far beyond the desired or goal, which Latvia is supposedly moving towards, to reduce the number of waste units to 135 units by 2020," concludes environmental defender.
Bathing in Riga takes place every day, on the hottest days of summer even twice, explains the representative of the City Council Uģis Vidauskas.
However, the struggle with dirty visitors is difficult.
We come back to the cultural issue of these people.
"Those who fertilise, drink alcohol, smoke and do all those things that are not allowed, even special signs do not work", says Vidauskas.
Vidauski therefore invites visitors to report pollutants to the police as well.
You can call the police, safely point to these violations and thus fight all.
Perhaps some new warnings can be put in place, but as I said, it is unlikely that this will radically change the situation.
"Since everyone should simply approach and be intolerant of such offenders together," he stresses.
Meanwhile, water quality measurements have been carried out for the fourth time this summer by the Health Inspectorate, which may impose a ban on official bathing areas.
This year, like other years, water quality is good and satisfactory everywhere.
At the moment, the situation is that all 56 bathing sites have always had good water quality and there are no bathing restrictions.
"For the last time we will take the analyses at the end of August", says Normunds Kadikis, Senior Environmental Health Specialist of the Inspection.
Waste left on land during heavy rainfall can be washed into water.
This in turn may affect its quality, says environmental specialist.
Rotations in the Russian elite continue - change of head in Putin's administration.
Did he leave his job?
Vladimir Putin has announced to Russian media that Sergei Ivanov wanted to leave this post himself and will henceforth be the president's special representative for nature protection, ecology and transport.
When he announced the changes, Putin commended Ivanov: "Honor Sergej Borisovich, we have been working together with you for many years and doing it successfully."
I am satisfied with the way in which you fulfil your responsibilities.
I remember well our agreement not to use you in this post of Head of the President's Administration for more than four years.
That is why I understand your desire to change the scope of activity.
And I hope that you will also make full use of your knowledge and experience in your new role.
However, it is highlighted that the leadership of the President's administration is a very important position and this made Ivanov one of the most influential people in the country.
In view of the forthcoming elections to the State Council in Russia next month, it has been rumoured that this step is linked to the fight for power in the Russian political elite.
Ivanov was also called a potential substitute for Putin in the post of President, therefore the claim that he himself wanted to hold the post of President of nature protection and transport has raised doubts.
According to the archives of Lsm.lv, Ivanov is the General Colonel of the KGB and the Federal Security Service.
Ivanov has been an old and close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He started his activities in special services in 1975, where he met Putin.
Later, when Putin became Head of the Federal Security Service, Ivanov became his deputy.
At the end of the reign of the first Russian President, Boris Yeltsin, was appointed Secretary of the Russian Security Council.
In 2000, after Putin came to power, Ivanov's "Information Security doctrine" was approved, which included the revitalisation of state censorship mechanisms in Russia.
In 2001, Sergei Ivanov became the Minister of Defence of Russia, but already in 2005 - Deputy Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov and was responsible for the development of Russian defence industry companies and arms exports.
Now, after leaving the office of Head of the President's Administration, Ivanov will also retain his seat in the Russian National Security Council, where the new Head of the President's Administration, Vaino, will also work.
The blame comes from the family's Soviet party elite.
The post of Head of the President's Administration was suggested by Ivanov himself.
Anton Eduardovich and I have been known for a long time.
Another time we worked under your leadership in the government.
And for the last almost five years, we have been in contact practically every day.
"That's why I'm sure that by all the professional and personal characteristics he's ready for this job", said Ivanov.
The blame comes from a family belonging to the elite of the Soviet party.
His grandfather Karl has held senior positions in the Estonian Communist Party, including ten years to 1988 as its first secretary.
The online edition Meduza refers to the book "Estonian Self-Determination and Independence" and says that at the end of the 1980s Karl Vaino asked Moscow to give permission to use force against demonstrators.
However, he had been refused and soon lost his job.
Shortly afterward, Vaino has moved to Moscow.
Anton Vaino has graduated from the Moscow Institute of International Relations and manages Japanese.
However, he has left the diplomatic service to work in the administration of the President's minutes.
It has already been reported that the removal and even arrests of several senior officials, including the replacement of governors and federal representatives, have rocked Russia in the last few countries.
According to political scientists, President Vladimir Putin rearranges the ruling elite before the 2018 elections.
One of the main features - more and more often, representatives of the structures of the forces are held in the leading positions.
Judado's fighter Nikiforenko also loses his first fight at the Olympic Games.
This was a fight in the first round, and the Latvian judo fighter has finished his participation in the Olympic Games, finishing in 17th place.
Coach Oleg Baskins admitted to Latvian Television that there was very little hope of Ņikiforenko, and it was already clear before the competition.
He also discovered that Judado’s wrestler suffered a shoulder injury.
It is noteworthy that in order to get to the Olympic sign, Nikiforenko had to start in a different weight category than usual - that is, in a weight category of up to 100 kilograms.
The Azerbaijani wrestler was 25 kilograms heavier.
As reported earlier, Jevgeny Borodovko stood for two and a half minutes against Rjunosuki in a fight of up to 100 kilograms in weight until the opponent succeeded in a clean victory.
Consequently, Latvia has finished the judo race in Rio.
Dreams disappear in Rio's sand.
Judist Yevgeny Borodavko entered the Thursday.
Yes, he had a more titled opponent in return, but the ambitious can surprise at times.
He didn't.
Artūrs Ņikiforenko's task was even more complex, because the experience is smaller and the opponent is also respectable.
The result is similar, even though he stayed on the tatami for almost a half minutes longer than Borodavko.
Unfortunately, in recent times, the Latvian judiists lack the most ambitions.
Since Gunārs Ķirsons and his financial studio Vladimirs Šestakovs, Aleksandrs Jackevičs left Latvia, "Golden Score" is no longer taking place.
Jackevich, who advises Kazakh judists here, and Vsevold Zelony, does not see the heirs.
But if he doesn't grow, he won't.
And that's the federation's prerogative.
Therefore, as from another galaxy in "Rīta panorama", the President of the Latvian Judo Federation promised Rio to win medals.
Flight far from reality.
In the evening we were eagerly waiting for the beach volleyball match Samoilovs/Šmēdins - Evandru/Pedru Solbergs.
Intriga as already in the "death" group - losers of the game ended.
The duet of Latvia had a slight derogation - it could also lose, but not more than four points in two sets.
The tension was increased by the long-standing previous game.
No one wanted to die -- this feeling over the windy girdled the whole length of the match.
The gust wind caused additional difficulties for the players.
At first, it seemed to be an ally of ours - which is more comprehensive -.
But it didn't.
It was quite easy to play against the Latvian duet here.
Serve so to Samoylov and wait for him to burst.
In the end of the first set and in the beginning of the third, the load was no joke.
Smödiņš was able to fish at that time, because the work was few, but when he was, he did it for honor.
Brazilian Samoilov and Smédin could win two sets, because the first took the lead with 16:15, but the 16 also remained, reaching the lost score limit.
But it could also be lost at 0:2 because in the second set the deficit was -4, but also thanks to the wind, we managed to win.
The third was on Evandro's serves.
The chain was formed: the inconclusive core, the second pass often flies too close to the net, and Samoylov left very few options for a successful attack.
If there was a stranger to the Cubans in the square Samoilov, this time he worked better, and only Sasha would the loss be unprofessional.
The Kremlin was wrong too, and enough symbolically, he was hit by the last bomb in the block.
Lost the team.
This time there was definitely a lack of success: in the third set alone, two of Evandro's attacks almost flew out of the court, but the ball hit the line.
There were two passages next to the line.
The contentious episode also benefited the adversaries.
If Evandro wrestled with servings in the first two games, they were very productive against ours.
All aggregated in the loss on the tabloe.
Now the causes of failure need to be examined calmly.
Maybe it was like living next to the stadium, not with a delegation in the Olympic village.
Two and a half hours went by.
A series of seven semifinals may have given some confidence.
Maybe Klagenfurt shouldn't have been played, but sooner come here and better acclimatise.
Maybe there was a mistake in finding the top of the athletic form.
For now, more questions than answers.
Our Buddhists are out of the game.
The dream of medals is over.
What's next?
There are still some World Cup tournaments and also Jurmala's Masters.
Smēdiņš and Samoylovs have never been and will not be friends in their lives, because there are too different personalities.
But that is not necessary either.
When the dream of the Olympic medals has collapsed, the idea of divorce can also arise, because the blame will be sought not only within itself, but also in the partner.
It is not difficult to decide, but it will be much harder to find a worthy partner in Latvia.
Both brothers play the bee, but John and Tom have already tried and divorced, while Mikhail Samoilov is still too green to begin conquering the world's peaks.
You can try to return to Harald Regzi, Alexander Soloveja, Edgars Toča, but it will not be better than this option, which proved itself not only once in the World Cup stages.
Cocaban sand did not smile at them this time.
And that's it.
Of course, we also need to take into account the fact that beach volleyball is becoming more popular, new couples are entering the circulation, and only the few have a height of less than two metres.
It does not guarantee success yet, but there is an important argument in the fight for victory.
Ours don't stay longer.
Both athletes and journalists have the opportunity to live in the places offered by the game organisers, as well as to choose their own.
The U.S. basketball team lives on a cruise ship; some tennis players do not stay in the Olympic village.
Also, some beach volleyball players have found a hotel in Kopokaban.
This time, quite modest accommodations offered to journalists were charged with very excessive prices.
That's why the choice fell on the apartment rent.
The risk is, because sometimes they can be uncomfortable from a logistical point of view.
This time the risk is justified.
Together with Vladimir Vladimirovich, we rent apartments on the Copacabana-Ipanema border.
The beach is 200 meters away, half an hour's walk in the pool arena.
The district is safe enough, because the favela is far away, but you must not lose your vigilance here either.
Vladimir Vladimirovich is not what some think about right away, but the most professional sports journalist in Russian media Vladimir Ivanov.
P.S. Looks like another medal dream was dreamed up on Friday morning.
Laura Ikauniece-Admidiņa left behind her personal records in 100 meters of barrier running and high jumping.
But there are already five disciplines.
After a 10-year break, "Porgy and Bess" sounds in Liepaja.
In Latvia, opera "Porgy and Bess" was first studied in 1973 at the Latvian National Opera.
Since then, the internationally recognized masterpiece has not been reintroduced.
That is why the organisers of the Cēsis Art Festival and the Liepaja Art Forum have decided in close cooperation to give the audience an opportunity to enjoy George Gērsvina's masterpiece.
"We are very pleased that after a 10-year break, when Liepaja was able to enjoy the opera production for the last time, this great version of George Gershvin's "Porghie and Bess" opera concert is to be enjoyed with us in the new, newly discovered concert hall "Great Amber", says Baiba Bože, the head of the concert hall "Great Ambers".
Opera "Porgy and Bess" is a story about love, its volatility, passion, as well as everyday tragedies and simple everyday pleasures.
It reflects African American vitality, music, and rhythm.
It is precisely this lack of political correctness in this opera, this exclusion of tolerance makes it so lively.
"And yes, this love story is extremely powerful, extremely beautiful and in some way really deep", says director Viesturs Kairišs.
What I like most - listening to or playing this opera are always such stops - famous tunes, famous motifs, but these transitions from one character to another, illuminating one character or another character, or choirs, or orchestras.
"It's the most exciting, this building", opera is appreciated by the musical director and conductor Andris Poga of the concert studio of opera "Porgy un Bessa".
Visitors to the Opera agree that this is a grand event.
They are very happy to hear this world famous Gērsvina opera.
Blessed that Liepaja can feel the world's breath.
"Execution professional", opera is appreciated by visitor Edgars Lāms.
The concert was special because for the first time the orchestra was playing at the new concert hall "Great Amber" and for the first time there was an opera concert performance.
The square next to the renovated building of the Art Museum could be named after Janis Rozentals.
Riga Vice-Senior Andris Ameriks announced at the opening of the Rozentāls exhibition that the museum's own address in the future could be not Krišjāņa Valdemāra iela 10a, but Janis Rozentāls laukums 1.
The director of the museum, Māra Lāce, admitted that re-registration of the address would create a considerable bureaucratic burden, but in general this idea is welcomed and therefore accepted the initiative of the municipality.
The city of Riga has laid a kind of foundation for this idea in 1936 by creating Burkards Dzeņa monument to Janis Rozentāls, who is standing next to the museum.
Wilhelm Purvītis, then director of the museum, was one of the initiators of this monument.
In this way, this further action could be purely logical.
But Wilhelm Purvītis, where are we gonna put his name?
"But if you promise to think, Mr. America," said Lace.
After extensive reconstruction and modernisation, the building of the National Museum of Art officially opened its doors this May.
This week the reconstruction of the VEF Culture Palace will finally begin.
The castle will be restored by SIA "Velve" by approximately 11 million euros.
It is planned to renovate several rooms of the castle, including two spectator halls, as well as to adapt the building to people with reduced mobility.
The Riga City Council intends to raise six million euros of European Union funds for the project, however, Oleg Burov, the Director of the Property Department of Riga City Council, admits that for the time being, there is not yet complete clarity about the European funds for the project.
"Despite the fact that the political will to start repairs at the VEF Culture Palace with the involvement of the European Structural Funds is, we are waiting for months for a decision, real action from the Ministry of Finance officials, it will be the money granted or not", Burovs says.
Last December, we were told that everything depends on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance received a letter from the European Commission that you are making your own decision that Brussels is not taking a decision here.
Now we see that another circle of discussion is emerging again, so we will see what we can expect in the coming days.
"I would like to say that the Riga City Council undoubtedly guarantees that this process will be started and completed in due time", Burovs points out.
As reported earlier, more than a year ago, in March 2015, VEF Culture Palace collectives organized a farewell concert before the immediate renovation of the building.
Although a year has passed, the renovation of the building was still not started and collectively continued to work under inappropriate conditions.
In the strategy of the Property Department of Riga City Council, the renovation of the VEF Culture Palace is divided into seemingly independent reconstruction works, where each will ensure the implementation of different functions of the castle.
The first is increasing the accessibility of the VEF Culture Palace and improvement of the surrounding area.
It will arrange the surroundings and engineering communications, as well as restore the facade of the building.
The second is improvement of the services offered by VEF Culture Palace.
It plans to restore the building's interior, walls and ceilings, improve the stage and sound recording studio, as well as arrange the building's internal engineering communications.
Third - Improvement of working conditions of creative amateur collectives, which includes plans to improve workshop equipment, space heating and ventilation systems.
Before the 40th anniversary of "Līvu", you can get acquainted with the legendary rock group at the exhibition in Liepāja.
The exhibition will present various characteristic objects of "Līvus" - photographs arranged in a time line to reflect the group's activities from the beginning until 2010, when the group's activities are announced.
Participants will also show stage costumes, musical instruments, awards and concert records, as well as other things that had not yet been seen for the general public, reflecting the creative work of the group "Līvi".
The exhibition will be supplemented with objects of the Liepaja Museum's collection.
The exhibition's visual design has been created in collaboration with the fashion artist and painter Elita Patmalniece.
Musicians who have been associated with the group "Līvi" and their relatives responded to the call and shared both objects and memories.
The origins of "Līvu" can be found in 1972, when a vocal instrumental ensemble, led by Juris Pavitols, is created in Liepāja Culture House.
In its original composition, the ensemble participated in the festival "Liepājas amber" in 1972 and 1974, as well as in the city and republic shows.
In 1976, the fateful meeting took place, when Juris Pavitols met with Ēriks Ķiģelis and Metalurgs in the cultural palace, and invited to join Ingrids Gutmanis, Andris Krūzins and Jānis Grodums.
Over the years, the group’s membership has become more than once.
Participants have joined, others have gone their way, some have returned.
Above all, however, the desire to confirm that Latvian rock music is able to live and exist has remained unchanged.
"What to see was not lacking - jeans, hairy and bearded, these boys were clearly different from the stereotype of the generally accepted stage singer," says music reviewer Klaas Vāvere about the band.
In addition to the musicians mentioned above, such outstanding musicians as Igo, Vilnis Krieviņš, Modris Šterns, Valdis Štarks, Laimis Rācenājs, Tālis Pusbarnieks, Ainars Virga, Aivars Brīze, Guntars Mucenieks, Dainis Virga, Toomas Kleins and many others have worked in the group.
Entrance is free of charge.
The exhibition is open from August 19 to October 30.
On August 27, at the Liepāja Concert Garden "Pūt, winds" the group "Līvi" will host the 40th anniversary celebration "Līvi" "Livifest 2".
Bulgaria is experiencing inflation for the first time in 8 months.
In July, Bulgarian national statistics showed 1% monthly inflation.
This is the highest since 2012 and the first above zero since October last year when it was positive (0.2%).
Average annual inflation after PCI, in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016), compared to the previous year, was -0.8%.
In July 2016, the consumer price index was 101.9% compared to the previous year and the monthly average inflation was 1.0%.
Since the beginning of the year, the inflation rate was -0.2% (July 2016 compared to December 2015) and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016 prices for the following groups of consumer goods were rising: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); entertainment and cultural events (6.3%); hotels and restaurants (1.2%); household goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and footwear (2.2%); home appliances, household appliances and regular house cleaning (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the previous month's level for alcohol and tobacco, management, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Zbigniew Stankevich: The time is coming, and the truth is rising.
The Archbishop of the Latvian Catholic Church, metropolis Zbigniew Stankevich, in an interview with the Independent, emphasizes that if we want to gain the strength of life, the Gospel message must be placed at the centre of it.
For the power of the truth is greater than that of evil.
Many are already on their way to the reception of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Aglona.
What message will believers receive this year?
In recent years, the pope’s nuncius expressed his desire to lead the main service in Aglona.
The main message is therefore in his hands.
It also turned out to be a kind of tradition that Bishop Jānis Bulis is leading the cross path.
He himself will make his own message.
I've been conducting a Christmas vigil service the previous day.
Last year I turned to Pope Francis's encyclical "Laudato si" and updated the common house, the Earth's theme in the context of Latvia.
This year... Of course, I'm watching what's going on in the world, and I'm trying to respond to it in my speech.
My approach coincides with the church's suggestion that the Gospel message should be put at the heart of life.
It must be shown that the Gospel responds to the most painful problems of human life and inspires him to go further.
Then it speaks to people.
But in Cesis, in the Lamp discussion, you said that "you should return to the understanding of the full man".
What do you mean?
Does this mean that a person is turning away from the church message?
And does the church today have the resource of such a return?
In the capital of India, a man who died on the side of the road is robbed.
In the capital of India, no one seems to be aware of a dead man who died on the side of the road - it turns out that he slept for an hour on the side of the road and then was robbed, informs the BBC.
A man identified as Matibule has been reported to have traveled by means of a prick during the day and worked as a guard at night.
Matibule at 5:30 a.m. went home on the road when a car hit him.
The camera record shows that the driver stepped out of the car to look at the victim, and then left.
After an hour, when no one seems to be aware of the bleeding man, he was robbed by a sorcerer.
About 90 minutes after the crash, the police arrived and the victim was taken to a hospital where he died.
Inga Koļegova, the Head of the State Environmental Service, has rescued the government from the fall, believes that Ojārs Skudra, an associate professor of the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Latvia, has withdrawn his candidacy to the post of the Director General of the State Revenue Service (SRS).
The explanation of the Koļegova regarding the withdrawal of the candidacy due to the contradictions in the ruling coalition is due to the fact that she has prevented the fall of the government.
In a conversation with agency LETA said that it was hard for him to imagine that next week at the government meeting "Unity" would support Koļegova's candidacy.
Consequently, if the 'Unity' ministers were to vote against, but Koļegov would still be confirmed in office, this would lead to a resignation of the government.
The expert also considers that prior to the announcement of withdrawal of the candidacy Koļegova has consulted both the Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola and Prime Minister Māris Kučinskis.
At the same time, it was also a concession to "Unity", which strongly opposed her candidacy.
When predicting whether the competition would be successful in finding a suitable candidate, Skudra admitted that there are two options: either a compromise figure will be chosen or the institution will continue to be managed by Dace Grey as acting Director-General.
At the same time, he points out that if the Minister of Finance had so far argued that no other candidate was being considered, it was a hint to the Grey that she should not be allowed to participate in the competition.
LETA has already announced that the Head of the State Environmental Service Koļegova has decided to withdraw his candidacy for the post of the Director-General of the SRS.
Due to the "Unity" objections, the government postponed the approval of Koļegova as the Director-General of the SRS for a week.
After the decision of the government to postpone the decision Koļegova confirmed that it is still ready to become the head of the SRS.
Later, however, she changed her mind: in her application to the Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola, on Friday, she points out that she withdraws her consent to transfer to the post of Head of the SRS and this is not an easy choice for her.
The press secretary of Prime Minister Māra Kučinskis Andrejs Vaivars explained to LETA that a new competition would be held for the vacant post of the Director-General of the SRS.
There was an accident in the centre of Riga involving a police car.
In the centre of Riga this afternoon there was a road traffic accident involving the State Police car.
The police car has rushed to the highest category call with sound and light signals until Krišjāņa Barona and Dzirnavu Street cross with another car.
The police explain the circumstances, but preliminary information indicates that the other vehicle has not missed the police car.
A woman has suffered an accident.
This year, the population in Riga has dropped
At the beginning of this year there were 638 784 inhabitants in Riga, which is 0.34% less than in 2015, when 641,000 people were officially registered in the capital, LETA informed the Central Statistical Bureau (CSP).
In terms of population, the capital of Latvia ranks 30th among the capitals of the European Union (EU) countries and the large cities with a population of more than one million.
According to the EU's statistical office "Eurostat", Riga has the highest proportion of women – the capital of Latvia is the most convincing place among Europe's largest cities with 127 women per 100 men.
All three Baltic capitals have the highest proportion of women in Europe's largest cities: in Vilnius, they are 123 and in Tallinn, 121 women per 100 men.
Warning pictograms will be placed at the LNMM.
In the next few days, warning signs will be placed at the Latvian National Museum of Art (LNMA) - pictograms, and the representative of the Property Department of Riga City Council Baiba Gailīte told LETA.
Currently, the repair of damage to the museum’s glazed atrium, which was the result of skateboarding, has been successfully completed.
Warning pictograms will be placed near it in the next few days.
Its inhabitants will be told that the surface can be slippery during rain and snow, and it cannot be moved by cars, as well as by bikes, roller skates, and skateboards.
Ušakovs wrote about this in the social network "Facebook" at the time, who pointed out that no damage to security is caused, but "thinks inexorably" and skateboarders "will come to drive".
New playgrounds for children and parents have been set up in Riga.
During this summer season, Riga Municipality has installed two more new playgrounds in the city, Ķīpsala and Čiekurkalns, which are already available for children.
On the beach of Ķīpsala there is a large, multifunctional playship with various climbing elements, bridges, games, pipes and slides.
The playground is designed for children of all ages.
The field also has swings and different balancing elements.
The world of Fantasy is filled with the location of the attraction on the coast of Daugava with the view of the passenger port and the cruise ships seen there.
In the playground between the 4th and 5th cross-lines of Čiekurkalns there is a gaming house, trampoline, step track, balance bridge, swings, toy balls and other elements of the game, as well as a gymnastics area with rings of strength and coordination trainings, contemporaries and other elements of the sport.
Under the field wrapped rubber cover in various colors.
A new, colorful pavement was inserted from the street to the playground.
A reconstructed section of the road was discovered in the honey.
Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis, management of VAS Latvijas Valsts ceļi (LVC), as well as representatives of construction companies SIA "Binders" and local governments today discovered the reconstructed state main road border Russia (Gebneva) - Rezekne-Daugavpils-Lithuanian border (Medumi) (A13) from Medumi to Lithuanian border (156,4-163,05 km).
Roads are the country's business card, especially the border roads, so it is particularly gratifying to discover a reconstructed section on the border with our southern neighbours.
This is another example of how the co-financing of European Union funds improves the situation on the main national roads.
"As the forecasts show, the funds available for roads in this planning period will be acquired already in 2018, and we have to think about how to continue maintaining the most congested roads in very good quality, and also to ensure mobility of the population in all regions of Latvia without European Union funding", stressed Uldis Augulis by cutting the symbolic tape.
The Minister of Transport also pointed out that proposals prepared by traffic experts on sustainable financing of Latvian roads in the near future will be presented to the government.
Construction works from Medumi to the Lithuanian border (156.4.-163.05 km) SIA Biders started last year and this year they continued after the technological break.
The cost of reconstruction is EUR 13.5 million (including VAT), the project was co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
"The reconstructed road section has completely restored road construction and next year repairs will be started in the next stage from Medums to Daugavpils itself, thus the entire road from the Lithuanian border to Daugavpils will be arranged," said Jānis Lange, Chairman of the Board of the LVC.
The country's main roads are the most congested, and by 2018 we intend to ensure that all the main roads in the country are in good condition.
The next task will be to maintain them in good quality, ensuring timely periodic maintenance and replacing the asphalt top layer every 7-9 years.
"It will, of course, require adequate funding, and all the travellers look forward to the proposals made by the expert group to improve the road financing system", noted Lange.
Within the framework of the project, road connections and lighting are arranged in the Hunting Centre.
Significant land works have been carried out: in four stages large-scale thawing and large-scale oblivion and embankment works, a smoothed longitudinal profile of the road, which has so far been very uneven.
Public transport stops have also been restored and a turning point for public transport has been rebuilt.
Previously, the road had insufficient bearing capacity and the terrain was not transparent due to mountainous valleys as well as the old road of a common terrain.
In the next construction season it is planned to restore the road section from Daugavpils city border to the now reconstructed section (144,80 km-156,40).
This year, the LVC plans to perform more types of works than 1100 kilometres of national roads.
Information on all planned repairs on the national road network is available on the website of LVC www.lvceli.lv.
"To achieve the desired weight loss results, the right choice of food mixes is very important", says Lithuanian nutritionist Laura Romeraite-Kuklieriene.
In addition, it is easy to do it during the summer period, when our own gardens grow fresh fruits, berries and vegetables.
A well-thinked combination of dietary products can help not only reduce weight but also purposefully promote various body processes.
Macarones and vinegar are a successful combination because they provide a long-lasting satiety and help to fight fat.
Studies published in the European Clinical Nutrition Journal have shown that vinegar has a beneficial effect on blood glucose and helps us to feel perplexed.
Cayenne pepper and protein-rich food, such as poultry or protein cocktail, create not only a feeling of satiety but also reduces the cravings after large meals at the next meal.
Such a combination of foods can also increase the amount of calories burned after a meal up to 35%.
Studies have shown that cayenne pepper can help to get rid of the layers of fat in the abdomen.
The egg contains a metabolising nutrient called choline, while paprika is a good source of vitamin C.
Adequate intake of these nutrients may reduce cortisol levels, and hence fat accumulation around the middle of the body.
Oat flakes, to which fresh berries have been added, is another delicious and fat - burning meal for breakfast, which is worth including in your menu.
Oat flakes and berries contain fibers that, according to Canadian scientists, control the sense of grelin - an appetite stimulating hormone - and thus the feeling of hunger.
In addition, berries contain polyphenols, which help reduce weight and prevent the formation of fat.
Vegetables and proteins are also able to perform miracles in weight reduction.
Such a combination can create a feeling of satiety.
The vegetables contain water and fiber, so they contribute to the feeling of satiety.
At the same time, proteins slow down the digestive process and provide a feeling of satiety for longer.
For lunch you can eat chicken with salads or make a protein cocktail from the finished mixture and enjoy it with your favorite vegetables.
What combinations of products to avoid.
Fruits contain sugars, monosaccharides or disaccharides, compounds of one or two molecules.
On the other hand, starch in vegetables is a polysaccharide.
Fruits decompose mechanically into the stomach, while chemically they do not decompose until they reach the third or fourth degree of digestion that occurs in the intestines.
The starch breaks down into three different stages that begin already in the mouth.
Therefore, it is important not to eat sweet food immediately after a meal.
When eating sweet food immediately after a meal, it is "blocked" in the stomach along with other dishes, where it is not chemically digested and begins to blow.
Do not eat bread, potatoes, peas, bananas, dates or other products containing carbohydrates with lemons, lime, oranges, grapefruit, pineapples or other acidic fruits.
The enzyme ptialin, which is found in saliva, only works in an alkaline environment.
In addition to inhibiting carbohydrate digestion, fruit acids also contribute to their fermentation.
Do not eat eggs and meat, nuts and meat, cheese and eggs or cheese and nuts, meat and milk, eggs and milk or nuts and milk and similar combinations of protein-rich products in one meal.
They require different digestive juices, each of them with different strengths, characteristics and time to reach the stomach.
Watermelon, honeymelon, muskmelone and other melons must always be eaten separately from other dishes.
Melons are not digested if they are in the stomach with other foods.
Fat in combination with protein-rich products.
Fats form a successful combination with starch, however, the same cannot be said of fat and protein - fats hinder protein digestion.
Proteins can be combined with a very small amount of fat.
If high levels of protein products are consumed, avoid total fat consumption.
This also applies to the freshing - it is not recommended to combine large amounts of nuts (contains proteins) with healthy avocados (contains fat).
Such a combination prevents effective weight loss.
How to cook?
"Food preparation, heat treatment leads to a significant loss of nutrients - about 15% to 55% of the initial nutrient content of the products", says Dietologist.
In most cases, nutrients go to waste, cooking food in water.
However, the nutritional value of some foods increases by cooking directly.
It is recommended to use the liquid left after cooking for soup preparation - in this case you will not lose any nutrients left in the water and you will be able to eat them later.
It is recommended to prepare vegetables, including by steaming them.
Thermal treatment significantly increases the bioavailability of lycopene contained in tomatoes.
The amount of lycopene increases by 25% when boiling tomatoes for 30 minutes.
Thermal treatment also significantly increases the bioavailability of betacarotene in red, yellow, orange plants such as tomatoes, carrots, sweet potatoes and spinach.
Heat treatment of eggs and meat takes away the natural properties of the proteins contained therein, making them more digestible.
The heat treatment of meat and eggs also makes iron and other minerals in these products easier to absorb in the body.
It should also be borne in mind that freezing products can reduce the amount of vitamin C from 10% to 90%, while freezing fiber does not affect it.
Beans in combination with tomatoes can increase iron intake in the body, which in turn provides better brain and muscle function.
Our body absorbs up to 33% of non-blood-producing iron found in plant products such as beans, leafy herbs, cereal products, than blood-producing iron found in animal products such as beef, fish and chicken.
You can significantly increase the absorption of non-blood-forming iron in your body by eating non-blood-forming iron-containing products along with sources of vitamin C, such as oranges, tomatoes and berries.
Vitamin C helps to change non-blood-forming iron so that our body absorbs it more easily.
Iron is needed for the production of haemoglobin, which provides oxygen supply to the muscles and brain.
To get maximum benefit from salads, add healthy fat to them, such as olive or linseed oil.
When preparing salmon sandwiches, add vitamin D-rich salmon or sardine-free yogurt, which is a good source of calcium.
Vitamin D increases the amount of calcium absorbed from the gut and plays an important role in bone formation.
Oats (as well as other whole-grain products) together with sources of vitamin C, such as strawberries, blackcurrants, raspberries and other fruits or berries, help to stabilise cholesterol levels and avoid blockage of the arteries.
Snapchat "Anime" effect is criticised for Asian cartooning
Snapchat's representatives say that this filter is inspired by animation, but some commentators argue that it is racistly insensitive.
With this lens effect Snapchat allows 150 million users to change reality in a rather absurd way and to play with their identity.
You can turn yourself into an pineapple, a dog, or an image that fits into Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Lens are foggy, image-distorting instruments that generate more than 30 million modified selfies per day.
Any error shall quickly become public.
Snapchat's lens effects have already been criticised in the past, while receiving accusations that the application promotes too black or light facial skin tones as a benchmark of ideal beauty.
This week, the new lens effects were published, allowing users to create cracks in eyes, split teeth and round cheeks, and some critics called it a racist Asian cartoon – “yellow face”.
The question was also asked whether such contradictions did not suggest that the company had greater problems with diversity.
News and public accidents flared up on Wednesday, when the expenditures “The Verge” and “Motherboard” announced that lens effects had been removed from the application.
The company explained that the objective of the lens is to depict Anime characters, not to cariculate people of Asian origin.
However, for those who have experienced racism, these effects resembled painful stereotypes.
Others categorically denied the illustration of Anime.
The record of the Korean-born American art student Grace Sparapani Twitter gained a broad resonance. In an e-mail, she indicates that lens effects are "anointing and uncomfortable, not to say more".
She added that it was difficult not to notice the obvious similarities between Asian cartoons and lens effects.
This suggests that the lens effect is not simply a yellow face, but a yellow face in the sense of racism.
Snapchat is not the only company that has fallen into this cultural trap.
American culture is also involved in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from business meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices we use on a daily basis.
And Snapchat's large youth audience, representing different races, is more sensitive to such things than older people.
If Snapchat lenses create an image that offends users, then "Today such things do not go unnoticed", said 25-year-old Katie Jou in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, the product manager of Medium company Jou deleted his Snapchat application and advised others to do the same.
In her article “Medium” and telephone interview, she explained that in her opinion problems with race arise due to Snapchat’s employment policy, which does not sufficiently support racial diversity.
Jou criticised the management of the company, which mainly consists of white men and then ended his article with reference #DeleteSnapchat.
"This means that there is no racial diversity in the company, so such decisions are allowed. Do some representatives of other races work in the company, but they do not hold such a position as to be able to express their opinion safely and comfortably", says Chinese-American Jou.
Others share her view, while Snapchat has not responded to her complaint.
The company does not disclose how many employees represent different races, indicating that they are a private company.
Snapchat refused to discuss the origin of its employees, but its representative found that the company had hired a staff specialist who would focus on the presence in the company of racial minorities, who were not widely represented and would encourage inclusion in the company.
Jou will not renew his Snapchat account, adding: "It is interesting whether they really need more users like us to understand that this is not the right thing."
The Congress Chamber declares that the reports on the Islamic State have been distorted by military officials.
In a statement issued on Thursday, the Congress Chamber notes that the U.S. Central Command has distorted the reports, depicting war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria more optimistic than is actually the case.
The Central Command Intelligence Analysts express general dissatisfaction with the provisional report of the Task Force created by the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Republics of the Defence Financing Sub-Committee, stating that their leadership controlled reports on American progress in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command known as Centcom is the military base in Tampa, Florida, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The latest news on this report indicates that the intelligence reports, endorsed by the senior leaders of Centcom, reflect the US's fight against terrorism more positively than is actually the case. The facts were regularly distorted, reflecting better results than other intelligence analyses suggest.
Ken Calvert, a representative of the Republic of California, says: "Centcom's behaviour is unacceptable: it is our soldiers who suffer when our policy makers receive false reports."
Centcom’s management errors can be found in the organisation’s top management.
This 10-page long report shows in detail the current problems in the reflection and analysis of the Central Command on the efforts of the Americans to prepare the Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although it does not provide conclusive evidence that senior officials of the Obama administration have forced the messages to be distorted, it shows that Centcom's leadership has put some pressure on analysts to reflect a more optimistic view of the threats posed by the Islamic state (also known as ISIS or ISIL).
The report indicates that in the first half of 2015, press releases, statements and reports from central government showed the situation to Congress in a significantly more positive light than it was in fact.
For example, Centcom's representatives publicly announced that the Mosul recovery operation could start as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul is Iraq's second largest city, still under the control of the Islamic State.
Mike Pompeo, a representative of the Republican Party in Kansas, says in his report: "A number of months' investigation clearly confirms this."
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the US Central Management Chiefs misunderstood the reports, depicting ISIS threats in Iraq weaker than they were in fact.
The Republican Party formed a working group to learn that analysts are concerned that information about the Islamic State is being distorted.
As the investigation continues, the report published on Thursday will be followed by new findings in this case.
The Inspector General of the Ministry of Defence conducts an investigation into the activities of the Centcom intelligence service.
The members of the Democrat Party of the Intelligence Administration Committee published their own report on Thursday, in which they agree with some of the conclusions of the Working Party of the Republican Party.
In his report, the Democrat spokesperson Adams B. Shif reported that, from 2014 to 2015, Centcom too limited the preparation of intelligence assessment reports in relation to ISIS and Iraqi security forces.
Mr. Shifa explains that this process "stopped the dissemination of information", worsened the ethics of analysts' work, and "dispersed facts that were not true."
But Shif and members of the Democrat Party added that there was no evidence that White Nam had put pressure on Centcom analysts to produce reports according to "pre-defined or political stance".
The Daily Beast published the preliminary results of the Congress investigation on Thursday.
In August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon Inspector General opened an investigation following complaints from Centcom analysts.
The Pentagon representative, Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, announced that the Pentagon would not comment on the convention report until the investigation continued.
He also added that experts sometimes interpret complex data differently, and the Ministry of Defence and the Intelligence Authority called for a constructive dialogue on vital national security issues.
The investigation is not limited to the question of whether the American-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is successful (a claim made by an increasing number of representatives of the Ministry of Defence).
But last year's accusations call into question whether President Obama can fully rely on reports from the Central Government on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hot spots.
Criticism about Islamic State Intelligence reminds us of more than ten years of events when Centcom's intelligence analyst Gregory Hukker published a study claiming that George W. Bush's Administration launched an Afghan war, thinking too little about its possible consequences.
He also played an important role in the discovery of the Islamic State's intelligence issue.
Last year, official representatives reported that Hobker's team found that, in contrast to public reports, air raids at Islamic State oil plants did not significantly worsen the financial situation of the terrorist group because they had built temporary plants to sell oil on the black market.
The Times of September reported that this discovery did not go beyond the walls of Central Management.
General Lloyd Austin III, Commander of Centcom at that time, received sharp criticism because many lawmakers believed that war reports described the situation too positively.
In April, General Austin retired and replaced General Joseph L.Wotell.
In the U.S. duel with Britain in the field hockey, wins the U.S., thereby winning the fourth victory in a row.
The day after winning over Japan with a score of 6:1, Thursday Katie Bama scored the first two goals for the US women's field hockey team when Americans beat the Indian team with a score of 3:0.
Five goals in two games are an unforgettable achievement, but 27 - year - old Bama said that she could not remember or that she would ever have succeeded.
She said, "I have no idea."
I am not one of those people who count their gates.
But she knows that the American score in the Olympics is 4:0, which gives them a draw in their group with Britain, which on Thursday after winning over Japan with a score of 2:0 remained undefeated.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday to play the last match in the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for a quarterfinals and the game will only determine which team will take the first place in the group of six teams and whose second.
The winner of the first place will avoid a meeting with a strong Dutch team leader for the second group for a little longer.
In spite of the Saturday game, Americans have already called a surprise storm, taking the last place in London four years ago among the 12 teams.
The team also had Bama
She grew up in Blubel, she first took a field hockey blackjack at the age of 3 (his older twin sisters were already doing this sport in Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16 years old, becoming the latest player in the history of the team.
She didn't attend the 2008 Olympics because she didn't end up in the finals.
But 2012 was a failure for her and her team.
The following year the Englishman Craig Parham was appointed as a team coach and everything changed for the better.
Bama called it "cultural, mental and physical change."
We did not invest as much in London as we do now.
We have changed everything.
In Thursday's game Bama revealed the result by winning the goal in the first half-time with a rear throw from a close distance.
India started the game without winning in his account, but their selection was very fierce and kept a minimum score of 0:1 until the end of the third period when Bama repeatedly scored the goal.
She introduced the ball into the anti-inflammatory zone on the left side of the field, then she noticed getting to the middle of the field and putting the ball into the counter-inflammatory gates, putting the American woman under 2:0.
In the middle of the fourth period, Melissa Gonzales scored another goal.
This was the first U.S. Gateguard Jackie Briggs dry game, each of the first three games running through one gate.
She's running in.
And so does Bama.
"We're going very well right now," said Paham, but how good, will show you the game on Saturday.
The most depressing food in the depression period is "The Fatal Meal"
In March 1933, shortly after being elected president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in an oval room to have a meal.
President Roosevelt tasted such fine culinary delicacies as goose liver pâté, or fuagara, and Maryland turtle soup.
But that day his meal was much more modest: packed eggs in tomato sauce, potato porridge and dessert - plum pudding.
Jane Ziegelmane says, "It's a way to show solidarity in cooking with people who were very hard to deal with."
Her husband, Andrew Kou, adds, "It's also a message to the Americans how to eat."
A couple of Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
Kou's last book "Sorry" describes Chinese cuisine in America, but Ziegelmane in her book "97 Ābeles" describes life through food at the rental house in the eastern lower part of Manhattan.
Their new joint work "The Great Meal," which will be published by the publishing house Harper on Tuesday, is a story about American food during the Great Depression.
By showing some solidarity in the culinary process, they held a meal together at the reporter "Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop", a simple lunch restaurant located in the Flathyron district and operating since 1929, when the great depression began.
The 54 - year - old Mrs. Ziegelmane ordered a sandwich with processed cheese and chopped olives, and 57 - year - old Kou ordered turkey, potato porridge, and vegetable salads.
When the reporter ordered a fake hare, the couple admitted that his choice was very appropriate for a conversation about the Great Depression food.
Mrs. Ziegelmane said that the counterfeited bunny was very popular.
There was a peanut bunny, a liver bunny, and a bean bunny.
They were prepared from basic ingredients and other ingredients that enriched the meal.
Imagine what it's like to eat so many peanuts so that they're in place of lunch.
Mr. Kou abducted.
"Surely it seemed that the belly was full of lead," he added.
During the pre-depression years, the American lunch table was similar to the Swedish table, especially in rural areas.
Women prepared meals for their husbands-workers and breakfast, lunch and dinner were served freshly prepared cookies.
During the First World War, the Americans sent Europeans food. The Great Meal describes how the Americans adapted to the circumstances when America was suddenly no longer a land of abundance.
"At that time, food became the main focus of the American people in everyday life," says Mr Kou, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write exactly on this subject.
The new budget diets became just as important: such unknown dishes as the counterfeit bunny and stew became everyday, stews were "a great way to use surpluses," said Mrs. Ziegelmane, because the chefs could hide the unattractive ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruits were replaced by cheap dried fruits.
Meat, which has been the main ingredient of American meals for years, has now become an extremely rare luxury commodity.
During the time when the number of calories and the nutritional value of food were more important than the taste, new, unprecedented formations were born.
In an ancient cookbook, Mrs. Ziegelmane found a recipe for making onions filled with peanut butter.
Mr Kou adds: "It wasn't a popular lunch-table supplement."
Mrs Ziegelmane says, "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and fried onion are incompatible.
Many recipes applied to difficult times.
Household economists such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Household Economics, from 1923 to 1943 determined the country’s eating habits that had not been experienced before or after the Great Depression.
By publishing articles and recipes in newspapers and magazines, they suggested that housewives become "economys" and accept challenges such as turning pasta and carrot mix into delicious meals.
"The Fatal Maltīte" is a feast of historical delicacies.
Particularly interesting is the evidence of the government's attitude towards its hungry citizens, such as the attitude of President Herbert Hover, "let me eat cake".
Although he spoke publicly about his simple childhood and feeding in Iowa, he actually ate as a fine millionaire he had become.
Mr Kou says: "She liked European cuisine, such as a fish with a cucumber sauce."
He ate in a nearly gilded living room wearing a lunch jacket.
He was completely taken away from reality.
President Roosevelt would have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, hadn't advised him to set an example with his eating habits.
The book tells us that Roosevelt hired a house servant who did not learn how to cook, so White House became a place "where not only was served one of the most untasking dishes in Washington, but also the worst prepared dishes".
As soon as the country’s economy recovers, most of the culinary habits of the depression era disappeared.
But we continue to pay attention to calories and nutritional value, as well as to how to apply science in cooking, added Mrs Ziegelmane.
A couple say that when they wrote the book, they gained a better understanding of Mrs. Ziegelmane’s mother’s eating habits, for example, why she could not throw out food.
"She was really afraid to throw out the food," said Mr. Kou.
Mrs Ziegelmane said, "She actually dreaded people."
There was an incident with wind cakes once.
After we had eaten at Eisenberg’s dining room, the writer’s couple took out a homemade dessert — a plum pudding that President Roosevelt used to eat at lunch.
"It's a plum cream," said Mrs. Ziegelmane, adding that at that time it was a common habit to give modest dishes a chic name.
It contains no foam cream, only dried plums, little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone was impatiently soaking the spoonful in the brown mass on the plates.
Surprisingly, it was not that bad.
Mr. Kou ate a few more bites.
Sounding like an experienced "economicist," he said to his wife, "I'd put a pinch of hazel nuts."
Gilead will receive reimbursement for legal expenses in the fight with Merck on the Hepatitis C patent
The district judge has decided that Gilead Sciences Inc. has the right to be reimbursed for the services of lawyers paid in the case on the termination of the Hepatitis C patent against the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilad was fined for a fine of GBP 200 million for the termination of two Merck patents, which threatened it with regard to the successful Sovaldi and Harvoni tablets, when the US Federal Judge found violations in Merk's activities, such as lying after the oath and other unethical acts.
At the hearing on Thursday, U.S. district judge Beth Labson Freeman pointed out that Gilead had the right to claim compensation for legal expenses incurred in defending the case.
Merck is trying to get a position on the market against Gilead, which dominates the market with the new generation of Hepatitis C medications that are effective in 90% cases of liver disease.
The case started already in 2013, when Gilad and Merck sued each other, trying to acquire ownership of the newly developed active component sofosbuvir, which is the main component of Gilad’s medicine.
The US-supported forces claim to have taken full control of the city of Manbige from the Islamic State.
Forces supported by the United States have completely taken control of the city of Manbija in the northern part of the country at the Turkish border and the last Islamic State soldiers have left the city, announced a group representative on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) are now cleaning up the city from the last opponents who have not yet left the city.
They have freed more than 2,000 hostage-civil residents who had been captured by the combatants, Reuters told the news agency Sharfan Darwisch of SDS's ally Manbige Military Council.
"Now the city is under our complete control and we are looking for fighters," he informed Reuters agency.
In 2015, Clinton's income reached 10.75 million dollars and the couple paid a federal tax rate of 34,2 percent.
On Friday, Hillary Clinton released the 2015 tax return, which shows that the candidate for Presidential office of the Democratic Party and her husband earned $10.75 million this year and paid the federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent accordingly.
During 2015, Clinton has donated USD 1 million, mostly to his Clinton charity. Former President Bill Clinton earned about USD 5.3 million by performing as a Speaker and former Secretary of State has earned USD 3 million from his book on work in the State Department, published in collaboration with Simon & Schuster.
The election ally of Clinton - the Senator of U.S. Virginia State Tim Kane and his wife Anna Holton have published their tax return for the last 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a federal tax rate of 20,3 %.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set new standards of financial transparency", said Janifer Palmiere, partner of the Clinton campaign.
Donald Trump, on the other hand, is hiding behind various pretexts and reservations so that he does not have to fulfill his promises to disclose his tax information.
Publication of paid tax information is a record practice for US presidential candidates, but it is not required by law.
The New York businessman Trump and his lawyers mention the State Revenue Service audit as a reason for not disclosing tax information.
"Your move", in his Twitter record, Klinton's campaign partner, Ians Sams, told about the tax information of a candidate for the Democrat Party.
On Thursday, special adviser Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish tax information before the audits were completed.
Trampa critics, including Mits Romny, President-designate of the 2012 Republican Party, and other Republicans, claim that his refusal raises questions about his real estate, donations and other commitments to his business, including commitments to Russia.
Clinton fired oil by publishing a video on Friday, where several influential Republics demand Trampa to publish its tax information.
She returned to this question again during an economic talk on Thursday in Michigan.
She told the crowd: "He refuses to do what other presidential candidates have been doing for decades."
Politico says that in the 1990s Tramp has paid very little or no taxes for two years, and on Friday, the business column author of the New York Times said that many accountants and lawyers believe that nothing has changed.
Federal tax rates are an important issue in these presidential elections.
Clinton, in support of the proposal of the billionaire Varena Bafett, promotes the idea that anyone who earns more than 1 million dollars a year should pay a tax of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports this proposal.
Last week during Klinton's speech in Omah, Nebraska, where his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is also located, Babephet invited Trampa to exchange tax returns.
Buffet said that he was also audited by the Revenue Service and Tramps feared voters rather than the tax authority.
The Clinton campaign has released tax information up to 2007.
Clintons now live in Chapakwa, New York, and have paid an average federal tax rate of around 32 per cent and a total tax rate of around 40,5 per cent between 2007 and 2014.
The 2015 Clinton Tax Survey shows that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income is a salary.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund from which Clinton received $109,000 in dividends.

The director of Jewish films criticises the hotel in Berlin for disengaging the Israeli long-line code at the request of an Arab - RT News
The director of French films of Jewish origin has caused a storm in social media, when he discovered that there is no Israeli long-term conversation code available at Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin.
Claude Lancman, director of the documentary film about the Holocaust "Shoah", did not hide his dissatisfaction with the Berlin "Kempinski Bristol" hotel and addressed an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his recent visit, Lancman tried to find Israel's long-term negotiating code on the hotel's list.
However, this country was not included in the list of countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible that in 2016, in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel has been wiped out and destroyed?
Written by Lancman.
Instead, the Kempinski Bristol hotel offers to call this country through its call center.
The Director requested an explanation from the hotel staff.
Lancman writes that the answer he received "was shocked."
The hotel administrator explained that "it is a conscious decision of the hotel management".
The reason for removing the code was even more angry with the film director.
"Most of the guests are Arabs and they asked for the deletion of the Israeli code," Lancman quotes the hotel employee's explanation.
Suddeutsche Zeitung states that the Israeli Ambassador to Germany, Jakov Hada-Handelsman, called this case "a great shame".
We are surprised and shocked at this incident.
That in itself is a great shame.
And the fact that this has happened directly in Germany is an even greater humiliation in this particular hotel network.
No explanation required.
The official said: "We hope that the hotel will draw the right conclusions".
This event also received a rather wide response on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.
Others believe that Kempinski's hotel was simply natural for Arab customers.
Another record said "fee", indicating that the hotel is located on Kurfurstendamm Street next to the synagogue.
Der Spiegel says that the hotel itself quickly rejected all the accusations, saying that it was all "misconception" and apologized to Lancman.
"We have not received a direct order to remove Israel from the list of national numbers," Suddeutsche Zeitung quotes Kempinski's representative.
And adds that the code was again added to the list.
The police use rubber bullets and tear gas to protesting Brazilian students.
Students and police clashed on Thursday in São Paulo, Brazil, where students gathered in a demonstration against reforms of the government's education system.
The police used rubber bullets and tear gas against students.
The problems began when the Ombudsmans tried to expel students, which resulted in the use of rubber bullets and tear gas by the police.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to show their dislike for the reforms of the education system.
The proposal of the Governor of São Paulo, Geraldo Alckmina, is to close almost 100 public schools, while 300 000 students will be transferred to other schools with the aim of saving money.
Some demonstrators drew graffiti on the walls with messages against interim President Michael Temer.
This protest took place only a few days after the previous protest, when students gathered in demonstrations with the aim of expressing their support for the suspended President, Dilma Rousef, whose impeachment was voted by the Senate.
Scott Calum Skinner finishs first, bringing the gold medal to Britain in cycling
Calum Skinner from Scotland finished the first men's cycling team at the sprinting race in Rio last night. The British team protected its champion title, which it won in the 2012 London Games.
The 23-year-old athlete from Glasgow played an important role in this race, making the legendary Scottish Scotch Sir Chris Hoy proud and lifting up the victory for the favorites in New Zealand.
Four years ago, Britain won an amazing victory when Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they also repeated it at the World Championship in London, even though Hoy had already finished his career as an athlete.
The problems were between the Beijing and London Olympics because of the need to replace the experienced start specialist, Jamie Staf.
They did it at the last minute.
When he left, he tried to fill his seat with Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.
The British coaches had hoped for Skinner by seeing his potential in him, which he later proved.
Hindus, Kenny - champions who took part with Hoy and Skinner four years ago, who set the Olympic qualification record, but the race was better for the New Zealand team.
However, the British trio won gold medals.
Quindes were close in their laps, Kenny took the lead, and Skinner kept the lead.
The change of strategy played an important role in the victory, as Hindus drove more gear to allow Kenya and, in particular, Skinner to drive faster.
Hoy watched the race as a representative of the BBC and caught the eyes of Skinner, Kenya, and Hindus when they climbed on the podium.
The 23-year-old Glasgow said, "It was an immense honor."
I'm doing everything to defend my name.
In the final we set the Olympic record and won the World Champions.
It was just incredible.
There's no better win.
After winning with Kenya and Hoy at the 2012 Olympic Games in London, Hindh confessed that he deliberately fell on the track after the failure.
Later, he rebutted that comment and British competitors were unable to prove otherwise.
This time, there were no such incidents.
Hindus said: "The British flags in the stands recalled London."
In the last 3 months, we have become a united team.
We have lost so many World Championships, so the victory in the Olympic Games was really special.
One medal will race for a country that won seven out of ten gold medals in cycling in Beijing and London.
If this achievement is an indicator of team progress in the last five months, then the next five days will be very exciting.
Given Kenya's result, he could really repeat Hoy's success by winning three Olympic gold medals.
For Kenya, this would mean six gold and one silver medal. Moreover, Kenny was born on 23 March (it seems to be a British holy date, because Steve Regreiv, Mo Farah and Roger Banister were born that day).
Hoy was born on that date.
Kenya's next race is a sprint that starts today and will continue for the next three days.
A 28-year-old athlete from Bolton said: "Now I just enjoy it all.
Team ride is always the best.
Because then you can win with your teammates.
To be honest, it's a little lonely to win alone."
Hindus said, "If he gets two more gold medals, he should be appointed as knights."
On that day, it was the only fight for medals, but it was not the only good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggin, Ed Clensy, Steve Burke, and Ovein Doul showed the fastest qualifying time for four-km.
Their time was 3:51.943
The world record that was set in London in 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and the final will take place today in the second half of the day, where Vigins will definitely be the focus.
Yesterday before his qualification trip, he had a disagreement with the Commissioner when the judges summoned him to measure his height.
On the women's journey, which will continue and end today, Laura Trot, Joanna Rowsel Shand, Elinor Barkere and Katie Archibald from Millgavy set a new record time of 4:13.260.
The British delegation hopes that the British cycling team will win the medals in the middle of the Olympic Games, hoping.
Remembering the excellent and unprecedented performance in Beijing and London, everyone expects the same achievements in Rio.
Meanwhile, after allegations of sexism and respect, technical director Shane Sathon resigned, and Hoy and Victoria Bendleton have finished their careers.
At the beginning of the first bicycle race, however, it seems that Britain, as always, will reach the highest level at the right time.
The future of the Portland Cemetery becomes uncertain because an ambitious contract has been terminated.
The future of aluminium smelters and hundreds of its employees in Portland, Victoria has become unclear, as its main customer of energy company has announced the termination of cooperation.
This statement is based on the Victorian government's plans to stop subsidising the energy company, which is vital for the company to continue its work.
20 years of subsidies will be discontinued in November.
As a result, more than 2000 jobs at the Alkoa Portland plant are at risk.
Up to 2 000 direct and indirect jobs could be at risk.
In addition, it will also have unpredictable side effects, as the mill consumes about 10 percent of all Victorian electricity supply.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the “Point Henry” Cemetery, which led to the interruption of the Anglesea power plant.
The Alkoa Portland Cemetery is loss-making and can be closed.
These events were caused by several years of speculation on the appreciation of the Australian dollar and the cost of production of the plant.
The plant’s energy supplier AGL, which supplies energy from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latroubes Street, says that the other three owners are likely to terminate their contracts.
The majority of the power plants are owned by Alcoa and Alumia joint venture, in addition to shares are owned by the Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp holding companies.
AGL looks forward to the continuation of the Portland plant, which would mean a further energy supply to the pipeline," said its representative.
AGL announced that the contracts were so-called "risk restrictive agreements" to enter into force as of November 2016.
Contracts have a period of validity of 12 months and will therefore expire in 2017.
"AGL" plans to receive revenue from these contracts also in the fiscal year 2017," said the company's representative.
As of the fiscal year 2018, the potential impact on profits is limited by favourable market forecasts for future wholesale electricity prices.
AGL claims that it has already accounted for a loss of 187 million dollars in its forecasts, with these contracts expected to be terminated.
Alcoa states that the decision to terminate the contracts will not affect Alcoa’s ability to continue its operations or to supply it with energy.
The U.S. company reports that in 2010 it concluded a contract with “Loy Yang” for 20 years, but in November it will be discontinued.
Analysts have expressed concerns both about the possible closure of Portland Cemetery in Victoria and the closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle, due to the weak economy of the sector.
Steven Michelson, CEO of AGL, said last week that analysts estimate Portland uses 600 megawatts and Tomago 900 megawatts of energy within a year.
If both of these plants left the energy market, then energy demand would fall significantly.
And that would not be good at all.
The Community legal centre rejects 160 000 people every year.
More than 160 000 people are rejected every year and the situation could deteriorate as the budget goes down.
Three out of five people in Queensland - mostly pensioners, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the means to fight illegal evictions - are refused free legal assistance and representation.
The Community legal centre, which has already been overburdened, warns that the decline in funding will only make the situation worse.
As of June next year, these legal centres will receive 30% less funding than they have done so far.
James Farrell, director of Queensland Legal Center, said that the latest report by the National Association of Legal Centres says that legal aid is being refused to thousands of people in need.
Mr Farrell pointed out that if this decision is not repealed, the situation will only get worse.
He also says, "The legal centre of Queensland is constantly underfunded, which means that thousands of people in need are refused assistance."
People who seek to end violent relations, people with deep debts, families who are divorced, workers who are unfairly dismissed - all these people have legal problems and this report shows that they are not getting the help they need.
As of June 2017, the federal government will reduce its funding by 30 percent, which means that several thousand more people in Queensland will have to deal with their complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Prosecutor General and the Queensland Senator, George Brandis, to stop funding cuts immediately so that people in need of legal assistance can get it.
Last year, the government unveiled its plans to bring the level of legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to pay attention to the needs of local communities and their clients, and to invest in this important area by the Palaatchuka Government.
Donald Trump's campaign was sued because one of the employees pulled out a firearm
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign organizers have been sued because they have failed to act on the information that its North Carolina Operation Manager has turned a gun against a staff member when they drive in the same car in February.
This incident was described in a court action brought on Wednesday by Vincent Brondi, a former campaign programmer, before the Charlotte Court.
The coordinators said that he had been waiting for months for this case to be dealt with internally, but understood that this would not happen.
Manager Earl Phillip "tipped the gun, put his right index finger on the cock and turned the barrel against Vincent's knee", Brodi claims in his complaint.
He also said that when he made complaints to local and regional campaign management, Bordi learned that at least four more people had experienced the same thing.
"The guns don't have to shoot to cause damage," says Brondi in his complaint.
Just two days before this case was submitted, the candidate of the Republican Party for the presidential office caused a scandal by announcing to the people that the "People of the Second Amendment", i.e. the owners of weapons and the enthusiasts, could act if his rival Hillary Clinton and his elected judges were to win the elections.
Tramp campaigners said that the media had pulled his words out of context, and he never incited violence.
They want to recover compensation from campaign organisers for negligent supervision, but from Philipps for attack, illegal use of the weapon and emotional stress.
The Tramp representative, Houp Hicks, did not comment immediately.
It's been a failure to communicate with Phillips.
The WCCB - Charlotte local news agency reports that Philip has recently abandoned the campaign.
Nor has he been able to call his consulting firm "Innovative Consultancy Services".

A new tradition - parish and sports festival in Ķūļciems.
On Saturday in Ķūļciems for the first time people gathered for the parish and sports festival.
After the celebration of ten years, it was decided that Lake Festival would be no more.
A new page has now been switched.
The day began with sports competitions.
This time the race was not in traditional ways and too serious, because, for example, darts had to be thrown into a sleeping target, the boot flew, with the man's left hand throw, there was no "balling" at all in the Olympic Games.
However, each participant could show how strong, brave, agile and resourceful he was.
After the sports games, everyone gathered in the open - air stage, where the parish festival began.
In the meantime, there was also a "children's corner", where the little ones could break into inflatable attractions and get a new image in the make-up.
The novelty, which could also become a tradition, was a parade of vehicles, in which both tractors and motorcycles went.
Everyone was approached by Inga Kadišķe-Skadiņa, the head of Ķūlciema parish administration, who wished a nice rest and dry time, but the rain did not interfere much.
The festival continued with the welcome of the youngest inhabitants of Kūlciems.
Indeed, it is good that the parish has been supplemented with five girls and one boy.
With their performances, amateur art collectives from Engure region had come to visit the artists – the audience had a great interest in the performances of the senior dance group "Rudens Ritmi", dance performers of different nations "Redas" and young dancers "Golden Pearls".
And it's nothing that someone had to slip on a wet stage.
Of course, the famous actors' duet Jānis Jarāns and Dainis Porgants, who were once again Mildiņa Nabiņa and Skaidrīte Krāniņa, as well as the attractive wives of Berzciems from the fishermen's farm "Dieniņas", brought joy to local people and visitors.
The party was played by the group Bruģis.
Britain must maintain the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow.
Heathrow will not only promote prosperity and growth in local regions and London, but also in the whole country.
This, in my opinion, makes Heathrow very attractive, as was the case in London in 2012, where we made a huge effort to ensure that all the regions of the country benefit from the Olympic Games.
Stratford and Eastend won an enormous amount from the Olympic Games.
And we will do it again, providing local citizens and businesses with business opportunities near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we will create 10 000 new business opportunities, 40 000 new jobs and finally put an end to youth unemployment in Heathrow.
Like the London Olympics in 2012, this time there will be people who will think that this challenge is too big and that the expansion of Heathrow is too ambitious.
People then said that Britain would never be able to prepare for the Olympic Games and that it would be a global failure.
Skeptics were wrong about 2012 and, in Heathrow's case, they will not be right.
There are always obstacles to be overcome, but Heathrow has overcome everything so far.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that will benefit society as a whole, not individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs, an economic growth of 211 billion, creating the ground for both employment and experience at this airport and throughout Britain.
Heathrow has a great team that has created an infrastructure investment programme worth GBP 11 billion, covering the time and budget, starting with the terminal 5, which for five years has been called the best airport terminal in the world and ending with terminal 2, which has been built between the two most intensive runways in the world.
They are now ready to set up a third runway, which will be financed by a private investment of GBP 16 billion.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success, and I am sure that this will be the enlargement of Heathrow.
The time has come to revive the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, ensuring the future of our trade and creating a new employment environment with which Britain could be proud.
Lord Paul Deuton is a member of Heathrow's board and former Secretary of Commercial Affairs of the Ministry of Economics.
In Switzerland, a woman runs on the highway trying to commit suicide.
In the middle of the night, the victim slipped on the highway.
The police are trying to find witnesses of an accident when on Thursday early in the morning, several cars crossed her on the highway.
The accident took place on Thursday shortly after midnight on the A1 road near the city of Morges in the canton of Vo.
The Vo Canton police report says that in desperately desiring to commit suicide, the woman was drowning on the road in the dark, where several cars drove her.
Undoubtedly trying to kill himself, the victim, a 49-year-old Swissman, drove several cars, including a truck.
She died at the scene.
Several drivers involved in the accident have already given evidence, while others have not yet been identified, says the police, who call on the drivers involved and the witnesses of the accident to respond.
A criminal investigation has also been initiated in the case, which in such a case is a logical step, a lawyer Gilles Hofsteller told Le Tribune de Genene.
However, it is not yet known whether any of the drivers involved will be punished.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
Hoffsteller adds, "This will be clarified by the prosecutor."
Two similar cases that have occurred in the last 5 years show that none of the drivers will be held accountable.
In both cases, the pedestrian was on the highway in the middle of the night, so it was decided that drivers could not predict that a pedestrian would be on the highway in the middle of the night, according to the newspaper.
Last year, a policeman was excused for being killed for negligence when in August 2014 she drove a man who was on A1 road near Paijerne in the middle of the night.
The court found that the 22 - year - old victim had drunk and later noticed falling asleep on the road.
The Court concluded that the policeman, who was on his way to the scene of the accident, traveled in a manner appropriate to the circumstances and the judge admitted that the sleeping man on the road was "a completely unpredictable and extraordinary case".
Anyone with information about the accident on Thursday near Morges is invited to contact the police by phone 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
Signatures are collected on the Internet for the organisation of a new SRS manager's competition.
The petition portal "Avaaz.org" has started collecting signatures for a competition for the post of head of the new State Revenue Service (SRS).
The petition addressed to the ministers of the National Association (NA) and the Greens/Farmers Union (ZZS) states that the public wants a transparent and professional nomination process.
The petition was created on 10 August and is currently signed by 55 people.
The nomination process of Inga Koļegova, the Deputy Director-General of the SRS, is opaque and unprofessional.
This brings to mind the best functional traditions of the Soviet Union.
It discredits the public administration and once again makes the public dissatisfied with government and politics.
"There is a need for a competition with clear criteria against which all candidates must be evaluated", says the petition text.
Its author Jānis B. pointed out that the public does not know the criteria for the position chosen by Koļegova.
Nor is it clear what the candidate's intentions in the work of the SRS are.
The petition indicates that the State Chancellery must create a new, open competition in which professional candidates are actively addressed, staff selection specialists are attracted and appropriate remuneration offered.
The Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola officially nominated Koļegovu to the post of Head of the SRS last week; this week, the government was due to approve him in the new post, but all the ministers of the Unity Party voted against, so the issue of the week was postponed.
Samoilov: If we lost, so I played badly.
The beach volleyball players Aleksandrs Samoilovs and Jānis Šmēdins have hoped for the prize in the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, however, without it, there is no difference in where to close the competition, Samoilovs said after leaving the tournament.
One of the world's strongest pairs of beach volleyball on Thursday in the final and decisive game of the sub-group tournament with 1-2 (16:21, 22:20, 7:15) lost the Brazilians Evandra Gonsalves Oliveira and Pedra Solberg Salgada, concluding their participation in the four-year most important sports forum.
Latvian athletes won one win in three sub-groups, but the same ratio was for two more couples.
The ratio of the small points between the three pairs was then calculated, which, after the persuasive loss suffered in this match, was the most unfavourable for the duet of Latvia.
"In the first set we were in the lead, but from 16:15 we also stayed on 16 points", Šmēdins remembered the course of the game.
I don't even know how we left the rest of the set without points.
You can't play like that.
After that, everything was fine in the second set, and at the end of the set it was able to break the game, and it should have been a good basis for the third set as well.
We started it in a similar way, but after changing the parties, the result grew for only one team.
We had too many errors in the attack.
In the subgroup, all the teams were similar, almost all the machines had three sets, so small points were important.
"I should've played more like that, rather than giving 3-4 points in a row," said the athlete.
We knew that Evandra could be served.
"In the first set we ended up with it, in the second we put 1-2 points, and in the third one he went to +4 the game," Smēdins remembered.
We tried to show the best game.
Sometimes it happened, sometimes it didn't.
I did not look at the overall situation before the match, but it was known that as many small points as possible were needed.
"If we lost, so I played badly," Samoilov said.
We expected a good serva from Evandro, and we had a pretty good deal with it in our first sets, but the third one opened up the serva and found it difficult to build an attack.
And I made a lot of mistakes in my reception right at Pedro Serve, but I had to deal with it.
Samoilov told us that unlike the previous match today, athletes were not nervous.
"We went, we played, we also had protection, but we needed a better welcome of the Serve", said the athlete.
"They played well and in the end came to the 'urre'."
Before the tournament, we immediately said that the lottery was the most embarrassing thing we could have had.
We also had the prospect of fighting for the first place, but we didn't even get out of the group.
"All of us waited for the medal and also we of ourselves, but after that there is no difference - 25th place or 4th," said Samoilov, who predicted that the duet would continue to play together in the future.
I think there will be no questions and we will continue to play together, because this is just one tournament.
Samoilov was already in the career of the third Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, because in 2008 he competed with Mārtiņš Pļaviņš in Beijing, but four years ago he played with Ruslan Sorokin in London.
Meanwhile, for Smödiņš, this was the second start in Olympics.
Latvenergo also follows the process of opening up the gas market from the position of a potential trader.
The state energy company Latvenergo follows the process of opening up the gas market from the position of both the consumer and potential trader, said the company's press secretary Ivita Bidere.
"The decision on whether Latvenergo will join the gas market in the future as a trader will be determined by which gas market model and legal framework will be established."
"For this reason we are actively involved in the development and commenting of regulatory enactments, as well as submit our proposals", said Bider.
The Agency BNS already wrote that the Ministry of Economics (EM) in cooperation with the Public Utilities Regulatory Commission and the Energy Company "Latvijas Gāze" has developed Cabinet of Ministers regulations project "Regulations on the Trade and Use of Natural Gas" that will change the existing principles of the operation of the natural gas market, providing natural gas users with the right to freely choose the natural gas trader from 3 April 2017.
Working on the new regulation of the natural gas market, the EM aims to make the natural gas trading process as simple and user-friendly as possible.
Therefore, the most efficient and user-friendly service solution has been chosen as the "center's central model", in which all activities related to customer service are provided by the trader - one contract, one invoice and one information provision and customer service place, leaving to the distribution system operator the technical issues of the natural gas distribution system.
A similar solution is currently being implemented in electricity trade.
We would like to remind you that it is planned to gradually open the market for household users - even after 3 April 2017, those household users who will not want to choose another natural gas trader will be able to continue to receive natural gas from the existing trader at a regulated price, thus becoming related users.
"In such a case, the obligation to supply natural gas to connected customers at a regulated price is imposed on the public trader", informed the Ministry.
Economic operators will have to choose the natural gas trader with whom to conclude a natural gas sales contract.
Until the conclusion of the natural gas sales agreement for a certain period of time, the natural gas trade will be ensured by the current natural gas trader at a fixed price.
The Cabinet of Ministers Regulations project details the rights and obligations of the natural gas trader, system operator and users.
The rules shall determine the procedures for supplying and terminating the supply of natural gas to the users, the requirements for the safe use of the natural gas system, the rights and obligations of the trader, public trader, system operator, user and owner of the gas-gasified object in the supply and use of natural gas; the procedures for the settlement of the services received, the rate of delay, the procedure for switching traders and the supply of natural gas in the event of disruption to the supply of natural gas to the connected customers; the procedure for ensuring the supply of natural gas to the public trader.

Minister: next week it is planned to discuss the increase in the remuneration of the Director-General of the SRS.
The Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Green and Farmers' Union (ZZS)) is planning to talk next week with Prime Minister Maris Kučinskis (ZZS) and the government coalition partners about the increase in the remuneration of the Director-General of the State Revenue Service (SRS).
On Friday, the journalist-Ozola noted that the issue of increasing the remuneration of the Director-General of the SRS should be addressed urgently in order to make this post more attractive to potential candidates for re-tendering.
Also next week we were going to talk about changing the terms of the competition.
The Minister also stressed that she did not have any particular candidate in mind to address her vacancy.
At the same time, Reizniece-Ozola expressed her opinion that the Head of the State Environmental Service Inga Koļegova would have been a good Director-General of the SRS.
As regards the current SRS leader Dace Pelēko, who expressed his readiness to apply for this post, the Minister reiterated the view that the new SRS Director-General should be an "outside view" and should not come from the SRS structure.
She also stressed that she was waiting for the Saeima to return from her leave in order to direct the amendments to the laws necessary for the reorganisation of the SRS as soon as possible.
The agency BNS has already announced that the Minister of Finance of the State Environmental Service Inga Koļegova has submitted an application to Dana Reizniece-Ozola (ZZS), which withdraws its candidacy for the post of the Director-General of the SRS.
In her application, she said that this was not an easy choice, but during the last two weeks, her relatives have been under serious emotional pressure, even though they have not taken any legally reprehensible action.
Koļegova also pointed out that the discussion of her candidacy has increased the contradictions between the ruling coalition parties, which are also unacceptable.
Ināra Pētersone, the former Director General of the SRS, has also been reported to leave office at the end of June.
Oil prices continue to rise; stock exchange indices in the US and Europe are rising, as are the values of the US dollar.
World oil prices continue to rise on Friday morning, with investors' confidence having a positive impact on the statements made by the Minister of Oil Affairs of Saudi Arabia, which reinforces the expectation that the major oil-producing countries will take action to stabilise the global oil market at the OPEC meeting in September.
The three main US stock exchange indices reached a record high on Thursday, which was not observed since 1999.
The main positive factor in the market was the rise in oil price and the strong financial indicators of several large companies.
The rise in oil prices and the strong financial performance of several companies on Thursday also led to an increase in European stock exchange indices.
The value of the US dollar increased on Thursday in relation to the euro, in relation to the British pound and in relation to the Japanese yen.
The price of crude oil from the WTI brand in the New York stock exchange for deliveries in September rose by USD 1.78 to $43.49 per barrel.
The price of Brent brand crude oil for deliveries in October increased by 1.99 dollars - to 46.04 dollars per barrel at the London Stock Exchange.
Last year the turnover of the canning producer "Zila Lagonas" is dropping by 33.8%.
Last year the turnover of the canning producer "Zila Lagona" was 4,202 million euros, which is 33,8% less than a year ago, while the losses of the company dropped 5.7 times - to 904,7 thousand euros, according to the annual financial report published in the data base "Lursoft".
The company's management report states that in 2015 the company made losses due to a number of reasons, including the permanent lack of working capital caused by the exit of Unicredit Bank from the Baltic market, terminating the previously valid credit line, and leaving the Blue Lagoon with concluded contracts without the possibility to fulfil them.
As a result, the company did not have sufficient resources to purchase cheaper raw materials in large quantities and receive a discount.
The withdrawal of the bank from the Latvian market also prevented the company from implementing European Union structural funds support projects, which would have allowed the production facility to purchase new production equipment and modernize the infrastructure.
The financial indicators of the company in the last year were also negatively affected by the rise in raw material prices and the unwillingness of customers to pay more for the goods produced by the company.
"Only in the second half of July 2016 customers acknowledged price changes and were ready to buy goods at the new - the highest - prices", says the company's management.
In 2015, "Zila Lagona" started discussions with potential investors, including the evaluation of the company's movable and real estate.
Investors have already been to the company's largest creditor, Unicredit Leasing, where the parties have become acquainted and discussed possible investment plans.
At the same time, the company’s activities and development were positively influenced by the implementation of the restructuring and optimisation plan started in 2014 and 2015.
This plan included the improvement and optimisation of technological processes, which allows to achieve greater productivity and capacity.
"A number of equipment was purchased, which ensures a higher production speed," said the company's management.
The management of "Zila Lagona" notes that the equipment purchased in 2016 will allow the company's production unit to meet such orders, which were not possible until now.
The first batch of production to be produced on this equipment will be ready in August.
As protocols of intent have already been signed on the sale of the product, all the production will be sold in accordance with the protocols of intent.
The new product will increase turnover by about 300 thousand euros per month", says the management of the company.
The company also plans to sign a cooperation agreement on the supply of fish products to Iraq in August 2016.
Blue Lagoon sent the first experimental container to Israel in 2016, expanded the market to Cyprus and this September signed a cooperation agreement with a new supermarket chain in the USA.
As a result of all the above measures, the company plans to increase its turnover.
In 2014, "Zila Lagona" worked with a turnover of 6.347 million euros and losses of 5.113 million euros.
The Blue Lagoon was founded in 1997 and its share capital is EUR 1.156 million.
The company is owned by two Latvian private individuals, Mikhail Kaidanov (89,11%) and Igor Širšon (10,89%).
Welcome to pl. 15 to the museum to welcome the cinema diva Zara Leander and participate in the press conference.
Riga can be considered the city of the beginning of the career and inspiration of the beloved cinema dairies Sara Leandere.
The visit of Zar Lender to the godmother Ruth, who was the Swedish Ambassador to Latvia, was fatal in Riga in 1924 because she discovered the unusual low-contralt of Sarah Leander's woman, which she tried to debut on the stage of the Riga cabaret theatre.
Maybe it was by chance that in Riga, it became the fateful turning of Sara's creative path towards the world's glory.
Riga Zara Leander was associated with warm memories, and she hoped to come to Riga during her guest performances, but unfortunately these hopes were not destined to be fulfilled because World War II began.
Using the play form, this meeting will be possible at Riga Festival 2016 and the outstanding role of Sarah Leander will be felt by the great Ieva Kerēvica.

The insurer pays compensation to passengers of the cancelled air flight at the airport on Wednesday.
If Insurance paid travel insurance compensation to a family for the cancellation of the flight at Riga Airport on Wednesday, 10 August, due to which it was necessary to refuse the planned visit to the music festival.
On August 11, If Insured from a client received a claim for reimbursement.

The repair of the neighbor forces the man to leave the house at a rotten ceiling.
Dmitry Saidjaševs, whose neighbor has begun to repair the capital in his apartment, turned to the LTV program "studija 4" and since then Dmitrijs cares for the plaster from the ceiling and is not convinced that it is safe to stay in the apartment.
The problem is that my neighbors carried out arbitrary construction and my apartment has a damaged ceiling.
Then I informed the Riga Construction Board, the house manager and other organizations.
The Construction Board said that we are not an operational service and we have no expert.
"The owner of the apartment must enter the Latvian Engineering Union, and there will be an expert from there", says Dmitrijs.
The invited expert arrived, recorded what had happened and admitted that the division was in unsatisfactory condition.
However, a month has passed since Dmitry’s first application to the building board, and until the beginning of this week nobody was able to answer whether the location in the apartment is life-threatening.
In the Construction Board said - this is the legislation, wait, if you are not satisfied, write to everyone in a row.
"Then I wrote to the Riga City Council, but they transferred the house to the governor, then the house manager again to the building board, and then it is a dead end", says Dmitrijs.
After examining the entire pile of papers, it is clear that the work has been stopped, even though it can be heard from time to time that someone is working there.
Within a further two-month period, the owner of the apartment carrying out repairs must carry out an inspection and, within six months, all these defects must be rectified.
The independent expert has drawn up his opinion, but the construction board considers it incomplete and superficial.
The expert has not indicated whether or not the metal grating in this supporting structure has been affected, so it is not certain that the owner of the lower apartment is exposed.
"Therefore we have requested additional clarification from this expert", says Ilze Žūka, representative of Riga City Construction Board.
Despite the ban on carrying out any repairs in the upper apartment, from there it will still be heard that the construction continues.
The penalty for arbitrary construction without building permits is between 70 and 700 euros, but in a particular case the penalty can be more severe.
While awaiting the expert's opinion, the construction board decided that both apartments should not be operated - both in which the construction works are carried out and in which Dmitri's apartment is located.
"This is an unprecedented case in the practice of the building board, when due to lack of knowledge or simply unwillingness, the inhabitants may have caused a threat not only to their property, but also to the owner of the lower property, as a result of which this owner cannot exploit his property", says the representative of the construction board.
Now Dmitry has to look for another place to live in - with relatives, friends, at the hotel or rent another apartment.
But Dmitry can try to recover the damage from his neighbor on a civil basis, which can take a lot of time.
Because of the arbitrary construction, it is currently prohibited to stay in both apartments until the engineer makes his conclusion, and it may have to wait up to three weeks.
The losses incurred will have to be borne by the owner of the apartment where the repairs have taken place.
The owner of this apartment, because the construction board has not taken into account, also risks imprisonment for up to six months.
Guess what!
How many lioness in this picture?

Conversion of the former Kemeri Sanatorium into a five-star hotel will cost EUR 22 million.
The transformation of the former Ķemeri Sanatorium into a five-star hotel "Park Hotel Ķemeri" will cost 22 million euros, Gita Želve, representative of the future hotel manager SIA "Park Hotel Ķemeri", tells LETA.
The hotel is the first stage of the renovation of Ķemeri's former sanatorium.
The second stage will be the wellness clinic, which will be opened in 2022, while the opening of the hotel will take place in May 2018.
Želve notes that the cost of a precise clinic is not yet known.
However, she points out that it will be located in a polyclinic building of the former Ķemeri resort, with an area of approximately 12,000 square meters.
Clinic will be located on three floors.
The owner of Park Hotel Ķemeri and the planned clinic is the international foundation G Capital Europe, which invests in European assets.
The owners of G Capital Europe are several investors who invest in this fund, says Želve.
As George Jones, Executive Director of G Capital Europe, said earlier, plans to invest between 12 and 15 million euros in the development of the former resort clinic, with investments exceeding 30 million euros.
As already reported, the restoration of more than 42 hectares of cultural-historical park, restoration of access roads and sections of street, construction of an interactive nature tourism object, improvement of the territory and construction of parking spaces on Emīla Dārziņa Street, which will contribute to the socio-economic development of Jurmala city and increase the number of tourists, Jūrmala City Council plans to attract EUR 14.5 million from European Union funds, co-financed with three to four million euros.
Until mid-2017, design works are planned, but construction and repair works will begin in the autumn of next year.
As reported, in the historical sanatorium complex "Ķemeri" it is planned to create a five-star hotel "Park Hotel Ķemeri" and "wellness" or wellness clinic.
However, reconstruction lasted for a long time.
In the 2010 report it was also claimed that "Ominasis" was regularly communicating with hotel operator "Kempinski", which continues to provide daily technical control at the sanatorium "Ķemeri" and already in 2011 will definitely have "completed reconstruction of the future hotel "Ķemeri"" and will immediately begin preparatory work for opening of the "Kempinski" chain hotel.
In October 2014, the Park Hotel Ķemeri confirmed its readiness to buy the package of Ķemeri sanatorium belonging to the insolvent "Ominasis Latvia" at auction, but one month later the auction was recognized as not having taken place, because the winner had not paid for the purchase in due time.
The sale price was set according to the starting price of the last failed auction - €2.86 million.
Ieva Aile, representative of the City Council, informed LETA as the agency, the municipality, signing the protocol, has confirmed that with the support of co-financing from the European Union structural funds, the adjacent infrastructure will be arranged – the historic Ķemeri park will be restored, an interactive nature tourism object will be created, roads and parking spaces will be arranged.

The e-mail of former NATO Commander Brīdlov has been hacked by Russian hackers.
The hackers who hacked the computers of the U.S. National Committee of Democrats (DNC) may have carried out several other cyber attacks, also hacked the e-mail of former NATO European Force Commander Philip Broedlov and servers of George Soros Institute "Open Society" on Thursday by the business news agency "Bloomberg".
The hackers have published the information on "DCLeaks.com".
Among other things, it includes correspondence from Bridlow and information on the work of the Soros Institute.
For hackers, the Institute's computers have been available for a whole year.
According to Bloomberg, these cyber attacks have been carried out by the same hackers associated with Russia's special services that have hacked DNC emails.
The Wall Street Journal, in turn, reports that the administration of US President Barack Obama is currently examining the issue of imposing new sanctions on Russia in response to the hacking of DNC computers.
In order to impose sanctions, the administration will have to formally attack the servers of the Democratic Party against Russia or the hackers supported by the Russian authorities.
As reported earlier, the WikiLeaks website released in July some 20,000 e-mails extracted from the DNC computer system, from which the leaders of the Democrat Party have, of course, tried to harm the party candidate, the Senator of the former rival Vermont, Hillary Klinton, Bernie Sanders, in his campaign to fight for the nomination of democrats for the presidential election.
According to the US press, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which investigates the hacking of democratic servers, as well as other U.S. departments, believes that Russia's connection to cyber-attacks is almost undisputed.
McCarthy: The presence of Yoko Ono threatened "The Beatles".
Paul McCartney admitted that the presence of Yoko Ono created a sense of danger for the legendary band "The Beatles".
The 74-year-old rock star currently maintains a "good" relationship with the widow of late John Lennon, but when she went to visit the group at the recording studio, she frightened McCartney, because Ono was the only woman among the group members - George Harrison, Ringo Stara, Lennon and McCartney.
When the singer was asked about the relationship between the two, he said to the Rolling Stone magazine, "It's really good."
We felt threatened at that time.
While we were recording, she was sitting on the amplifiers.
Most of the group could not tolerate it.
We were able to do this, but not very successful, because we were very tense.
We weren't sexists, but girls usually didn't come to the recording studio, they let us work.
When John began to meet Yoko, she was not in the control room, but in the middle of our four.
The author of Yellow Submarine has also admitted that he now regularly communicates with his former group member Ringo, and periodically approves the work plans of the recording studio Apple, but otherwise, "The Beatles" is "completed".
When asked if he still meets with the other only member of the legendary rock group, McCartney said to the Rolling Stone magazine: "Often not."
We meet at social events and parties.
But I don't go to the meetings, I feel a little distanced from it.
I left the Apple at the time of the heavy divorce.
Instead, I sent John Eastman to the meetings and said, "Tell me what everyone says, because I can't suffer sitting at that table."
It was too painful to see our pet dying.
The company is now working so that I just listen to all the records.
I am part of the approval process.
NASA climate model: Venus used to be a habitable planet
Based on NASA’s latest climate models, Venus has once been an inhabitable planet.
Researchers at NASA Godard Institute of Space Research have developed a model to explore the history of Venus using tools and algorithms that climate scientists also use.
The model was designed to determine whether on Venus, which has a hot surface, where there is no water and whose atmosphere consists almost exclusively of carbon, conditions similar to those of the Earth have existed.
Scientists have previously guessed that Venus’s slow speed is due to its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulations show that Venus once had a thin earthlike atmosphere, and it turned slowly.
The model also looks at Venus’s earlier topography.
There were more dry areas on the planet than on the earth, but there was enough water and geographical diversity on it to produce life and prevent the evaporation of water.
In early Venus, the sun was 30 percent brighter.
In the simulation of the GISS model, the Venus rotation model reveals that the bright part of the day lasts 2 months on it, explained GISS scientist Antony Del Genio in a press release.
This process warms the planet’s surface and causes rain, which in turn forms thick cloud layers that act as an umbrella to protect the planet from the sun’s heat.
The result is a moderate climate temperature, which is actually a few degrees lower than the temperature on earth today.
The model depicts the history of Venus, which is similar to the theory of evolution developed by scientists in their hypotheses.
Although it has been inhabitable, Venus has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet rays over several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated, and the spirits were burned by ultraviolet rays.
As water completely evaporated, only the thin atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse gas - Venus, as we know it today - remained.
Scientists published the results of the new Venus climate model in the journal “Geophysical Research Letters”.
Patrick Roy resigns from the role of Avalanche coach
On Thursday, the coach of Colorado Avalanche and vice-president of hockey operations, Patrick Roy, submitted a request for the reason of the lack of influence in the team's decision-making process.
The vice president and general manager of Colorado, Joe Sakik, confirmed this message and informed us that the club would immediately start searching for a new coach.
"For the last three years, I have been energetic, enthusiastic and purposeful as the main coach and vice president of the hockey operations of the Colorado Club," says 50-year-old Roy in his statement.
During this summer, I have thought a lot about how I could improve team performance to give it the necessary brilliance and achieve higher level results.
In order to achieve this, the visions of the chief coach and the vice president of hockey operations must be completely identical to those of the organization.
He must also be able to influence decisions relating to team performance.
At present, these conditions are not met.
Sakik, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
Sakik said Patrick informed him of his decision today.
We appreciate all that he has done for the organization and wish him all the best in the future.
In his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014 Roy was recognized as the League's best coach and received Jack Adams' award.
He helped the club to reach 112 points and first place in the Central Division, but in the first round of the defeat games Colorado the team was defeated by Minnesota hockeyists. Since then, the club has not entered the defeat games for two years.
"Avalanche" concluded the 2015-2016 season with a score of 39-39-4 and remained five points behind the "Wild" team without receiving the second special invitation of the organizers of the Western Conference.
Roy won four Stanley Cups in his career, two with Montreal Canadien and two with Avalanche.
North Sea oil platform workers resume negotiations and put off strike
Employee strikes for the remuneration of North Sea oil platform workers have been postponed, as the two parties to the dispute have resumed negotiations, the negotiators are telling.
Regularly, the oil processing company "Wood Group" is holding strikes on the oil platforms of the North Sea, where the company "Royal Dutch Shell" operates.
The joint statement states that the trade unions of the Wood Group and Unite and RBT have agreed to resume negotiations on the settlement of the dispute.
During the coming weeks, a number of full-day meetings are scheduled to start at the beginning of next week with a view to re-examining problematic issues.
The trade unions stated that their recent activities, organised after more than 25 years of break, were directed against the planned reduction in wages of 30 per cent.
This year, due to negative market pressure, the Wood Group reduced wages for North Sea workers by 9 percent.
As early as 2014, the company reduced the wages of land workers by 10 percent.
The company explains that additional wage cuts would allow the company to survive the market downturn.
Shell already reduced wages for several thousand people and announced plans to stop oil and natural gas operations in 10 countries in order to optimise its work in preparation for a large-scale merger with the British energy company “BG Group”.
Energy companies are experiencing pressure due to falling oil prices, and the situation is further complicated by Britain's decision to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of the week, a Scottish Member of Parliament, Dave Anderson, met with workers' representatives to discuss one of the most important issues - the North Sea strike plans.
He said that the North Sea is vital for the region's economy.
In his report, he explains that the North Sea and the country as a whole need an economy that benefits all, not individual individuals.
In 2016, new North Sea projects are expected to invest almost $1.4 billion, compared to $7 billion invested over the last five years.
Kepler measures the speed of turning of stars in the Plead constellation.
Kepler’s latest telescope mission has helped astronomers to compile the most complete catalogue of star speed in the Plead constellation.
The new data helps astronomers understand why the stars in this constellation rotate at different speeds, as well as how the speed of star rotation refers to the formation of planets.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other constellations, we will get more information about the relationship between the mass of stars, age and even the history of its solar system," said Pasadena Caltech Infrared Process and Analytical Center scientist Louis Rebula.
The valley constellation is located 445 light years away from Earth.
Many stars in this constellation are only beginning to grow, reaching the age of about 125 million years.
They turn at maximum speed.
At its maximum speed, these rising stars emit large amounts of star winds.
When winds get into the magnetic field of the stars, they brake the stars.
As the stars age, their speed of rotation decreases.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by determining the time between the appearance of a recognizable area of stars, such as solar spots.
The latest star rate catalog shows that larger stars turn slower than smaller stars.
Rebuls compares stars with dancers, larger dancers perform pyruits slower than small dancers.
Rebuls tells that the Plead's "ballet" shows that the slow rotating objects are larger and more massive, while the faster rotating objects are very small stars.
Thanks to the fact that the Plead constellation is so close, it serves as a great space laboratory, where you can compare star characteristics with spin speeds.
Rebuls tells that the Plead constellation helps to create theoretical models of star rotation in both directions for both older and younger stars.
We still have a lot to learn how, when and why the speed of star rotation and the complete stopping process of it slows down.
Rebuls and his colleagues presented in detail the analysis of the speed of rotation of the Plead stars in three new publications that will soon be published in the Astronomy Journal.
