Assembly Members of the Assembly (AM) are concerned about the possibility to "be perceived as ticks"
Some members of the Assembly are concerned about the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reason for this is the plans to change the name of the Assembly to "Welsh Parliament".
AAM in the whole political spectrum is concerned that it can make them a target of ridicule.
One of the Labour Party's AM explained that their group was concerned about "the echoes of the words Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh "twp" means "single court", but "pwp" means "kaka".
The parties Plaid AM indicated that none of the groups were "unsatisfied" and have suggested alternatives.
The representative of the Conservative Party of Wales admitted that their group was ready to consider the change of name, but added that MWP was very similar to Muppet, which means "eram".
In this context, it should be noted that the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly to the English Yorkshire dialect "u".
The Assembly commission, which is currently drafting a bill to change its name, informed: "The final decision on the terms used to designate the members of the Assembly must, of course, be taken by the members of the Assembly themselves."
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals, which gained broad support for changing the name of the Assembly to the Parliament in Wales.
As regards the title of AM, the Commission preferred to have a 'Welsh Parliament Member' (WMP), but MWP received the greatest support in the public consultation.
The AM explicitly recommends alternative options, but the struggle for an agreement can give rise to headaches for Elin Jones, the Speaker of the Assembly, who is expected to table a bill on the changes in the coming weeks.
The draft law on changes will also include other changes to the work of the Assembly, including the rules on the disqualification of AM and the structure of the committee system.
The final vote of the AM on what they will be called will take place once the laws and regulations have been discussed.
Macedonians are going to vote in a referendum on changing the name of the country
The voters will vote on Sunday whether their country's name will be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular referendum was organised to resolve decades of disagreement with neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbour gives the impression of the claims on its territory, and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's request to be admitted to the EU and NATO.
President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, one of the plebiscite of name change opponents, declared that he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is simply a matter for accession to the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's church bells shut down when the churches of Harlem fight for existence.
"As the old people with whom I have spoken told you, there was a bar and a church on every corner in the past," says Mr Adams.
"Now there's neither one nor the other."
He admits that the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
"People are socialising in other ways nowadays," he said.
"Bars are no longer living rooms in the neighbourhood, which people visit regularly."
Speaking even to the churches, he is worried that the money he receives when he sells properties will end faster than he hopes the leaders will "and sooner or later they will be back to their starting point".
The temples, he added, may be replaced by apartment buildings with apartment properties, where people will live, who will not help the remaining shrines in the area.
"Most of the people who will buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he explained, "and thus the day will come closer when these churches will close forever, because it is unlikely that most of the people who will move into these apartments will become members of these congregations."
Both churches were built by the white congregation, before Harlem became the black metropolis, by the Metropolitan community in 1870, and by St. Martin — 10 years later.
The original white Methodist congregation abandoned the building in the 1930 ’ s.
The building was taken over by a black congregation that had worshiped God right next door.
The black church of St. Martin took over his blessing during John Howard Johnson. On 125th Street, at the main shopping in Harlem, he led a boycott of working retailers who had refused to hire or give them a promotion.
In 1939, the fire seriously damaged the building, but because of the plans of the Father’s Johnson Congregation to rebuild the building, they ordered a call game.
His blessing David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin's Church, proudly called the bell game "the bells of the poor people".
The expert who played this call game in July used other words: "cultural treasure" and "an indispensable historical tool".
The expert Tifany Ng from Michigan University added that it was the first call game in the world played by the black musician Dionio A. Lind (Dionisio A. Lind), who moved 18 years ago at a larger call game in the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather told him that St. Martin's congregation did not replace him.
Over the past few months, events around St. Martin’s church reflected the relationship between knotted architects and contractors, some of whom had been attracted by secular power and others by the episcopal church diocese.
The Council of the Congregation, composed of secular leaders, in July addressed the diocese in writing with concern that the diocese "will try to pass on the costs" to the council, even though the council was not involved in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some in the congregation complained about the lack of transparency in the work of the diocese.
Shark injures a 13-year-old female lobster fishing ground
The shark attacked a 13-year-old boy in California on Saturday and injured him. It was the first day of the lobster season, the story services.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m., near the beach of Beacon's Beach in Encinita.
Chad Hammel informed KSWB-TV San Diego that he and his friends had a dive on Saturday morning for about half an hour when he heard that the boy was crying for help, and then the group came to him to help him pull the boy out of the water.
Hammel explained that at the beginning he had thought that it was simply a delight at the caught lobster, but then he "understood that the boy was shouting "My bit!
I'm bit!"
The whole bone of his key was torn apart," said Hammel, who immediately noticed it when he got to the boy.
"I yelled, let everyone leave the water: "There is a shark in the water!" added Hammel.
The boy was taken by air to a children’s hospital in San Diego, Radie (Radie), where he was found to be in a critical position.
The attacking shark species is unknown.
The rescue captain Larry Giles informed the media that a shark had been observed in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found not to be a dangerous species for humans.
Jail added that the upper part of the torso was traumatized to the victim.
Officials closed the beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in the city of Encinita for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Jaills pointed out that more than 135 shark species are present in this area, but most are not considered dangerous to humans.
"Sainsbury's" plans to penetrate the UK beauty industry market
"Sainsbury's" is heading for the attack "Boots", "Superdrug" and "Debenhams" with a series of supermarket-style beauty product shelves and trained sellers.
As part of the significant investment in the UK's 2.8 billion-billion beauty market, which continues to grow, although sales of fashion goods and home items are decreasing, 11 shops in the country will be tested in larger rows of shelves of beauty products, and if everything goes well, there will be more such stores next year.
In the beauty industry, money is invested when supermarkets are looking for opportunities to use shelves that were previously reserved for televisions, microwave ovens and home goods.
"Sainsbury's" informed that it would double its offer in the field of beauty up to 3000 products, including brands such as "Revlon", "Essie", "Tweezerman" and, for the first time, "Dr. PawPaw".
The existing lines from "L'Oreal", "Maybelline" and "Burt's Bees" will also receive more space with branded zones, similar to those in "Boots" stores, for example.
The supermarket also re-markets its Boutique line of make-up, where most products will be vegan-friendly, which is increasingly demanded by younger buyers.
In addition, the perfume wholesaler Fragrance Shop will test the concession in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which was opened last week in Croydon, south of London, and the second one will be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and switching to small purchases of food every day in local shops mean that supermarkets need to invest more to convince people to visit them.
The CEO of Sainsbury's, Mike Coupe, has said that points of sale of goods will become increasingly similar to department stores, because the chain of stores is trying to fight the discount shops Aldi and Lidl, offering a wider range of services, but without food.
"Sainsbury's" has placed "Argos" outlets in several hundred shops and has opened several "Habitats" since bought both chains two years ago, which is claimed to have improved sales of goods and made the purchase more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to improve its beauty and pharmaceutical departments ended in defeat.
"Sainsbury's" joint venture with "Boots" was tried in the early 2000s, but the union broke down after a dispute about how to distribute the income from pharmacy stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy develops after "Sainsbury's" 3 years ago sold its 281 store of large pharmaceutical business to the owner of "Celesio", "Lloyds Pharmacy" chain for 125 million pounds.
According to this plan, the "Lloyds" task will be to supplement the assortment with a wide range of exclusive skin care products, including "Roche-Posay" and "Vichy" in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, said: "In order to improve the environment for customers, we transformed the appearance of the shelves of our beauty products and the impression they create.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues, who will always be ready to make a recommendation.
Our brand range is designed to meet all needs, but an attractive environment along with a comfortable location means that now we are a charming goal on the way to beauty, a goal that challenges current shopping habits."
Peter Jones "full of contempt" after Holley Williamby quits the 11 million pound deal
"Dragon Den" star Peter Jones "became rage" after TV show director Holly Willoughby gave up the 11 million pound deal with his lifestyle brand to pay all his attention to his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Viloubia has no time to devote to their homewear and accessories brand "Truly".
The couple's business was compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow brand "Goop".
"This Morning" 37-year-old programme manager used Instagram to announce that she was leaving.
Holly Willouby has left the Dragon Den star Peter Jones in anger because at the last minute he left their lucrative lifestyle brand business — to draw all attention to his new huge contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources of information claim that Jones was "full of contempt" when a TV gold girl at a tense meeting on Tuesday at his business empire residence in Marlow, Buckinghamshire announced that her new contracts, worth up to 1.5 million pounds, meant that she no longer had the time to devote to their homewear and accessories brand "Truly".
The company was compared with Gwinetta Plato's brand "Goop", and, according to a hint, it will double the Viloubia's wealth, which is estimated at 11 million pounds.
When Willouby (37) used Instagram to announce that he left Truly, Jones took away from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
According to the source of information, "Truly" was the most important of Holley's priorities.
It should have become her long-term future for the coming decades.
Her decision to quit surprised all those involved unprepared.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday: everything was so close to the start.
In the center of Marlowa there is a warehouse full of ready-to-sale goods."
Experts believe that the head of this Morning, one of the most financially profitable stars, can pay the company millions away, because a lot of money has been invested in various products – from pillows and candles, to clothes and goods for the house, and their placing on the market will be even more delayed.
And it can mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children, Willouby, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been in close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for 10 years.
Vilouby "Truly" together with Kep was established in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as president in March.
Both couples spend their holidays together, and Jones holds 40 % of the shares in the Boldvin TV producer company.
Viloubia must become the ambassador of the M&S brand and she will replace Ant McPartlin as the head of I'm A Celebrity.
A close source for Jones said yesterday, "We don't want to comment on his business transactions!"
A serious conversation "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticisms that he would receive from news companies about a comment that some may find "indecent to the President" and about the fact that he was so positive to the North Korean leader.
Why has the president given up so much?
Tramp said in his imaginary voice of the "Knowledge Dictor".
"I didn't give up anything!"
He pointed out that Kim had shown interest in meeting one more time after Trump recognized their initial meeting in June in Singapore as a major step towards the denuclearisation of North Korea.
However, negotiations on denuclearisation have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, one of the main North Korean diplomats Ri Jongho (Ri Yong Ho) informed world leaders in the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "response" to North Korea's initial steps towards disarmament.
Instead, he pointed out that the US continues sanctions aimed at maintaining tension.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We have a great relationship with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had produced positive results — the cessation of missile testing tests, the release of prisoners, and the return of remaining American soldiers to their homes.
And he defended his unusual approach when it comes to relations with Kim.
"It's easy to give the President an impression, but instead of standing outside, 10 000 people trying to get into this close-populated area, we have 200 here," said Trump, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and the earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island, killing hundreds of people
Following the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organisations were told that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lomboca was displaced, the state of national disaster was not declared, but it is necessary to propose foreign aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they said very clearly that they were not asking for international assistance, so this is a certain problem" said Ms Sumbung.
Although "Save the Children" collects a group to go to Pala, it is still unclear whether foreign workers will be allowed to work there.
The representative of the National Disaster Agency, Mr Sutototo, explained that Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see whether international agencies will be able to contribute to the aid.
Given the regular nature of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is still extremely unprepared for the rage of nature.
Although there are shelters for tsunamis in Aceh, these are rare along other shores.
It is also likely that Palo did not hear warnings of tsunamis, even though the warning was effective.
Even in the most favorable times, the movement between the many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The hospital, which was anchored in Lomboca to treat the victims of the earthquake, is now going to Pala, but it will take at least three days to reach the victims of the new scourge.
President Joko Widodo had made upgrading the destroyed infrastructure of Indonesia the central point of his election campaign, and he has given large sums to roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds has tormented Mr Joko's administration and is waiting for him to be re-elected next year.
Moreover, Mr Joko has to contend with the long-standing problem of tensions between sects in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority has adopted one of the conservative forms of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands expelled from their homes, while Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets using machetes, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons.
Watch this: Liverpool player Daniel Starige, with his ambition, restores balance in the match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge rescued Liverpool from his loss against Chelsea's Premier League, winning the goal at the Stamford Bridge stadium in London at 89 minutes.
Starige received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri, about 25 metres (30 yards) from the Chelsea Gate, when his team lost at 1:0.
He moved the ball a little to the left of himself and then kicked the ball in the farther direction of the gatepost.
In this attempt, the ball flew high across the square, reaching the top right corner of the net.
The ball eventually flew over the head of Kepa Arrizabalaga, which is in the jump, and fell into the net.
"I just tried to get that position to get to the ball, and players like Shaq always play as far ahead as possible, so I just tried to get as much time as I could," Starige explained LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Cante (Cantee) approaching, touched the ball, and, without thinking much, kicked."
"Chelsea" at half-time was led by 1:0 after the Belgian star Edden Hazard scored the 25th minute.
The Blues attacker played the ball back to Mateo Kovacic before cutting to the middle of the field and jumping to the Liverpool side as fast as possible.
Kowačičs quickly played and got the ball back in the middle of the field.
Then he did a beautiful blow between the players, allowing Azard to get to the zone.
Azard outpaced the speed of protection and completed the combination with the left foot performing a blow in a remote pole network, passing the "Liverpool" by Allison Becker.
"Liverpool" at the Champions League Group stage on Wednesday at 15.00 in "Stardio San Paolo" in Naples (Italy) will fight with "Napoli".
"Chelsea" with "Videoton" UEFA in the European League will meet on Thursday at 15.00 in London.
Indonesia tsunami kills 832 people
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has reached 832 people, early on Sunday announced by the national disaster agency.
It was reported that many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings after the 7.5-magitou earthquake that struck the country on Friday and caused up to 20 feet (~6.0 m) of high waves, informed the Agency’s representative, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The town of Palu, with more than 380 000 inhabitants, was covered by ruins of ruined buildings.
Police suspect of stabbing a woman arresting a 32-year-old man

Kromwell's statue in parliament becomes the latest "historical rewrite" scandal
It would have been ethically justified to abandon it in the light of similar activities to the Taliban, as a result of which his fanatic Puritan followers destroyed so many monuments of culture and religion in England.
However, the Cromvela Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "the fool" and "the attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "In view of the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Kromwell's figure outside Westminster's palace would also become the target.
Cromwell himself neither ordered nor executed the destruction of icons during English civil wars.
It is possible that the wrong Kromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his forefather, a century earlier lived by Thomas.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent depiction of Kromwell's views in the 19th century and is part of his hysteria of a person who, as many believe, is still worth honoring.
Mr Goldsmith informed Sunday Telegraph: "Many of Kromvels, perhaps more than today at the end of the 19th century, considered it to be a defender of the parliament against external pressure, which, of course, was a monarchy in his case.
Historical discussions continue as to whether this really is a completely accurate representation of the theme.
It is clear that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century determined the future development of our nation, and Cromwell as such is a recognised personality that represents one of the sides of the separation of the time.
As a protector of lords, it is worth praise and mention."
Pig-sleap to death collapsed a farmer in China
According to the local media, the pig in the market in south-west China attacked and killed the farmer.
The man — mentioned only in his surname Yuan — was found dead with a broken artery, all in the same blood at a pig shed on the market in Liupanshui province of Guizhou, reported on Sunday at South China Morning Post.
The pig farmer is about to inject vaccines to pigs on 30 May 2005 in a pig stable in the province of Qinghai, Xining.
He and his cousin were reported to have arrived on Wednesday from neighbouring Yunnan Province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found the man dead and discovered that the door of the nearby pig house was open.
He said that there was a large male pig in the pig hen with blood on his mouth.
According to a judicial medical examination, 550 pounds (~249 kg) of heavy vepris had collapsed the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and mutilated," said the cousin – only his surname Vu (Wu) was mentioned, writing "Guiyang Evening News".
The safety camera material showed Yuan entering the market on Thursday at about 4.40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan was not owned by him or his cousin.
The Market Manager informed "Evening News" that the vampris was turned on to prevent its attacks on others while the police collected evidence on site.
According to the information, the Yuan family and market management discuss compensation for his death.
Although such cases are rare, other pig attacks in humans are known.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and a man on their farm in Massachusetts, resulting in critical injuries to a man.
Even 10 years ago, a 650 - pound (~295 kg) pig in Wales kept farmers forced to the tractor until the animal was frightened by his wife.
After farmers at Oregon ate their pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba "CBC News" explained that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "pistol shot".
"They're just playful.
They like to covet, they're very curious... they don't want to harm you.
You just have to show them enough respect," he said.
The end of Orkan Rose brings a great and powerful case to the southwest of the United States
It is predicted that hurricane Rosa will weaken along the coldest waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
In the next few days, however, Rosa will bring flooding to northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
At five o’clock in the afternoon (U.S. East), Rose’s gusts reached 143 km/h (85 miles per hour), corresponding to a category 1 hurricane, and its point was 620 km (385 miles) southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low pressure depression is formed above the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward to the eastern coast of the United States. As Rose approaches the peninsula of Lower California, Baja California, on Monday it will begin to push the mass of moisture deep from the tropical zone northward to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday part of Mexico, rose will bring up to 10 inches (~25.4 cm) of rain.
Then tropical moisture, interacting with the approaching low pressure depression, will create a large heavy rain zone in the southwest in the next few days.
1-4 inches (~2.6-10.2 cm) of rain will cause dangerous sudden floods, mud currents and possibly landslides in the desert.
Humidity deep from the tropical zone will cause rainfall, which in some places will reach 2-3 inches (~5,1–7,6 cm) per hour, especially in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
In some south-west, especially in most of Arizona, is expected up to 24 inches (~5.2-10.1 cm) of rain.
There may be sudden flooding with rapid deterioration due to the spread of tropical rains.
It is highly undesirable to walk in the desert because of the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into rapid rivers, but storms will bring local gust winds and sand storms.
A low pressure depression approaching will bring local heavy rains to the southern California coastline.
Rainfalls are possible, which together exceed half an inch (~1.3 cm), and this can lead to small mud streams and slippery roads.
This will be the region's first rain gas in the wet season.
Certain diffuse tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday before the rain takes over the wider area late on Monday and early on Tuesday.
Strong rain will spread on Tuesday in the Four Corner region (DR Colorado, DA Yuta, NA Arizona and DR Jaunmexika) and will last all Wednesday.
In October there is a possibility of intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States, as temperatures in the Arctic are falling, but the tropics are still quite warm.
Sometimes it causes dramatic changes in temperature at a short distance.
This is an example of dramatic temperature differences on Sunday in the central part of the United States.
The difference between the temperature in the city of Kansas, Missouri, and Omah, Nebraska, and in Saint Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, varies by almost 20 degrees.
The next days will try to form and expand the long summer heat.
In a large part of the United States central and eastern parts of October is expected to be warm, reaching 80 degrees Fahrenheit (~27 degrees Celsius) in large areas from the southern plains to part of the northeast.
The temperature in New York City on Tuesday could reach 80 degrees Fahrenheit (~27 degrees Celsius), which would exceed the average by about 10 degrees.
Our long-term climate forecasts indicate a high probability that in the first half of October, temperatures in the eastern part of the United States will exceed the average.
More than 20 million people watched the Bret Kaveno case
More than 20 million people on Thursday on six television channels watched with enthusiasm, as shown by Brett Kavanaugh, candidate of the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Kaveno of sexual harassment, which, according to a woman, took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political tie continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular transmission to report on the latest developments in Friday's events: an agreement organised by Arizona senator Jeff Flake that the FBI will investigate charges for a week.
Forda informed the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate that she was absolutely convinced that Kaveno drunk him and tried to remove her clothes during the high school party.
Kaveno showed that he was absolutely convinced that this was not the case.
According to Nielsen, on Friday, 20.4 million people watched it all.
CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC recorded the interest of medium-sized viewers.
Data for other broadcasters, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which demonstrated it, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has problems counting people looking at the offices.
In order to get a better idea, this number of viewers corresponds to the number of watchers of the "Oskara" or "Oskara" ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose commentators have strongly supported the appointment of Kaveno, had the highest number of viewers, an average of 5.69 million throughout the day during the hearing, said Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3,26 million spectators.
CBS attracted 3,1 million, NBC 2,94 million, MSNBC 2,89 million and CNN 2,52 million, reported Nielsen.
The interest remained great even after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican team had published a statement that he would vote for the appointment of Kaveno, the senator was noticed by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning when he, accompanied by the cries of indignation of protestors, tried to get the elevator to the Justice Committee hearing.
On a live CNN broadcast, he stood for several minutes stabbed eyes as grubbed.
"I stand here, right in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told that "you have power while so many women are powerless."
Flake explained that his team had made a statement, and before the elevator door closed, he was told that he still had something to say during the committee hearing.
Cable networks and broadcasters reflected what was happening live several hours later, when the Committee on Justice was about to vote on the nomination of Kaveno to vote in the Senate.
Flake, however, claimed that he would only do so if he knew that the FBI would deal next week with the accusations against the candidate that a minority of democrats had demanded.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Senator of Democrats Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Koons and several other senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kaveno without an investigation.
President Trump has commissioned the FBI to investigate charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of political games on Bruxit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Teresa May accused people who criticise her plan to leave the European Union of "political games" with Britain's future and undermining national interests.
The British Prime Minister, Teresa May, arrives to the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, next to an interview with her on the first page of the newspaper, Maija's former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, continues to attack her Brexis plan for Britain's future relations with the European Union, the so-called Chequers plan, emphasizing that the suggestion that Britain and the EU use each other's tariffs is "totally absurd".
Form Sims' shooting: the police arrested Duteon Simpson suspected of murder of LSU player
The police have arrested the suspect for shooting Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, aged 20, was arrested and arrested as an accused of second degree murder, informed Baton Rouge police station.
The officials released a video of Sam’s clash with Simpson, and the police said that Sam lost his glasses during the fight.
The CBS subsidiary, WAFB, reports that police glasses were found at the scene of the crime and that Simpson’s blood was found on them.
After his interrogation, the police informed him that he had confessed to the shooting of Wade.
According to a lawyer, he was given $350,000 in security.
On Friday, a team of court medical experts from East Baton Rouge Parish published a preliminary report stating that the death was caused by a shot in the head that hit the neck.
The Department thanks the State Police refugee search team of Louisiana, the State Police forensics laboratory, the South University police and the population of the territory for assisting in the investigation leading to arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU Sports Director, thanked the law enforcement authorities for their "satisfaction and work in the name of justice".
Sam was 20 years old.
6 feet 6 inches (~1.98 m) the long attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball LSU.
In the last season in one game he scored 5.6 points on average and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning LSU basketball coach Will Wade announced that the team is "shocked" and "shocked" about Wade's death.
"That's what a man's always worried about," said Wade.
The volcano spits ash across Mexico City
The ash from the Pokatepetla volcano has reached the southern neighbourhood of the capital of Mexico.
After activity was observed in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours, the National Disaster Prevention Centre on Saturday warned the Mexicans that they should not approach the volcano.
The center observed multiple tingling and trembling.
Images on social networks showed that car windshields in Mexico City, such as Hochimilko (Xochimilco), are covered with a thin layer of ash.
Geophysicists have noticed 45 miles (72 kilometers) to the southeast of the capital’s volcanic activity, since a 7.1-magitud earthquake shaken the central part of Mexico in 2017.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police conflict with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the clashes between the protesters supporting independence and the police of public order and, when thousands joined the demonstrations of opponents, to mark the first anniversary of the political vote on the separation of Catalonia.
A group of camouflage supporters, who were prevented by the police of public order, trampled them with eggs and sprinkled them with powdery paint, creating dark dust clouds on the streets, which would usually be full of tourists.
Later that day the discord broke out, and the police used stunts to prevent fights.
For several hours, groups of advocates of independence were involved in the confrontation with pro-unitive protestors, who said, "Ilgo life for Spain!"
According to local newspapers, 14 people were given medical help because of minor injuries during protests.
One year after the 1 October referendum, which Madrid declared illegal, but which was praised by the Catalans, the idea of independence in the region remains under great pressure.
The voters strongly expressed their independence, although the turnout was low, and those who were against separation mostly boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan officials, almost 1 000 people were injured last year, when the police tried to stop voting at election points throughout the region, and there were brutal clashes.
Independence-supporting groups had served on Friday night to prevent demonstrations in support of the state police.
The demonstration took place, but the demonstrators were forced to choose a different path.
Narcis Termes, a 68 - year - old electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, admitted that he no longer expects Catalonia to gain independence.
"Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents' eyes filled with tears of joy for having been allowed to vote, but now everything has stopped," he said.
Although parties that support Catalonia's independence won last year's regional elections with a small but significant victory, these parties have fought to stay on track this year, as several of the most well-known leaders have either emigrated or been arrested and are waiting for a trial for their role in organising a referendum and in the subsequent declaration of independence.
The 42-year-old mechanic Joan Puig, who filmed on the phone to support the police of protests, said that the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"The tension is growing," he said.
On Saturday, one of the nine Catalan leaders, Oriol Junqueras, who has been in detention before the court since the previous year, announced that he would stand for elections to the European Parliament next year.
"Candying in the European elections is the best way to expose the regression of democratic values and the repression that the Spanish Government has brought against us," he said.
Londonderija: Men arrested after a car crash in the building
Three men (33, 34, and 39 years old) were arrested after the car was hit repeatedly against the Londonder building.
The incident took place at Balynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 7.30 p.m. in BST.
Detective inspector Bob Blemming informed that the gates and the building itself were damaged.
Perhaps the car was fired from the arballet at the same time.
Menga blow allows "Livingston" with 1-0 to win "Rangers"
Dolly Menga's first gates secured the win of Livingston
The Supported Livingston blinded "Ranger" by giving Steven Gerrard the second loss in his 18 games as manager of the "Ibrax" club.
Dolly Menga's blow turned out to be decisive, because Gary Holt's team levelled the situation with "Hibernian".
The Gerard team has not won this season, and next Sunday they have to meet the leader "Hearts", from which they lag by eight points.
Before that, on Thursday in the European League, "Rangers" hosted Vienna's "Rapid".
Meanwhile, Livingston extended its series without loss in the division to six games, and the main coach, Holt, has still not felt the taste of defeat since Kenny Miller changed last month.
Livingston doesn't use the option against the dim guests
Holt's team had to be in the lead long before they got the words with their direct game, which made it difficult for Ranger in a wide variety of ways.
Scott Robinson broke out, but delayed his attempt in front of the gate, then Alan Lithgow's attempt after slipping into his legs to prevent Craig Halkett's blow with his head across the gate line was unsuccessful.
The owners allowed the Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they would be able to stop the guests in the planned places.
And that is how the decisive gates arrived.
Ranger allowed a free-stroke, and Livingston used the corridor, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined together to provide an opportunity for Menga, who beat and scored the gate from the middle of the zone.
At this stage, Ranger managed the ball, but the protection of guests turned out to be impervious and nobody particularly disturbed the goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
This continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos ordered Kelly to save the gate.
Scott Pitman's attempt was interrupted by the "Rangers" goalkeeper Alan McGregor's agility, and Litgov dropped past the gate in the "Livingston" combination.
The Livingston area continued to show up centred bombs, but two calls for punishment were rejected following Halket's fight for a ball with a substitute, Glenn Middleton, and for a hand playing.
"Fenomenal" "Livingston" performance - analysis
The Scottish BBC Alsdair Lamont in the Tony Maši arena
Phenomenal "Livingston" performance and result.
Each of them was excellent, continuing to beat expectations by continuously improving performance.
Their game style and personalities have practically not changed since returning to the highest eschelon, but much praise is due to Holt for how he has assembled the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great in maintaining first class protection, while Manga made sure that Connor Goldson and Joe Worral always kept alert.
But Ranger lacked inspiration.
No matter how good they were at times under Gerard’s authority, they were far from these standards.
Their last ball was boring – only once they broke into the part of the master's square – and it's basically an invitation to wake up "Ranger, who is in the middle of the table.
Erdogan in Cologne awaits with shared feelings
On Saturday (29 September), when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin, there were many smiles and blue sky.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have disagreements on various issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new gigantic mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
The police blocked a crowd of 25,000 people for security reasons, not allowing them to meet in front of the mosque, but many of the supporters came near to see their president.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdogan — a large part of them being Kurds — also expressed their attitude by condemning both Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to take him to themselves.
The protests between both sides reflect the contradictions caused by the guest, some of whom see the German Turk as a hero, while others despise it as an autocratic.
Road traffic accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
London’s cyclist died in a car collision.
The collision took place on the intersection of Bestwood Street with Evelyn Street, on the road section with intensive traffic in Deptford, in the south-east of the city, at about 10.15 BST.
The driver stopped, and the medical staff helped, but the man died at the scene.
The collision took place several months after another cyclist died on Childers Street, about a mile from the place of Sunday.
The capital police announced that the police were involved in identifying a man and informing their loved ones.
Roads and buses are closed at the location of the event, but car drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Long Longin prison: six employees injured during riots
The Prison Administration (Prison Office) reports that six prison staff were injured in a disorderly men's strict regime prison.
The riots broke out in HMP Long Lartin prison in Vorchestershire at about 9.30 a.m. on BST Sunday and are still ongoing.
To prevent riots involving eight prisoners who are confined to one wing, special service "Tornado" staff were involved
Employees were treated for mild facial injuries at the site of the event.
A representative of the Prison Service stated: "In order to resolve the HMP Long Long Longin incident in prison, specially trained prison staff were involved.
Six staff members were provided with medical assistance due to injuries.
We will not accept violence in our prisons and say clearly that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend more time behind bars".
There are more than 500 prisoners in HMP Long Long Longin prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the prison chief was reported to have been treated in the hospital following an attack by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the rebels were sent to prison to resolve the serious disorder in which the personnel had been attacked by billiard bombs.
Orkan Rosa Phoenix, Las Vegas and Solt Lake City are threatened with sudden flooding (probably the situation will benefit the areas affected by drought)
Arizona is rarely suffering from tropical depression, but this is likely to happen early in the next week when hurricane Rosa, with the remaining force, is moving across the deserted southwest, causing a sudden flood risk.
National Weather Service has already issued a warning about sudden flooding on Monday and Tuesday in the western part of Arizona, the southern and eastern parts of Nevada, the southeastern part of California, and the Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaph, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move right across Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving with the case late on Monday.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix Twitter recorded that since 1950, only "ten tropical cyclones kept the status of tropical storms or depression within a 200-mile (320 km) radius from Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was an hurricane 40 miles (65 km) from the borders of AZ."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 2–4 inches (~5.08–10.2 cm) of rainfall, reaching up to 6 inches (15.24 cm) in some places.
Other areas of the south-west desert area, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive 1-2 inches (~2,54-5.08 cm), reaching up to 4 inches (~10.2 cm) in some places.
For those who are not at risk of sudden flooding, the rain of Rose can become a blessing because of the drought in the region.
Although the possibility of flooding is a very serious concern, some of the rainfall is likely to be good, as south-west is currently suffering from drought.
According to US drought control (Drought Monitor) slightly over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category, reported by weather.com.
First, the hurricane Rose’s road leads to the Low California (Baia California) Peninsula in Mexico, where it will reach the coast.
Rosa still has the force of hurricane on Sunday morning at a maximum wind speed of 85 miles (137 km) per hour, located about 385 miles (~620 km) south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moving north at a speed of 12 miles (19 km) per hour.
The storm encounters cooler Pacific waters and therefore slows down.
It is therefore expected that the hurricane with the force of tropical storms will reach the coast in Mexico on Monday afternoon or morning.
In the rainy part of Mexico, there may be a serious risk of flooding.
"It is expected that the rainfall will reach 3-6 inches (7.62-15.24 cm) from Lower California inside the south-western part of Sonora, precipitation, possibly reaching 10 inches (25.4 cm)," reported weatherer.com.
Rose will move north, across Mexico as a tropical storm, and then reach the Arizona border early on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then cross Arizona and arrive in the south of Utah late on Tuesday night.
"The main threat expected from Rosa or its residues is very heavy rainfall in Lower California, in the north-western part of Sonora and in the deserted south-west of the United States," said the National Centre of Orkans.
This rain is expected to cause life-threatening sudden floods and mud flows in deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack on Midsommer Norton: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20 - year - old man were arrested for attempted murder after a 16 - year - old boy was found in Somerset with wound wounds.
The injured teenager was found on the territory of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at about 4 p.m. in BST.
He was taken to a hospital where his condition remained "stable".
The police informed that 17-year-old and two 18-year-old teenagers, as well as a 20-year-old man, were arrested overnight in Redstock, Eivon and Somerset.
The police have asked anyone who could have a mobile phone material about what happened.
Trump claims that Kaveno has suffered from the "violence and anger" of the Democrat Party.
"The vote on Judge Kaveno is a vote to reject the cruel and violent tactics of the Democrat Party," Trump announced at a meeting in Wheeling, Western Virginia.
Trump stressed that Kaveno suffered from the "evilness and anger" of the Democrat party throughout his nomination process.
Kaveno witnessed before Congress, where he vigorously and emotionally denied any accusations of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford decades ago, when both were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed his accusations in the course of the hearing.
The President announced on Saturday that "The Americans saw" Kaveno's "excellence, abilities and courage".
"The vote on the approval of Judge Kaveno is a vote to confirm one of the most educated lawyers of our time with a brilliant history in connection with the ministry of the people," he declared in support of the crowd in West Virginia.
President Kaveno referred to the nomination as being oblivious in terms of the importance of the activities of the Republicans in the interim elections.
"Five weeks to one of the most important elections in our time.
I didn't stand as a candidate, but I actually did," he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere, fighting for great candidates."
Trump argued that the democrats have undertaken a mission to "prosthetise and resist".
It is expected that the first of the important procedural votes in the Senate on the nomination of Kaveno will take place no later than Friday, CNN informed the Senior Assistant to the Government of the Republican Party.
Hundreds of people killed in an earthquake in Indonesia, and it is clear that the number of victims is increasing
Officials reported on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed, many simply washed away when gigantic waves hit the coast after a severe earthquake and tsunami struck the island of Sulawes.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered on the beach for the festival in Palu, when up to six metres (18 feet) of high waves hit the coast in a chair, rinsing many to death and destroying everything on their way.
The tunami erupted after a violent earthquake of 7.5 puppets.
"When there was a tsunami threat yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not flee immediately, and they were victims," said Sutoto Purwo Nugroho, representative of the Indian disaster relief agency BNPB, in Jakarta.
"The tunami didn't come alone, it brought cars, logs and buildings, it drattered everything that was on the ground," Nugoro said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the sea at 800 km/h before it hit the coast (497 mph).
"Many people climbed on trees to escape, and survived," he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers of Palu.
The photographs taken on the flight by the disaster agency show many destroyed houses and shops, deformed and collapsed bridges, and a water enveloped mosque.
After the rush, the coastal city continued to tremble on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application of the BPPT, in its statement, stressed that the energy distributed by the Friday massive earthquakes was about 200 times higher than the energy of the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay may have reinforced the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho's damage was described as "wide", and informed that thousands of houses, hospitals, shops and hotels had collapsed.
He said that some victims found bodies trapped under ruined buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho admitted that the number of victims and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in the area called Dongala, which is located nearer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
"Communications "were completely destroyed, no information was received from Dongal," said Nugroho.
More than 300 000 people live there," said the Red Cross in the communication, adding that its personnel and volunteers travel to the affected regions.
"It's a tragedy, but everything could have been even worse," the organization informed.
On Saturday, the Agency was widely criticised for not knowing that the tsunami had struck Pala, even though officials claimed that the waves arrived at the announcement of the warning.
A video distributed on social networks shows that a man desperately calls people on the bottom of the street in the upper floor of the building for approaching a tsunami.
Within a few minutes, the water wall strikes against the shore, washing away the buildings and machines.
News agency Reuters was unable to confirm immediately whether the material was real.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a serious loss of power, which cut off the communication Pala, making it difficult for officials to coordinate rescue.
The officials announced that the army had begun sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still need food and other basic necessities.
The city airport is open only for aid measures and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami exceeds 800.
That's very bad.
Mr Doseba said that the employees of the World Vision, who successfully reached the city of Palu from Dongala, now live in a tarpaulin in the yard of the office, passed through the scenes of destruction.
"They told us they saw a lot of buildings destroyed," he explained.
That's very bad.
Even when aid teams have resolutely started to organise aid to disaster victims, some complained that foreign aid workers with great experience were not allowed to go to Pala.
According to Indonesian legislation, financing, resources and staff of overseas organisations will only be allowed to arrive if the disaster area is declared as a national disaster area.
This has not yet happened.
"It is still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Arriani, representative of the Red Cross of Indonesia.
"When the government announces, "OK, this is a national disaster," we will be able to accept international aid, but this status has not yet been established."
When Palu arrived on the second night after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, friends and family members of unfound people continued to hope that their loved ones would become miracles that would brighten the gloomy life of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the drain.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been pressed under the rubble for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono (Gendon Subandono), a coach of the Indonesian national paraglider team, had prepared two of the missing paraglider Asian games that took place earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other people who were trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr Mandagi, were their students.
"As an experienced paraglider," he said, "I teach the burden of emotion."
Mr. Gendon remembered that after the news of the breakdown of the Roa Roa Hotel spread to the paragliders team, he desperately sent the WhatsApp reports to the Palu contestants who participated in the beach festival for hours.
However, the result of his reports was only one grey mark, not two blue marks.
"I think it means the messages didn't reach the addressee," he said.
The thieves robbed 26 750 dollars during the ATM filling in the Newport on the Levee complex
According to a statement from Newport Police Department, thieves stole $26,750 on Friday morning for a Brink's employee who loaded the ATM Newport on the Leee complex.
"The driver of the car emptied the ATM of the entertainment complex and was prepared to fill it with more money," Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While the manager was busy, another man ran from the back to the Brink's employee and stole the bag with the banker's money.
According to the press release, the Witnesses noticed a number of suspicious persons who left the scene of crime, but the police did not specify the number of those involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities should contact the Newport police 859-292-3680.
Kanje Vest: Reper changes his name to Je
Reperis Kanje Vests changes his name to Ye (Je).
When he announced his replacement on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The Būtne, who previously knew as Kanji Vestu."
The 41-year-old West had already been called Je for some time and used the nickname as the name of his eighth album, published in June ("Ye").
This change takes place before his appearance on the show "Saturday Night Live," in which, as expected, he will release his new album "Yandhi".
The creators of the show tell us that he is replacing singer Arian Grandi, who stopped the work "emotional cause".
The West has said that it is not only an abbreviation of his current professional name, but it also has religious significance.
"I believe that 'Ye' is the most common word used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'Tu'," Vest explained earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with the radio broadcast leader Big Boy (Big Boi).
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
At first there was Kanye, which means "only one, followed by "Ye", which is a reflection of good and bad in us, about our confusion, about everything.
Album more is reflection on who we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs, previously known as Puff Daddy, Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the words Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who had previously collaborated with Vestus, also has and has not used the sign of thought and the capital letters.
The elected Mexican President promises not to use the army against the civilian population
The elected Mexican President, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has promised never to use military force against civilians during the 50th anniversary of the bloody repayment to students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday to "never use the army to oppress the Mexican people."
The troops shot a peaceful demonstration on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when left - minded student movements spread throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has sworn to support young Mexicans by issuing monthly subsidies to students and opening more public universities.
He said that unemployment and a lack of education draw young people into criminal gangs.
US funding for artificial intelligence should be doubled
As China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in this field, explains investor and artificial intelligence practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments were made after various US government bodies have made statements on artificial intelligence, although the US generally lacks a strategy in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China launched its plan last year: its aim is to become a leading country in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"A double budget for artificial intelligence research will be a good start, given that all the other countries are so lagging behind in the United States, and there is a coming cardinal turn in the field of artificial intelligence," said Lee.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said that doubling the funding could double the possibility that the next achievement in the field of artificial intelligence would take place in the US.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Executive Director of Innovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the most prominent artificial intelligence companies in China "Face++".
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked to create an artificial intelligence system that would beat America's best Othello (Reverse) player, but later he was the leading employee of Microsoft Research and the president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee was recognized by previous U.S. government organized technology competitions, such as "Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge" and asked when he would be prepared for the next to identify people with ideas for the future".
"Scientists in the United States often have to work very hard to get government grants," picture Lee.
"It's not China that attracts leading scientists, it's the big companies," he explained.
"Facebook", "Google" and other technology companies have hired university luminaires to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee added that changes in immigration policy could also help the US to improve its achievements in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that green cards should be automatically given to people with a PhD in philosophy in the field of artificial intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China published its next generation artificial intelligence development plan.
Lee explained that the National Science Foundation of China provides funding to people from academic institutions, similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organisations providing money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
This year, the U.S. Defense Department (U.S. Defense Department) established a joint artificial intelligence centre, which will bring together partners from industry and academia, and White Nam announced the creation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA (Central Research and Development Organisation of the US Ministry of Defence) announced a 2 billion dollar investment in the initiative called "AI Next".
The National Science Foundation, on the other hand, currently invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, US legislation, which was tasked with setting up a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has not been working for several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the name of the country
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country to "The Republic of North Macedonia", taking a step that will prevent decades of disagreement with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's requests for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, stresses that its northern neighbour's name is indicative of claims on its territory and has vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but the nationalists in the opposition insist that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in a referendum, and the campaign calling for boycott has raised concerns as to whether the turnout will reach the minimum of 50% required for the referendum to be recognised as valid.
The referendum bulletin asks: "Are you in favour of membership in NATO and the EU by means of an agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying on their way to Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the break-up of Yugoslavia, becoming an organisation, such as an EU and NATO member.
"I have come to vote for the future of the country, for Macedonian young people, so that they can live freely under the cover of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament have declared that they will take into account the outcome of the vote, which will become decisive.
A 2/3 majority will be required in Parliament to change the name.
The National Electoral Commission informed that no violations had been reported before 1 p.m.
However, the activity was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the previous parliamentary elections, in which 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said Giose Tanevski, 62-year-old voter in Skopje, the capital.
The Macedonian Prime Minister, Zoran Zayev, his wife, Zorica and their son, Dushko, handed over their votes in a referendum in Macedonia on the change of name, which will open the way to NATO and the European Union, to Strumica in Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov, prepared a small stage and arranged chairs at the tents put on by those who would boycott a referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to stand up with a head, not through the doors of servants," said Kavakarov.
"We are a small country, but we have self-esteem.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China or Russia, and become part of European-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zajevs claims that NATO membership will start the necessary investment in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate exceeds 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority will give a vote for, the more than 80"% of our citizens support the EU and NATO," said Zayev after the vote.
He said that the result "yes" "will confirm our future".
Last Monday's survey published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research shows that 30-43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum, less than the required activity.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian Telema TV found that 57 percent of the voters were planning to participate in the Sunday vote.
70 percent of them replied that they would vote in favour.
For a referendum to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent and another vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the West-oriented government that came to power last May.
Watch: Manchester "City" Sergio Aguero is released through the entire "Brighton" protection to get the goal
Serhio Agvero and Raheem Sterling defeated the "Brighton" protection by allowing Manchester "City" on Saturday at the "Etihad" stadium in Manchester, England to win with 2:0.
Agvero gave the impression that his goal gain at the 65th minute was ridiculously light.
The Argentinian attacker received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the combination.
He ran out between the three Brighton guards and threw himself into the free space.
Then Agvero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He took the ball to one guard, then he ran a few more Brighton at the edge of the field.
Then he made a key to the left, reaching Sterling.
The English center attacker used his first touch to play back Agvero, who used the right football boot to defeat the "Brigton" goalkeeper Matthew Ryan, smashing the ball on the right side of the network.
"Agvero is struggling with foot problems," Pep Guardiola, manager of "City" told reporters.
"We discussed playing for 55, 60 minutes with him.
That's exactly what happened.
We were lucky that he scored the goal at that time.
However, it was Sterling, which provided Sky Blues with an initial advantage in the Premier League's wrestling.
The gate was reached in the 29th minute.
Agvero got the ball deep into the Brighton.
He sent the ball with a beautiful blow along the eggs of Leroy Sane's left leg.
Sane made several blows until he ordered Sterling to take the ball to the farther gate.
The Sky Blues Center attacker easily turned a bomb into the network just before crossing the border.
"City" fights with "Hoffenheim" Champion League group games on Tuesday at 12.55 on Tuesday at "Rhein-Neckar-Arena" stadium in Zinshai, Germany.
Shercer wants to cause problems at Rockies
Since "Nationals" does not participate in the defeat games, there was no reason to restart.
But Scherzer, who is always ready to compete, hopes to take advantage of the opportunity against Colorado "Rockies" on Sunday, but only if "Rockies" will be the actual defeat games. And the Rockies Group of the West of the National League is led by one match against Los Angeles's "Dodgers".
"Rockies" has printed at least a white card with a Friday night at 5:2 winning "Nationals", but still has not won their first title in the Division.
"Although we play the same way, we will at least be able to have fun, knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver, with the crowd and the other team, will probably be the most annoyed to me this year.
And why wouldn't I want to compete?"
"Nationals" has not yet announced who will start the game on Sunday, but it says he is ready to let Shercer do a pitch.
Shercer, for whom it will be the beginning of 34. On Thursday, he conducted a litter session in the "bullpen" part of the field, and on Sunday, during the normal rest time, he will throw the ball.
"Washington" bellow is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikes 220 2/3 innings in this season.
Tramp hosts rallies in West Virginia
The President referred to the situation in which the candidate of the Supreme Court Brett Kaveno, chosen by him, has entered, at the same time talking about the importance of the activity of the Republican electorate in the interim elections.
"Everything we have done is under threat in November.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
It's really very, very serious -- I didn't stand as a candidate, but actually I did, and that's why I'm everywhere and I'm fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say, 'You see this terrible, terrible group of democrat radicals who are acting right now.
And they are determined to regain power, using all possible means to achieve the goal. You see evil, repugnant action.
They don't care what they're going to hurt, who they have to break in order to gain power and control, that's why they want to gain power and control, and we won't give them that."
The democrats, he said, have undertaken the mission of "prosecuting and resisting".
"And you yourself have seen it in the last four days," he stressed, calling the democrats "unstinting, evil, naughty and false."
He named Diane Feinstein, Senator of the Democrat Party of the Senate Committee on Justice, to whom the audience responded with loud cries.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Hmm, what are we talking about?
No, hmm, wait -- it was really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer ready for diversity.
It is tolerant of the open
It was no wonder that Momentum activists in my local party wanted me to be subject to censorship.
After all, I am the last Labour Party to date in the line of MPs who have been informed that he is not desirable, all of this because we do not hide our opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, went along the same way because she was determined to oppose anti-Semitism.
In my case, the movement criticised me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of economically responsible policies, of national security, of Europe, ironic, but these were issues where Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the Labour Summit in the eastern part of Nottingham states on Friday that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Most of the meetings that took place during my career as a member of my local Labour Parliament were exactly that.
Unfortunately, the atmosphere at many meetings today is different and promises of a "kinder, more gentle" policy have long been forgotten if they have ever existed.
It has become increasingly clear that the Labour Party does not want to tolerate different views, and any view is judged depending on whether it is acceptable to the party's management.
It started soon after Jeremy became a leader: colleagues who I think are similar in terms of our political views began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and accept opinions that I would never have agreed to in other cases, whether they are national security or a single EU market.
When I speak publicly — and basically it doesn't matter what I'm saying — I'm following a play on social media, calling for a ban on standing in the next elections, exposing the centre's policy, claiming that I have no place in the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments against me are usually political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who are confronted every day with a stream of sexist and racist insults, but never try to escape silently.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how normal exploitation has become.
Jeremy Corbin announced last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer an organisation ready for diversity of views and, with every expression of distrust or change of selection rules, the party is narrowing.
During the last two years, I have often been advised not to jump to the harrows, to think about what I'm talking about, and then "everything will be fine" with me.
But that is not why I decided to get involved in politics.
Since I joined the Labourers 32 years ago as a student in response to the neglect of the government in Techer, which had literally led my integrated school class to collapse, I set out to fight for better public services for those who need them most, both as a member of the local council and as a minister of the government.
I have never concealed my political views, nor in previous elections.
No one in the East of Nottingham had any reason to doubt my position on political matters and in areas where I disagreed with the existing government.
For those who put forward the proposal on Friday, I can only say that at a time when the country is moving decisively towards Brexita, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to spend such time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But basically, the only thing I want to announce is not for Nottingham's Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are Labour Members: I am proud to be able to serve you, and I promise that there is no threat of denying to stand up or reminders that no one is irreplaceable in politics, will not stop me from doing what I think is best for all of you.

"Ayr" 38 - 17 "Melrose": The unharmed "Ayr" reaches the highest line in the table
The last two attempts may to some extent split the final result, but there is no doubt that "Ayr" deserves to triumph in this amazingly exciting Scottish Championship match today.
Now they're at the top of the table, the only unscathed team out of ten.
After all, it was both their great protection and the much better use of the opportunities that led the hosts, and the coach Peter Murchie has every reason to be content.
"We have tested all our games and we are still not defeated, so I have to rejoice," he said.
"Melrose" Robin Christie: "All respect "Ayr", they used their opportunities better than we did."
The attempt by Grant Anderson at the 14th minute, by Frazier Climo, put forward "Ayr", but the yellow card to the Scottish captain, Rory Hughes, where the Warriors had been awarded, changed the numbers of Melrose, and Jason Baggot, who caught an unrealized ball.
Klimo increased the management of "Ayr" with punishment, right at the end of half-time, he scored points, then realized the solo attempt, so in the break "Ayr" went by 17-5.
But Melrose started half-time with a good game, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was carried out by Begot, reduced the backwardness to 5 points.
Then there was a long break, because Ruaridh Knott suffered a serious injury and was taken away from the field to the loaders, but when the game resumed "Ayr" quickly moved forward when Staffor McDowall carried out an attempt that was carried out by Klimo.
The captain of Ayr, Blair Macpherson, then received a yellow card, and once again, after intense pressure, Melrose used an excess player, with Bruce Colvine's attempt, which was not realized.
However, the owners were paralyzed, and when Straan Hutchinson received the yellow card for grabbing Klimo without a bomb, from the penal corridor, McFerson did the tačdaun "Ayr" at the back of the pier.
Klimo realized the ball, as before, almost from the resumption itself, after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong in the court of kicks and sent the Flange player Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt.
Still Game star seems to plan a new career in the restaurant business
Ford Kieran, star of the "Still Game" series, seems to be planning to enter the hospitality business, because he was found to be the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show he is creating and participating in with his old partner in comedys by Greg Hemphill.
Duet has announced that the next ninth season will be the last show, and Kīrnan apparently plans his life after Craiglang.
According to official information, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although the Scottish Sun source pointed out that Kīrnan planned to get involved in Glasgow's "fashioning restaurant business".
"The sea belongs to us!": Bolivia, trapped on land, hopes that the court will open the way to the Pacific Ocean
The seamen patrol around Flote Stab in La Paz.
Public buildings have raised the blue flags of the ocean.
Fleet-based ships from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are decorated with a motto: "We have the right to the sea.
It's our duty to get it back."
The memory of Chile in the bloody 19th - century conflict of the lost coastline is still alive in the dry country of Bolivia, as is the yearning to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
These expectations have probably been highest for decades, as Bolivia awaits the judgment of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of review.
"Bolivia is developing, it is united and peaceful in its spirit, and, of course, positive thoughts await the outcome," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivists will watch the International Court of Justice's judgment on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Tribunal in The Hague will decide in favour of Bolivia's request that, after several decades of negotiations that have been conducted with interruptions, Chile has a duty to discuss granting a sovereign way to the sea to Bolivia.
The charismatic president of Bolivia’s local origin, Evo Morales, who is awaiting a controversial fight for re-election next year, is also very interested in Monday’s judgment.
"We are close to regaining the Pacific Ocean," he excavated at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that a judgment in favour of Bolivia is unlikely, and if so, no major changes are expected.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no mandate to grant the territory of Chile, and its representatives have said that they will not determine the possible outcome of the negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice is passed only six months after the final review shows that the case was "not complicated", explained the international regulatory expert, Paz Zárate, from Chile.
And the last four years have not moved the Bolivian case forward but, on the contrary, delayed it.
"The question of access to the sea has been misappropriated by the current Bolivian administration," said Zarate.
Morales' militant rhetoric has stifled the rest of her good will, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will once continue to negotiate, but after this, it will be very difficult to hold a discussion.
Both countries have not exchanged with the ambassadors since 1962.
Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, former president, Edwardo Rodríguez Veltzé, did not agree that the court took the decision unusually quickly.
Monday will bring Bolivia an "extraordinary opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and an opportunity to " put an end to the 139-year conflicts from which both sides will benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used sea problems as a political cop.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"This decision is an opportunity to realise what needs to be done to overcome the past."
North Korea will give up nuclear weapons only when it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong Ho said that his people would never first take away their nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made during the meeting of the leaders of both countries in Singapore.
His comments were made at a time when the US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, seems to be ready to resume the stalemate diplomatic efforts to prevent the nuclear war, more than three months after the Singaporean meeting with North Korea's leader Kim Chenun.
Ri claims it is a "fantasy" to hope that the US has not yet abolished sanctions and unwillingness to declare the end of the Korean war will ever make North Korea kneel.
Washington is cautious about agreeing to a declaration before Pyongyang will take significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
However, many are sceptical about whether Phenjana really wants to give up armaments that the state probably considers to be the only way to guarantee its own safety.
Pompeo intends to visit Phenjan next month to prepare the next Kim appointment with Trump.
Paris Fashion Show presents the latest array of headband lines on the way to you nearest High Street
If you want to increase your hat collection or block the sun completely, then you are in the right place.
Designers Valentino and Tom Browne presented the audience with a row of absurd, huge head-to-head items in the 2019 spring/summer season collection, which dazzled against the background of Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their stunning achievements to show fashion.
Valentinos’ most outstanding design was a magnificent beige hat decorated with a wide edge like feathers that devoured their heads.
Among the massive accessories were precious watermelons, magic hat and even pineapples — but they are not designed to keep your heads warm.
Tom Brown also showed a strange selection of masks — just before Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lipsticks, and they served Hanibal Lecter rather than the high fashion.
One of the formations resembled the diving of breathing senses, with a tube and glasses, while another resembled a melted ice cream cone.
And if you want to continue with massive fashion, then it's time.
Style observers believe that huge fescues are possible on the way to High Street near you.
Large-scale hats immediately became popular after La Bomba appeared — straw hats with two feet (~60 cm) wide edges seem to have worn all, from Rianna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The status of very unpractical hats as a cult object in all social networks led to another big piece of cloth on the tongue — a straw beach bag, almost as large as the model dressed in a swimsuit, which brought it.
The reddish-yellow Rafia bag, dressed with rafia fringes and equipped with a white leather handle, took a special place in the 2019 Spring/Summer 2019 collection of "Jacquemus' La Riviera" at Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage explained to FEMAIL: "I expect large hats and beach bags to appear in central business street stores next summer, because the designer has left such a big impression that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for huge accessories."
John Edwards: knowledge of languages is essential for the citizens of the world
The Scottish independent schools have a reputation for excellence and have maintained it in 2018 when they once again obtained excellent exam results, which are further enhanced by individual and collective achievements in sport, music and other social activities.
The aim of these schools, which are attended by a total of 30,000 students in Scotland and represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), is to ensure the best level for their students and their parents.
Independent schools have set the goal of preparing their students for further and higher education, their careers and their lives as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can develop and implement special school programmes, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable subject in our schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to a person in a language that he understands, it stays in his consciousness.
If you speak his mother tongue, it remains in his heart."
It is a strong reminder that we cannot simply rely on English when we want to establish a relationship and gain the confidence of people from other countries.
Given the recent results of this year's exams, we can see that languages are at the top of league tables with the largest number of exams passed in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of foreign - language students reached the highest grade of A.
The Scottish Council of Independent Schools for 74 schools shows that 72 percent of students scored A in Chinese, and 72 percent learned German, 69 percent learned French, and 63 percent learned Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Now languages, as an object of choice, are valued in independent school programmes as much as subjects of the science-technology-engineering and mathematics group.
A 2014 survey of the Commission for Employment and Skills in Great Britain revealed that 17 percent of employers reported a lack of language skills as a reason for not being able to fill vacancies.
As a result, language skills are becoming increasingly mandatory in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With increasing job opportunities that will require language skills, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of their chosen career, learning a foreign language will bring them a real benefit in the future from such long-term skills.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically improve the competitiveness of a multi-language specialist.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in Great Britain, 75 percent did not have the ability to speak a foreign language well enough to keep the conversation going, while French was the only one who spoke a 2-digit number of people, 15 percent.
That is why the contribution to language teaching is important for today's children.
A number of languages, especially in developing countries, will provide children with better opportunities for meaningful work.
Schools in Scotland differ in terms of the languages taught.
Some schools will pay more attention to the most common languages of today, while others will teach languages such as Chinese and Japanese, which are considered to be the most important for Britain's future, according to plans for 2020.
Whatever your child is interested in, independent schools will always be able to choose from several languages and teachers will be specialists in the field.
The Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a language environment that will equip children and provide them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future may be.
At the moment, in the global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still vitally important for the future of the country, so this fact must be reflected in education.
Indeed, today's languages should be regarded as "the skills of international communication".
Independent schools will continue to offer Scottish young people this choice, diversity and excellence.
Il faut bien le faire (This has to be done).

Lebron will debut in the composition of "Lakers" on Sunday in San Diego
Fans have finally met the moment when Lebron's first game in Los Angeles's "Lakers" will take place.
Lucker coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play on Sunday before the opening of the season against Denver's Nuggets San Diego.
But it is still up to us to decide how many minutes he will play.
"It will be more than one, but less than 48," Volton informed "Lakers" on the official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James would probably play a limited number of minutes.
Continuing his practice this week, James was asked about his plans for a series of six pre-season games by Lakers.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season games to prepare," he said.
Tramp's myth in West Virginia, channel YouTube
President Donald Trump is launching a series of rallies today in Wying, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five Trampla's planned rendezvous next week, including stopping in friendly places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since the vote on his choice to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court has been suspended, Trump's aim is to obtain support in the forthcoming interim elections, as there is a risk that the Republicans will lose control of Congress after the votes were cast in November.
What time will you see Trump's meeting in West Virginia today and how can you watch it online?
Tramp is scheduled for seven o'clock in Wying, West Virginia, after ET today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the ramp in West Virginia online on YouTube.
It is likely that Trump will speak about this week's hearing in the case of candidate of the Supreme Court Brett Kaveno, which has been caused by indictments of sexual crimes, and a vote of the Senate is expected to postpone confirmation for a week, while the FBI will conduct an investigation.
However, the main objective of this meeting is to help improve the situation of the Republicans expected to be elected in November.
President Trump's campaign thus shows that this five-day meeting is about "activating volunteers and supporters, while the Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority they own in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"The control of the Congress on his agenda is so important that the President will visit as many states as possible, because we are launching an active campaign season," said Reuters, a representative of the Trump campaign who did not want to reveal his name.
This evening's meeting, which is planned for Wesbanco Arena in Villing, will attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and will be reflected in Pittsburgh media," says West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday will be the second time in the last month when Trump will visit West Virginia, the state in which he won with more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump tries to help West Virginia Senator candidate Patrick Morrisey, who lags behind according to surveys.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the President has to arrive to help improve his results in polls," said Simon Haeder, professor of political science at West Virginia University.
Radera Cup 2018: The USA has demonstrated its determination to fight to keep high expectations for Sunday singles
After three sessions in the "one word" Wednesday afternoon game format "foursome" was probably exactly what was needed for this Rider Cup.
Athletes love to talk about the fluctuations of success, and they really believe that, especially in competitions like these.
So, what side do they think is luck now?
"They were in the lead with six points, but now with four, so I think that in a sense it means that success has turned to us," said Jordan Spieth as he goes on his journey.
Europe, of course, has priority, because it is in the lead with 4 points, but another 12 will be played out.
Spit explained that the Americans believe that the wind blows in their sails and they have reason for optimism, of course, also in the person of Spit and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long, and each of them can be proud of three points out of four.
The jaw has been destructive from the first blow place, to the lawn, and is an example of the winner.
Those gullary victories became louder when his round continued, a decisive blow was made in the pit to reach the same number four times, when he and Thomas had fallen by two beats after two.
His blow in the hole, which led to their victory 15, was perceived by a similar cry, of them, of his belief that the American team has not yet been pushed out.
"It is really necessary to dig deep, and worry about your match," Spite said.
That's all that's left for these players.
18 holes to succeed.
The only players who have scored more in the last two days than Spite and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who will undoubtedly enter the history of this Rider Cup.
Europe's strange but attractive couple are four points behind and will not be able to harm.
Molivud was the only couple who lived without bogie on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogies on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and nine of the last pits on Friday morning.
This process and the way their energy flows to this crazy crowd and back convinces them that they are players to win on Sunday, and Flitewood with Molinari will be the most popular players who can ensure a potential European victory when the sun descends over the Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different pits.
However, the talk of European triumph was premature.
Babba Watson and Webb Simpson were quick to deal with this morning's hero in the form of "fourballs" in Sergio Garcia, who played with Alex Noren.
Bogie and the two double fronts in nine led the Spaniards and the Swedish trouble, and they were not even close to getting out of it.
On Sunday, however, there is no one to help you cope.
In the forms of "fourball" and "foursome" games, it is so exciting to watch nearby because of the interaction of couples, to watch what advice they give, and what not, and how strategy can instantly change the situation.
Europe has played better as a team up to now and is in a far-reaching lead before the last day, but this race in the form of "foursome" showed that the US team is determined to fight for which many, especially "Stateside", have had doubts.
European team on the last day of the Radera Cup leads 10-6
The European team will start the last day of the Radera Cup in a pleasant lead after the Saturday "fourball" and "foursome" competitions ended in lead with 10-6 against the United States.
The inspired couple Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari were led by two victories over the hard-working Tyger Woods, which increased the score of Le Golf National to four.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, to preserve the trophy lost by "Hazetine" two years ago, dominated over the imprecise American team in the morning race "fourballs" format, and the series score became 3-1.
The United States resisted more forcefully in the form of "foursomes", winning two matches, but failed to eliminate the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needs 8 points on Sunday 12 singles to save the trophy.
Flitewood is the first European first-year-old to score four points in a row with Mollywood (Molliwood), after a sensational weekend, is only the second couple in the history of the Raider Cup, who scored four points in the first four matches.
In the "fourballs" format of "Patrick Reed" Woods and Patrick Reed, they then easily beat the tired Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with an even more sympathetic score of 5&4.
Woods, who won two games on Saturday, showed a great game at times, but he has lost 19 out of 29 matches in "fourballs" and "foursomes" formats, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose rested before the morning games "fourballs", returned to his partner Henrik Stenson's "foursomes" to defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka with 2&1 in the world ranking.
Europe failed to fully achieve its own, even though the day in south-west Paris was a pleasant and blowing wind.
The three-time winner of the most prestigious golf race, Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas, set a benchmark for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They extorted 2&1 against Spanish John Rahm and Ian Poulter in "fourballs" format and returned later to defeat Polter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 "foursomes" after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Rider Cup the team has played back 4 points in deficit singles, but as owners, Furyk team is only enough with a draw to save the trophy.
After being in the second place for two days, it looks like Sunday's counterattack will be problematic.
North Korea stated that in the "nothing" case it would not be unarmed unilaterally, without trust
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister informed the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions deepened its distrust of the United States, and North Korea will not unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho informed the World Organisation's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant steps of goodwill" last year, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile trials, the dismantling of nuclear weapons testing sites and the promise to never spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see a proper US response," he said.
"If there is no confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in the security of our country, and in such circumstances we will certainly not unilaterally disarm the first."
Although Ri repeated the well-known North Korea's criticism of Washington's resistance to a "phasing-in" approach to denuclearisation, according to which Korea will be rewarded for the gradual steps taken, his statement left the impression that it did not automatically reject unilateral denuclearisation, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Chenunun and Donald Trump at the first meeting of the US President and North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work towards the "denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula" and Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has attempted to officially end the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States have declared that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also not given up on the call to facilitate the serious international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The United States insists that "douclearisation must be first" and increases the level of pressure imposed by sanctions in order to achieve the goal with power, even opposing the "declaration of the end of the war"," said Ri.
"The idea that sanctions could put us on our knees is empty fantasies that people who know nothing about us cherish.
The problem, however, is that the continuation of sanctions only deepens our distrust."
Ri did not talk about the intentions of Kim's second meeting with Trump, which the US leader had mentioned in particular when he spoke to the United Nations this week.
In his speech, the Minister particularly highlighted three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the other half of this denuclearisation issue were South Korea, not the US, the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead end."
However, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from what he said last year when he declared in the UN General Assembly that the targeting of North Korea's missiles to the US mainland was inevitable after the "Evil Mr. President" Trump called Kim a "missile" on a suicide mission.
This year, in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps towards disarmament, but stressed that there was still a lot to be done and that sanctions should be maintained until North Korea denuclearised.
On Wednesday Trump announced that he had not planned a specific time, stressing that "it does not matter whether it will take two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia stress that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its achievements.
However, the US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of security Council sanctions must be vigorously continued without making mistakes until definitive and convincing denuclearisation is achieved."
The Security Council has unanimously reinforced the sanctions since 2006 in an attempt to bring about the depletion of funding for the Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic weapons programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the United Nations General Assembly, and then informed that he would visit Phenjan again next month to prepare for a second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip was not successful.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made, but in just a few hours, North Korea accused him of "favourable demands".
North Korea's meeting with Muna this month committed to dismantle the weapons landfill and also the nuclear complex if the US takes "appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim had informed him that the "appropriate measures" that North Korea wants to see are the security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and the steps to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard University students will learn the subject about how to relax enough
A new subject at Harvard University this year has made students sleep more, and it is an attempt to counter the increasingly popular culture of brutalism, which includes caffeine-filled study all night long.
One teacher found that students of the best university in the world often lack even basic knowledge of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, as well as a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a subject that he believes is the first such subject in the United States.
He was inspired to create a new subject after speaking about the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
"In the end, a girl came to me and asked, "Why do I only have this story now that I am in the last year?"
She found that no one had ever explained to her the importance of sleep — what surprised me, he told me "Telegraph".
This year, the first educational subject released, provides students with basic information on how good sleep habits contribute to learning and sports achievements, as well as improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, and the executive director of the university’s health services, informed that the university decided to introduce a course of training after learning that students suffer from a serious lack of sleep during the week of study.
The hour-long training process includes a series of interactive tasks.
One of the parts is a picture of dormitories, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books to learn about caffeine and light effects and how performance in sports is affected by lack of sleep and how important it is to sleep routine.
In another part, students are informed about how prolonged lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
Then the student campus map with interactive icons invites participants to reflect on their daily routine.
"We know that this will not immediately change student behaviour.
But we believe that they have the right to know. Just as you have the right to know how smoking cigarettes will affect your health," said Professor Cheisler.
He said that a culture that boasts the ability to learn all night still exists, adding that modern technology and the growing pressure on students meant that lack of sleep became an increasingly serious problem.
He explained that sufficient quality sleep provision should be a student's "secret weapon" to combat stress, overload and anxiety, and even to prevent weight gain, because the lack of sleep in the brain turns the brain into fasting mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheissler to develop a subject after taking part in one of the professor's lectures last year, in Harvard's first course.
He said that the subject had opened his eyes and inspired him to make the course available to the whole campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask students who receive postgraduate education to study a similar program before going to enjoy competition.
Professor Chessler recommends students to install a alarm device not only for the time they get up, but also when you go to sleep, and to keep in mind how people are harmed by "blue lights" emitted by electronic devices screens and LED lamps, because they can disrupt the rhythms of the day, making it difficult to sleep.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Ranger: Manga's gates overthrow Gerard's men
Another sad game hit Ranger when Dolly Menga hit Steven Gerrard's confused team for a loss of 1 to 0 against Livingston.
The team of "Ibrox" hoped for the first victory in the trip since February 4:1 triumphal "St Johnstone", but the team of Gary Holt brought Gerard his second loss in 18 games since he became a club manager, and his team is 8 points away from the leader of the Scottish Championship "Hearts".
Menga hit the ball at the gate seven minutes before the end of half-time, and the lack of inspiration of "Rangers" did not look like an attempt to smooth the score.
"Ranger" falls to the sixth place, while "Livingston" goes to the third, and in terms of the difference in the gate, it is out of the reach of only "Hibernian".
And "Rangers" may be another problem, because judge assistant Kalum Spence needed medical assistance due to head injury, which was apparently caused by the object from the farthest end.
Gerard made eight changes to his team, which quickly left behind "Ayr", reaching the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same "Livingston" 11 players who took off "Hearts" one point last week, and he would be happy to see his well-printed team oppressed opponents in every episode.
It is possible that Ranger managed the ball more often, but Livingston used better what they did.
They should have reached the goal two minutes after the first hand of Menga sent Scott Pittman to the Allan McGregor Gate, but the center player missed his big chance.
Then a long time ago, Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his partner in defence, Alan Lithgow, was able to send the ball only far past the back post.
Ranger took control, but the impression was that playing in the last third is hoped, not believed to happen.
Alfredo Morelos doubtless believed that he had to strike the sentence at 15 minutes, after he had come into contact with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected the request of the Colombian.
"Rangers" performed only two hits at the target in the first half of the time, but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not particularly interfere, neither Lassana Coulibaly's head hit, nor the modest end of Ovie Ejaria's attack.
Although what started at Livingston at 34 min might have changed the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their efforts.
Ranger was not able to deal with Jacobs' long planned combination again.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent a bomb to Scott Robinson, who kept balance and chose Menga for a simple conclusion.
During the break, Gerard replaced Culibali with Ryan Kent, and this almost immediately affected the game, as the midfielder sent the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly from his line immediately ran to block.
But Livingston continued to make guests play, as they like, taking one long shot after another by Litgov and Halket.
Holt's team could have continued to lead in the final phase, but McGregor played well by stopping Jacobs before Litgov kicked his head from the corner.
Ranger's substitute, Glenn Middleton, asked for another punitive kick in the game late, after he had been in contact with Jacobs, but Tomson ignored the request again.
Almanach: Inventor of Geiger’s Meter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning almanach: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today... one day in Germany, Johannes Wilhelm's "Hans" Geiger, who grew up as a physicist.
Geiger developed a method of measuring and measuring radioactivity, which ultimately resulted in a device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger meter in science has also taken its place in pop culture, such as the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, where externally inconclusive cowboy scientists Rogers and Dale Evans played their main roles:
Man: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geigger meter used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can hear how the atoms that are released because of the radioactivity produced by these minerals work."
Evans: "Really, it really breaks!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But his invention continues to live.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "see" the evil cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "see" the evil cells and kill them
Vaccine as part of treatment teaches the immune system to recognise evil cells
Using this method, the patient obtains immune cells that convert into a laboratory
Then they would be able to "see" a protein that is characteristic of many malignant tumors, and will be injected back into the body
The trial vaccine has shown promising results in patients with various types of malignancy.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that taught her immune system to recognise wicked cells experienced that her ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method is to obtain cells from the patient's immune system, convert them into a laboratory to be able to "observ" a protein characteristic of several tumors HER2, and then inject these cells back into the body.
The U.S. National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, professor Jay Berzofsky, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes the growth of several types of cancers", including breast, ovary, lung and colon and rectal cancer, explained Professor Berzoovskis.
A similar approach to the patient’s acquisition of immune cells that ‘learn’ how to attack cancerous tumour cells has worked in one form of leukaemia.
After visiting SNL, Kanye West, dressed in a MAGA hat, attacked Trump’s critics.
It didn't end well
Kanye West was pulled out at the "Saturday Night Live" studio after an incoherent performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and announced that he would stand for the 2020 presidential election.
After completing the third song of the evening, titled Ghost Town, during which he wore the "Make America Great" hat, he began to barge loud phrases about democrats and repeatedly stressed his support for Trump.
"So many times when I spoke to the white people, they ask, "How can you like Trump? He's a racist!"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
"Saturday Night Live" began with a parody with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's Committee on Justice about Christine Blasey Ford's accusation of sexual attack.
Although it was not broadcast, the material with Vest's lame social networks was loaded by the comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to mock Vest in this way.
And Vest complained to the audience that he had been mistreated behind the scenes because of his headlace.
"They mocked me behind the scenes!
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat in your head."
They mocked me!
And they also said that I've lost touch with reality," said West, according to "Washington Examiner".
The West continued: "Gribat see what happens when you lose touch with reality?", and promised to put on "your Superman's cloak" because it means you can't tell me what I do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love!"
"Variety" reported that his comments caused the whistles of the viewers at least twice, but the team members of the show looked embarrassed, and at least one person told the press: "Study was in complete silence."
The vest had been invited at the last minute to replace the singer Ariana Grande, who had died a few days ago by a friend rapper Mac Miller.
The West confused many with the song (I Love it), which he performed in champagne bottles costume.
The Vestus was supported by the leader of the conservative group TPIAS, Kandace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "One of the strongest people in the spirit: PATEICOS, DO NOT CONTACT THE COLOUR!"
However, the conversation director Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that Vest was simply "what he is, and that's wonderful."
"But I choose not to reward a person (by buying his music or clothing, or by supporting his "art") who, as I believe, supports and in bars with ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And we too," she added.
Before this show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name, saying that he had now become "a presence previously known as Kanji Vest".
He is not the first artist to change his name and acts in the same way as Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper Snoop Dogg used to be Snoop Lion, and, of course, the late music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol, but then to a "view artist that was previously known as Prince".
Indicted in attempted murder for stabbing at the Belfast restaurant
A 45 - year - old man is accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The police informed that the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The accused is expected to appear before the Magistrate of Belfast on Monday.
The accusations will be examined by the Public Prosecution Service.
"Trone Games" star Kit Harrington against the toxic manhood
Kit Harrington is known as the sword-blowing John Snow HBO's ruthless medieval fantasy series "Trone Games".
However, the 31 - year - old actor has turned against the stereotype of the brutal hero, saying that such characters often make young boys think that they should be strong to be respected.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit explained that he thought he had "a problem" and asked how to deal with the toxic manhood in the #MeToo era.
Kitt, who recently married his "Trone Games" partner, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted that this problem is important to him.
"I can't think about what mistakes we've made with a manhood right now," he said.
"What do we teach young men in terms of this problem when they grow up in view of the existing problem?"
Kit believes that television with its very masculine characters may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic manhood.
He went on to say, "What's inborn, but what's being taught?
What is being taught on TV and on the streets that make young boys feel that they need to be treated as men?
I think this is one of the most important questions of our time: how can we change it?
Because there are clearly problems with young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any follow-up to the "Trone Games" or preyvela, after the series ends next summer, stressing that "the battlefields and horses are fed up".
Starting from November, Kit will play a key role in the restored "True West" of Sam Shepard, which is the story of a film producer and his brother robber.
The actor recently admitted that he considered his meeting with his wife, Rose, to be the best thing that happened to him as a result of the "Trone Games".
"I met my wife on this show, as it somehow provided my present family and my life from then on," he said.
Kita's personality, John Snow's beloved Igrit, played on the fantasy series won by Rosa Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 in the family property of Leslie in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% increase in its population living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials report that over 820 000 people are affected in the country.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The majority of new cases were the result of sexual relations, indicating a change.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly as a result of transfusions of infected blood in some parts of China.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has fallen to almost zero, according to the Chinese health officials at the conference in Yunnan Province.
However, the number of people living in China with HIV and AIDS has increased to 100,000 from one year to the next.
The transmission of HIV through sexual relations is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but it is said that LGBT people are often discriminated against.
Given the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that 70 to 90% of men who have had sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of sexually transmitted diseases are the result of poorly protected sex in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that the employee leaked data of the Republican senators, sharply targets "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, Maxine Waters, the US Chamber of Representatives, denied the assertion that her staff member has published personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on Wikipedia's legislative pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat insisted that the claims were distributed by the "ultra right" wing whiskeys and Internet sites.
"Belie, lie and even more contemptible lies," said Waters on Twitter in her statement.
The leaked information has been reported to include residence addresses and telephone numbers belonging to the U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Haatch from U.S.A.
Information appeared online on Thursday, it was published by an unknown person from Congress, at a time when hearing about charges of sexual abuse by Brett Kaveno nominated to the Supreme Court took place in the Senate group.
The leak arose some time after three senators had questioned Kaveno.
Conservative, Internet sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the origin of the records is linked to the Waters office, and revealed information about the staff of Waters, informed Hills.
"This unwarranted statement is absolutely false and utter lies!" insisted Waters.
"My staff member, whose identity, personal information and security are compromised because of these fraudulent and false claims, shall not be liable in any way for any leak of information.
This unwarranted statement is absolutely false and utter lies!"
The Waterss announcement soon triggered criticism online, including the criticism of the former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This is an angry denial," Fleisher wrote.
"This leads to the conclusion that her temper does not correspond to a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
He can't be wary.
He must not speak of the accuser's motives.
He must be calm and calm."
Fleisher's job was to compare Waters' reaction with that of the Democrat with that of Judge Kaveno, who was accused of being too angry during a Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a candidate for republican candidates to get Waters to lose her chair in the interim elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if it's true," he wrote.
In her statement, Waters informed that her cabinet had warned responsible officials and law enforcement bodies about these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be revealed," she continued, "and that they will be recognised as legally responsible for all their work, which is destructive and dangerous to any of my staff employees."
Johnny English 3 Review of Rovan Atkinson's Parody on Spy Films left in half a wheel
It has become common to look for associations with Brexis in every new film with a British taste, and that seems to be the case with this one that has revived, Johnny English's pardoning adventure comedy franchise, which began in 2003 with Gioni Angli and was reborn in 2011 with Johnny Angli coming back.
Is the tangled clean about ourselves, about how obviously hopeless we are, is there a new export opportunity for our nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny Englishman has the right to create a mile after the second revitalisation — his name more than anything else signals that he is a wide range of comic characters designed for areas where consumers do not speak English.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent who, despite his strange claims for charming sophistication, is a little Kluzo, a little Mr. Bean, and a bit of the guy playing one note in the chariots of Fire's music at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
He is also based on the traveler and the incomprehensible international character that Atkinson once portrayed in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads where he left chaos on his way.
The latest Johnny English adventure has at least one or two nice moments.
I liked the place where Johnny English goes to the helicopter dressed in a medieval armored suit, and the propeller blades clash against his helmet for a moment.
Atkinson's talents to visually create a comical impression are well visible, but humor is quite weak and strange superficial, especially because "serious" film brands like "007" and "Mission impossible" themselves use comedy as one of the ingredients with confidence.
Humor gives the impression that it is dedicated to children rather than adults, and in my opinion Johnny English's absurd problems are not as creative and purposeful as the tricks of Atkinson's mute films in Bina's skin.
As usual, everything is based on the fact that Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyber hacker has broken into Britain’s super-secret spy internet network, revealing the identity of all British agents in this area, for the dislike of an active agent — the miserable role of a small Kevin Eldon.
It is the last straw for the Prime Minister, the pompouse and a conflict-driven person who has already lost its full political popularity: Emma Tomson does something, with Teresa Meja's partially-like personality, but in the scenario there is not much to work with.
Her intelligence advisors state that, as all active spies have become public, she will have to call for someone who has already retired.
And this man is an insane Johnny Englishman who now works as a teacher in a fine educational institution, and quietly teaches how to work as a secret agent (a couple of fun jokes), because Englishman offers to learn the spy profession from the very foundations.
The Englishman is brought back to Vaithola for an extraordinary meeting and is united with his former many injured assistant Bo, which is also played this time by Ben Miller.
Bo is now a married husband, married to the commander of the submarine, a fun personality that becomes important only at the end of the film, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine is not fully exploited.
So Batman and Robin have returned to the secret service of Her Highness and met Olga Kurylenko's beautiful fateful woman, Ofelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime ministers have dangerously mastered the charismatic technology billionaire, the evil Jason Walt, who is being played by Jack Lacy, and he claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problem.
An Englishman and Bo begin their wild imaginary mosquitoes: camouflaged by the oficians, they set fire to a fine French restaurant; they create confusion in a secretly burglary into the Volta luxury yacht; and an Englishman causes absolute chaos, trying to use virtual realities on the head of the display to get acquainted with the interior of the Volta building.
Everything is done for the final course, but no matter how attractive and crazy the film is, there are many children’s television elements.
A lot of moderate elements.
As with other Johnny English films, I could not wonder whether the British film industry could give Rovan Atkinson a role that would make full use of his talent?
The Labour Party denies plans that the British will work four days a week and receive a salary for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is going to discuss a radical plan, according to which the British will work four days a week and receive a salary of five.
It is reported that the party wants executives to give their workers savings through the artificial intelligence revolution, giving them another holiday.
In this case, employees will be able to enjoy a weekend of three days, while receiving the same salary as before.
The sources say that the idea will "answer" the party's agenda for the economy, and plans to change the economy for the benefit of the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week has been supported by the Trade Union Congress, which believes that it is an opportunity for workers to benefit from economic change.
One of the top representatives of the Labour Party informed The Sunday Times: "It is expected that the policy changes will be announced by the end of this year.
"It will not happen in one day, but the four-day working week is an idea that is in line with the party's goal of balancing the economy in favour of the workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised to introduce a four-day working week already in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party as such does not support this desire at present.
Labour Party representative said: "The four-day working week is not part of party politics, and the party does not consider it."
The Shadow Cabinet Minister John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to give shape to his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonell explained that he was determined to take power away from "the mass of directors" and "spectuants" of public services companies.
The Minister of Shadow Cabinet also plans that existing middle shareholders in water companies may not recover their entire package, because the Labour Government could implement the "deduction" due to injustice.
He also approved plans to include employees on company boards and to set up exclusive Ownership Funds to allocate 10% of the capital of private companies to employees who would receive up to 500 pounds each year in dividends.
Lindsey Grem and John Kennedy answer '60 Minutes' or the FBI investigation in the Kaveno case might change their opinion
The FBI investigation has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least one week, and raises the question as to whether the findings of the office could force a senator of Republicans to withdraw his support.
On an interview on Sunday, Scott Pelley interviewed the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham on whether the FBI could reveal something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy left the impression of a more open person than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said, when I turned to the hearing procedure, I said that I had spoken to Judge Kaveno.
I called him after it happened when the charge became known, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, direct and clear."
On the other hand, Grem's vote seems to have been laid in stone.
"I've made a decision on Brett Kaveno, and will need a disruptive accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Grem added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of her names was able to confirm it.
The event is 36 years old.
I don't think there's any change coming."
What is the World Citizens' Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the World Citizens' Festival, an annual music event, will take place in New York with an impressive number of stars and an equally impressive mission: to reduce world poverty.
This is the seventh year of the festival, the World Citizens' Festival will be attended by tens of thousands of people who will gather in the Great Mooring of the Central Park not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, the Repere Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true goal of the event, which is ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an event created by the international advocacy group "Global Poverty Project", which hopes to end poverty by attracting more and more people who are actively fighting poverty.
In order to receive a free ticket to this event (unless there was a desire to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert visitors had to perform a series of tasks or "actions", such as voluntary work, sending an e-mail to a world leader, making a phone call or any other important activity to raise awareness about ending poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen movement been, with 12 more years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of an award with a free concert a good way to convince people to act, or is it just another case of so-called "cliactism" where people feel they can really influence something by signing an online petition or sending a Twitter message?
The Global Citizen movement claims that since 2011 it has registered more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, trying to achieve different goals.
It reports that these actions have helped global leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to over USD 37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group referred to 390 commitments and statements stemming from its activities for which at least USD 10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that the funds allocated so far have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include the Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "help children grow up fully", promising Rwanda with USD 35 million to help put an end to malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 Twitter reports from the world's citizens.
"With the support of the UK Government, Donors, Governments of other countries and citizens of the world like you, we can leave the social injustices of malnutrition in history," said Tracey Ullman, representative of The Power of Nutrition, at the April 2018 concert in London.
The Group also mentioned that, after the launch of more than 5000 measures calling on the UK government to provide better nutrition to mothers and children, the government announced funding for the "Power of Nutrition" project, which will provide nutrition to 5 million women and children.
Answering one of the most frequently asked questions on your website – "What makes you think we can put an end to extreme poverty?"
"Global Citizen" commented: "It will be a long and long journey, where we will stumble at times and suffer failure.
However, just as the great civil rights and anti-Apartheid movements have done before us, we will also be successful, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York, led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use the war fleet for "blocking" to hinder Russian energy exports, says the Minister of the Interior
"In case of need," Washington can use its war fleet to prevent Russia's energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, by U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s activities in Syria, especially where it operates under the legal government’s invitation, were a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"In my opinion, the reason why it is in the Middle East is that it wants to supply energy in the same way as it does in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe," he said.
And in the opinion of the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States can make sure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, block them so that Russia cannot bring its energy to the market," he said.
Zinke approached the public who had come to attend the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organisation that calls itself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with the situation in Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are actually the same.
"The economic opportunity of Iran and Russia is more or less the use and replacement of fuel," he said, at the same time referring to Russia as a country whose economy is mainly dependent on fossil fuels.
There are claims that Trump's administration promotes the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, thereby replacing Russia, the much cheaper option for consumers in Europe.
For this reason, Trump's administration officials, and also the US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that would make Berlin "dependent" to Moscow according to Trump's words.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion US dollar Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which would double the existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington's fervent resistance to the project is simply based on economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"In my opinion, we agree that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier," said Alexander Novak, the Russian Minister of Energy, after a September meeting with the US Minister of Energy, Rick Perry in Moscow.
The US has expressed its opposition to Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
The leading German industry organisation, the German Industry Federation (BDI), has called on the US to refrain from engaging in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I feel a big problem if a third country intervenes in our energy supply," said Dieter Campf, head of the German Federation of Industry (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator of Massachusetts, will seriously consider her candidacy for the presidential elections in 2020
On Saturday, the Senator of Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, declared that he was seriously considering standing for the post of President after the mid-term elections.
During the City Council meeting in Holioca, Massachusetts, Voren confirmed that she was considering standing for the presidential election.
"It is high time there were women in Washington who would "comparate" the imperfect government, which also means women-presidents," her words are reflected in the newspaper "The Hill".
"After 6 November, I will carefully consider my candidacy for the US Presidential elections."
During the Dome Cathedral session, Warren referred to President Donald Trump, claiming that he "leads the country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren has openly criticised Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Britta Kaveno.
On Friday's Twitter report, Warren said: "Of course, an FBI investigation is required before the elections."
However, a survey published on Thursday revealed that the majority of Warren's supporters do not believe that she should stand for the 2020 elections.
In accordance with the results of the poll of the political research centre/agenda "Boston Globe" of the University of Suffolk, fifty-eight percent of the "possible" constituents of Massachusetts claimed that the senator should not stand for election.
Thirty - two percent supported the decision.
The results of the survey revealed that the former Governor, Deval Patrick, had received more support, receiving 38 percent for election and 48 percent for election.
The names of high-profile democratic party leaders, such as former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders, also appear in relation to possible candidacy in the 2020 elections.
News agency "Associated Press" informed that Baiden has committed to give a formal decision by January.
Sarah Peilina quotes Treka Peilina at the PTSS Donald Tramp
Trek Peilin (26) spent a year in Iraq after joining the military in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and accused of domestic violence.
"What my own son goes through, which he goes through after he returns, I can extend to other families facing the consequences of PTSS and the vulnerability of certain doses that our soldiers return to," she said to the public at Donald Trump's meeting in Tuls, Oklahoma.
Peilina referred to his arrest as "an obvious problem that everyone is turning a blind eye" and said of her son and other veterans of war that "they return a little differently, they return for a fortification, they return to think about whether they respect what their fellow soldiers and pilots, as well as all the other members of the military, have given to this country".
According to Dena Bennett, a representative of the Vasil Police Department, he was arrested on Monday in Vasila, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman and of keeping a gun under the influence.
18 states, Colombia region challenges a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and Colombia are in favour of a legal challenge for a new US policy that deprives victims of asylum who flee gangs or domestic violence.
The representatives of these 18 states and the Colombian district of D.C. on Friday presented a brief statement to the court's adviser to support the asylum seeker facing the obstacles created by this policy, reports "NBC News".
The plaintiff's full name in Grace v. Sessions' proceedings initiated by the American Union for Civil Liberties against Federal Policy in August has not been disclosed.
She claimed that her partner "and the sons of his violent gang companion" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her request for asylum on 20 July.
She was detained in Texas.
The state lawyers who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, from which a large proportion of the U.S. asylum seekers come, as countries where gangs and domestic violence are prevalent.
The new US asylum policy changed the 2014 decision of the Appeals Board of Immigrants, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
Karl Racine, General Prosecutor of Colombia, announced on Friday that the new policy "ignores state, federal and international laws that have been put in place for decades".
"Federal law provides that all requests for asylum are examined on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the claim in question, and such an obstacle violates this principle," said the court advisor in his brief statement.
In addition, the lawyer stated in his statement that policies that prevent immigrants from entering the country are detrimental to the US economy, as these immigrants are likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary workforce".
Advocate General Jeff Sessions in June addressed immigration judges with a request to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang abuse.
"Shelter is available to persons who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear related to their race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion," he said in his statement on policy on 11 June.
Asylum has never been designed to solve all the problems, even all the serious problems, that people face every day throughout the world.
A desperate rescue effort in Palu, with the number of deaths doubling in the search process for survivors
The situation of survivors was getting worse.
"The situation is very tense," said 35-year-old Riza Kusuma, comforting his hectic baby in the evacuation center of the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute, the ambulance brings new victims.
Clean water is a deficit."
The people were seen when they returned to their destroyed homes and overflowing the goods that had been buried in the water, trying to save everything that was found.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals that had suffered from the 7.5 - magnitude earthquake were crowded.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who had broken spines and shoulders, lay outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were taken care of outdoors because of the constant strong post-wars.
His eyes were full of tears, remembering how a powerful earthquake began to shake the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save.
I think I was printed in wall ruins," said Haris to the Associated Press news agency, adding that his family had arrived in town for wedding purposes.
"I hear my wife cry for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of intimidation attempts using propaganda ads
A week after the official Chinese newspaper released a four - page advertisement highlighting the benefits of trade between the United States and China each day, the U.S. Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the annex paid by China Daily in the most sold newspaper of the state of Iowa, Des Moines Register, accused China of trying to interfere in the US Congress elections on 6 November, but China denies it.
Trampa's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US elections marked what US officials said to Reuters news agency, namely that it was a new stage in the growing Washington campaign to put pressure on China.
While there is a perfectly normal situation in which foreign governments place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently being dragged into an increasing trade war, resulting in a series of tariffs on each other's imports.
At the beginning of the trade war, Chinese repressive tariffs were directed against exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported the Trump Republican Party, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, the US Ambassador to China and the former long-term governor of Iowa, who is a large exporter of agricultural goods to China, said that Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstads wrote his opinion to the Sunday edition "Des Moines Register", claiming that China "now doubles this intimidation by placing propaganda ads in our own free press."
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of such an important tradition of freedom of speech and free press for America by inserting a paid ad "Des Moines Register," wrote Branstads.
"On the other hand, here in the usual Beijing news kiosks you will find a limited number of different opinions and will not see such a true reflection of different opinions that the Chinese people may have in connection with China's alarming economic trajectory, given that the media are here under the strict supervision of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most influential Chinese newspapers avoided publishing" his article, but he did not mention which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn of Republicans alienating female voters from mid-term elections involving the Kaveno scandal
As many leading Republicans support and defend the candidate of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, against whom several allegations of sexual violence have been made, analysts have warned that in the forthcoming mid-term elections they will experience a negative reaction, especially from women.
The emotions involved have been extremely high, and it is evident that most Republicans have already been ready to give their voice.
Such things cannot be withdrawn," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the University of Siracus Maxwell School, in his Saturday article in The Hill.
Reecher questions that last minute encouragement by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to conduct an FBI investigation will be enough reason to appease angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday. They will not forget it tomorrow or November," said Carine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and representative of the state in the progressive movement "MoveOn" on Friday, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning protestors in the hallway of the Senate demonstrablely sang "November coming!" when Republicans in charge of the Judicial Committee chose to continue with the nomination of Kaveno despite Dr Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, reported "Mic".
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be at a very high level," independent political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the news portal.
"People say it's already high, that's true.
However, it could be even higher, especially among the electors and younger voters living in suburbs (aged 18-29), who often do not go to the elections even if they do not like the President."
Even before Ford's public statement, in which she outlined allegations of sexual violence on the part of candidate for office of the Supreme Court, analysts mention possible failure if Republicans continue to nominate this candidacy.
"This has become a mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former Chairman of the Republican National Committee, according to "NBC News" at the beginning of last week.
"It's not just about the committee's vote or the final vote, or about whether Kaveno will be sentenced, it's also about how the Republicans have dealt with this situation and how they treated him," said Guy Cecil, Director of the Priority USA, who is chairing this group, which helps to elect democrats.
It seems, however, that the Americans have been somewhat divided over what to believe by the testimony of Ford and Kaveno, somewhat more inclined to believe in the latter.
The new "YouGov" survey shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or mostly tend to believe in the Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say that they are definitely or mostly inclined to believe in the Kaveno's testimony.
In addition, 38 percent claimed that Kaveno may have lied about his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
The Guardian reported that following Flake's encouragement, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week Ford showed in the Senate's Committee on Justice that Kaveno was drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the post of a judge of the Supreme Court during his studies in Jeila in the 1980s has shown her his genitalia at a party.
The global web inventor plans to launch a new internet to take over Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, a global web inventor, is launching a project that could compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project "Inrupt" is a company based on the "Solid" platform of Burners-Lei open source.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people are allowed access to some information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Burners-Lei joked that Inrupt's hidden intention was to "preside over the world".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to enable people to build their own "personal online data repository" or PTD.
It may include contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, as well as other personal and professional tools.
It's like if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slick and Spotify were all available in one browser at the same time.
The personal online data repository is unique in that only the user determines who and what kind of information can be accessed.
It is referred to by the company as "personal authority using the data".
According to the company manager John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to provide the company with resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently operates a security platform purchased by Burners-Le, Bruce, IBM, some freelance developers hired to work on the project, and a community of voluntary encoders.
From this week onwards, technology developers around the world could build their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Burners-Lee said that he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change, fully reversing all their business models within one night.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a Saturday article published on the Platform Medium, Burners-Le mentioned that "Inrupt" is "a mission to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid's basis".
In 1994, Burners-Lei transformed the Internet by creating a Global Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Burners-Lee has had an influential opinion in discussions on net neutrality.
Even after the launch of Inrupt, Burners-Le will remain the founder and director of the Global Web Consortium, the Global Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm really optimistic about this new web era," Burners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Marking the Victoria Cross of the clergy during World War I
For 100 years in its home city, the event has been celebrated when the only clergyman of the Church of England received the Victorian cross during World War I as a fighter.
Lt-Col Bernard Ven received this award on 29 September 1918 in connection with attacks on Bellenglise and Lehaukort.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper, so he never knew about the highest British military award he had won.
At his Saturday parade in Rashden, Northamptonshire, his two grandsons revealed a memorial stone dedicated to him.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, mentioned that it was "excellently symbolic", that such a stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the significant award.
According to the newspaper "London Gazette" on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Ven led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through very thick fog and gunfires and machine guns."
Later, he rushed to the shooting line, and with the greatest courage he led the line forward before conceiving the cannon zone, where three gangs were defeated.
Lieutenant Colonel Ven was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Wen (72) said that his grandfather's actions were "something that I could never do, and that at the same time is a very humble act".
He and his brother Dr James Vann also placed the crown after the parade, accompanied by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Wen claimed that he felt "honored by participating in this parade" and added that "the support given by many people is the value of a true hero".
MMA fans waited all night "Belator 206", but instead they were greeted by Pigeon Pep
Imagine spending the whole night up to see Bellator 206, but in the end, you're denied this main event.
In San José, there were 13 fights, including six on the main map, broadcast live all night long on UK Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., when Geord Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were about to confront each other, the UK was shocked to change the broadcast to Puppi.
Some were puzzled when they stayed awake all night until early dawn while waiting for the fight.
A fan on Twitter described the change of transmission to children's cartoon as a "failure joke".
"The government has determined that after 6.00 this type of content is unacceptable, therefore the transfer to the children's program was switched," explained Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of Bellator on marketing and communication issues.
"Pep, piggy," "yes."
Scott Cooker, President of Belator, said that he would work on scheduling so that future viewers in the United Kingdom could see these broadcasts.
"Thinking about repeating the broadcast, I think we can sort it out," Koker said.
"However, the clock there is six on the morning Sunday, and we will not be able to solve this problem until Sunday after our time and Monday after their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, a lot of texts appeared after the switch, and they were not positive.
We tried to prevent this because we thought it was a technical failure.
But that was not the case. It was controlled by the government.
I can assure you that the next time there will be no such problems.
We will stick to five battles instead of six (as it has been until now).
It's a bad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Dalley didn't feel good enough because of his sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley claims that he grew up feeling less valuable than others because of his sexuality, but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old man did not realize that "not everyone is like me" until he started attending high school.
Visiting the first Radio 4 programme, "Desert Island Discs", led by Lauren Laverne, he said that he started talking about homosexual rights to give others "hope".
He also mentioned that becoming a parent made him less worried about winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the permanent manager of the long-term programme, has spent several months off because of illness.
As he appeared as an outcast from the society of Laverne in the first program, he said that as he grew up, he felt "less valuable" than others, because "the society has not assumed that both girls and boys can enjoy it."
He said, "Until today, the feeling that I am not as good as others, or that I am different, has been the main driver that has given me strength and endurance to succeed."
He said you wanted to prove that there was "something" not to disappoint people when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The double bronze medal winner of the Olympic Games has become the leader of the high-level LGBT campaign and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia, calling for even more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he decided to address the public, because you felt happy to be able to live openly and without complications, and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said he fell in love with his husband, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "was overwhelmed by unprepared".
Daily married the 20-year-old Oscar Prize winner last year, and claimed that the age gap had never been an obstacle.
"When you've gone through so many things at such a small age" (his first Olympic Games were at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone at your age who would have experienced similar peaks and falls.
The couple became parents to their son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Dalley claimed that his "all perspective" had changed.
"A year ago, everything that was important to me was getting a gold medal," he said.
"Do you know what? There are more important things in life than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son Robert has the same name as his father who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Dalley said that his father did not want to accept that he was dying, and one of the last things he asked Dalile was whether they had tickets for the 2012 London Olympics, in which he wanted to be in first line.
"I couldn't tell him that she'd no longer be there to be in the first line," he said.
"I held his hand until he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and was dead, I finally admitted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Dalley took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I simply knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life — to dive in front of my family in the Olympic Games. There was no better feeling about it," he said.
It also inspired the choice of his first song — Heather Small performed “Proud”, which resonated with him on his way to the Olympics and is constantly driving the goose.
The "Desert Island Discs" program is heard by BBC Radio on 4 Sundays at 11.15 after British summer time.
Mickelson, who left the form, in a reserve bench in the Saturday Rider Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday, playing his 47th Rider Cup match, but he will need to change his strategy to avoid an unfortunate turn of events.
For the 12th time in the championship every two years, Captain Jim Furyk sat on the reserve bench for four balls and two pairs of games.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as has so often been the case with US teams, the five-time winner divided his day, acting both as a supporter and as a player in his game with the hope of correcting what bothered him.
Since the 48-year-old golfer has never been the most accurate player even at the top of his career, he is not the most suitable candidate for the tense fight in Le Golf National's uneven square, where regular imprecise kicks are punished.
And if the game itself is not scary enough, on Sunday's ninth match, Michelson will fight the exact winner of the British Open Championship Francesco Molinari, who has joined forces with the young Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, behind four points when starting 12 single match matches, successfully take the lead, Michaelson's match might prove to be crucial.
Furik expressed confidence in his teammate without unnecessary words.
"He was fully aware of his role today, put his hand on my back, and told me that he would be ready tomorrow," Furick said.
"He is very sure of himself.
He is an outstanding athlete who gave so much to these teams earlier and this week.
I don't think I've imagined they're playing in two matches.
I imagined more, but everything changed in the way it turned, and that's what we're going to count on.
He wants to be out there, like everyone else."
Michelson will pass the Nick Faldo record for the most played matches at the Rider Cup on Sunday.
This could mark the end of the Rider Cup career, which has never really coincided with the heights of his individual record.
Michaelson has won 18, has lost 20 and seven unsettled games, even though Furik claimed that his presence gave the team some intangible benefits.
"He's fun, sarcastic and witty, he likes to amuse about people, and he's a great teammate," he explained.
"In my opinion, the younger players liked to piss him this week too, which was fun to watch.
He gives much more than just a game."
Captain Thomas Bjorn of the European team knows that the leading position can quickly disappear
European team captain Thomas Björn knows from experience that a major lead in the fight for the Rider Cup in the last day's single-games can easily turn into an unpleasant situation.
Dane debuted in 1997 in Walderram, where a team of opponents, whose captain was Save Ballesteros, scored five points over the Americans, but only now got to the finish line with a very small score, namely winning with 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we were prominent in leadership in Valderram; we were leading in Brooklyn, where we lost, and Valderram, where we won, but only with a small majority," said Björn (in the picture), watching the 2018 graduation group victory with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, taking the lead with 10-6 golf course "Le Golf National.
Thus history will show me and every member of that team that nothing is over.
Tomorrow you will give yourself everything.
Go to the square and show your best performance!
It's not over until you see the points on the screen.
Our aim is to get this trophy and let us also focus on it.
I've been saying all the time that I'm focusing on 12 players on our side, but we're very well aware of what's facing us on the other side, the world's greatest players."
Facilitated by the performance shown by his players on the golf course, Björn added: "I never rejoiced too early.
New challenges await tomorrow.
Tomorrow there are individual games, and that is a completely different thing.
It is great if you have a partner next to you when everything goes well, but your golfer skills are fully tested in individual games.
This message must be sent to your players, that is to say, so that they give up everything in the game next day.
Now you leave your partner, and he also has to go show his best performance."
Unlike Bjorn's opposing team, Captain Jim Furik will see to it that his players show their best performance directly in individual rather than partner games. The exception is only Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furik himself has been on both sides of these significant last days tournaments, both as part of the winning team in Brooklyn and then as a result of the defeat of European teams having a sensational success, which later is also known in the world of golf as "Miracle at Medinah".
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to Ben Crenshaw, captain of the 1999 team, brought together his players in the last days of the fight.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you'd like to get straight to the fast-pace you experienced in Brooklyn, like you were in Medina.
When such impulses are transmitted in one direction, it puts great pressure on the mid-term games.
Accordingly, we made our own composition and ranked the guys in the way we thought they were right. Let's try to do some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead a counter-attack, and he ranked Rory McIlroy for the main game and the Europeans Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter in the first part of the list.
"I ranked the guys in this order, because I think it fits best in the course of the tournament," said Björn in relation to the selected single players.
Re-delayed German new warship
The German military fleet was to be put into operation in 2014, thus replacing the ageing Cold War warships, but it will not happen until at least next year due to erroneous systems and rising costs, it was reported by the local media.
The placing in service of the ship's Rheinland-Pfalz main ship in Baden-Württemberg class was now postponed until the first half of 2019, reported in Die Zeit newspaper, citing a military representative.
The ship should have joined the warfall in 2014, but the unpleasant after-delivery problems affected the fate of the ambitious project.
Four vessels of the Baden-Württemberg class ordered by the caraflote in 2007 will replace the outdated Bremen frigate class.
They are expected to be equipped with a powerful gun, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some sensitive technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other essential features include longer maintenance periods: it should be possible to place the new frigates up to two years away from the ports in which they are registered.
However, continued delays mean that the newest technology warships, which would allow Germany to demonstrate its power in the overseas countries, will have become obsolete by the time they enter into service, in the note "Die Zeit".
The unsuccessful fregate F125 was visible in all the headlines last year when the German military flotation officially refused to put the ship into service and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the corrode returned to the shipyard after the ship had been delivered.
The reasons for this were little known, but the German media mentioned a number of significant "software and equipment defects" that would invalidate a warship if it were used in a battle mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important as ships of the Baden-Württemberg class will be operated by a crew of approximately 120 seafarers, which is only half of the senior Bremen class fregatian personnel.
It also proved to be too heavy a ship, which reduces its performance and restricts its ability to make improvements in the future.
It is believed that the 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz ship is twice the weight of ships of a similar class used by Germany during the Second World War.
Besides the erroneous hardware, the cost of the whole project (including crew training) also became a major problem.
It is said to cost EUR 3.1 billion instead of the EUR 2.2 billion originally envisaged.
The problems associated with the new frigates are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings about the weakening of the German Navy.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartel, head of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, admitted that the warfall really "becomes running out of usable ships".
The official claimed that over time this problem had been greatly exacerbated by the withdrawal of old ships from operation, but that no new ones were delivered instead.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg fregatés had joined the Caraflote.
National Trust listens to the lives of secret bats
The new study, which is being carried out in a Scottish highland, focuses on discovering how bats use the landscape in the food search process.
The findings are expected to provide new clarity on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and to help protect them in the future.
Scientists of Scottish National Trust will study dwarf bats, pygmey bats, brown long-eared bats, and water bats in Inverve gardens in Westeros.
Special recorders will be placed in the main locations, which will track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using hand detectors.
The sound experts will analyse all records in order to determine the frequency of bat calls and which species carry out the activities in question.
A map of habitats and a report will then be developed to create a detailed view of the landscape, reflecting bat behaviour.
NTS Nature Conservation Adviser Rob Dewar hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are the most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management such as the creation of meadows and how best to preserve forests for bats and other associated species.
During the last centenary, the bat population in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined significantly.
These lands are threatened by construction and development works affecting the hiding places of bats and the loss of residence.
Wind generators and lighting can also pose risks, as well as flypaper and chemical products for certain building materials, as well as cat attacks.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes during hunting.
They use a sophisticated echo-location detection method to find insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for maintaining more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes the bat problem very seriously.
The organisation has ten trained experts who regularly carry out surveys, tests on bat skies and sometimes even rescue work.
The organization has even created in Scotland the first and only reserve for bats called "Threave" in Damfrisa and Galowey, where eight of the ten species of bats found in Scotland live.
David Thomson, the owner of the estate, claims that this area is ideal for bats.
"Here's a great place for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and generally suitable habitats.
But there are plenty of things we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us to understand better what they need to survive."
He stressed that it was important to check if bats were not staying at the site before the maintenance work was carried out, as it could happen that one female hiding place was killed by the unintentional destruction of up to 400 females and their pups, possibly destroying the entire local population.
Bats are protected animals and must not be killed, tortured, obstructed or destroyed by their hiding places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a member of the Scottish Bat Conservation Trust, has called on the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about bats, and for a number of their species we simply don't know how they are doing."
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape by assigning lawyers to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has condemned the rape charges against him as "false news", claiming that people "will pay attention to themselves" using his name.
His lawyers have been ordered to sue the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, which published these allegations.
Portuguese origin and Turin Juventus football star is accused of rape by American Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
It's said he paid the woman $375 000 to keep quiet about this incident, so it said "Der Spiegel" on Friday.
A few hours after these statements, Ronald, 33, approached his 142 million followers via Instagram's online video, calling this information "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," said the five-time winner of the Ballon d'Or award in the camera.
"They want to become famous using my name.
This is normal.
They want to become famous at the expense of my name, it's part of my work.
I'm a happy man, and everything is good," smiled the player.
According to Reuters, Ronald's lawyers are about to sue the Der Spiegel magazine for their allegations, which they have called "unacceptable information on grounds of suspicion in the field of privacy".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would claim compensation for "moral damage to the extent corresponding to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of the rights of the person in recent years".
This incident occurred in June 2009 in the "suite" room of the hotel "Palms Hotel and Casino" in Las Vegas.
According to the documents submitted to the Nevada State Clark District Court, Ronald and Majorg went back to the player's hotel room, where he analed a woman.
Majorga claims that after the incident, Ronald fell on his knees and said that he was "99 percent "good boy", but fell in the temptation of this "one percent".
According to the documents, Ronald confirmed that the couple had sex, but this was done by mutual agreement.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and had taken pictures of the injuries in the hospital, but later she agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "fear of revenge" and worried about "public humiliation".
A 34-year-old woman claims that she does not want to accept the terms of this settlement anymore, as the incident has left a permanent injury.
At the time when these statements were made, Ronald was going to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid, but this summer he went to Juventus, Italy, for 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK would "perpetually regret" the loss of car manufacturers
"The United Kingdom 'will regret it forever' if, after Brexita, it loses its world leader in car manufacturing," said business secretary Greg Clark.
His "disrupted" fact that Toyota UK announced to BBC that if Britain left the EU without agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston plant near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese carmaker said that in the case of Brexis, delays at the borders could, without agreement, put jobs at stake.
Last year, the Bureau plant producing Toyota's Auris and Avensis models produced almost 150 000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will be stopped," said Toyota, Managing Director of Burnston, Marvin Cooke.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are concerned about leaving the EU without a treaty and how cross-border trade will operate.
For example, BMW claims that after Brexis, he will close his mini factory in Oxford for a month.
According to the car manufacturers, the main concern is that the supply chain is at risk if no agreement is reached after Brexita.
The Toyota production line operates on the basis of the "time-to-time" principle, where every 37 minutes for cars made to order part comes from both UK and EU suppliers.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, there could be disruption at the border, which could lead to some delays and shortages.
According to the company, Toyota would not be able to detain more than one day worth of inventory at its Derbyyshire plant, so it would have to stop production.
Mr Clark said that the withdrawal plan (Chequers) drawn up by Theresa May for future relations with the EU is "calculated precisely to avoid such border checks".
"We need an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that would allow, as I would say, not only to benefit at the moment, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he said in the "BBC" Radio 4 program "Today".
"The proof of this not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers is that we need to be able to fully pursue the very successful supply chain strategy."
Toyota was unable to say how long production could be stopped, but warned that, in the long term, rising costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately put jobs at risk.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Bournaston for 24 years and has been working in the factory as a union coordinator, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "I can tell you from experience that as a post disappears, it does not return."
The government representative said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
Tramp meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, reports White House
The important meeting of Donald Trump with the Deputy Prosecutor General, Rod Rosenstein, may be "stayed for another week", because the fight in relation to the candidate for the post of the judge of the Supreme Court Brett Kaveno continues, it reported the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the special adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates interference in the Russian elections, the link between the funds used by Trump and Russia, as well as the possible violation of the rule of law by the President.
For months now, in Washington, we have been thundering whether Trump will fire the Deputy Prosecutor General and thus threaten the independence of Miller.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the signing of the conversation with Trump and the possibility of suspending the President by Amendment 25.
Rosenstein denied this information.
But last Monday, he went to White House, where he gave talks about his resignation.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was at that time at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Trump said that he would not "be willing" to let Rosenstein go, but then the meeting was postponed in order to avoid a clash with the hearing of the Judicial Committee of the Senate, which showed both Kaveno and one of the women who accused him of committing sexual misconduct — Dr. Christine Blaizija Ford.
On Friday Trump ordered the FBI to carry out a week-long investigation into the charges raised by Kaveno, continuing to delay the Senate's vote.
Sarah Sanders, the press secretary of Trump's press, visited Fox News Sunday.
She said about Rosenstein's meeting: "The date of the meeting has not yet been set, it could be this week or postponed for another week, taking into account all the cases that take place around the Supreme Court.
But that's what we'll see, and I always want to inform the press about the news."
Some reporters dispute this assertion: Sanders has not organised the White House press briefing since 10 September.
The leader, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of briefs is not related to the dislike of the "slave" TV reporter, even though she added, "I don't want the fact that they're a love of fame."
She then suggested a direct contact between Trampa, which would lead to an increase in the interest of the press.
"The President engages in more questions and answers sessions than any president before him," she said and, without giving more details, added, "We have been interested in their number."
Sanders claimed that the briefings would continue to take place, but "if the press would be able to ask the President of the United States questions directly, it is undeniably better than talking to me.
We are trying to do this a lot, and you see that we have done it a lot in recent weeks, and this will happen instead of the press briefings when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Tramp regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or taking part in open sessions or press conferences attended by important persons.
Individual press conferences are rarely held.
Perhaps the President demonstrated the reason for this in New York this week by giving an uncontrolled and at times strange expression to the reporter's crowd.
Minister for Health writes EU staff in Scotland NHS about Brexit-related fears
The Minister for Health has written to EU staff working in the Scottish National Health Service (NHS) to express his gratitude and wish them endurance after Brexis.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter to MSP less than six months before the United Kingdom withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the costs of permanent status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Frien wrote: "During the summer, negotiations continued between the United Kingdom and the EU on the withdrawal which led to the decisions expected this autumn.
However, the UK Government is also preparing for a possible scenario in the absence of an agreement.
I know this is a very restless time for you.
I would therefore like to stress once again how much I appreciate every employee's involvement, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from within and outside the EU provide valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the healthcare service and benefit our cared patients and communities.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we really want you to stay here."
After a head injury, Christian Abercromby undergoes an emergency operation
The protector of Tennessee's state "Tigers" Christian Abercrombie was undergoing an emergency operation after a head injury, which he won in a Saturday game in which, with a score of 31-27, the "Vanderbilt Commodores", reported "Tennessean" sports reporter Mike Organ.
The chief coach of Tennessee's state team, Rod Reed, told reporters that the trauma was gained just half a while ago.
"He came to the side line and so to say collapsed," said Reed.
While Abercrombius was on the side line, the trainers and medical staff gave him oxygen, then put him on the stretchers and brought him for further examination.
An official of Tennessee told Nashville, the reporter of WSMV in Tennessee, Chris Harris, that Abercrombius had been removed from the medical center of the University of Vanderbilt.
Harris added that for the time being "there is no information about the type/heaviness of the injury", and Tennessee's state team is trying to understand when this injury occurred.
Abercrombius, a representative of the red shirt, is in her first season after changing Ilionis to Tennessee's state team.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he had made five blocks in total, which totalled 18 in this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher state fee when buying property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher state fee when buying property in the United Kingdom, and the additional funds obtained will be used to help homeless people in accordance with the new Thory plan.
Such a step will counteract Corbin's efforts to attract new voters.
The increased excise duty will apply to non-taxable persons in the United Kingdom.
The Treasury foresees that up to 120 million pounds per year can be collected to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher state fee when buying property in the United Kingdom and channelling the additional funds obtained to help homeless people, it will today announce Teresa May.
Such a step is seen as an attempt to counteract Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract new voters with promises to provide housing at more favourable prices and to address the wealthiest part of society.
The increased excise duty will apply to non-taxable persons and companies in the United Kingdom, with additional money being allocated to government efforts to combat the problem of homelessness.
The premium included in the current national levy, including the introduction of a higher level of charges two years ago for the purchase and renting of a second home, could amount to up to three per cent.
The Treasury foresees that such a step may add up to GBP 120 million per year to its budget.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the newly built London properties are purchased by non-residents, thereby hitting prices and making it difficult for first buyers to get to their home.
Many of the territories of the wealthy country, especially in the capital, have become "pocket cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers, who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy was introduced only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the state tax so that more young people could afford to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by grabbing the land, but not using it, and urged Mrs Maya to give up quotas for affordable housing in order to deal with the British housing problem.
Mr Korbin has proposed a series of attractive housing reforms, including a reform on rental control and evictions for no reason.
He also wants to give boards more power to build new housing.
Mrs May said: "Last year I mentioned that I would use my position as Prime Minister to restore Britain's dream: every young generation must have a better quality of life.
And that means putting our damaged housing market right.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and arrange their lives here.
However, it is not right that housing can be purchased as easily as foreign companies and people who do not live in the UK and the hard-working British people.
For many, the dream of home has become too distant, and the harsh problem of homeless people is still topical."
Jack Ross: "My biggest goal is to lead Scotland
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, claims that his greatest goal is to become the head of Scotland at some point.
Scott, 42, has accepted the challenge of rebuilding the North East Club, which currently ranks third in the first league with three points from above.
This summer, he moved to the Starium of Light after putting St Mirren back into the Scottish Premier League last season.
"As a player I wanted to play for my country.
I got the B Cup, and that was all," said Ross for the Scottish BBC broadcast.
"But I grew up watching the Scottland games in the Hampden Park with my father, and it's always called me back.
However, such an opportunity would only appear if I were successful in running the club."
Ross' predecessors at Sunderland are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic claims that he has not been disturbed by following the footsteps of such a large club's recognized leaders, previously rejecting the offers made by Barnsley and Ipswich.
"My success will now be judged by whether I will be able to return this club to the Premier League.
Because of the structure and possibilities of this club, it fits unequivocally in the Premier League," he said.
"Reverting the club to the Premier League will not be an easy task, but I will probably believe that I will be successful here only when this task has been accomplished."
Ross is at his career stage for only the third year, previously working as Deputy Director in Dumbarton and spending 15 months as a part of the "Hearts" coach.
He then helped the club "Alloa" to recover from falling to the third level and in the same season helped St Mirren to win the title of the champion.
Ross claims that at the moment feels much more comfortable than during his player's career in the clubs "Clyde", "Hartlepool", "Falkirk", "St Mirren" and "Hamilton Academic".
"It was probably a true crossroads," he recalls, taking responsibility for Alloa.
"I really believed that leadership was my real call, much more appropriate than playing.
It sounds strange because I was successful, I could live from it and enjoy some heights.
But playing can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot of things every week.
I still feel it because of work-related stress and pressure, but management is my field.
I've always wanted to lead and now I do it. I think I'm in the right place, I haven't felt so good all my life."

The survey found that the best time to enjoy the pint is at 5.30 a.m. on Saturday afternoon
The summer heat wave has caused Britain’s less popular pubs to shrink, but it has increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The data collected revealed that in July, the sales of pubs and bars had increased by 2.7 per cent, but in restaurants they had decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, who represents the business consulting agency CGA, who collected the data, said: "Continuously, the sunny weather and the prolonged participation of England in the World Cup meant that in July there was a similar trend as in June, namely, the profit of the pubs had increased by 2.8 percent, while the restaurants had fallen.
Restaurants, whose sales dropped by 1.8 percent in June, experienced an even more severe situation in July.
The situation in the drinking pubs and bars was most grateful because they experienced a much greater upturn than the restaurants experienced a downslide.
Food - based pubs also suffered from the sun, but not as dramatic as restaurant workers.
It seemed that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars, sales of beverages increased by 6.6 percent month-on-month, while food sales decreased by 3 percent."
RSM leisure and hospitality analyst Paul Newman said: "These results continue the trend observed at the end of April.
Weather conditions and the impact of extensive social or sporting events are the major factors determining the turnover outside the home market.
It is not surprising that the groups of restaurants continue to fight, although the drop in sales by 4.8 percent compared to the corresponding period of the previous year will be particularly painful for the additional continuous pressure of costs.
As far as food providers are concerned, the long and hot summer could not come at an even worse moment, and the time will show whether the more moderate temperature we usually experience in August will provide the much-needed respite."
The overall increase in sales among pubs and restaurants, including new firms, reached 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the decline in brand sales.
The Coffer Beach Tracker, which is the sales monitor of the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector, collects and analyses data from 47 business groups with a total turnover of over GBP 9 billion, and this has been incorporated into the industry benchmark.
Every fifth child has a secret social media account that he hides from his parents
The survey reveals that every fifth child, some of whom are only 11 years old, has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in false Instagram pages.
This information has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" account to show their parents.
One in five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, creates social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed that Instagram, a photo sharing site, is growing rapidly in the number of false profiles.
This information has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "clean main" account to show their parents, and also private accounts.
One mother who struck her 13 - year - old daughter’s secret site discovered a teenager who encouraged others to rape her.
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent School Leaders' Conference (HMC) revealed that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and only half of them admitted to maintaining private accounts.
HMC leader Mike Buchanan said: "It's scary that so many teenagers make up online profiles where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eillide Doyla will have a "light-lighted voice" on the Scottish Athletics Board
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board of Eilidh Doyle.
Doila is Scotland's most prized athletician in space and outdoors, and President Ian Beattie described this step as an excellent opportunity for those who are driven by sport to benefit from her extensive international experience over the last ten years.
"Eilida is given great respect throughout the Scottish, UK and global athletic community, and we are confident that Scottish Athletes will gain enormously by involving them on the board," said Beatty.
Doila said: "I would like to act as a "light voice" and I hope I can really get involved and help drive this sport in Scotland."
The American who won the 200-meter and 400-meter race at the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games, thus winning four Olympic gold medals in total, and is currently a regular BBC panel, was unable to pass after a transient ischaemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "This day a month ago I experienced a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time would tell if and to what extent I would recover.
It was a terrible job, but I fully recovered, learned to walk again and can do agility exercises today!
Thank you for your inspiring words!"
Opinions are shared about advertising a breast milk pump that compares mothers with cows
A breast-milk pumping company has taken care of shared views online in relation to advertising comparing nursing mothers with milking cows.
To mark the launch of the so-called "world's first quiet carry-on breast pump", consumer technology company "Elvie" released the ad of a sticky melody to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump offers to breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a wall-filled cow barn at a song that says, "Yes, I wipe myself, but you don't see any tail" and "if you didn't notice, they're not udders, they're my breasts."
The song continues: "Sūpūpūpūpūpūpūpūpūpūpūpūpūpūpūpūpūpūpūpūpūpūpūpūpūpūpūpūpūpūpūpūpūpūpūpūpūpūpē, I feed the babies, ūpūpūpūpūpūpūpūpūpūpūpē, I milk my ladies."
However, advertising published on the company’s Facebook page has led to a wide online resonance.
77 000 times the video viewed and commented hundreds of times has received shared feedback from viewers, and many say that it highlights the "false" of the dairy industry.
"A very wrong decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Just as we, as well as them, need to become difficult and give birth to milk, but their babies are taken away from them a few days after their birth," someone wrote.
"Elvie" breast milk pump unobtrusively belongs to breast-feeding women (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment states: "I understand that it is traumatic for both mother and baby.
But why not use it to advertise a breast milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
The opinion was also heard: "The creators of the advertising did not know what they were doing."
Others defended the ad, and a woman admitted that in her opinion the song was "enthusiastic".
"I think it's a great idea.
I'd buy one if I were still breast-feeding.
Milk sucking made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I understood the idea of it.
This is a brilliant product," wrote one.
Another comment says: "It's a fun ad, it's for moms who loosen milk (not yet in workplaces or toilets) and feel like a cow.
It is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the advertisement, a group of women discovered that they all danced with the inconspicuous pumps placed in their bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the observation that many women who loosen milk say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump pump is completely quiet, has no wires and pipes, and it is unobtrusively part of a breast for breastfeeding women, allowing them to move freely, keep their babies and even participate in events outside the house.
Anna Balarin "Mother" partner and creative director commented: "The Elvie Pump pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative placing on the market.
By pulling away the parallel between the milk-laughter women and dairy cows, we wanted to pay attention to milk-laughter, while at the same time demonstrating in an entertaining and intelligible way the stunning sense of freedom that the new pump will bring."
This is not the first time that the Elvie pump pump has come to the centre of attention.
In London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the tongue in Marta Jakubowski’s show using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent town on Texas border
The number of migrant children apprehended has increased rapidly, although relatively many people cross the border every month as before, partly by the harsh rhetoric and policies of the Trump administration that have made it difficult for children to settle with sponsors.
Generally, most sponsors have also been undocumented immigrants themselves, fearing that by openly applying for a child, this will threaten their ability to stay in the country.
The risk increased in June when federal officials announced that potential sponsors and other members of their household would have to be allowed to take their fingerprints, and these data will also be passed on to other immigration-related authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs law enforcement officer, showed before the Congress that the Agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsors of unaccompanied minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not been punished in advance.
"Almost 80 percent of those who are either sponsors or members of the sponsor's household are staying here illegally, and a large part of them are criminal aliens.
That is why we are continuing to persecute such persons," said Mr Albens.
According to asylum officers, in an effort to deal with children's cases more quickly, officials have introduced new rules which require some of them to appear before the courts within one month of their detention rather than after 60 days, as the previous standard stipulated.
Many will use the possibility of videoconferencing instead of coming in person to defend their legal status before an immigration judge.
Persons who will be considered unfit for release will be evicted quickly.
The longer children are held in custody, the more likely they are to become restless or depressed, which may lead to violent attacks or attempts to escape, reported according to information and testimonies provided by asylum officers, which have been taken out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers claimed that these concerns would be reinforced in larger sites, such as Tornillo, where signs of child suffering are more often overlooked due to their breadth.
They added that moving children to a tent town without giving enough time for their emotional preparation or allowing them to say good - bye to friends could lead to injuries that many already struggle with.
Syria forces the U.S., French and Turkish "Occupants' Armies" to immediately withdraw their troops
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country has been going on for the eighth year.
Moualem, who is also acting as Deputy Prime Minister, claimed that foreign forces are illegally present in Syria under the pretext of combating terrorism and will be "addressed accordingly".
"They need to resign immediately and without any conditions," he said to the Assembly.
Moualem insisted that in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011, and millions have been forced to leave their homes, "the war against terrorism is almost over".
He announced that Damascus would continue to fight in the holy war until all Syrian territories were cleansed, both of the two terrorist groups and of "any foreign military presence".
The United States has deployed around 2 000 soldiers in Syria, who mainly train and advise both the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs who are opponents of President Bashar Al Asada.
France has sent over 1,000 men to this war - torn country.
With regard to the issue of refugees, Mualem stated that the circumstances were great for them to return and blamed the "separate Western countries" for spreading "irrational fears" for which refugees do not want to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"These people are politicising what should be just a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive aid for the reconstruction of the country before an agreement is reached between Asad and the opposition on the end of the war.
UN diplomats explain that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last pillar of the rebels in Idlib has created an opportunity to speed up political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces on a province of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement "has set deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against Jihadists, including fighters from Al-Qaeda's affiliated group "Jabhat al Nusrah", who would be "destroyed".
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, looks forward to holding the first meetings of the new committees, including government and opposition representatives, in order to draft the post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for the elections.
Moualem laid down the conditions for the Syrian state's participation in the committee, stressing that the group's work should be limited to the 'review of the articles of the existing constitution', and warned of the interference.
Why Trump will be elected for a second term
From this point of view, Mr Trampa will be re-elected in the 2020 elections, unless, and perhaps many liberal observers, impressions and scandals hope for this, will not put an end to his Presidency prematurely.
And in that case, "it will be the most dramatic final of the Presidency all the time!"
At the moment, there is no sign of any relaxation.
Since 2014, ratings have more than doubled during the most advantageous CNN broadcast time, reaching 1.05 million viewers, while MSNBC has almost tripled them to 1.6 million viewers.
At Fox News's most favorable broadcast time, 2.4 million viewers, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, are informed by Nielsen, while MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" is in the highest position in the cable rating with 3.5 million key news viewers in the evening.
"It's a fire that attracts many people because it's an incomprehensible thing for us," explained Neal Baer, the support of the ABC drama Designed Survivor.
Nell Scovell, comedy writer-veterane and "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club" author has his own theory.
She remembers a taxi trip in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The leader told her that he would vote in favour of Mr Trump.
She wanted to know why.
"He said, "Because he laughs at me," said Ms.Skovel.
Chaos is somewhat entertaining.
Of course, unlike everything else that appears on TV, the news from Washington could determine what will happen to the Rou v Wade judgment, whether immigrant families will be able to unite, and the state of the global economy.
Ignoring is a luxury that only the most privileged observers can afford.
And yet it's more than being a citizen-informed when we discuss at six o'clock the expert group how Bob Woodward has used unnamed sources of information for his book Fair, Paul Manfort, a 15 thousand-dollar bomber-type jacket from ostrich feathers and skin ("the suit from which the arrogance sucks," declared Washington Post) and the role of Stormy Daniels' passionate description of the anatomical details.
I, for example, will never again perceive Super Mario like before.
"Part of what he does, which creates the impression of reality show, is that he endowed you with information every day," Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the show "Pawn Stars" explained about the changing team and everyday turns of Trump's show (a homage with the praise of N.F.L., Kim Chenun).
You can't afford to miss just one episode, because you'll fall behind.
When I got to Mr. Fleuss that week, the time on the north coast of Kauai was sunny,80 degrees (~27 degrees Celsius), but he was sitting in the premises where, without wiping his eyes, he watched the MSNBC show while recording CNN.
He could not stand still, not when Brett Kavanaugh had to stand before the Committee on Justice of the Senate and his future in the Supreme Court is threatening to break apart.
"I remember the times when we made all those crazy shows and when people said that "this is the end of Western civilisation," said Mr. Fleuse.
"I think it's such a joke, but it turns out they were right."

The money flows from the outside into the pre-election campaigns of the most tense parliamentary interim elections
It is no wonder that the 17th Congress constituency of Pennsylvania is seeking money thanks to the transformation of the Congress districts, which will result in two existing Members fighting for one place.
This recently redesigned outskirt area of Pittsburgh is linked to the representative of the Democrats Conor Lamb, who won his place in a special election last spring in another area.
The Lembs will fight with another current Member, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th Pennsylvania district, which largely overlaps with the new 17th area.
After the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally divided in favour of the Republicans, the cards were recycled.
Competition in the new 17th area has led to a fight between the main financial groups of the parties: the Democratic Campaign Congressal Committee and the National Republican Campaign Committee.
Lemb became known in Pennsylvania when he won the popular March elections at the 18th Congress of Pennsylvania.
This place had been held by the Republicans for more than 10 years, and President Donald Trump won in this area with 20 points.
Policy experts give democrats a little weight.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but then thought
The diplomats acknowledged that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing without much pressure from Washington.
Mr Trampa had a friendly meeting with President of Panama Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and he stayed at the hotel in Panama until his partners left behind the management team of Trump's organization.
The officials of the Department of State decided to withdraw the heads of diplomatic missions of the United States from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the grounds of "the recent decision not to recognise Taiwan anymore", its representative, Heather Nauert, stated earlier this month.
However, penalties were considered to be limited to El Salvador, which in 2017 received an amount of around 140 million from America, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which would involve reducing financial assistance and restricting targeted visas, would be painful for a Central American country where unemployment and murder rates have reached their highest levels.
In the course of internal meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focusing on security and economic well-being, which would have followed a similar meeting last year, which was recognised as a rapprochement effort to prevent migrants from moving to the US.
In mid-September, the top officials of the country made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, essentially by putting an end to the considerations of punishment in El Salvador.
The diplomats informed that Vice President Mike Pence now decided to participate in the conference scheduled for mid-October to show how seriously the administration emphasises the meeting.
And three American ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new and serious statements or penalties from Washington.
The representative of the White House, who spoke on behalf of Mr Bolton, did not wish to provide further information on the debate that was characterised by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to negotiate in-house if their anonymity was maintained.
Their stories were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition that his anonymity would be preserved.
Studying History
The second stone garden could be the special report by the prosecutor Robert Mueller that Mr Trampa may have obstructed justice, which has a great deal of evidence at the public's disposal.
It is said that Mr Miller will also investigate whether Trump's campaign has colluded with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the other party wins the Congress, Trump will have to respond to this structure, and perhaps also to the jury of his fellow members, just at the moment when he is going to meet the electorate again.
There's a lot of "but" and I'm not saying that the fall of Trampa is inevitable or that it will happen to his associates in Europe.
There are choices that we will have to make on both sides of the Atlantic, and these choices will show the duration of the fight.
In 1938 German officers were ready to take a coup against Hitler if the West had resisted him and supported him in Czech Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid years of long - lasting bloodbath.
History revolves around such turning points, and the unstoppable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans now have to face a number of such turning points.
What do we do if Mr Trampa fires General Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr Miller's investigation?
It has been difficult for Rosenstein since it was reported that last year he proposed secretly to record a conversation with the President and wondered about his unsuitability.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times story is not accurate.
"How can we respond if the FBI's inquiry into Brett Kaveno is not complete or honest, or if he is confirmed as a judge of the Supreme Court in spite of his unfair testimony and credible accusations of sexual assault?
And, most importantly, will we vote in the interim elections of Congress, which will bring Trump to justice?
If we do not pass all these tests, democracy will have a long winter.
But I believe that we will succeed by referring to what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jewish woman who was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once lived in my embassy.
She survived, emigrated America, and 60 years later she sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the table with a swastika.

"Rangers" star Grem Doran feels optimistic about the battle with Vienna's "Rapid"
"Rangers" will host Vienna's "Rapid" on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians after the impressive draw game in Spain with "Villarreal" earlier this month will allow them to be in a stable position to qualify from the European League Group G.
The road trauma did not allow the center's attacker Grem Dorans to resume participation in seasonal games until the draw score of 2:2 with "Villarreal", but he believes that "Rangers" can use this result as a springboard to achieve even more.
"We can be happy about it because Villarreal is a good team," said a 31-year-old footballer.
"We went in the game believing that we would be able to make good progress, and we got this point.
Perhaps we could have beaten them in the end, but overall, a tie is an honest result.
They may have been better in the first half of the day, but we had our second half and we were a better team.
And Thursday will be another important night for Europe.
Hopefully, we will get three points, but this will not be an easy game, because they got a good result in the previous game, but I am sure that with the help of our supporters we will be able to continue to fight and get good results.
The past year, with all my injuries and changes in the club itself, was clearly heavy, but now we see new coolness that I feel good about.
The team is great, and the guys enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope we can continue the fight, leave the past season behind and succeed."
Women are unable to sleep because they worry about their pension savings
Although the respondents knew clearly what kind of care they wanted, few had discussed the matter with the family.
About half of the individuals in a national study indicated that they should not talk to a spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said that they had talked to their children about it.
"People want to be cared for by family members, but they don't do anything to pronounce it," says Holly Snyder, Vice President of the State Life Insurance Agency.
That's where we should start.
Talk to your spouse and your children. You cannot prepare your family for needing care if you do not know your wishes well in advance.
Work with your consultant and family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these choices can be an important factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial advisor. Your consultant may also help you to figure out how to cover these costs.
Your ability to provide financing for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid insurance policy with a monetary amount to cover these costs, or a guarantee through your property, the main thing being that you have money.
Prepare your legal documents. Eliminate legal battles before they start.
Conversate an authorised person on health matters so that you have a trusted person who will supervise your health care and ensure that specialists act according to your wishes if you are unable to express it on your own.
Also consider the possibility of conferring a mandate on finances.
Choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf, who will take care of the payment of your bills if you are unable to do so on your own.
And don't forget the seemingly small details! Imagine that one of your elderly parents is being taken to the hospital for emergency care.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Indicate these facts in a written plan so that this situation does not surprise you.
"And this is not only about finances, but also about who the doctor is," Martina pointed out.
"What are the medicines used?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Make sure you have a plan of this kind."
A man shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe (Ilfracombe)
The man received several shots with an air rifle, going home at night.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove, Ilfracombe, in Devon, when he was shot in his chest, stomach, and palm.
The police described the shooting at around 2.30 p.m. of the BST as "adjacent".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries do not endanger his life, and the police call on witnesses to apply.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to the government, a severe earthquake and tsunami that struck Pala in Indonesia on Friday have killed at least 384 people, and the number of victims is expected to increase.
Because of the ruined communications, the rescuers have not been able to obtain any information from the Dongala (Dongala) district, located north of Pala, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magitud earthquake.
More than 16 000 people were evacuated after the devastating natural disaster.
Here is the basic information about Pala and Dongal, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi Province and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. It is estimated that in 2017 it had 379 800 people.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami.
Dongala is an area extending approximately 300 km (180 miles) along the north-west coast of the island of Sulawesi.
The administrative region of the province is estimated to have a population of 299 200 people in 2017.
Fisheries and farming are the economic pillar of the Central Province of Sulawesi, especially in the off-shore Dongal district.
The production of nickel also plays an important role in the province, but it is mainly concentrated on the other bank of Morrowali, Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Prevention Agency, Palu and Dongal have suffered several tsunamis in the last 100 years.
In 1938 the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongal.
The Tsunami also overthrowded the western part of the Dongal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismically active Pacific fire ring, where earthquakes are regularly formed.
The following are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A severe earthquake on the west coast of Aceh, northern Sumatra, caused a tsunami on 26 December, affecting 14 countries, killing 226 000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, of which more than half were in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nia, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A strong earthquake of 6.8 magnesium waters erupted in the south of Java, the most populated island of Indonesia, causing tsunamis hitting the southern coast, killing almost 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 - magnitude earthquake broke out near the city of Padang, the capital of the Western province of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-maglitud earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai off the coast of Sumatra, causing tsunami waves of up to 10 metres high that devastated dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: An earthquake close to the surface of the earth struck the area of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing devastation and panic, as it reminded of the destruction that the devastating earthquakes and tsunamis of 2004 brought with it.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapsing buildings.
In 2018, severe earthquakes struck the Indonesian tourism island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily prevented hundreds of tourists from returning home.
Senior son of Sarah Peilin arrested following an accusation of domestic violence
Track Palin, senior son of former Governor of Alaska and Vice-President-designate Sarah Peilin, has been arrested for being accused of attack.
According to a Saturday report by the Alaska State Troopers, 29-year-old Peilin, who lives in Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested for alleged domestic violence and resistance to arrest.
According to a police report, when an acquaintance-woman tried to call the police to report, as she claimed, crimes, he took her phone away.
Peilin has been detained in the pre-trial detention facility of Mat-Su, and he has $500 in security, reports KTUU.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where, when asked whether he found himself guilty, he declared that "it was definitely not guilty".
Peilin has been charged with three A-grade offences, for which he can be sentenced to a year in prison and a USD 250 000 fine.
He has also been charged with a class B offence for which a day-long prison sentence and a $2,000 fine can be obtained.
It is not the first time that criminal offences have been prosecuted against Peilin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father Todd Peilin.
His mother, Sarah Peylin, summoned the police and reported an attack.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of delaying the report on domestic violence, and of wearing a gun in the context of this incident.
His girlfriend says he's hitting it with a fist in the face.
In 2016, veteran groups criticised Sarah Peilina for linking her son's violent behaviour to post-traumatic stress disorder, returning from the service in Iraq.
Tsunami caused by the earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people died after the earthquakes that struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 - magnitude earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been destroyed and the number of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake broke out near the central part of Sulawesi, southeast of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
Videos showing the moment of a collision are spreading on social networks.
Hundreds of people were gathered to the beach festival in Palu, when the tsunami struck against the coast.
Federal prosecutors want to demand the execution of a rarely used person suspected of a terrorist act in New York City
Federal prosecutors want to demand the execution of Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected of a terrorist act in New York City when eight people were killed, a rare form of punishment that has not been committed in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
As it is claimed, 30-year-old Saipov used the Home Depot rental car to attack the bikeway along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October, where he hit pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
In order to justify executions, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused a serious injury, as stated in the statement of intent to apply for the death penalty submitted to the Southern District Court of New York.
According to a judicial document, both of these charges could be sentenced to death.
Within a week of the attack, the Federal Grand Jury adopted an indictment of the prosecution of Saipova in 22 charges, which included eight charges of murder for the purposes of extortion, commonly used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as charges of cruelty and damage to motor vehicles.
The attack required "considerable planning and pre-intention", explained the prosecutors, mentioning that Saipov's attack was "false, cruel and inhuman".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov injured, harmed and caused damage to their families and friends: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleveles, Anna-Lory Dekadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Ernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejan Dagnocco," says the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since the prosecutors of the Southern District Court of New York had carried out an accusation against the death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but eventually he was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2009.
The death penalty was last executed in New York City in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were sentenced to death after being accused of engaging in espionage during the Cold War of the Soviet Union two years ago.
On June 19, 1953, the death penalty was executed in an electric chair for a couple of Rozenbergs.
According to judicial documents, as days and months passed, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, did not regret the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to an indictment article, Saipov told the officials that he was inspired to attack after watching the ISIS video on his phone.
The police informed him that he had also asked for permission to display the ISIS flag in his chamber.
He has rejected the 22 indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders of Saipov, said that he was "very naturally dissatisfied" about the indictment decision.
"We believe that the intention to demand the death penalty instead of accepting guilt in exchange for life imprisonment without the right to release will only prolong the ongoing injury to all parties involved," Patons explained.
A team of Saipova defenders has previously called on prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative Member states that Mr Brexis should be entrusted with the management of the negotiations to NAIJEL FARASE
Nigel Faraj promised to "mobilise the army of the people" at the Conservative conference today.
The former leader of the British Independent Party stated that politicians must feel the anger of the Eurosceptics when one of the Members of the House of the Teresa May suggested that negotiations with the EU should be entrusted to him.
Peter Bone, a Conservative associate, announced to Marsh Birmingham that Britain would have withdrawn for a long time if Mr Farage were Brexit's minister.
However, the challenge that Mrs May will have to face in trying to consolidate her controversial party was demonstrated by the conservatives who supported the EU and joined a separate urban protest against Brexis.
The Prime Minister is fighting to maintain her compromise plan on Britain's future relations with the European Union (Chequers compromise) and is being attacked by those who want to leave the EU, by those who want to remain in the EU and also by the EU itself.
The companions insisted that she would make a determined effort to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and would force Eurosceptics and Laboures to choose between her offer and the chaos.
Mr. Bouna said that he wanted to throw the chuck Checks away at the Leaving Means Leave at Solihull.
He proposed that Mr Farage be made an ally and that he be entrusted with the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been here, we would have stopped," Bouns said.
The MEP from Wellingborough added: 'I will support Brexit, but we have to throw away the May Plan'.
In support of his opposition in the EU, he said: 'We did not fight to be crews!
We want to make our own laws in our country!"
Mr. Bouna ignored the assumption that public opinion could have changed since the vote in 2016: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is absolutely false."
Andrea Jenkyns, a supporter of Brexis, also took part in the march and said to the reporters: "I just say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is not popular with society, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and our supporters, who actually do all the work and elect us.
Please give up Chequers and start listening."
In the news of May, she added: "The Prime Ministers remain in place when they fulfill their promises."
Mr Farage said that politicians at the meeting should be under pressure if they are to disregard the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's a question of trust between us people and our politicians," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexis and we're here today to tell them that we're not going to let them do it."
In his message, he fills an enthusiastic crowd: "I want you to let our politicians who are planning to pass on Brexis feel the pressure.
"We will invite the people of this country who have allowed us to win the fight for Brexit, and we will never relax until we are independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the residents marched through Birmingham before a two-hour meeting took place in the center of the city.
Unknowing activists greeted conservatives with Brexis Banners after the group meeting this weekend.
The representative of the Workers' Party, Lord Adonis, ridiculed Conservatives for the security issues they experienced at the start of the party application conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they are able to maintain the order of the IT system and all their technology for Canada and more, and yet, for a whole border, free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
"It's an absolute farce.
There is no such thing as a successful Brexith," he added.
Warren plans to carefully consider the candidacy of the President of the United States
Senator Elizabeth Warren says that she will "consider carefully" her candidacy in the US presidential election after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, the democrat of Massachusett spoke about her future in the town hall of West Massachusett.
Warren, who often criticises President Donald Trampa, participates in the re-elections in November and is standing against GOP State Republican Geoff Dahl, who was Vice-President of the 2016 Massachusetts campaign in Trump.
It is being speculated that she will be the main one who dares to stand against Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters through the town hall since Trumps took office.
One visitor asked her if she was planning to stand for the presidential election.
So what did Warren say is it's time for "Washington to have women who "will fix" the imperfect government, which also means the women-presidents."

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Champion after the team lets him beat Sebastian Fetel
From the moment Walter Bottas qualified on Saturday before Lewis Hamilton, it became clear that Mercedes' team's work would play an important role in the competition.
From the start, Bottos started well and almost left Hamilton dry, defending his place on the first two trips and inviting Fettel to attack his teammate.
Fetel first entered the garage and left Hamilton in the engines to deal with the others, likely decisive.
The Mercedes pilot filled the circle later and fell behind Fetel, but Hamilton continued to take the lead after the force was measured, which saw the Ferrari rider persistently leaving the inside free, risking to lag behind the double maneuver to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstapen began from the back row and at the end of the first circle was the seventh on his 21st birthday.
Then he was in the lead of a large part of the race, because he focused the tires to quickly reach the finish and overtake Kim Raikonen in the fourth.
Eventually, he came to the garage in circle 44, but he couldn’t increase the speed in the remaining eight laps because Raikonen remained fourth.
This is a difficult day, because Walter did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman.
The team did an extremely important job to get one two," said Hamilton.
It was a very bad body language
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diana Feynstein for her perseverance to disclose a letter from Christine Bleisy Ford, in which she accused the candidate of the Supreme Court, Brett Kaveno, of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not speak directly about the testimony of Ford given to the legal committee of the Senate, but made a comment that what happened in the Senate shows that people there are "bad, nasty and unreliable."
"One thing that can happen and something beautiful that is already happening in the last days in the Senate, when there is anger, when you see angry, evil, nasty and unreliable people," he said.
"When you read the press releases and leaked information, and then they say, "Oh, no, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diana Feynstein, did you leak the information?
Remember her answer to the question... did you leak the document?
Oh, no.
I didn't do it."
All right, hold on a second.
Did we do it...No, we didn't do it," he added, in the intonation of the senator.
In July, Feynstein was sent a letter explaining in detail what Ford accused Kaveno of, and early September the contents of the letter were disclosed, but Feynstein denied that it would have happened in her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I "don't leak" her story," Feynstein said to the commission, reports "The Hill".
"She asked me to keep it confidential, and I did it."
But her denial did not appeal to the President, who commented on the situation at a Saturday evening meeting as follows: "I will tell you that it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the candidate of the Supreme Court, whose three women are accused of sexual harassment, the President suggested that democrats use accusations for their own benefit.
"They are purposeful to regain power by any means."
Do you see evil, confusion, they don't care what they're hurting, what they have to destroy in order to gain power and control," the President says, "Mediaite".

Air traffic controller dies, allowing hundreds of people on board to escape during an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is praised as a hero after he sacrificed himself to make a plane with hundreds of passengers rise safely from land.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a severe earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing tsunamis.
Strong aftershocks continue in the area and many are trapped in the mud in Palu.
However, despite his colleagues saving their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Ganavan Agung refused to leave his job in the control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport at Palu Airport, which was rocking.
He remained in his position to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321 on the runway at that time would safely take off in the air.
Then he jumped off the traffic control tower, thinking it could collapse.
Later, he died in the hospital.
Indonesian air navigation representative Johannes Sirait said that his decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported Australia’s ABC news.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Pala.
"We're really upset when we hear it," he fills.
Meanwhile, public authorities are concerned that the number of deaths could reach thousands, the national disaster prevention agency claims that access to Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that beautiful will grow, because many human bodies are still under the rubble, as well as many cannot access," said the agency's representative, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The 6 - foot [6 m] waves destroyed Pala, where a mass funeral would take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft continue to provide assistance and the necessary goods.
Risa Kusuma, 35-year-old mother, Sky News, said: "Every minute's the ambulance brings new victims.
Clean water is a deficit.
The little shops are all over-broken."
Jan Gelfand, International Head of the Red Cross in Indonesia, CNN said: "The Red Cross of Indonesia is rushing to help the survivors, but we do not know what we will find there.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can all get worse."
On Sunday, the President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu and said to the military of the country, "I ask you to work day and night to accomplish all the tasks relating to evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Already this year, Indonesia was shaken by earthquakes in Lomboca, where more than 550 people died.
A plane disaster in Micronesia: Now Air Niugini says that one of the people is missing after the plane crash in the lagoon
The airline carried out a flight during which it fell into the Pacific lagoon of Micronesia and now claims that one person had disappeared, although previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from a sinking plane.
Air Niugini announced a press release on Saturday afternoon when they could not answer for one of the passengers, a man.
The airline announced that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the missing man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for further information about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
The local people helped save other passengers and crew by boat after the plane fell into the water, trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were hospitalized.
The airline announced that six people remained in the hospital until Saturday, and all of them were in a stable position.
The causes of the accident and the sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy report that the aircraft fell into the lagoon shortly after taking off the runway.
Some eyewitnesses thought that the length of the runway was overestimated on the plane.
Bill Jane, an American passenger, said that the plane was very low.
"It was really very good," said Jane.
Jane says that he and other passengers were able to get out of a sinking plane using emergency exits, because the water was only to the waist.
He said that the Stuarts panicked and yelled, as well as that he had a mild head injury.
The U.S. navy sailors who worked nearby to improve the quay also helped rescue by using an inflatable boat to bring people to shore before the plane sank about 30 metres (100 feet) below the water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in PNG registered airlines in the last twenty years, and no one is related to Air Niugini.
Psychoanalytical commentator explains the scene of the night when a woman was burned alive
The charge on Saturday provided evidence in the re-opened case, where a man is accused of burning a living woman in 2014.
Paul Rovlet, a psychoanalyst of the U.S. Department of Judicial Expertise, showed himself for several hours as a witness expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used the information from his phone to put together the 29 - year - old Quinton Tele and 19 - year - old Jessica Chambers acted on the night she died.
Rovlet said he received location data from several phones, which shows that the Telis was with Chambers in the evening of her death, challenging his previous testimony, reported "The Clarion Ledger".
When the data showed that his phone was at Chambers in time when he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford showed that he was not in the city that day.
When the accusation asked if the Telis was telling the truth, claiming that that night was in Sanford's car, Sanford said he "melo, because my car was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that the Telis said he knew Chambers only about two weeks after she died.
Your phone records show that they knew each other only for a week.
Rovlet said that a little after the death of Chambers, the Telis deleted text messages, calls and contact details from Chambers from his phone.
"He erased him from his life," said Hale.
It is planned that the defences will give their final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later on the same day.

Black again?
In New York, a babysitter sues a couple for dismissal after receiving a "rasistic" message
In New York, a babysitter has sued a couple for discriminating dismissal after she has received an erroneous text message from a mother who has complained that the babysitter is "black again."
A couple deny that they would be racists, comparing the trial to the extortion.
Lindsey Plasco-Flaksman, a mother of two children, expressed her disapproval when she learned that the new baby carer, Giusele Maureis, was black when she arrived for work the first day in 2016.
"IN THE NOW, RETURN," Plasco-Flaksman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, she sent a message, not to her husband, but to Mauries, and twice.
Aware of their awkwardness, the "fragile" Plasko-Flaksman discount on Mauries, pointing out that their previous nanny, who was an African American, did a bad job and that she had been waiting for a Filipino, referring to the New York Post.
Mauris was paid for one working day and sent home with Uber.
Now Maurisa has sued the couple, claiming compensation for the dismissal, and she wants to receive $350 a day for six months for working with a secure living, which she originally applied for and without a contract of employment.
"I want to show them that such things don't do," she said on Friday, "Post", adding "I know it's discrimination."
A couple reject the accusations that they are racists, claiming that the termination of Mauritanian employment was a reasonable decision because they feared that she would not be able to trust her after she was accused.
"My wife sent her what she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco, man, said, "Post."
"But would you entrust your children to someone you treated rudely, even if it was just a mistake?
Your newborn?
Think about it."
The trial was likened to "expression", Plasco said that his wife had given birth to the little only two months ago and was in a very "complex situation".
"You're really turning to someone in this way?
This is unacceptable," added the investment banker.
While proceedings are still ongoing, public opinion quickly goes to court over social networks, denouncing them for their behaviour and logical thinking.
A new letter reveals that the publishers of Padington’s book were concerned that readers would not be able to associate with a talking bear
Bond's daughter Karen Jenkel, who was born shortly before the book was approved, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in someone's shoes, who reads the book for the first time before it is published.
It is very surprising to find out now what we know about the great success of Padington."
She added that the 60th anniversary of the book was "sweetly bitter" after the father's death last year.
Speaking of Padington, which she calls a "very important member of the family", her father quietly boasted about her eventual success.
"He was a quiet, quiet man and wasn't bounced," she said.
"But because Padington was so real to him, it was the same as if you had a child who achieves something: you're proud even if you haven't done it yourself.
I think he looked at Padington's success in a similar way.
Although it was made by him and the fruit of his imagination, he always gave every credit to Padington himself."
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter by phone
After landing, her daughter was taken by the ambulances to the Nice Hospital of Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors fought for her life all the time.
"Ned called regularly and said that she was very bad and expected not to survive," said Ednana-Laperuza.
"Then I got a call from Ned, saying that she'll die in the next two minutes and I have to say goodbye to her.
And that's what I did.
I said, "I love you very much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicine that the doctors gave her to maintain her heart rate slowly stopped and left her body.
She would have died even faster, and it's over now.
I had to sit down and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I could not cry or cry because I was in a situation where families and people were around.
I needed a lot of strength to control."
After all, then the daughter of the grieving, Ednan-Laperuza boarded a plane with other passengers who had no idea what she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I stabbed my head down and tears flowed all the time.
It is difficult to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt deep sympathy for Ned.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved him."
Surrendering women attach cards to bridges to prevent suicide
Two women whose loved ones have committed suicide act to help others not to take their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hamfrey are strengthening cards at the Welsh Bridge with an inspiring message and phone numbers so that people can call and receive support.
Davis ’ son Tyler was 13 years old when he began suffering from depression, but he committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want a parent to have to experience what I have every day," she said.
Davies, 45 years old in Lydnya, said that her son was a promising cook with an addictive smile.
"Everyone recognized him for a smile.
Everyone always said that his smile "enlightened" always and everywhere."
But, he gave up his job before he died, because he was "in a very, very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found him after Tyler had committed suicide.
Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that this will have consequences."
Davis created cards "to make known that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if it is a friend.
You don't have to sit in silence, you have to speak."
Hamphrey, a year old friend of Davis, lost Mark, her spouse for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he would feel sad or depressed or any quote would feel," she said.
"Some days before Christmas we noticed that his attitude had changed.
He reached his lowest point on Christmas morning, when the children opened the gifts he did not make eye contact with them or something."
His death was a great trauma to children, but they have to deal with it: "It hurts the whole family.
That's what divides us.
But we must all continue and fight."

Brett Kaveno's future hangs in the air because FBI is launching an investigation
"I think if we could really get what he needs – in terms of time and scope of the limited investigation – we might be able to achieve a little consensus," Flake said on Saturday, adding that he is concerned that the commission "divides" between fortified guerrilla.
Why do the supporters of Kaveno and his Republics not want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their abstention is only a coincidence.
It is five weeks later, on November 6, when the Republicans are expected to go bad, their attempts will be much weaker to elect a man from among themselves in the highest court.
George W. Bush calls the senators, lobbying to support them in Kaveno, who worked in the White House during Bush's time and thanks to him met his wife Ashley, who was the personal secretary of President Bush.
What will happen after the FBI prepares its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where at present 51 seats belong to the Republicans and 49 democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kaveno can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pens, Vice-President, to decide the vote and confirm him in the Supreme Court.
Kim's leadership "depreciated" North Korea's number of political asylum seekers
North Korea's number of political asylum seekers in South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong came to power seven years ago, said the South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the South Korean uniting ministry, said that last year there were 1127 political asylum seekers compared to 2011, when they were 2706.
The park said that stricter border controls for Star North Korea and China and high rates of smugglers are key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of political asylum seekers from North Korea are ultimately offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that more than 30 000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most go through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarisation Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China considers political asylum seekers to be illegal immigrants and deport them forcibly.
The relations between North Korea and South Korea, which are still fighting technically, have improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang to discuss delayed negotiations on denucleration.
This took place after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jongun in Singapore in June, when, on big trains, they agreed to cooperate to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions since these negotiations had not progressed.
"If there is no confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in the security of our country, and in such circumstances we will never unilaterally disarm the first," said Ri at the UN General Assembly in New York."
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kaveno "histerical" and claims that he is unsuitable for work in the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, a minority leader of the Court, called Bret Kaveno the candidate of the Supreme Court "histerical" and claimed that he was not suitable for work in the Supreme Court because of her temperament.
Pelosi made comments in an interview on Saturday at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman had behaved like this, they would call her "histerical," said Pelosi about his reaction to the testimony given to the Senate's Judicial Commission on Thursday in Caveno.
Kaveno emotionally denied the accusations of sexual harassment by Dr. Christine Blasia Ford when they were both teenagers.
In its starting argument, Kaveno was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and smoking, talking about his family and high school years.
He condemned, in particular, the democrats in the commission, naming the accusations against him of "the destruction of a coherent and coherent nature", organised by the Liberals, who are angry at the loss of Hillary Clinton in the Presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believes that Kaveno's testimony is a justification for not being able to work in the Supreme Court, because it shows that he has a bilateral attitude towards Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and attitude with which he targets Clinton and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi objected when she was asked whether she would try to question Kaveno if she was approved and if the Democrats obtained a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say that if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or FBI, then he's not suitable not only for office in the Supreme Court, but also for work in the existing workplace in the court," Pelosi said.
Kaveno, right now, is a judge in the appeal court of Washington County.
Pelosi added that as a democrat is concerned about the possibility that Kaveno makes decisions against the "Affordable Care Act" or Roe v. Way, because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his appointment negotiations, Kaveno bypassed questions about whether he would reject decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It is not a good time for a hysterical and bizarre man to work in court, but we expect us to be happy to say, "Isn't it wonderful?!" said Pelosi.
But women must hold their hands.
It's a denunciation, for months and years, it's all piled up "over the edges", but she's not allowed to get it all out of herself crying.
"We cry when we're angry," said Mrs. Steinem in 45 years' time.
"I don't think it's unusual, what do you think?"
She continued, "Once I was very helped by a woman who was herself a leader in a company who said that she also wept when she was angry, but developed a technique — when she got angry and started to weep, she told the person with whom she was talking: "You can think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she kept going.
And I thought it was great."
As a form of discharge of anger, the tears are only partially recognized, since they are misunderstood fundamentally.
One of my most vivid memories is from the oldest work, which was marked by the proportion of men, when I wept once because of undiscovered anger when I was caught by an older woman, a restrained head (a woman), who was always a little afraid of me, who drew me to the stairwell.
"Never let them see that cry!" she told me.
"They don't know you've passed.
They think you're sad and they're just gonna be happy that you managed to "break under your skin."
Patricia Schroeder, the US Congress of Democrats from Colorado, worked together with Gary Hart for his presidential election campaign.
In 1987, when Hart, caught in out-of-marriage, left the ship, also called "the making of fools" and left the elections, Schroeder, deeply disappointed, thought that there was no reason why she could not stand for the post of president.
"It wasn't a carefully thought out decision," she laughed at me 30 years later.
"The election was already seven other candidates and the last thing they wanted to do was one more.
There were those who called it "Snow White and Seven Dwarves."
She got involved late in the campaign, she was lagging behind in collecting funds and promised that she would not take part in the elections unless $2 million were collected.
It was a lost fight.
She found that many of her supporters, who donated $1,000 to men, gave her only $250.
"Do they think I get discounts?" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was very emotional — grateful to the people who supported her, disappointed in a system that made it very difficult to raise money and speak to voters rather than to the delegates, and angry for sexism — in which she was 'nought'.
"You'd think I'd have a breakdown of my nerves," Shreder recalled how the press reacted to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor."
I remember thinking about what they're going to write on my gravestone.
"She cried."
Why the U.S.-China Trade War can be favorable for Beijing
The main excuses as to how the trade war between the US and China began are hidden and until the battle is over, differences between countries can be favourable to Beijing in the long term, say experts.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning at the beginning of this year, taxing the main Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation started this week with new rates affecting a unit worth USD 200 billion (GBP 150 billion) by immediately levying half of the goods exported to the US from China.
Beijing also "kind" answers every time, the youngest is five to ten percent rates for 60 billion dollars worth of American goods.
China has announced a commitment to respond to the US one-to-one and it is doubtful that in the near future, the world's second largest economy could be mined.
In order for Washington to withdraw, it would be necessary to agree to certain requirements, but it would be too shameful for President Xi Xi Xi Xi Jinping to stumble publicly in the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays out its cards correctly, the pressure of the US trade war can have a positive effect on China in the long term, reducing the interdependence of the economies of both countries.
"The fact that a political decision has been made quickly, either in Washington or Beijing, could create uncontrollable economic conditions in any of the countries, which are really more dangerous than previously recognised by observers," said Abigel Grace, a researcher at New American Security, who focuses on Asia.
Syria is a "ready-to-go" for the return of refugees, said the Foreign Minister.
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for assistance in rebuilding a country that has been ravaged by war for more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Almualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
"Now the situation on land is much more stable and safer, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the territories destroyed by terrorists to their normal state.
There are all the conditions for refugees to return voluntarily to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their livelihoods.
The UN assumes that 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
A further six million people still live in the country and need humanitarian aid.
Almualem said that the Syrian regime would accept aid for the reconstruction of a devastated country.
But he stressed that the state would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that helped sponsor riots.
The European golf team has a sensational victory for the Radera Cup in Paris
The European golf team won the 2018 Rider Cup, surpassing the US team with a score of 16.5:10.5 "Le Golf National" outside Paris, France.
The United States has already lost six times in a row in Europe and has not acquired the Raider Cup since 1993.
Europe regained the cup when the team led by the random dog Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points that were needed to beat the US sample.
The U.S. star Phil Michaelson, who had a hard time hit the entire tournament, hit his T-tree in the water at the 16th Hole of PAR 3 by joining the match Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari played brilliantly in all of his stages, becoming one of the four players who have ever managed to score 5-0-0 since 1979, when the tournament is played according to the existing format.
American Jordan Spite with 5 to 4 sensationally lost European teams, by rating, to the lowest player, Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's best player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 Ian Polter from England, for whom this was probably the last Rider Cup.
The veteran of the eight Raider Cups, Spanish Serhio Garcia, became the best player of all time from Europe with 25.5 career points.
"I don't cry normally, but today I can't hold my tears."
This was a hard year.
I am grateful to Thomas that he drew me up and believed me.
I'm very, very happy we've recovered the cup.
This is the merit of the team and I am glad that I was able to help," Garcia commented emotionally on the victory of the European team.
He goes on to give his compatriot John Rams, who won the US golf legend Taiger Woods on Sunday with 2 to 1 singles.
"The pride I feel in winning Taiger Woods, I grew up following the course of this player," said 23 years young Rams.
Woods lost all his four matches in France and now he has a career record with 13-21-3 in Rider Cup.
Unusual statistics for one of the best players of all time, who won 14 top-level golf tournaments, being second behind Jack Nidlaus.
The U.S. team fought throughout the weekend to find their opportunities, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf for the entire tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furick said, after his team's unsatisfactory performance, "I'm proud of the guys, they fought.
This morning was the moment when we were able to put a little pressure on the European team.
We fought.
With all due respect to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played a very good game.
We will restructure, I will work with the American PGA and the US Rider Cup Committee and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to hit your hats.
We won."
Red tide latest: Concentration decreases in Pinell (Pinella), Manatee and Sarasota (Sarasota)
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Committee (FWC) points to an overall reduction in red tides in part of the Gulf of Tampa area.
According to FWC, blooming spots have been reported in Pinell, Manate, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, indicating a decrease in concentration.
The red tide blooms approximately 130 miles from the coast of North Piel to the southern tip of the sea.
The spots can be found about 10 miles from the seashore of the Hillsborough area, but in some places it lasts about a week.
The red tide is also open in the Pasco area.
Last week, average concentrations in the Pinele area or its maritime coastal area, low to high concentrations in the maritime coastal area of the Hilsborough area, low to high concentrations in the Manate area, low to high concentrations in the Sarasota area or its maritime coastal area, low to medium concentrations in the Charlotte area, low to high concentrations in the Lee area or its maritime coastal area, and low concentrations in the Collier area were reported.
Respiratory irritation is still reported in Pinela, Manatei, Sarasota, Lee and Colliere areas.
No respiratory irritation was reported in Northwest Florida last week.
