When the English-speaking person notices that the foreigner with whom he speaks does not understand something of what he says, he repeats exactly the same thing, but more loudly, as if this person were deaf. At no point does it come to his mind that the choice of his words might be difficult, or that his expression could be easily misunderstood by the foreigner, and that he could say it more simply by other words. As a result, the person not only still does not understand what he has said, but also becomes annoyed by the fact that he is considered deaf.
