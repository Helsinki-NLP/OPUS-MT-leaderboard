Members of the Assembly of Wales (AM) are concerned about the possibility of "being perceived as mites"
Some members of the assembly are concerned about the suggestion to change the name of their office to MDP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – member of the Welsh Parliament).
This is due to plans to change the assembly's name to "Welsh Parliament"(the Parliament of Wales).
The AM worries throughout the political spectrum that it can make them a laughing stock.
One of the Labour Party's AMs explained that their group was doing the concern of "resonances with the words Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, "twp" means "one-court", while "pwp" means "kaka".
Party Plaid AM indicated that none of the group were "unsatisfied" and have recommended alternatives.
A spokesman for the Welsh Conservative Party admitted that their group was willing to consider the name change, but added that "MWP" is very similar to "Muppet", meaning "erm".
In this context, it should be noted that the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly to the English Yorkshire dialect "u".
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a bill to change the name, informed: "The final decision as to what terms will be used to designate Assembly members is, of course, to be made by Assembly members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals. e Commission gained broad support for changing the assembly's name to the Welsh Parliament.
As regards the AM title, the panel preferred "Welsh Parliament Member" (WMP), but the MWP received the most support in the public consultation.
AM explicitly recommends alternative options, but the battle for agreement may cause headaches for Assembly Speaker Elin Jones, who is expected to present a bill for change in the coming weeks.
The draft law on the change will also include other changes to the work of the assembly, including laws on AM disqualification and the structure of the committee system.
The AM's final vote on what they will be called will be made once the laws and regulations have been discussed.
Macedonians go to vote in referendum on changing country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday whether their country's name will be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia".
A referendum was organised to resolve decades of disagreements with neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbour gives the impression of claims on its territory, and has repeatedly objected to Macedonia's request to be admitted to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, one of the opponents of the plebiscite for the name change, stated that he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is simply a thing to be done to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's church bells shut up as the Harlem churches fight for existence.
"As the old people I've talked to tell me, in the past there was a bar and a church on every corner," Mr Adams says.
"Now there is neither one nor the other."
He admits that the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
"People today are socializing in other ways," he said.
"The bars are no longer the neighborhood's living rooms that people visit regularly."
Speaking even to the churches, he worries that the money he receives by selling the properties will end faster than the leaders hope, "and sooner or later they will have returned to the starting point".
The temple, he added, will probably be replaced by apartment buildings with apartment properties housing people who will not help the shrines remaining in the area.
"Most of the people who will buy apartment properties in these buildings will be white," he explained, "and thus will come closer to the day when these churches close forever, because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these apartment properties will become members of these congregations."
The two churches were built by the white congregation, even before Harlem became a black metropolis, the Metropolitan community in 1870, and St. Martin's, 10 years later.
The original white Methodist congregation left the building in the 1930s.
The black congregation, which had worshiped right next door, took over the building.
The Black Congregation of St. Martin's Church took over his blessings during John Howard Johnson. He led a boycott of working retailers on 125th Street, Harlem, who had refused to hire blacks or give them a promotion.
A fire in 1939 seriously damaged the building, but as members of Father Johnson's congregation planned to rebuild the building, they ordered a call game.
His blessing David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin's Congregation, proudly called the call game "for the bells of the poor people".
The expert who played this call game in July used other words: "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Expert Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan added that it was the first call game in the world played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to a larger call game at Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather told him that St. Martin's congregation did not replace him.
The events of the past few months around St. Martin's church reflected a knotted relationship between architects and contractors, some of whom had been attracted to secular power in the work, and others by the episcopal diocese of the church.
The council of the congregation, made up of secular leaders, addressed the diocese in writing in July with concerns that the diocese would "seek to pass costs" to the council, although the council had not been involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some members of the congregation complained about the lack of transparency in the operation of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old teenager at lobster fishing ground
Shark attacked a 13-year-old boy in California, who dived after lobsters, and wounded him on Saturday. It was the first day of the lobster season, the services of the story.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m., near Beacon's Beach beach in the town of Encinita.
Chad Hammel informed KSWB-TV San Diego that he and his friends had been dive for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy call for help, and then aired with the group up to him to help the boy pull out of the water.
Hammel explained that at first he had thought it was simply a rapture of the lobster he caught, but then he "understood that the boy was shouting "My biting!
I'm bitten!"
His entire keybone had been torn apart," Hammel told, who immediately noticed it when he had got to the boy.
"I yelled for everyone to leave the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The boy was taken by air to Rady's Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition was found to be critical.
The species of the attacked shark is unknown.
Rescue captain Larry Giles informed the media that a shark had been observed in the area a few weeks earlier, but was found not to be a dangerous species for humans.
Jails added that the upper part of the torso was traumatized to the victim.
Officials closed access to beaches from Ponto Beach, Casablad, to Swami's in the city of Encinita, for 48 hours for the duration and safety of the investigation.
Jails pointed out that more than 135 species of sharks are present in this area, but most are not considered dangerous to humans.
Sainsbury's plans to penetrate the UK beauty industry market
"Sainsbury's" goes on attack on "Boots", "Superdrug" and "Debenhams" with ranks of department store style beauty products shelves and trained vendors.
As part of the significant investment in the UK's 2.8 billion-pound beauty market, which continues to grow, although the sales of fashion goods and home-made items are declining, 11 stores in the country will be testing larger rows of shelves for beauty products, and if everything goes well, there will be more such stores next year.
In the beauty industry, funds are invested when supermarkets are looking for ways to use shelves that were previously reserved for televisions, microwaves and goods for the house.
"Sainsbury's" informed that they would double their offer in the beauty industry for up to 3,000 products, including brands such as "Revlon", "Essie", "Tweezerman" and, for the first time, "Dr. PawPaw".
Existing lines from "L'Oreal", "Maybelline" and "Burt's Bees" will also receive more space with branded areas, similar to, for example, those in "Boots" stores.
The supermarket also re-markets its Boutique line of make-up, in which most products will be vegan-friendly – which is increasingly demanded by younger buyers.
In addition to this, perfume wholesaler "Fragrance Shop" will test the concession at two "Sainsbury's" stores, the first of which was opened the previous week in Croydon in south London, and the second will be opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham, later this year.
Shopping online and switching to small purchases of food every day in local stores mean that supermarkets need to invest more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that merchandise outlets will become more and more similar to department stores as the chain of stores attempts to fight discount stores Aldi and Lidl, offering a larger range of services, but without food.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos outlets in several hundred stores and has opened several Habitats since buying both chains two years ago, which is said to have improved merchandise sales and made the purchased more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to improve its beauty and pharmaceutical departments resulted in defeat.
The Sainsbury's joint venture with the Boots was tried in the early 2000s, but the union broke up after a dispute as to how to split the income from pharmacy goods stores into supermarkets.
The new strategy evolves after the Sainsbury's sold its 281 store large pharmaceutical business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million.
Under this plan, Lloyds will be tasked with adding a wide range of exclusive skin care products, including Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said, "To improve the environment for buyers, we transformed the appearance of our shelves of beauty products and the impression they create.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will always be prepared to make a recommendation.
The range of our brands is designed to suit all needs, but an attractive environment along with a convenient location means that now we are a delightful goal on the way to beauty, a goal that challenges current shopping habits."
Peter Jones "full of rage" after Holly Willoughby gives up a £11 million deal
"Dragons Den" star Peter Jones was "taken over by rage" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby gave up a £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to pay all his attention to his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willouby has no time to devote to their homewear and accessories brand "Truly".
The couple's business was compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow brand "Goop".
"This Morning" was used by 37-year-old broadcast host on Instagram to announce that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby has left the Dragons Den star Peter Jones in a rage as he dropped out of their lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute — to pay all his attention to his new huge contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "fulfilled with rage" when a TV gold girl during a tense meeting on Tuesday at his business empire residence in Marlow, Buckinghamshire stated that her new contracts, valued at up to 1.5 million pounds, meant she no longer had time to devote to their home costume and accessories brand "Truly".
The company was compared to the Gwyneth Platrow brand "Goop", and, according to a hint, it will double the fortunes of Willouby, which is estimated to reach £11 million.
When Willoughby (37) used Instagram to announce he was leaving "Truly", Jones took away from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
According to a source of information, "'Truly' was the most important of Holly's priorities.
This should have become her long-term future, to which the next decades would be devoted.
Her decision to withdraw surprised all those involved unprepared.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday: everything was so close to the start.
There's a warehouse in downtown Marlowe full of ready-to-sell goods."
Experts believe that this Morning manager, who is one of the most profitable stars, can be able to leave millions, because a lot of money has been invested in various products — from pillows and candles, to clothes and goods for the house, and even more delay in putting them on the market.
And that can mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children, Willoughby, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have maintained a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for 10 years.
Willouby "Truly" was formed with Kep in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman in March.
The two couples spend their holidays together, and Jones owns a 40% stake in Boldwin's TV production firm.
Willoubia is to become a messenger of the brand M&S, and she will replace Ent McPartlin as head of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones stated yesterday, "We don't want to comment on his business dealings!"
Serious conversation "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would receive from news companies about the comment that some may find "indecent to the President", and about his being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why is the president so much to give up?
Trump said in his playful voice of "a message announcer".
"I gave up nothing!"
He pointed out that Kim had shown interest in meeting one more time after Trump recognized their initial meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on denuclearisation have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, one of the main North Korean diplomats, Ri Yong Ho, informed world leaders in the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see the U.S. "response" to North Korea's initial steps towards disarmament.
Instead, he pointed out, the U.S. continues sanctions aimed at maintaining tension.
Trump was much more optimistic in his rallies speech.
"We have a great relationship with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said that what he did with the aim of improving his relationship with Kim had produced positive results — the interruption of missile testing tests, aid in the release of the captives, and the return of the remaining American soldiers home.
And he defended his unusual approach when talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's just to make a presidential impression, but instead of having 10,000 people standing out there trying to get into this closely populated area, we have 200 here," said Trump, pointing to a crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and the earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island, killing hundreds of people
Following the Lomboka earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organisations were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lomboka's population was displaced, the state of the national disaster was not declared, but it is necessary to propose foreign aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they made it very clear that they were not asking for international help, so it's a certain problem" admitted Miss Sumbung.
Although the Save the Children is collecting a group to travel to Pala, it is still unclear whether foreign workers will be allowed to work there.
A spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, Mr Sutopo, explained that Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to the aid.
Given the regular nature of the earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is still extremely unprepared for the rage of nature.
Although shelters for tsunamis have been set up in Aceh, they are rare along other shores.
It is also likely that Palu did not hear the warning sirens about the tsunami, even though the warning was effective.
Even in the most favorable times, moving between Indonesia's many islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The ship-hospital, which had anchored in Lomboka to treat earthquake victims, is now heading to Pala, but it will take at least three days to reach the victims of the new devastation.
President Joko Widodo had made the improvement of Indonesia's ruined infrastructure the central point of his election campaign, and he has given large sums to roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds has plagued Mr. Joko's administration and he is expected to be re-elected next year.
In addition, Mr. Jocko has to contend with the protracted problem of tensions between sects in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority has adopted one of the conservative forms of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands kicked out of their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other primitive weapons.
Look: Liverpool player Daniel Starige restores balance in the match against Chelsea with scope
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a loss against Chelsea in the premier league, scoring a goal in the 89th minute of Saturday's game at the Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Starige received a pass from Jerdan Shaqiri, being about 25 metres (30 yards) from the Chelsea goal when his team lost by 1:0.
He moved the ball slightly to the left of himself and then kicked the ball towards the farthest goalpost.
In this attempt, the ball flew high across the field, reaching the top right corner of the net.
The bomb eventually flew over the head of the jumped Kepa Arrizabalaga (Kepa Arrizabalaga) and fell into the net.
"I just tried to get that position to get to the ball, and players like Shaq always play as far forward as possible, so I just tried to get myself as much time as possible," Staridge explained at LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante (Kante) approaching, touched the ball, and, without thinking much, I kicked."
"Chelsea" was in the lead at half time with 1:0 after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored the words in the 25th minute.
The Blues striker played the ball back to Mateo Kovacic before cutting off at the middle of the field and dropping to the Liverpool side of the field as quickly as possible.
Kovačić quickly passed and received the ball back in the middle of the field.
He then made a beautiful kick between the players, allowing Azard to get into the area.
Azard overtook the defense at speed and completed the combination by making a kick with his left leg in a further pole net, past "Liverpool" Allison Becker.
Liverpool will fight Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will meet Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Indonesia tsunami hits 832 people
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has reached 832 people, the state disaster agency announced early on Sunday.
Many people were reported to be trapped in the rubble of buildings after the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that struck the country on Friday and caused up to 20 feet (~6.0 m) high waves, the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho informed at a news conference.
The town of Palu, with over 380,000 people, was covered by rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police suspect stabbing a woman arrests a 32-year-old man
An investigation into the murder was launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old victim was found with stitch wounds at 7:55 p.m., in Grayson Mews on John Street, and suspected murder arrested a 32-year-old man.
Police have called for people in the area who have seen or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan informed, "The investigation has just begun, but I want to invite everyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious.
I also call on every driver, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something in their car's video recorder footage, to contact us because they may have information important to our investigation."
A police spokeswoman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead, and she was found on her property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know a woman have come to a crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and as the police informed, they deal with informing the closest relatives of the victim.
The taxi driver, who lives in Graysonmouse, attempted to return to his apartment, but police replied to him that no one should enter or leave the building.
He was unable to express a word when he learned what had happened.
Citizens are told that it will be hours before they are allowed to return.
A police officer told a man that the whole neighborhood was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman in tears appeared at the crime scene.
She keeps repeating, "It's so awful!".
At two o'clock in the afternoon, there were two police vans inside the cordon, and another had been parked right next to the outside.
Several police officers were stationed inside the cordon and controlled the apartment house.
Everyone who has information is asked to use DM @MerPolCC by September 30, call 101 or contact "Crimestoppers anonymously" by phone 0800 555 111 naming 247.
Cromwell's statue in parliament becomes the latest "rewriting of history" scandal
Rejecting it would be ethically justified in the light of Taliban-like activities that resulted in the destruction of so many monuments of English culture and religion by his fanatical Puritan followers.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "foolishness" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said, "In view of the existing debate over the removal of the statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster Castle would also become the target.
Cromwell himself neither ordered nor enforced the destruction of icons during the English Civil Wars.
It is likely that the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed because of the actions of his ancestor, a century earlier resident Thomas.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent portrayal of Cromwell shows an opinion in the 19th century and is part of a historiography of a person who many believe is still worth honoring.
Mr. Goldsmith informed the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was perhaps seen by many — perhaps more than today in the late 19th century — as a defender of parliament against outside pressure, which was, of course, a monarchy in his case.
There is ongoing historical discussion as to whether this is really a completely accurate representation of the topic.
What is clear is that the conflict in the mid-17th century determined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell as such is a recognizable personality representing one of the parties to the divide of the time.
His accomplishments, being a protector of the Lords, are worth praising and mentioning."
A pig-slaughter to death tears a farmer in China
According to local media, a pig in a market in southwestern China attacked a farmer and killed him.
The man — only his surname Yuan is mentioned — was found dead by a torn artery, all in one blood at a pig shed in a market in Liupanshui in Guizhou Province, reported "South China Morning Post" on Sunday.
The pig farmer is preparing to inject vaccines to pigs on 30 May 2005 in the pig barn in Xining in Qinghai, China.
He and his cousin are reported to have arrived on Wednesday from the neighbouring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found the man dead and discovered that the adjacent pig shed door stood open.
He said that there was a large male pig in the pig barn with blood on his mouth.
According to a court medical examination confirmed that a 550-pound (~249 kg) heavy hog had torn the farmer apart.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and mutilated," the cousin told — only his surname Wu (Wu) is mentioned, written by Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera material showed Yuan entering the market at about 4.40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal who killed Yuan did not belong to either him or his cousin.
The market manager informed the Evening News that the hog was turned on to prevent its attacks on others while police were collecting evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market management are discussing compensation for his death, according to information.
Although such cases are rare, other pig attacks on humans are known.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and a man on their farm in Massachusetts, resulting in critical injuries to the man.
Another 10 years ago, a 650-pound (~295 kg) pig in Wales held the farmer forced to the tractor until the animal was terrified by his wife.
After farmers in Oregon ate his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba explained to "CBC News" that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "gun shot".
"They're just playful.
They like to get involved, they're very curious ... they don't want to harm you.
You just have to show them enough respect," he said.
The conclusion of Hurricane Rose brings extensive and powerful rain to the southwest of the United States
Orcano Rose is projected to weaken as it moves across the coldest waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flooding rains in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the next few days.
In the five afternoon (North American Eastern time), Rose's wind gusts reached 143 km/h (85 miles per hour), corresponding to a Category 1 hurricane, and its point was located 620 km (385 miles) southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low pressure depression is forming over the Pacific Ocean, moving east towards the east coast of the United States. Rose with a tropical storm force approaching the Lower California (Baja California) Peninsula, on Monday it will begin to push moisture masses deep from the tropical strip northward towards the southwest United States.
Rose will bring up to 10 inches (~25.4 cm) of rain in part of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical humidity, interacting with the approaching low pressure depression, will form a wide heavy rain zone in the southwest in the next few days.
1–4 inches (~2.6–10.2 cm) of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, mud currents and possibly landslides in the desert.
Moisture deep from the tropical strip will cause rainfall that will reach 2–3 inches (~5.1–7.6 cm) per hour in certain locations, especially parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In part of the southwest, especially most of Arizona, up to 24 inches (~5.2–10.1 cm) of rain is expected.
Sudden flooding is possible, with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the dispersal of tropical rains.
It is highly undesirable to walk on foot in the desert due to the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into rapid rivers, but thunderstorms will bring local gusty winds and sandstorms.
A low-pressure depression approaching will bring local heavy rain to part of the southern California coastline.
Rainfall is possible, which together will exceed half an inch (~1.3 cm), and this can lead to small mudflows and slippery roads.
It will be the region's first rainfall in the wet season.
Separate dispersed tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before rain will take over the wider area late on Monday and early on Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners Region on Tuesday (DR Colorado, DA Utah, NA Arizona and DR New Mexico) and will last all Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the United States, as the Arctic temperatures are falling, but the tropics are still quite warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic changes in temperature a short distance away.
This is an example of dramatic temperature differences in the central United States on Sunday.
The difference between the temperatures in Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and Saint Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, varies by nearly 20 degrees.
The next few days will try to form and expand lasting summer heat.
In much of the central and eastern United States, the beginning of October is expected to be warm, with temperatures reaching 80 and more degrees (Fahrenheit; ~27 degrees Celsius) in extensive areas from the southern plains to part of the northeast.
Temperatures in New York City could reach 80 degrees (Fahrenheit; ~27 degrees Celsius) on Tuesday, which would exceed the average by about 10 degrees.
Our long-term climate forecasts suggest a high probability that in the first half of October the temperatures in the eastern part of the United States will exceed the average.
Over 20 million people watched the hearing in the Bret Caveno case
Over 20 million people watched enthusiastically on six television channels on Thursday, according to Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Caveno of sexual harassment, which the woman claims occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, a political draw continued, with broadcasters interrupting the regular broadcast to report the latest milestone in Friday's developments: an agreement organized by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI would investigate the allegations for a week.
Ford informed the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely convinced that Caveno drunk her and tried to take off her clothes during a high school party.
Caveno testified dispassionately that he was absolutely convinced that this did not happen.
According to Nielsen, all of this was watched by 20.4 million people on Friday.
The company's CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, "Fox News Channel" and MSNBC recorded interest from middle viewers.
Data from other broadcasters, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, who demonstrated it, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has problems counting people looking at the offices.
To get a better picture, this viewership corresponds to the number of watchers of the playoffs or "Oscara" ceremony.
The Fox News Channel, whose commentators have resolutely supported Caveno's appointment, had the highest number of viewers, an average of 5.69 million during the all-day lengthy auditions, informed Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS raised 3.1 million, NBC raised 2.94 million, MSNBC raised 2.89 million, and CNN raised 2.52 million, informed Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was a central figure in Friday's drama.
After the temperate Republican team had published a statement that he would vote for Caveno's appointment, the senator was spotted by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, when he, accompanied by the protesters' outcry cry, tried to get with the elevator to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
On the live CNN, he stood for several minutes stabbed eyes, as barred.
"I'm standing here, right in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told that "you possess power while so many women are powerless."
Flake explained that his team had made a statement, and before the elevator door closed, he was informed that he still had something to say during the committee hearing.
Cable networks and broadcasters reflected what was going on live several hours later when the Judiciary Committee was going to vote for Caveno's nomination to vote in the Senate.
Flake, however, claimed that he would only do so if he knew that the FBI would look at the charges brought against the candidate next week, which a minority of Democrats have requested.
Flake was partially persuaded by conversations with his friend Democrat Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Koons and several more Senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was significant because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes for Caveno's approval without an investigation.
President Trump has instructed the FBI to conduct an investigation into the charges against Cavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of political games on Brexit's account
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused people who criticized her plan to withdraw from the European Union of "political games" with Britain's future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, 29 September 2018.
In another interview, right next to an interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, Meja's former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, continues to attack her Brexit plan on Britain's future relations with the European Union, the so-called "Chequers plan", stressing that the suggestion that Britain and the EU use each other's tariffs is "completely absurd".
Shooting Wade Sims: Police have arrested Diteon Simpson suspected of murdering an LSU player
Police have arrested the suspect for shooting Wade Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and arrested as an accused of second-degree murder, informed Baton Rouge police station.
Officials released a video showing Sims' clash with Simpson, and police mentioned that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
CBS subsidiary WAFB reports that police found the glasses at the crime scene and Simpson's blood has been found on them.
Following Simpson's questioning, police informed that he had admitted to shooting Wade.
According to the lawyer, he was given $350,000 in bail.
A team of East Baton Rouge Parish forensic expert released an interim conclusion on Friday, citing that the death was caused by a shot in the head that struck the neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police refugee search operational group, the State Police Forensic Laboratory, Southern University Police, and residents of the area for assisting with the investigation that resulted in the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the area's law enforcement officers for their "effort and work in the name of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6 feet 6 inches (~1.98 m) long striker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
In the final season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade announced that the team was "shocked" and "shocked" about Wade's death.
"That's what a man worries about always," Wade said.
The volcano spits ash across Mexico City
Ash rising from the Pocatepetl volcano has reached the southern vicinity of the Mexican capital.
After activity was observed in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours, the National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday that they should not approach the volcano.
The center observed multiple ducing and trembling.
Images on social networks showed that car windshields around Mexico City, such as Hochimilco, were covered with a thin layer of ash.
Geophysicists have noticed the activation of a volcano located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake rocked central Mexico in 2017.
The volcano, also known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police conflict with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after a clash of pro-independence protesters with public order police and when thousands joined opposing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote for secession.
A group of masked proponents of the separation, hampered by public order police, pelted them with eggs and melted powder paint, forming dark dust clouds on streets that would usually be full of tourists.
The disagreements broke out later that day, and police officers used batons to prevent fighting.
For several hours groups of independence supporters, chanting, "Don't forget and forgive!", were involved in a confrontation with pro-unity protesters who chanted, "Long life for Spain!"
According to local newspapers, fourteen people were given medical treatment during the protests due to minor injuries.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid found illegal, but which was lauded by the Catalans, the thought of independence in the area remains under great tension.
Voters spoke overwhelmingly of independence, although voter turnout was low, and those who were opposed to secession mostly boycotted voting.
According to Catalan officials, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to stop voting at polling points across the region, and cruel clashes erupted.
The pro-independence groups had been on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the state police.
The demonstration took place, but the demonstrators were forced to choose a different route.
Narcissus Teremez (Narcis Termes), a 68-year-old electrician who participated with his wife in the separatist protest, admitted that he no longer hoped Catalonia would gain independence.
"Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents' eyes filled with tears of joy that they were allowed to vote, but now everything has stopped," he said.
Although the parties that support Catalonia's independence won last year's regional elections with a small but significant lead, these parties have struggled to keep moving this year, as several of the best-known leaders have either emigrated or have been arrested and await justice for their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
42-year-old mechanic Hoan Puig, who filmed on the phone in support of the protest police, said the conflict had been fueled by politicians on both sides.
"The tension is getting bigger," he said.
On Saturday, one of the nine Catalan leaders, Uriol Junqueras, who has been in custody until the court since the previous year, announced that he would stand for election to the European Parliament the following year.
"Candidating in the European elections is the best way to expose the regression of democratic values and repression that the Spanish government has targeted us," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after crashing a car into a building
Three men (33, 34 and 39 years old) were arrested after the car was hit repeatedly against a building in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Balinagard Krescent on Thursday at about 19.30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings informed that the gate and the building itself were damaged.
It is possible that an arballet was fired at the car at the same time.
Menga's blow allows Livingston to win the Rangers 1-0
Dolly Menga's first goal secured a "Livingston" victory
Supported Livingston stunned the Rangers, bringing Steven Gerrard his second loss in 18 games played as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Meng's blow proved decisive as Gary Holt's team leveled the situation with the Hibernian.
Gerard's team has not won guest this championship season, and next Sunday they have to meet the leader, the Hearts, of whom they are eight points behind.
Prior to that, the European League hosted the Vienna Rapid on Thursday by the Rangers.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended its series without loss in the division to six games, and head coach Holt has still not felt the taste of defeat since replacing Kenny Miller the previous month.
Livingston doesn't take an opportunity against the dull guests
Holt's team with their direct game, which made it difficult for the Rangers in a wide variety of ways, should have been in the lead long before they got the words.
Scott Robinson broke out, but delayed his attempt in front of the goal, then Alan Lithgow's attempt after slipping into his legs to delay Craig Halkett's kick with his head across the goal line was unsuccessful.
The hosts allowed the Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they would be able to stop the guests at the planned locations.
And that's exactly how the crucial gate came.
The Rangers allowed a free kick, and Livingston used the corridor, Declan Galager (Declan Gallagher) and Robinson teamed up to provide an opportunity for Meng, who kicked and scored goals from the middle of the zone.
At this stage, the Rangers managed the ball, but the protection of the guests proved impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not particularly disturbed by anyone.
This continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos ordered Kelly to save the goal.
Scott Pitman's attempt was interrupted by the Rangers' goalkeeper Alan McGregor's dexterity, and Litgov threw past the goal in the Livingston combination.
Centered bombs continued to appear in the Livingston area, but two calls for a penalty — after Halkett fought for the ball with substitute Glenn Middleton and for playing by hand — were rejected.
"Fenomenal" "Livingston" performance – analysis
Scottish BBC Alsdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and score of Livingston.
Each one of them was excellent, continuing to beat expectations by steadily improving performance.
Their playing style and personalities have practically not changed since returning to the higher echelon, but much praise has been deserved by Holt for the way he has brought the team together since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great at maintaining first-rate organized defences, while Menga made sure that Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall always remained vigilant.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
No matter how good they were at times under Gerard's command, they were far from these standards.
Their last ball was boring — only once did they break into the part of the hosts' field — and it is essentially a call to awaken "The Rangers who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan in Cologne is greeted with shared feelings
On Saturday (29 September), when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin, there were many smiles and blue skies.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have disagreements on various issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new gigantic mosque.
The town is home to the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
Police, citing security as a reason, blocked a crowd of 25,000 people, preventing them from gathering in front of the mosque, but many of the supporters came nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan — much of them Kurds — also made their attitude known, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to take him to himself.
The protests between the two sides reflect the contradictions that a guest has created, which some German Turks regard as a hero, while others despise as an autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist died in a collision with a car in London.
The collision occurred at the intersection of Bestwood Street with Evelyn Street, on a road section with intensive traffic in Deptford, southeast of the city, at about 10.15 a.m. BST.
The driver stopped, but the man died at the scene.
The collision took place several months after another cyclist died on Childers Street, about a mile from the Sunday collision site. At the time, the driver left the collision site.
The Capital Police Service stated that police officers were involved in identifying the man and informing their loved ones.
Roads have been closed and buses diverted at the scene, but car drivers have been advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Employees Injured During Troubles
The Prisons Authority (Prison Office) reports that six prison employees were injured in disorder in a men's strict regime prison.
The disorder broke out at HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire at about 9.30 a.m. BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
In order to prevent disorder involving eight prisoners who are enclosed in a single wing, special service "Tornado" staff were involved
Employees were treated for mild facial injuries at the scene.
A prison service spokesman stated, "In order to resolve the incident at the HMP Long Lartin prison, specially trained prison personnel were involved.
Six staff members were given medical attention due to injuries.
We will not accept violence in our prisons and say clearly that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend more time behind bars".
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates in prison, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison chief was treated in hospital after the prisoner's attack.
And in October last year, officials responsible for controlling the rebellion were sent to prison to resolve serious riots in which staff had been attacked with billiard bombs.
Orcán Rosa Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City are threatened with sudden flooding (the situation is likely to benefit drought-stricken areas)
Arizona suffers rarely from tropical depression, but this is what is likely to happen early next week, when Hurricane Rose with the remaining force will advance across the deserted southwest, posing a sudden flood risk.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning of sudden flooding on Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rose is expected to move right across Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving with the rain late on Monday.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix indicated on Twitter entry that since 1950, only "ten tropical cyclones maintained tropical storm or depression status within a 200-mile (320 km) radius of Phoenix!
Catherine (in 1967) was an orcant 40 miles (65 km) from the borders of AZ."
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 2–4 inches (~5.08–10.2 cm) of rain, reaching as much as 6 inches (15.24 cm) in certain locations.
Other areas of the desert southwest, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, will probably receive 1–2 inches (~2.54–5.08 cm), reaching as much as 4 inches (~10.2 cm) in certain places.
For those who are not at risk of a sudden flood, the rain of Rose may become a blessing as the region has been struck by drought.
Although the possibility of flooding is of very serious concern, some of the rainfall is likely to be beneficial, as the southwest is currently suffering from drought.
According to the U.S. drought control (Drought Monitor), just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, reported weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rose Road leads to Lower California, Baja California, in Mexico, where it will reach shore.
Rosa is still with the force of hurricane on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 85 miles (137 km) per hour, located about 385 miles (~620 km) south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moving north at a speed of 12 miles (19 km) per hour.
The storm encounters cooler Pacific waters and therefore subsides.
Therefore, the hurricane is expected to reach the coast in Mexico Monday afternoon or morning with a tropical storm force.
Rainfall in parts of Mexico can be severe, posing a significant risk of flooding.
"The rainfall is expected to reach 3–6 inches (7.62–15.24 cm) from Lower California inside southwestern Sonora, precipitation likely reaching 10 inches (25.4 cm)," reported weather.com.
Rose will advance north, across Mexico as a tropical storm and then reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then advance across Arizona and end up in southern Utah on Tuesday late evening.
"The main threat expected from Rose or its remains is very heavy rainfall in Lower California, northwestern Sonora, and the deserted southwest of the United States," the National Center of Orcans told.
This rain is expected to cause life-threatening flash floods and mudflows in deserts, and landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack on Midsommer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested suspected of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy with stitch wounds was found in Somerset.
The injured teenager was found in Excelsior Terrace in the area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at about 4 p.m. BST.
He was taken to a hospital where his condition remains "stable".
Police informed that a 17-year-old and two 18-year-old teenagers, as well as a 20-year-old man, were arrested overnight, in Redstock Territory, Aivon and Somerset.
Police officers have called on anyone who might have mobile phone material at their disposal about what happened.
Trump claims that Caveno has suffered "evil and anger" from the Democrat Party
"The vote for Judge Caveno is a vote to reject the Democrat Party's ruthless and violent tactics," Trump stated at a meeting in Wheeling, Western Virginia.
Trump emphasized that Caveno had suffered from the Democrat Party's "evil and anger" throughout his nomination process.
Caveno testified before Congress, where he vigorously and emotionally denied any charges of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford several decades ago, when both were teenagers.
Ford also testified in the course of the hearing on his charges.
The president announced on Saturday that that day, "the American people saw" Caveno's "excellence, ability and courage."
"The vote for the approval of Judge Caveno is a vote to endorse one of the most educated lawyers of our time with a brilliant history in connection with serving the people," he stated to a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
President Caveno mentioned the nomination in a ludicrous manner, talking about the importance of Republican turnout in the interim elections.
"Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
I didn't stand, but in fact I stood," he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere fighting for great candidates."
Trump objected that the Democrats had undertaken the mission of "protesting and resisting".
The first of the important procedural votes in the Senate for Caveno's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, CNN informed the senior assistant leadership of the Republican Party.
Hundreds of people killed in an earthquake in Indonesia, and it is clear that the number of victims is increasing
Officials informed Saturday that at least 384 people were killed, many simply washed away when gigantic waves hit the coast after a strong earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
On Friday, hundreds of people had gathered for a festival in the city of Palu on the beach when waves up to six metres (18 ft) high hit the coast in a chair, washing many away into death and destroying everything that was in their way.
The tsunami broke out after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people still operated on the beach and did not flee immediately, and they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indian disaster relief agency, informed the briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not arrive alone, it brought cars, logs and buildings, it smashed everything that was on the ground," Nugoro said, adding that the tsunami, before hitting the coast, had crossed the sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph).
"Many people crawled into trees to escape and survived," he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Photographs taken in flight by the Disaster Agency show many destroyed houses and shops, deformed and collapsed bridges, and a water-enveloped mosque.
Aftershocks in the coastal town continued to tremble on Saturday.
The earthquake series was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
In a statement, the Indonesian Technology Evaluation and Application Agency BPPT emphasized that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquakes was about 200 times the energy of a nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The location of the town at the end of a long, narrow bay may have reinforced the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "wide", and informed that thousands of homes, hospitals, shops, and hotels had collapsed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho acknowledged that the number of casualties and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Dongala (Dongala), which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
"Communications "were completely ruined, no information was received from Dongal," Nugroho informed.
More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross informed in a statement, adding that its personnel and volunteers travel to the affected regions.
"Already it's a tragedy, but everything could have been even worse," the organization informed.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not informing that the tsunami had struck Pala, although officials claimed that the waves arrived at the time of the warning.
A video distributed on social networks can be heard that a man on the top floor of the building desperately calls people on the bottom of the street that a tsunami is coming.
Within minutes, the water wall hits the shore, washing away buildings and machines.
The Reuters news agency was unable to confirm immediately whether the material was real.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a serious loss of power supply that unlocked communications in Pala, making it difficult for officials to coordinate rescue efforts.
Officials stated that the army had begun sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still need much food and other essential goods.
The city airport is only open to relief measures and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesian tsunami casualties exceed 800.
That's really bad.
Mr Doseba told us that the employees of World Vision, who successfully reached the city of Palu from Donggal, and now live in tarpaulin sheds in the backyard of the office, passed the devastation scenes on the way.
"They told us they saw a lot of buildings that had been destroyed," he explained.
That's really bad.
Even when aid groups have made a determined start in organising relief efforts for disaster victims, some complained that foreign aid workers were not allowed to travel to Pala with much experience.
According to Indonesian law, funding, resources and personnel of overseas organisations will only be allowed to arrive if the disaster area is declared as a national disaster area.
This has not yet happened.
"It's still a provincial-level disaster," said Indonesian Red Cross spokeswoman Aulia Arriani.
"When the government announces, "OK, it's a national disaster," we will be able to accept international aid, but that status has not yet been established."
When Palu came the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family members of the still unearthed people continued to hope that their loved ones would become miracles that brighten the gloomy lives of natural disasters.
A small boy was pulled from the gutter on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been printed under the rubble for two days, next to her mother's corpse.
Gendon Subandono (Gendon Subandono), coach of the Indonesian national paragliders team, had been preparing two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games held this month earlier in Indonesia.
Others of those trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including, Mr. Mandagi, were their students.
"As an experienced paraglider," he said, "I am taught by the burden of emotion.".
Mr. Gendon recalled that after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel spread to the paraglider team, he desperately sent WhatsApp reports to Palu contestants who participated in the beach festival for hours.
However, the result of his reports was only one grey mark, not two blue marks.
"Thinking, that means the messages did not reach the addressee," he said.
Thieves kidnap $26,750 during ATM refilling at Newport on the Levee complex
According to a statement by the Newport Police Department, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee on Friday morning, who charged an ATM at the Newport on the Levee complex.
"The driver of the car emptied the ATM of the entertainment complex and had prepared to fill it with more money," Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While the manager was busy, another person "from behind ran into a Brink's employee" and stole a bag of banker money.
According to a press release, the witnesses noticed a number of suspicious persons leaving the crime scene, but police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his name to Je
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye (Je).
Announcing the replacement on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, "Būtne, who previously knew as Kanji Vest."
The 41-year-old West had been called Je for some time, and used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, published in June ("Ye").
This change takes place before his appearance on the show "Conturday Night Live," in which, as expected, he will release his new album "Yandhi".
The show's creators tell that he replaces singer Ariana Grande in the show, who stopped working for "emotional causes".
West has told us that it is not only an abbreviation of his current professional name, but it also has religious significance.
"I believe that 'Ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'You'," West explained earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with the radio show host Big Boy (Big Boi).
"So I'm you, I'm us, that's us.
At first there was Kanye, which means "only one, followed by "Ye", which is a reflection on the good and the bad in us, on our confusion, on everything.
The album is more of a reflection on who we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs, known so far as both Puff Daddy and P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he stated that he preferred the words Love (Love) and Brother Love (Love's brother).
JAY-Z, who had previously collaborated with West, also has and has not used the sign of thought and capital letters.
The President-elect of Mexico promises not to use the army against the civilian population
The elected President of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has promised never to use military force against civilians at a time when the 50th anniversary of the bloody repayment to students is approaching.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday "Tlatelolco Plaza" to "never use an army to suppress the Mexican people."
Army units fired a peaceful demonstration on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when leftist student movements spread throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to support young Mexicans by issuing subsidies to students each month and opening more public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drag young people into gangs of criminals.
The US should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in this field, explains investor and artificial intelligence practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various U.S. government bodies have made statements about artificial intelligence, although the U.S. generally lacks a strategy in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China launched its plan last year: it aims to become a key state in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"A double budget for artificial intelligence research will be a good start given that all other countries are so backwards in the United States, and the next cardinal turn in the field of artificial intelligence is expected," said Lee.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said that doubling funding could double the likelihood that the next achievement in the field of artificial intelligence would take place in the United States.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, the CEO of Innovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the most prominent artificial intelligence companies in China's Face++.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie Mellon (Karnegi-Melon), he worked to create an artificial intelligence system that would beat America's best Othello (Reversi ) player, but later he was a leading member of Microsoft Research and president of the Google's Chinese branch.
Lee recognized previous technology competitions organized by the U.S. government, such as "Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge" and asked when the next one would be prepared to identify people with ideas for the future".
"Scientists in the U.S. often have to work very hard to get government grants", pictured Lee.
"It is not China that lure leading scientists, but big companies," he explained.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university luminaries to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee added that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States improve its achievements in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe green cards should be automatically awarded to people with a doctorate of philosophy in the field of artificial intelligence," he said.
The State Council of China published its next generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
Lee explained that China's National Foundation of Natural Sciences provides funding for people in academic institutions, similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations allocate money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense (U.S. Defense Department) founded a single joint artificial intelligence center, which is to bring together partners from industry and academia, and White House announced the formation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA (the U.S. Ministry of Defence's Central Research and Development Organization) announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called "AI Next".
The National Science Foundation, on the other hand, currently invests over $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation, tasked with setting up the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has been in operation for several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing country's name
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the name of the country to "Republic of North Macedonia", taking a step that will prevent decades of disagreement with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's requests to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, emphasizes that the name of its northern neighbour suggests claims to its territory, and has vetoed Macedonia's admission to NATO and the EU.
The two governments entered into an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalists in opposition insist that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the referendum, and the campaign with a call for boycott has raised concerns whether voter turnout will reach at least 50% required for the referendum to be declared valid.
The referendum bulletin asks, "Are you in favour of membership of NATO and the EU through an agreement with Greece."
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying on the way to Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the break-up of Yugoslavia, becoming an organization such as an EU and a NATO member.
"I have come to vote for the future of the country, for Macedonian youth, so that they can live freely, under the guise of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have stated that they will take into account the outcome of the vote, which will become decisive.
It will take a 2/3 majority in parliament to change the name.
The state electoral commission informed that no violations had been reported by 1 p.m. in the afternoon.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the previous parliamentary election, which saw 66 percent of registered voters vote.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said 62-year-old Josie Tanevski, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, his wife Zorica (Zorica) and their son Dushko put their votes in a referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name, which will open the way to NATO and the European Union, to Strumica (Strumica) in Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old in Skopje, prepared a small stage in front of the House and arranged chairs at the tents that had been put on by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to stand with our heads raised, not through the door of our servants," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a small country, but we have self-respect.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China or Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zayev claims that NATO membership will start the necessary investments in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate exceeds 20 percent.
"I believe most will cast a vote for, because more than 80" percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," said Zayev after the voice was cast.
He said the result "yes" will "confirm our future".
A poll published last Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research shows that 30-43 percent of voters — less than the required turnout — will participate in the referendum.
Another poll conducted by Macedonia's 'Telma TV' found that 57 percent of voters were planning to participate in the Sunday vote.
70 percent of them replied that they would vote in favour.
For a referendum to be successful, turnout must be 50 percent and another vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the West-oriented government to come to power last May.
Look: Manchester "City" Sergio Aguero plunders through the whole Brighton defense to score a goal
Serhio Agvero and Raheem Sterling defeated the Brighton defense allowing Manchester City to win at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England by 2:0 on Saturday.
Agvero gave the impression that his goal in the 65th minute was ridiculously light.
The Argentinian striker received a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the combination.
He ran out between the three Brighton guards, and pitched inside the free field.
Then Agvero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He bypassed the ball for one guard, then overtook several more in the run at the edge of the Brighton field.
He then made a pass to the left, reaching Sterling.
The English center striker used his first touch to pass back Agvero, who put the right football boot in use to defeat Matthew Ryan, goalkeeper of Brigton, hitting the ball on the right side of the net.
"Agvero is struggling with foot problems," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"He and I discussed playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's exactly what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the time.
However, it was Sterling who provided the Sky Blues with an initial advantage in Premier League wrestling.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Agvero received the ball deep into the Brighton area in that play.
He sent the ball with a beautiful kick along the eggs of Leroy Sane's left leg.
Sane made several kicks until he entrusted Sterling to bring the ball to the further goalpost.
The downtown forward of the Sky Blues lightly raided the bomb into the net just before crossing the border.
"City" fights Hoffenheim Champions League Group will be played Tuesday at 12.55 p.m. Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Zinshaima, Germany.
Shercer wants to cause problems for the Rockies
As the Nationals did not participate in the playoffs, there was no reason to reopen yet.
But Scherzer, who is always ready to compete, hopes to take an opportunity on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies are in actual playoffs. And the Rockies in the National League Western Group are leading with one game against the Los Angeles Dodgers.
The Rockies have squeezed at least a white card with Friday night at 5:2 winning the Nationals, but have still not won their first title in the division.
"Although we play the same way, we will at least be able to have fun, knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver, with the crowd and the other team, will probably be the most annoying one I'll face this year.
And why wouldn't I then want to compete?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who will start the game on Sunday, but are said to be ready to let Shercer make the pitch.
Shercer, for whom it will be the 34th beginning, made a pitch session on Thursday on the "bullpen" part of the outfield, and will throw the ball at the usual time of rest on Sunday.
The Washington righthand is 18−7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikers 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds rallies in West Virginia
The President mentioned the situation in which his choice of Supreme Court candidate Brett Caveno has entered, while speaking about the importance of Republican voter turnout in the interim election.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
It's really very, very serious — I didn't stand, but in fact I stood as a candidate, and that's why I'm everywhere and fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say, "You see this horrific, horrific group of Democrats radicals acting right now.
And they are determined to regain power by using all possible means to achieve the goal. You see the evil, the disgusting act.
They don't care what they're gonna injure, who they have to trespass to gain power and control, that's why they want to gain power and control, and we won't give it to them."
Democrats, he said, have undertaken the mission of "protesting and resisting".
"And you have seen it yourself in the last four days," he stressed, calling the Democrats "ridiculous, evil, nasty and false."
He named Diane Feinstein, Senator of the Democrat Party of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to which viewers responded with loud exclaims.
"Do you remember her response?
Did you leak the document?
Hmm, what's this about?
No, hmm, wait — it was really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer ready for diversity.
It is intolerant of the revealed
It was no wonder that Momentum activists in my local party wanted to bring me under censorship.
After all, I'm the last Labour Party MP to date in a row who was informed that he was not desirable — all of this because we don't hide our opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was similarly overturned because she resolutely opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the movement criticised me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn for censorship.
It was ironic about the importance of economically responsible policies, about national security, about Europe, but these were issues where Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the Labour meeting in the eastern part of Nottingham on Friday says that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Most of the meetings that took place during the career of eight of my local Labour MPs were exactly that.
Unfortunately, in many meetings today, the atmosphere is different and promises of a "kinder, more lenient" policy have long been forgotten, if ever.
It has become increasingly clear that the Labour Party does not want to tolerate different views, and any view is judged depending on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
It started soon after Jeremy became the leader: colleagues I think our political views were similar to began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and accept opinions that I would never have agreed to in other cases — whether it is national security or a single EU market.
When I speak publicly — and it doesn't really matter what I'm saying — there is a tirade about using on social networks, calling for a ban on standing in the next election, exposing the center's policies, claiming that I have no seat in the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments against me are usually political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a stream of sexist and racist insults every day, but never try to quietly avoid.
One of the most unsatisfactory aspects of this political era is how normal exploitation has become.
Jeremy Corbin announced last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer an organization ready for diversity of opinion and, with every expression of distrust or change in the rules of selection, the party is narrowing.
Over the past two years, I have often been given advice, inviting me not to jump on harrows, to think what I am talking about, and then to me "everything will be fine".
But that's not why I decided to get involved in politics.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a student in response to the negligence of the Thatcher government, which had literally led my integrated school class to collapse, I set the task of fighting for better public services for those most in need — both in the role of a local councillor and government minister.
I have never concealed my political views, nor in previous elections.
No one in the East of Nottingham had any reason to doubt my position on policy issues, and in areas where I disagreed with the existing government.
For those who moved the proposal on Friday, I can only say that at a moment when the country is moving decisively towards Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand such a desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But basically the only thing I want to announce is not for Nottingham's Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they're Labour members: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise you that no threat of disqualification or reminders that no one is indispensable in politics will stop me from doing what I think is best for all of you.

"Ayr" 38 - 17 "Melrose": The undefeated "Ayr" reaches the highest line in the table
The last two attempts probably split the final score to some extent, but there is no doubt that "Ayr" deserves to triumph in this amazingly exciting Scottish Championship match today.
Now they're at the top of the table, the only unbeaten team out of ten.
After all, it was both their excellent defense and the much better use of the opportunities that drove the hosts, and coach Peter Murchie has every reason to be satisfied.
"We have tested in all our games and we are still not defeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
"Melrose" Robin Christie: "All due respect to Ayr, they took their chances better than we do."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, which was realized by Frazier Climo, raised "Ayr", but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, where the Warriors had been awarded to the game, changed the numbers for the Melrose, and Jason Baggot grabbed an unrealized ball.
Klimo increased Ayr's lead with a penalty, right at the end of half time, he scored, then realized a solo try, hence Ayr went 17-5 in the break.
But Melrose started half time with a good game, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which Begot realized, reduced the gap to 5 points.
Then there was a lasting break as Ruaridh Knott suffered a severe injury and was brought to the stretchers away from the field, but when the game resumed at Ayr quickly advanced when Stafford McDowall made a try, which was realized by Climo.
Ayr's existing captain, Blair Macpherson, then received a yellow card, and once again, after intense pressure, Melrose used a redundant player — with an attempt by Bruce Colvine that was not realized.
However, the hosts fraught, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for breaking Klimo without a ball, from the penalty corridor, McPherson made a tachdaun in the back of the Ayr jetty.
Climo realized the ball, as before, almost from reopening itself after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong's kick in the field and sent flanking player Gregor Henry into the hosts' fifth attempt.
Still Game star seems to be planning a new career in restaurant business
Ford Kieran, star of the comedy series Still Game, seems to be planning to enter the hospitality business as it emerged that he had been named as a director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show he is making and starring with his ancient partner in comedies Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the next ninth season will be the show's last, and Kürnan is apparently planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official information, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although the Scottish Sun source indicated that Kürnan planned to enter Glasgow's "swinging restaurant business".
"The sea belongs to us!": Bolivia trapped in dry land hopes that the court will open its way to the Pacific Ocean
The sailors patrol around the outfitted Fleet Staff in La Paz.
Public buildings have raised ocean blue flags.
Fleet base ships from Lake Titicaca, to the Amazon are embellished with the motto: "We have the right to sea.
It is our duty to recover it."
In the dry land of Bolivia, the memory of Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century of the lost coastline is still alive, as is the longing to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
These expectations are probably the highest since decades, as Bolivia has been awaiting the judgment of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of consideration.
"Bolivia is developing, it is united and peaceful in its spirit, and of course with positive thoughts awaits the outcome," stated Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will watch the ruling of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country, in the hope that the tribunal in The Hague will decide in favour of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent negotiations, Chile is obliged to discuss granting a sovereign exit to the sea to Bolivia.
Bolivia's charismatic president of local origin, Evo Morales, who is awaiting a controversial fight for re-election next year, is also very interested in Monday's verdict.
"We are close to reclaiming the Pacific," he thrilled at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that a court ruling in favor of Bolivia is unlikely, and if one is passed, no major change is expected.
The Dutch-based UN body does not have the authority to grant Chilean territory and its representatives have expressed that they will not determine the possible outcome of the negotiations.
The fact that the ruling of the International Court of Justice is passed only six months after final examination shows that the case was "not complicated", explained the international normative expert Paz Zárate from Chile.
And the last four years have not moved the Bolivian case forward, but, on the contrary, delayed it.
"The question of access to the sea has been misappropriated by the existing Bolivian administration," Zarate stated.
Morales' militant rhetoric has stifled the remaining goodwill in the Chileans, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will once continue negotiations, but after this it will be very difficult to hold a discussion.
The two countries have not exchanged envoys since 1962.
Bolivian spokesman in The Hague, former president Edwardo Rodríguez Veltzé, disagreed that the court made the decision unusually quickly.
Monday will bring Bolivia an "extraordinary opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "put an end to the 139-year-long conflicts from which both sides will benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales — still one of Latin America's most popular presidents — used marine problems as political cops.
"Bolivia will never waive its right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"This decision is an opportunity to realize what needs to be done to overcome the past."
North Korea will only give up nuclear weapons when it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho, said that his people would never first eliminate their nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to live up to the promises made during the meeting of the leaders of the two countries in Singapore.
His comments came at a time when the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears ready to resume the stale diplomatic efforts to prevent nuclear war, more than three months after Singapore's meeting with North Korean leader Kim Chenun.
Ri claims that they are "fantasies" to hope that the U.S. still uncancelled sanctions and unwillingness to declare the end of the Korean War will ever cause North Korea to kneel.
Washington is cautious about agreeing to the declaration before Pyongyang will take substantial disarmament measures.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
However, many are skeptical about whether Pyongyang really wants to give up the armament, which the state probably regards as the only way to guarantee its own safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare Kim's next meeting with Trump.
Paris Fashion Show presents the latest massive headband line on the way to High Street
If you want to increase your hat collection or block the sun completely, then you are in the right place.
Designers Valentino and Tom Browne introduced viewers with a row of absurd, huge head-to-head items in the 2019 spring/summer season collection that dazzled against the backdrop of the Paris Fashion Week's set style.
Explicitly impractical hats have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their stunning achievements to showcase fashion.
Valentino's greatest product was a magnificent beige hat decorated with a feather-like wide edge that devoured the heads.
The massive accessories included gem-covered watermelons, a magic hat, and even pineapple — but they are not designed to keep your heads warm.
Tom Brown also showed a strange selection of masks — just in time before Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips, and were more appropriate to Hannibal Lecter than to the high fashion.
One of the formations resembled a breathing wit for diving, with a tube and glasses, while another resembled a cone of melted ice cream.
And if you want to go on with massive fashion, then the time is right.
Style watchers believe that huge aubs are probably on the way to High Street, which is closest to you.
The large size hats immediately became popular after "La Bomba" appeared – straw hats with two feet (~60 cm) wide edges appear to have worn all, from Rianna, to Emily Ratajkowski.
The status of very impractical hats as a subject of worship on all social networks led to another big addition on the tongue — a straw beach bag, almost as big as the swimsuit-suited model that carried it.
A reddish-yellow raffia bag, dressed with raffia fringes and equipped with a white leather handle took a special place in "Jacquemus' La Riviera"'s 2019 spring/summer season collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage explained to FEMAIL: "I expect large hats and beach bags to appear in central business street stores next summer because the designer has left so much impression that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for huge-sized accessories."
John Edwards: Language skills are vital for the citizens of the world
Scottish independent schools have a reputation for excellence in educational institutions and have maintained it in 2018 when they once again obtained excellent exam results, which are further enhanced by individual and collective achievements in sport, art music and other community events.
These schools, with a total of 30,000 students in Scotland and represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best level for their students and their parents.
Independent schools have set the goal of preparing their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their lives as world citizens.
As an education sector that can develop and implement special school programmes, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable subject in our schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it remains in his consciousness.
If you speak his mother tongue, it remains in his heart."
It is a strong reminder that we cannot simply rely on English when we want to build relationships and gain the trust of people from other countries.
Given the recent results of this year's exams, we can see that the languages are at the top of the league tables with the largest number of exams passed in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who taught foreign languages reached the highest mark in A.
The Scottish Council of Independent Schools data for 74 schools show that 72 percent of the students got the highest mark in A Chinese, and the same mark came for 72 percent who learned German, 69 percent who learned French, and 63 percent who learned Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Now languages, as a matter of choice, are valued as highly as science-technology-engineering and mathematics group subjects in independent school programs.
A 2014 survey by the Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 percent of employers cited a lack of language skills as a reason for failing to fill vacancies.
As a result, language skills are increasingly becoming compulsory to prepare young people for their future careers.
As job opportunities increase, which will require language skills, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of their chosen career, learning a foreign language will bring them a real advantage in the future from such long-term skills.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically improve the competitiveness of a multi-lingual speaker.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in Britain, 75 percent did not know a foreign language well enough to maintain conversation, while French was the only one spoken by a double-digit number of people, 15 percent.
That is why investing in language teaching is important for children today.
A number of languages, especially the languages of developing countries, will provide children with a better chance of meaningful work.
Schools in Scotland differ in terms of taught languages.
Some schools will focus more on the most common modern languages, while others will teach languages such as Chinese and Japanese, which are considered the most important for Britain for the future, according to plans for 2020.
Whatever your child is interested in, independent schools will always be able to choose from several languages and teachers will be specialists in the field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a language environment that will prepare children and provide them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future may be.
At the moment, in the global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still vital for the future of the country, so this fact must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be regarded as "transnational communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer Scottish youth this choice, diversity and excellence.
Il faut bien le faire (It must be done).

Lebron will make his debut for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Fans have finally welcomed the moment when Lebron's first game as part of the Los Angeles Lakers will take place.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Sunday in the preseason opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it remains to be decided exactly how many minutes he will play.
"It will be more than one but less than 48," Walton informed the Lakers on the official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell (Mayk Trudell) recorded on Twitter that James was likely to play a limited number of minutes.
Continuing the practice started this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' series of six preseason games.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season games to prepare", he said.
Trump rallies in West Virginia time, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching a series of rallies today in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five scheduled rallies by Trump the following week, including stops at friendly locations, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the vote on his choice to fill a vacant seat in the Supreme Court has been suspended, Trump's goal is to gain support in the upcoming interim election, as there is a risk that Republicans will lose control of Congress after the vote is cast in November.
What time will Trump's rally in West Virginia be held today and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rallies in Wheeling, West Virginia are scheduled for seven o'clock in the evening, after ET today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rallies in West Virginia online on YouTube.
Trump is likely to talk about this week's hearing on Supreme Court candidate Brett Caveno's case, which has been made tense by allegations of sex crimes, and a Senate vote is expected to postpone confirmation for a week while the FBI will conduct an investigation.
However, the main purpose of this rallies is to help improve the situation for the Republicans expected by the elections in November.
Consequently, President Trump's campaign shows that the task of these next week's five rallies is to "activate volunteers and supporters while Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority they own in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congressional control of his agenda is so important that the president will visit the state as much as possible because we are starting an active campaign season," a Trump campaign spokesman, who did not want to reveal his name, told Reuters.
This evening's rallies, which are planned for "Wesbanco Arena" in Wheeling will probably attract supporters from "Ohaijo and Pennsylvania, and will be reflected in the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, a state he won with over 40 percent in 2016.
Trump tries to help West Virginia Senator candidate Patrick Morrisey, who lags behind according to the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president must come in to help improve his results in the polls," according to Reuters stated Simon Haeder, professor of political science at the University of West Virginia.
Raiders Cup 2018: US has demonstrated determination to fight to keep high hopes for Sunday singles
After three sessions in "single words" the Wednesday afternoon game's "foursome" format was probably exactly what was needed for this Ryder Cup.
Athletes love to talk about the fluctuations of success, and they really believe that, especially in competitions like these.
So, on which side do they think luck is now?
"They were in the lead with six points, but now with four, so I think that means in a way that luck has turned to us," said Jordan Spieth as he went his course.
Europe, of course, has a priority because it is leading with 4 points, but 12 more will be played out.
Spite explained that the Americans believe that the wind blows in their sails and they have reason for optimism, of course, also in the person of Spite and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each of them can be proud of three points out of four.
Spite has been destructive from the first hit spot, to the lawn, and is an example of the winner.
Those gutular victories became increasingly loud as his round continued, a decisive kick in the pit was made to reach the same number four times when he and Thomas had fallen behind by two beats after two.
His kick in the pit, which achieved their victory in 15, was perceived by a similar cry, from them, for his belief that the American team had not yet been pushed out.
"There is really a need to dig deep, and worry about your match," Spite said.
That's all that's left for these players.
18 pits to make luck.
The only players who have scored more over the past two days than Spite and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who will undoubtedly enter the history of this Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange but attractive couple are four points behind and will not be able to harm.
Mollywood was the only couple to make a living without a bogie on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogies on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and nine in the last pits on Friday morning.
This course and the way their energy flows to this mad crowd and back convinces them that they are players to win on Sunday, and Fleetwood with Molinari will be the most popular players who can secure a potential European victory when the sun declines across the "Le Golf National".
Preferably for both simultaneously in different pits.
However, the talk of Europe's triumph was premature.
Babba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly coped with this morning's character in the "fourballs" format Sergio Garcia, who played with Alex Noren.
Bogie and the two double front nine were led by Spaniards and Swedish in trouble, and they were not even close to getting out of it.
On Sunday, however, there is no one to help deal.
The game's "fourball" and "foursome" formats are so exciting to watch nearby because of the interaction of couples, to watch what advice they give and what they don't, and how strategy can instantly change the situation.
Europe has played better as a team so far, and is in the lead far before the last day, but this race in the "foursome" format showed that the US team is determined to fight for which many, especially "Stateside", have doubted.
The European team on the final day of the Raiders Cup is in the lead 10-6
The European team will start the final day of the Raiders Cup in a pleasant lead after Saturday's "fourball" and "foursome" competitions ended in the lead with 10-6 against the United States.
The inspired couple Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari were in the lead with two wins over hard-working Tyger Woods, who increased the score for Le Golf National to four.
Thomas Bjorn's European team to save the trophy lost to Hazeltine two years ago dominated over the inaccurate American team in the morning competition in the "fourballs" format, and the series score became 3-1.
The United States vigorously opposed the "foursomes" format, winning two tackles, but failed to eliminate the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needs 8 points in Sunday's 12 singles to save the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European first-year-old to score four points in a row with the Molinaris, nicknamed Molliwood ("Molliwood") after a sensational weekend is only the second pair in Raiders Cup history to score four points in the first four matches.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in a "fourballs" format, they then defeated tired Wood and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau in a brilliant game with an even more sympathetic score of 5&4.
Woods, who won two games on Saturday, showed a great game at times, but he has lost 19 of 29 tackles in "fourballs" and "foursomes" formats, besides seven in a row.
Justin Rose rested before the morning games "fourballs", returned to partner Henrik Stenson's "foursomes" to defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepka, who rank first and second in the world rankings, with 2&1.
Europe failed to fully catch up, even though the day in southwest Paris was a pleasant and blew light wind.
The three-time winner of the most prestigious golf competition, Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas, set a benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They squeezed 2&1 against John Rahm of Spain and Ian Poulter in a "fourballs" format and returned later to defeat Polter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 "foursomes" after losing the first two pits.
Only twice in the history of the Raiders Cup, the team has replayed in 4-point deficit singles, but as the owners, the Farika (Furyk) team is enough with only a draw score to save the trophy.
After being in second place for two days, as it looks, Sunday's counterattack will be problematic.
North Korea stated that they would not disarm unilaterally, without trust, in "no case"
North Korea's foreign minister informed the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions deepened its distrust of the United States, and North Korea would not unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons in any such situation.
Ri Yong Ho informed the world organization's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill steps" last year, such as stopping nuclear weapons and missile testing, dismantling a nuclear weapons test landfill, and promising never to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see an adequate U.S. response," he said.
"If there is no confidence in the United States, there will be no faith in the security of our country, and under such conditions we will by no means disarm unilaterally the first."
Although Ri repeated the well-known North Korean rebuke for Washington's resistance to a "gradual" approach to denuclearization, under which Korea would be rewarded for gradually taking steps, his statement left an impression as it did not automatically reject unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang had done before.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Chenun and Donald Trump at a first-time meeting of US President and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim vowed to work to achieve "Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has attempted to officially end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has stated that Pyongyang must give up her nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also not conceded a call to ease the serious international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The U.S. insists that 'denuclarisation must be first', and raises the level of pressure imposed by sanctions to achieve the goal by force, even opposing the 'declaration of the end of the war,'" said Ri.
"The idea that sanctions could push us to our knees is empty fantasies cherished by people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that continuing sanctions only deepens our infidelity."
Ri did not talk about intentions for a second meeting of Kim with Trump, which the US leader had specifically mentioned speaking to the United Nations this week.
In his speech, the Minister particularly highlighted three times Kim's meeting with South Korean leader Mun Jane (Moon Jae-in) over the past five months and added, "If the other side of this issue of denuclearization were South Korea, rather than the United States, denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to such a dead end."
However, Ri's tone of speech differed dramatically from what he said last year when he stated in the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korean missiles on the U.S. mainland was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump had called Kim "a rocketman" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who had threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea last year, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps towards disarmament, but stressed that much remains to be done, and sanctions must be maintained until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump stated that he had not scheduled a specific time, stressing that "it doesn't matter whether it will take two years, three years, or five months".
China and Russia stress that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for what he has done.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that, "The implementation of Security Council sanctions must be pursued vigorously, without making mistakes, until final and convincing denuclearization is achieved."
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions since 2006 in an attempt to bring the funding of Pyongyang's nuclear- and ballistic-weapon programmes to an end.
Pompeo met Ri outside the meetings of the UN General Assembly, and then informed that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the latter's trips were not successful.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made, but just hours later, North Korea accused him of "gangster-worthy claims".
North Korea, at the meeting with Muna this month, pledged to dismantle the weapons landfill and also the nuclear complex if the U.S. takes "appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim had informed him that the "appropriate measures" that North Korea wants to see were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard University students will learn a subject about how to relax enough
A new subject at Harvard University this year has resulted in students sleeping more, and it is an attempt to counter the increasingly popular culture of brutalism, which includes caffeine crowded study through the nights.
One teacher found that students at the best university in the world often do not even have basic knowledge of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School, as well as a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a subject he believes to be the first of its kind in the United States.
Inspiration to create a new subject for him arose after speaking about the influence of sleep deprivation on learning.
"In the end, a girl came up to me and asked, "Why is it telling me only now that I'm in the last course?"
She discovered that no one had ever explained to her the importance of sleep — which surprised me, he told the Telegraph.
This year, the first study subject released provides students with basic information on how good sleep habits contribute to achievement in learning and sport, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, informed that the university decided to introduce a course of instruction after learning that students were suffering from serious sleep deprivation during the school week.
The hour-long training process includes a series of interactive tasks.
One of the parts features a dormitory door picture where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books to learn about caffeine and light exposure and how performance in sports is affected by lack of sleep and the importance of a bedtime routine.
In another part, students are informed about how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
Then the campus map with interactive icons invites participants to rethink their daily routine.
"We know that this will not change student behavior immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know. Just as you have the right to know how health will be affected by cigarette smoking," added Professor Chaisler.
He said that the culture of being proud of the ability to learn throughout the night still exists, and he added that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation became an increasingly serious problem.
He explained that providing enough quality sleep should be a student's "secret weapon" to combat stress, overwork and anxiety, and even to prevent weight gain as lack of sleep switches the brain into fasting mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaisler develop a subject, after taking part in one of the professor's lectures last year, Harvard's first course.
He said the subject had opened his eyes and inspired the course to be accessible to the entire campus.
He hopes that the next step will be a request for postgraduate students to learn a similar program before going on to enjoy competition.
Professor Chaisler advises students to install an alarm clock not only for the time they rise, but also when they go to sleep, as well as to keep in mind how people are harmed by "blue lights" emitted by electronic device screens and LED lamps, as they can disrupt circadian rhythms, making it difficult to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga Gate overturns Gerard's men
The Rangers were hit by another sad game guest when Dolly Menga kicked Stephen Gerrard's stunned team to a 1 - 0 loss against Livingston.
The Ibrox team hoped to score the first win in the outing since the February 4:1 triumph of St Johnstone, but the Gary Holt team secured Gerard his second loss in 18 games since he has become the club manager, and his team is 8 points away from Scottish Championship leader"Hearts".
Menga kicked the ball into the goal seven minutes before half-time ended, and the Rangers' lack of inspiration did not look like an attempt to equalise the score in any way.
The Rangers fall to sixth place, while Livingston climbs to third, and in terms of goal difference, it is surpassed only by Hibernian.
And the Rangers may have another problem, as the judge's assistant, Calum Spence, needed medical attention due to a head injury apparently caused by the subject from the far end of the cast.
Gerard made eight changes to his team, which quickly left behind Ayr, reaching the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livingston 11 players who took away the Hearts one point the previous week, and he would be delighted as his well-deprecated team suppressed opponents in each episode.
It is possible that the Rangers managed the ball more often, but Livingston used what was their actions better.
They should have scored a goal just two minutes after the start when Meng's first play sent Scott Pittman towards Allan McGregor's goal, but the center player missed his big chance.
Then a distant free kick by Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his partner in defence Alan Lithgow was only able to send the ball far past the rear pole.
The Rangers took control, but there was the impression that play was hoped for in the last third, not believed to happen.
Alfredo Morelos doubtless believed he should have made a penalty kick in the 15th minute, after he had collided with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected a Colombian call.
The Rangers made only two hits in the goal at the first half time, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not particularly bothered by, nor was Lassana Coulibaly's hit with his head, nor the modest ending of the Ovie Ejaria attack.
Although what Livingston started in the 34th minute might have changed the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their efforts already.
The Rangers didn't deal with Jacobs' planned long combination again.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher broadcast the ball to Scott Robinson, who maintained balance and chose Meng for a simple end.
Gerard replaced Kulibali with Raain Kent in the break, and this almost immediately affected the game as the midfielder sent the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly from his line immediately pitched to block.
However, Livingston continued to make guests play as they like, with Litgov and Halket making one long kick after another.
Holt's team could have continued to lead in the final stage, but McGregor played well, stopping Jacobs before Litgov made a hit with his head from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton late in the game demanded another penalty kick, after colliding with Jacobs, but Thomson again ignored the request.
Almanach: Inventor of Geiger's counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" almanah: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today... one day Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, who grew up to be a physicist, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, the result of which was, after all, a device known as the Geiger counter.
In science, the ranked and preserved Geiger counter has also taken its place in pop culture, as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, in which externally inconclusive cowboy-type scientists Rogers and Dale Evans played their main roles:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put on these headsets, you'll be able to hear how atoms work, which are released because of the radioactivity generated by these minerals."
Evans: "Really, it really does pause!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention named after him continues to live.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" evil cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" evil cells and kill them
The vaccine in therapy teaches the immune system to recognise evil cells
Using this method, the patient obtains immune cells that are converted in the laboratory
Then they would be able to "see" a protein that is characteristic of many malignant tumors, and will be injected back into the body
The trial vaccine has shown promising results in patients with various types of malignancies.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that taught her immune system to recognise evil cells experienced a loss of her ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting from the patient’s immune cells, converting them into a laboratory so that they can “see” the protein HER2 characteristic of several tumors, and then injecting these cells back into the body.
U.S. National Cancer Institute told Bethesda, Professor Jay Berzofsky in Maryland, "Our results show we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes the growth of several types of malignancy," including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer, explained Professor Berzovsky.
A similar approach, when the patient obtains immune cells that are "trained" to attack cancer cells, has been effective in one type of leukemia.
Kanye West attacked Trump's critics after visiting SNL, dressed in a MAGA hat.
It Did Not End Well
Kanye West was whistled out at the studio during the Saturday Night Live show after an incoherent performance in which he lauded U.S. President Donald Trump and announced that he would run for the 2020 presidential election.
After finishing the third song that night, titled "Ghost Town", during which he wore the "Make America Great" hat, he began barring loud phrases about Democrats and repeatedly stressed his support for Trump.
"So many times when I speak to white people, they ask, "How can you like Trump? He's a racist!"
Well, if I were worried about racism, then I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
"Conturday Night Live" began with a parody with Matt Damon in a lead role in which a Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's charge of sexual assault.
Although it was not broadcast, material with West's pity on social networks was loaded by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear if Rock tried to mock West in this way.
And another West lamented to the audience that he had been mistreated behind the scenes because of his headlace.
"They mocked me behind the scenes!
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat in your head!"
They made fun of me!
And yet they said I've lost touch with reality," West said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Gribat see what happens when you lose touch with reality?", and promised to put on "your Superman cape" because that means you can't tell me what to do. Want the world to move forward?
Try love!"
"Variety" reported that his comments caused the audience's whistles at least twice, but members of the show's team looked embarrassed, and at least one person told the press publication, "The studio entered complete silence."
West had been called up at the last minute to replace singer Ariana Grande, who had died a few days earlier by friend rapper Mac Miller.
West confused many with the song (I Love it), which he performed in a champagne bottle costume.
Vest was supported by the leader of the Conservative group TPUSA, Candance Turner, who recorded on Twitter, "To one of the strongest people in the spirit: PATEICOS, THAT YOU NEED TO POWDER!"
But talk show host Karen Hunter recorded on Twitter that West simply "was who he is, and that's wonderful."
"However, I choose not to reward a person (by buying his music or clothing, or by supporting his 'art') who, I believe, supports and bars with an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And we too," she added.
Prior to this show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he had now become "a presence previously known as Kanji Vestu".
He is not the first artist to change his name, and acts like Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, used to be Snoop Lion, and of course the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol, but then to "a stage artist formerly known as Prince".
Charged in attempted murder for stabbing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
Police informed that the incident occurred in Ballihackamore.
The accused is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrate Court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Herrington turns against toxic manhood
Kit Herrington is known as the sword-crowding John Snow in the HBO's ruthless medieval fantasy series Throne Games.
However, the 31-year-old actor has countered the brutal hero's stereotype, stating that such characters on the screen often make young boys think they need to be strong to be respected.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit explained that he thought there was "a problem," and asked the question of how to deal with toxic manhood in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Throne Games partner Rose Leslie, also aged 31, admitted that he cared about the problem.
"I can't think of what mistakes we've made with manhood right now," he said.
"What do we teach young men in the face of this problem as they grow up given the existing problem?"
Kit believes television with its very masculine characters may be partly responsible for an increase in toxic manhood.
He went on to say, "What's innate, but what's being taught?
What is being taught on TV and on the streets that makes young boys feel that they need to be perceived as men?
In my opinion, this is one of the most important issues of our time: how can we change it?
Because problems have clearly arisen with young men."
He also admitted in an interview that he would not participate in any follow-up or prequel to the Game of Thrones, after the series ends next summer, stressing that "there are fed up battlefields and horses".
Starting in November, Kit will play a key role in the renewed "True West" of Sam Sheppard, which is the story of a film producer and his brother robber.
The actor recently admitted that he considered his meeting with his wife Rose to be the best thing that happened to him as a result of the Throne Games.
"I met my wife on this show, since it somehow provided my present family and my life from that moment on," he said.
The Rose Emmy Award winning fantasy series was played by Kit's character John Snow's favourite Igrit.
The couple married in June 2018 at the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China stated that the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS has increased rapidly by 14%.
Health officials report that over 820,000 people have been affected in the country.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were the result of sexual intercourse, suggesting a change.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly as a result of blood transfusions infected parts of China.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has fallen to almost zero, Chinese health officials reported at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has risen to 100,000 from one year to the next.
The transmission of HIV through sexual relations is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality in China was decriminalized in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT people is common.
Given the conservative values of the country, research estimates that 70-90% of men who have had sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of sexually transmitted diseases are the result of underprotected sex in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs, as part of measures to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that the employee leaked Republican Senators data, harshly targets "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Maxine Waters of the U.S. House of Representatives on Saturday denied allegations that her staff member had posted personal information from three U.S. Republican senators on the pages of the Wikipedia legislature.
A Los Angeles Democrat insisted that the allegations were spread by "ultra right-wing" allies and internet sites.
"Meli, lie and even more despicable lies," Waters insisted in her statement on Twitter.
The leaked information is reported to include residence addresses and phone numbers owned by U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from Congress, at the time of a Senate group hearing on the sexual indecent conduct charges of the Supreme Court nominated Brett Caveno.
The leak occurred some time after three senators had questioned Caveno.
Conservatives, Internet sites such as "Gateway Pundit" and "RedState" reported that the IP address identifying the origin of the records is linked to Waters' office, and revealed information about Waters' staff member, informed Hill.
"This unsubstantiated statement is absolutely false and utter lies!" insisted Waters.
"My staff member, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised due to these fraudulent and false statements, shall in no way be liable for any leakage of information.
This unsubstantiated statement is absolutely false and a total lie!"
Waters' statement soon sparked criticism online, including that of Ari Fleischer, former White House Press Secretary.
"This is an angry denial," wrote Fleisher.
"This makes it possible to conclude that her temperament does not correspond to a member of Congress.
When a man is accused of what he has not done, that man must not be angry.
He mustn't be belligerent.
He must not express himself on the motives of the accuser.
He must be calm and serene."
Fleisher's task was to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrat's fall for Judge Caveno, who was accused of being too angry a reaction during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who stands to get Waters to lose her chair in the interim election, also made his point on Twitter.
"Great if true," he recorded.
In her statement, Waters informed that her cabinet had warned responsible officials and law enforcement bodies of these fraudulent allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be exposed," she continued, "and that they will be found legally responsible for all of their work, which is destructive and dangerous to any of my staff."
"Johnny English 3" review — a parody of spy films by Rowan Atkinson left in the half wheel
It has become common to look for associations with Brexit in every new film with British flavour, and this also seems to apply to this, which has revived, parodying adventure comedy franchise by Johnny English, which began in 2003 with "Johnny English" and was nicknamed in 2011 with "Johnny English Returns".
Is a mocking satire about ourselves, about how obviously hopeless we are, a new export opportunity for our nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny Englishman, with his hunched eyes and an unusually moving face, has the right to create a mile after the second revitalization — his name more than anything else signals that he is a wide-ranging comical character designed for areas in which consumers do not speak English.
He is, of course, that silly secret agent who, despite his strange claims to delightful sophistication, is a little Kluzo, a little Mister Bean, and a little bit of that guy playing one note in the music of the Chariots of Fire theme at the London 2012 Olympic Opening Ceremony.
He is also based on the traveller and international, incomprehensible character that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials in which he left chaos in his way.
The latest adventure of Johnny English has at least one or two lovely moments.
I liked the place where Johnny English goes to a helicopter dressed in medieval armor, and the propeller blades glisten against his helmet for a moment.
Atkinson's abilities to visually create a comical impression are well visible, but the humor is rather weak and strangely superficial, especially because "serious" film brands like "007" and "Mission Impossible" themselves use comedy with confidence, as one of the ingredients.
Humor gives the impression that it is dedicated to children rather than adults, and I think Johnny English's absurd misfortunes are not as creative and purposeful as Atkinson's silent film tricks into Bean's skin.
As usual, everything is based on the fact that Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyberhacker has broken into Britain's super-secret spy internet network, revealing the identities of all British agents in this area, for dislike to an active agent — a miserably small role of Kevin Eldon.
It is the last straw for a Prime Minister, a pompous and conflict-like person who has already lost its full political popularity: Emma Thomson is doing what she can, with a character partly similar to Theresa Meja, but in the scenario there is not very much to work with.
Her intelligence advisors inform that, as all active spies have come to light, she will have to call someone already retired.
And this man is the imbecile Johnny Englishman who now works as a teacher in some fine institution of education, and quietly teaches how to work as a secret agent (a couple of fun jokes), because the Englishman offers to learn the profession of spy from the very foundations.
The Englishman is brought back to Whitehol for an emergency meeting and is teamed up with his former much-victimed assistant Bo, also played by Ben Miller this time.
Bo is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, a fun character who only becomes important at the end of the film — a role in which Vicki Pepperdine is not fully used.
And so Batman and Robin have returned to the secret service of Her Highness to meet the beautiful fateful woman Ophelia Bulletova, portrayed by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Ministers have been dangerously tamed by the charismatic technology billionaire, the evil Jason Walta, played by Jack Lacy, and he claims he is able to solve Britain's computer mess.
The Englishman and Bo begin their wild fun odyssey: disguised as the Oficians, they set fire to a fine French restaurant; they create confusion by secretly sneaking into the Volta luxury yacht; and the Englishman causes absolute chaos in trying to use virtual realities on the head display to get acquainted with the interior of the Volta Building.
Everything possible for the end is done, but no matter how attractive and crazy the film is, there are many elements of children's television.
A lot of moderate elements.
As with other Johnny English films, I can't think of whether the British film industry could give Rowan Atkinson a role that would make full use of his talent?
The Labour Party denies plans that the British will work four days a week, but will receive a salary for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is about to discuss a radical plan under which the British will work four days a week, but will receive a salary of five.
The party is reported to want business executives to give workers the savings saved through the artificial intelligence revolution, giving them another holiday.
In this case, employees will be able to enjoy a three-day weekend while receiving the same salary as before.
Sources tell us that the idea will "respond" to the party's agenda in economics, and plans to change the economy in favor of the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week has been supported by the Trade Union Congress, which believes it is an opportunity for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
One of the top representatives of the Labour Party informed The Sunday Times, "It is expected that changes in politics will be announced by the end of this year.
"This will not happen in one day, but the four-day working week is an idea that is in line with the party's goal of balancing the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the party's overall strategy in industry."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised to introduce a four-day week of work as early as the 2017 general election campaign.
However, as such, the Labour Party does not support this craving at the moment.
A spokesman for the Labour Party informed, "The four-day work week is not part of the party's politics, and the party is not considering it."
Shadow Cabinet Minister John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to give shape to his vision of the socialist revolution in economics.
Mr. McDonnell explained that he was determined to take power away from the "director mass" and the public service company "speculators."
The Shadow Cabinet is also planned by the Minister to mean that the existing average stockholders in water companies may not be able to recover their entire package, as the Labour government could implement a "deduction" due to the injustice allowed.
He also approved plans to include employees on company boards and to create exclusive Ownership Funds (Ownership Funds) to allocate 10% of the capital of private sector companies to employees who would receive up to 500 pounds annually in dividends.
Lindsay Grem and John Kennedy answer "60 Minutes", or the FBI investigation into Caveno's case could change their opinion
Against the prosecution brought by Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the FBI investigation has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least one week, and raises the question of whether office findings could cause any Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview on Sunday, Scott Pelley, a correspondent for the show 60 Minutes, questioned Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about whether the FBI could reveal anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy left the impression of a more open man than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," answered Kennedy.
"I said, turning to the audition procedure, I said I had spoken to Judge Caveno.
I called him after it happened when the charge became known, and asked, "Did you do that?"
He was determined, direct and unambiguous."
On the other hand, Grem's vote is apparently cast into stone.
"I've made a decision on Brett Caveno, and a subversive charge will be required," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett resolutely denied it," added Grem, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of those named by her were able to confirm it.
Event aged 36.
I don't think there are any changes to come."
What is the World Citizens' Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the World Citizens' Festival, an annual music event featuring impressive amounts of stars and having an equally impressive mission: to reduce world poverty.
This is the seventh year of the festival, tens of thousands of people will attend the World Citizens' Festival, who will gather on the Great lawn of Central Park, not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, rappers Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an event created by the international advocacy group the Global Poverty Project, which hopes to end poverty by attracting more and more people actively fighting poverty.
To receive a free ticket to this event (unless there was a desire to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert visitors had to perform a series of tasks or "actions", such as doing voluntary work, sending an e-mail to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other significant action to raise awareness of ending poverty.
But how successful has the movement "Global Citizen" been?
Is the idea of awarding a free concert a good way to convince people to act, or just another case of so-called "clivism" where people feel they can really influence something by signing an online petition or sending a Twitter message?
The Global Citizen movement claims that since 2011, it has registered over 19 million "actions" from its supporters in an effort to achieve various goals.
It reports that these actions have helped world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to over $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group referred to 390 commitments and statements stemming from its operations for which at least $10 billion has already been paid or funded.
The group estimates that up to now nearly 649 million people worldwide have been directly affected by the funds allocated.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and enforcers committed to "helping children grow up fully", promising to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 Twitter messages from global citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, governments of other countries, and citizens of the world like you, we can leave the social injustice of an undernourished diet in history," Tracy Ullman, a spokeswoman for The Power of Nutrition, announced to the crowd at its April 2018 concert in London.
The group also mentioned that after the launch of over 5,000 events calling on the UK government to provide mothers and children with better nutrition, the government announced funding for the "Power of Nutrition" project, which will give nutrition to 5 million women and children.
Answering one of the most frequently asked questions on your website— "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
The Global Citizen commented, "It's going to be a long and long road where we stumble and fail at times.
However, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will also succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists to perform at this year's event in New York City, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy for "blockage" to hinder Russian energy exports — says Interior Minister
"In case of need," Washington may use its Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, by the U.S. Interior Minister, Ryan Zinke, as quoted in "Washington Examiner".
Zinke argued that Russia's activities in Syria, especially where it operates under the invitation of the legitimate government, were a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"In my opinion, the reason why it is in the Middle East is that it wants to supply energy just as it does in Eastern Europe — in the southern part of Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means of dealing with it.
"The United States, through its Navy, can make sure that the sea routes are open, as well as block them if necessary, so that Russia cannot bring its energy to the market," he said.
Zinke approached the public who had come to attend an event hosted by the Energy Consumers Alliance, a non-profit organization that calls itself "the voice of an energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with the situation in Russia and Iran, stating that they were actually the same.
"Iran and Russia's economic opportunity is more or less the use and substitution of fuel," he mentioned, while referring to Russia as a country whose economy depends mainly on fossil fuels.
It is claimed that the Trump administration is promoting the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, thus replacing Russia, the much cheaper option for consumers in Europe.
For this reason, Trump administration officials, and also U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which would, according to Trump, make Berlin "dependent" on Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the US$11 billion Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which would double the existing gas pipeline's capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington's ardent resistance to the project is simply based on economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"In my opinion, we agree that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier," said Russian energy minister Alexander Novak after his September meeting in Moscow with the US Minister of Energy Rick Perry.
The US has expressed its negative stance towards Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the German Federation of Industry (BDI), has called on the US to refrain from engaging in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I feel a big problem if a third country intervenes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industry (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider her candidacy for the 2020 presidential election
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced Saturday that she was seriously considering running for president following the mid-term elections.
During a council hearing in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering standing for the presidential election.
"It's time there were women in Washington who would 'find' the imperfect government, which also means woman-presidents," so her names are reflected in The Hill newspaper.
"After November 6, I will carefully consider my candidacy in the U.S. presidential election."
During the council hearing, Warren referred to President Donald Trump, claiming that he "leads this country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply disturbed by what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren has openly criticized Trump and his chosen Supreme Court candidate, Brett Caveno.
In Friday's Twitter report, Warren mentioned, "Of course, an FBI investigation is required before the election."
However, a poll published on Thursday revealed that most of Warren's supporters do not believe she should stand in the 2020 election.
According to the results of the Suffolk University Political Research Center/newspaper "Boston Globe" poll, fifty-eight percent of the "possible" Massachusetts voters argued that a senator should not stand for election.
Thirty-two percent supported such a decision.
The poll results revealed that former Governor Deval Patrick had gained more support, receiving 38 percent for standing in the election and 48 percent against.
In addition, names of high-profile Democratic Party operatives such as former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders appear in relation to a possible candidacy in the 2020 election.
The Associated Press news agency informed that Baiden was committed to giving an official decision by January.
Sarah Peelin quotes Trek Peelin's PTSS at Donald Trump's rally
Trek Peelin (26) spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in the military in September.
He was arrested on Monday evening and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, which he goes through after returning, I can extend to other families facing the consequences of PTSS and the vulnerability of certain doses with which our soldiers return," she told the public at Donald Trump's rallies in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Peelin called his arrest an "obvious problem that everyone pretends not to see" and said of her son and other veterans of the war that "they come back a little differently, they come back fortified, they come back thought about whether they respect what their fellow soldiers and pilots, as well as all the other members of the military, have given to this country".
According to Wassila Police Department spokesman Dan Bennett, he was arrested Monday in Vassila, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman and for holding a gun while in a state of intoxication.
18 states, District of Columbia challenges new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies shelter to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives of these 18 states and the District of Columbia submitted a brief statement to the court's counsel on Friday in Washington, D.C. to support the asylum seeker facing the obstacles posed by the said policy, reports NBC News.
The plaintiff's full name in the Grace v. Sessions trial initiated by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal politics has not been revealed.
She claimed that her partner "and the sons of a member of his violent gang" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her request for asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
State attorneys supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, from which much of the U.S. asylum seekers come, as countries where gangs and domestic violence are a common problem.
The new U.S. asylum policy changed the 2014 decision of the Board of Appeals for Immigrants, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
Attorney General of the District of Columbia Karl Racine stated on Friday that the new policy "ignores state, federal, and international laws enacted for decades".
"Federal law provides that all requests for asylum are dealt with in the light of the facts and circumstances of the claim in question, and such an obstacle violates this principle," the brief statement by the court counsel said.
In addition, the lawyer mentioned in his statement that policies that prevent immigrants from entering the country were detrimental to the U.S. economy, as these immigrants would likely become entrepreneurs and would "provide the necessary workforce".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions approached immigration case judges in June with a request to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang abuse.
"The asylum is available to persons who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear associated with their race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political views," Sixons said in his June 11 statement regarding politics.
Asylum has never been designed to solve all the problems, even all the serious problems, that people face all over the world every day.
A desperate rescue effort in Palu, with the number of dead doubling in the search for survivors
The situation became more severe for the survivors.
"The situation is very tense," said 35-year-old Riza Kusum, comforting her hectic baby in the center of the evacuation of the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute, the ambulance brings in new victims.
Clean water is a deficit."
The residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes and rebuffing the stuff that had melted in the water, trying to save everything that was found.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals affected by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake were crowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had a broken spine and shoulder, slept outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were cared for out due to the constant strong aftershocks.
He had tears in his eyes, remembering how the powerful earthquake began to shake the hotel room on the fifth floor in which he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save.
I guess I was printed in wall ruins," the Associated Press news agency told Haris, adding that his family had arrived in the city for the wedding.
"I heard my wife cry out for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe."
US ambassador accuses China of attempted intimidation through propaganda ads
A week after an official Chinese newspaper released a four-page advertisement emphasizing the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China on a daily basis, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to distribute propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to an annex paid to China Daily in the Iowa state's most sold newspaper, the Des Moines Register, accusing China of attempting to interfere in the November 6 U.S. Congressional election, but China denies this.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was attempting to interfere in the U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials told the Reuters news agency, namely that it was a new phase in the growing Washington campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is perfectly normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently caught up in a growing trade war, resulting in a series of tariffs on each other's imports.
Early in the trade war, Chinese repressive tariffs were directed against exporters in states such as Iowa who supported the Trump Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said that Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote his opinion for the Sunday edition of "Des Moines Register", claiming that China "now doubles this intimidation by placing propaganda ads in our own free press."
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's tradition of free speech and free press, placing a paid advertisement on the Des Moines Register," wrote Branstad.
"In contrast, here in the usual Beijing news kiosk, you will find a limited number of different opinions and will not see such a true reflection of different views that the Chinese people may have in connection with China's alarming economic trajectory, given that the media is here under the strict supervision of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most influential newspapers avoided publishing" his article, however he did not mention which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn of Republicans alienating female voters from mid-term elections involving Caveno scandal
As many leading Republicans support and defend Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, against whom several allegations of sexual abuse have been made, analysts have warned that in the upcoming mid-term elections they will experience a negative reaction, especially from women.
The related emotions have been extremely high, and it is evident that most Republicans have already been prepared to give up their voice.
Such cases cannot be withdrawn, "it was told in a Saturday article in The Hill newspaper by Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University.
Reeher questions that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last-minute urge to conduct an FBI investigation will be a good enough reason to appease angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday. They won't forget it again tomorrow or November," said Carine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and state spokeswoman for the progressive movement MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters in the Senate hallway demonstratively sang "November Comes!", when Republicans in charge of the Judiciary Committee chose to continue with Caveno's nomination despite testimony given by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported "Mic".
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be at a very high level," independent political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the news portal.
"People say it's already at a high level, that's true.
But it could be even higher, especially among commuters living in suburbs of fluctuating voters and younger voters (aged 18-29), who often do not go to elections even if they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which she set out allegations of sexual abuse by a candidate for the post of Supreme Court, analysts cite a possible failure if Republicans continued to put forward this candidacy.
"This has become a messy mess for the Republican Party," Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said according to NBC News earlier last week.
"It's not just about the committee's vote or the final vote, or about whether Caveno will be convicted, it's also about how Republicans have dealt with the situation and how they treated him," Guy Cecil, the director of Priories USA, who leads this group that helps elect Democrats, pointed out to the news channel.
However, it seems that the Americans are somewhat divided in terms of what to believe according to the testimony of Ford and Caveno, a little more inclined to believe in the latter.
The new "YouGov" poll shows that 41 percent of respondents are definitely or mostly inclined to believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say that they are certainly or mostly inclined to believe in Caveno's testimony.
In addition, 38 percent claimed that Caveno may or may have lied about his testimony, while only 30 percent have said the same about Ford.
The Guardian newspaper reported that, at Flake's urging, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford, as well as at least another accuser, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Caveno committed a sexual assault against him in drunkenness at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the post of Supreme Court judge during his studies at Yale in the 1980s has shown her his genitalia at a party.
The global web inventor plans to launch a new internet to take over Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the global web, launches a project that could compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Technology legend's latest Inrupt project is a company based on the Burners-Lee open-source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people are allowed to access some information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Burners-Lee joked that Inrupt's hidden intention was to "dominate over the world".
"We must do it now," he said of the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to enable people to build their own "personal online data repository" or PTD.
It may include contact lists, lists of works to be done, a calendar, a music library, as well as other personal and professional tools.
It's like if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all simultaneously available in the same browser.
The personal online data repository is unique in that only the user determines who and what type of information can be accessed.
The company refers to it as "personal powers using data".
According to company manager John Bruce, "Inrupt"'s idea is to provide the company with resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently operates a security platform acquired by Burners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, some freelance developers hired to work on the project, and a community of voluntary coders.
From this week onwards, technology developers around the world could build their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Burners-Lee said he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change, completely reversing all their business models within one night.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In an article published by Platform Medium on Saturday, Burners-Lee mentioned that "the mission of Inrupt is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid".
In 1994, Burners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the Global Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Burners-Lee has had an influential opinion in discussions on net neutrality.
Even after the launch of Inrupt, Burners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the Global Web Consortium, the Global Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm really optimistic about this new web era," Burners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Marking the Victoria Cross granted to the clergyman during World War I
For 100 years in its hometown, an event is noted when the only clergyman of the Church of England has received the Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter.
The Honourable Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Wen received this award on 29 September 1918 in connection with the attack on Bellenglyse and LeHaucourt.
However, four days later, he was killed by a sniper, so he never learned of the highest British military award he obtained.
At a Saturday parade in Rashden, Northamptonshire, his two grandsons discovered a memorial stone dedicated to him.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, mentioned that it was "excellently symbolic" that such a stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather had received the significant award.
According to the newspaper "London Gazette" on 29 September 1918, Lt. Wen led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through large fires created by very thick fogs and cannons and machine guns."
He later rushed to the shooting line and led the line forward with the greatest bravery before taking the gun zone, where he defeated the three groupings.
Lieutenant Colonel Wen was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 — just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Wen (72) said that his grandfather's actions were "something I could never accomplish, and which at the same time is also a very humble act".
He and his brother, Dr James Vann, also laid the wreath under the auspices of orchestra Brentwood Imperial Youth Band after the parade.
Michael Wen claimed to feel "honored by participating in this parade", and added that "the value of a true hero is evidenced by the support given by the many people".
MMA fans waited all night for "Bellator 206", but instead welcomed Piggy Pep
Imagine being spent all night up to see Bellator 206, but in the end, you're denied watching this main event.
The San Jose Affiche included 13 fights, including six on the main map, broadcast live throughout the night on UK Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were about to face each other, viewers in the UK were unpleasantly surprised by changing transmission to Piggy Pep.
Some were puzzled when they were awake all night until early dawn, waiting for the fight.
A fan on Twitter described the transmission's change to a children's cartoon as a "failed joke".
"The government has determined that this kind of content is unacceptable after 6 p.m., so there was a transmission switch to the children's program," Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of Bellator for marketing and communication, explained the transmission change.
"Piggy Pepa," "yes."
Scott Coker, president of the company Bellator, said that he would be working on scheduling so that future viewers in the UK could see these broadcasts.
"Thinking about repeating the transmission, I think we'll be able to sort it out somehow," Koker said.
"But the clock there is six o'clock in the morning on Sunday, and we won't be able to solve this problem until Sunday after our time and Monday after their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, a lot of texts appeared after the transmission switch, and they were not positive.
We tried to prevent this because we thought it was a technical failure.
But it wasn't.It was controlled by the government.
I can promise you that there will be no such problems next time.
We will stick to five fights instead of six (as has been the case so far). We tried to please the fans, but we overreacted.
It's a failed situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley didn't feel good enough because of his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley claims he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but this motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old man was unaware that "not everyone was like me" until he started attending high school.
While attending the first Radio 4 program, "Desert Island Discs", hosted by Lauren Laverne, he mentioned that he started talking about homosexual rights to give others "hope".
He also mentioned that becoming a parent made him less worried about winning the Olympics.
The permanent head of the long-term program, Kirsy Young, has gone on to rest for several months due to illness.
Appearing as the outcast from the public in Laverne's first program, Daley said that growing up felt "less valuable" than others because "it is not common in society to like both girls and boys."
He said, "Until today, feeling that I am not as good as others, or that I am different, has been the main drive that has given me strength and endurance to succeed."
He said he wanted to prove there was "something" not to disappoint people when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medal winner has become a high-profile LGBT campaign manager and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia, calling for even more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he decided to address the public because he felt happy to be able to live openly and without complications, and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man, US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, was "surprised unprepared".
Daley married a 20-year-old Oscar Award winner last year, and claimed that the age gap had never been an obstacle.
"When you've gone through so much at such a small age" (his first Olympic Games were at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone at your age who would have experienced similar peaks and downs.
The couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley claimed that his "whole perspective" had changed.
"A year ago, all that mattered to me was getting the gold medal," he said.
"Do you know what? There are more important things in life than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic Gold Medal is Robbie."
His son Robert has the same name as his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley mentioned that his father did not want to accept dying, and one of the last things he asked Daley was about whether they had tickets for the 2012 London Olympics, in which he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him that she would no longer be to be in the first line," he said.
"I held his hand until he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and was dead, I finally admitted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew it was what I had dreamed of my whole life — to plunge in front of the homers at the Olympics. There was no better feeling about it," he said.
It also inspired the choice of his first song, "Proud" performed by Heather Small, which resonated with him on his way to achievement at the Olympics and still chased the goose.
The "Desert Island Discs" programme can be heard on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11.15 a.m. British summer time.
Mikkelson out of form in the reserve bench of Saturday's Raiders Cup play
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday playing his 47th Ryder Cup playout match, but he will need to change his strategy to avoid a failed turn of events.
Mickelson, who is already participating in the every two years championship for the 12th time, was grounded by captain Jim Furyk on the reserve bench for Saturday's four-ball games and two-pair games.
Instead of being at the centre of action, as has so often been the case in relation to U.S. teams, the five-time winner split his day, acting both as a supporter and participating in his game with the hope of correcting what distressed him.
Since the 48-year-old golfer has never been the most accurate player even at the top of his career, he is not the most suitable candidate for the tight fight in the rough field of Le Golf National, where imprecise kicks are routinely punished.
And if the game itself is not scary enough, Mickelson will fight the exact British Open Championship winner Francesco Molinari in Sunday's ninth match, who has joined forces with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If Americans who are four points behind in starting 12 singles matches successfully take the lead, Mickelson's match could prove crucial.
Furik expressed confidence in his teammate without undue words.
"He was fully aware of his role today, swung on my back, put his hand on me and said that he would be ready tomorrow," Furik mentioned.
"He is very confident in himself.
He is an outstanding athlete who gave so much to these teams earlier and also this week.
I don't think I've imagined him playing in two matches.
I imagined more, but everything changed the way things got in, and that's what we're going to count on.
He wants to be out there, like everyone else."
Mickelson will hand over Nick Faldo's record in relation to the most played matches in the Raiders Cup on Sunday.
This could mark the end of Raiders' Cup career, which has never really coincided with the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has scored 18 wins, suffered 20 losses and seven draw games, although Furik claimed his presence gave the team some intangible character gains.
"He's hilarious, sarcastic and witty, he likes to amuse about people, and he's a great teammate," he explained.
"In my opinion, the younger players enjoyed teasing him too this week, which was fun to watch.
He provides much more than just a game."
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that a remarkable leadership can quickly fade away
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows from experience that a major lead in the fight for the Raiders Cup in the last day's singles can easily turn into an unpleasant situation.
Dane made his debut at the 1997 Games in Walderram, where the opposing team captained by Seve Ballesteros scored a five-point lead over the Americans, but only now got to the finish line with a very small score, namely winning with 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we took the lead significantly in Walderram; we took the lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and Walderram, where we won, but only with a slight lead," said Bjorn (pictured), watching the 2018 graduation group win with 5-3 on both Friday and yesterday, taking the lead with 10-6 on the golf course "Le Golf National.
Thus history will show both me and every member of its team that nothing is over.
Tomorrow you will give yourself all.
Go to the field and show your best performance!
It will not be over until the points obtained are visible on the screen.
Our goal is to get this trophy and let us focus on it.
I've been saying all the time that I'm focusing on the 12 players that are on our side, but we're very aware of what the other side is facing us — the world's greatest players."
Facilitated by what performance his players showed on the golf course, Bjorn added, "I never rejoiced too early.
There are new challenges ahead tomorrow.
Tomorrow is intended for individual games, and that is a completely different thing.
It's great if you have a partner next to you when everything's going well, but in individual games, your golfer skills are fully tested.
This message you must pass on to your players, that is to say, to give themselves all up in the next day's game.
Now you leave your partner, and he too must go show his best performance."
Unlike Bjorn's opposing team, Captain Jim Furick will make sure that his players show their best performance directly in individual rather than partner games. The exception is only Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furik himself has been on both sides of these important last days tournaments — both as part of the winning team in Brooklyn and later suffering defeat when European teams achieved sensational success, which is later also known in the golf world as "Miracle at Medinah".
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to how Ben Crenshaw, captain of the 1999 team, combined his players for the last day's fight.
"We've got 12 important games tomorrow, but you'd like to get to the fast rise you experienced in Brooklyn, the one you experienced in Medina.
When such an impulse is transmitted in one direction, it puts great pressure on the mid-term games.
We made our own composition accordingly and lined up the guys in the way we thought we were right. Let's try to do some spell tomorrow."
Thomas had been given the task of trying to lead a counterattack, and placed Rory McIlroy in the main game and Europeans Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter in the first part of the list.
"I ranked the guys in that order because I think it fits best in the course of the tournament," Bjorn said regarding the selected singles players.
Deferred entry into service of new German warship
The German warfly's latest frigate was to be put into service in 2014, thus replacing the aging Cold War warships, but this will not happen until at least next year due to flawed systems and rising costs, according to local media.
The commissioning of the main ship of the Baden-Württemberg frigate class, the Rheinland-Pfalz, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, so reported in Die Zeit newspaper, citing a spokesperson for the military.
The ship should have joined the warfly in 2014, but the unpleasant post-delivery problems affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships commissioned by the warflot in faraway in 2007 will replace the obsolete Bremen-class frigates.
They are expected to be equipped with powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared, and acoustic signal reception.
Other essential characteristics include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible to place new frigates up to two years away from the ports where they are registered.
However, the continuing delay means that the warships of the latest technology, which would allow Germany to demonstrate its power overseas, will already be obsolete by the time of entry into service, in the note "Die Zeit".
The failed frigate F125 was noticeable in all headlines last year when the German warfly officially refused to put the ship into service and sent it back to the shipyard "Blohm & Voss" in Hamburg.
This was the first time that a warflotte returned it to the shipyard after the ship was delivered.
Little was known about the reasons for this move, but German media cited several significant "software and equipment defects" that would render the warship invalid if it were used on a combat mission.
The software's shortcomings were a particularly significant factor, as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half the staff of the older Bremen-class frigates.
Similarly, the ship proved to be overweight, which reduces its performance and restricts the ability of the warflotte to make improvements to it in the future.
The 7000-ton ship "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice the weight of ships of a similar class used by Germany during World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project (including crew training) also became a major problem.
It is said to cost EUR 3.1 billion instead of the initial EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems associated with the new frigates are becoming particularly significant in the light of recent warnings about the decline of German naval forces.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chief of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, acknowledged that the warflott really "begins to run out of usable ships".
The official claimed that the problem had increased significantly over time, as old ships are being taken out of service, but no new ones are being delivered at the site.
He expressed regret that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates had joined the warflot.
The National Trust listens to the lives of secret batsmen
The new study, which is being conducted at a Scottish Highland estate, focuses on discovering how batsmen use the landscape in the food search process.
The findings are expected to bring new clarity to the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help in their protection measures in the future.
Scientists at the Scottish National Trust in Invereve Gardens in Westeros will study dwarf bats, pygmy bats, as well as brown long-eared and water night bats.
In key locations, special recorders will be placed on the property, which will track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand detectors.
Sound experts will analyze all records to determine the frequency of bat calls and which species perform the particular activities.
A habitat map and report will then be developed to create a detailed landscape view reflecting the behavior of bats.
NTS conservation adviser Rob Dewar hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management works such as the creation of meadows and how best to conserve forests for bats and other associated species.
During the last centenary, the bat population in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined significantly.
These lands are threatened by construction and development work affecting the hideout and loss of residence of batsmen.
Wind generators and lighting can also pose risks, as can flypaper and chemical treatments of some building materials, as well as cat attacks.
In fact, bats aren't blind.
However, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes during hunting.
They use a sophisticated echo-location method to find insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for maintaining more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the bat problem very seriously.
The organization has ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, checks on bat hideouts, and sometimes even rescues.
The organization has even established in Scotland the first and only specially designed reserve for bats on the property of "Threave" in Damfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten bat species found in Scotland reside.
The property manager, David Thompson, claims that the area is ideal for bats.
"Here's a great place for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of ancient trees and generally suitable habitat.
But there are still many things we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand better what they need for survival."
He stressed that it was important to check whether bats would not be housed at the site before carrying out maintenance work on the property, as it may occur that hiding places of one female are killed by unintentional destruction of up to 400 females and their young, thus possibly destroying the entire local population.
Bats are protected animals and must not be killed, tormented, disturbed or destroyed by their hideouts.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a member of the Bat Conservation Trust, has called on the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about bats, and for a number of their species we just don't know how they're doing."
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape, ordering lawyers to sue the German magazine
Kristiano Ronaldo has denounced the rape charges against him as "false news", claiming that people "want to draw attention to themselves" using his name.
His lawyers have been assigned to sue the German news magazine "Der Spiegel", which published these allegations.
Portuguese-born and Turin's Juventus football star is accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He is alleged to have paid the woman $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, it narrated "Der Spiegel" on Friday.
A few hours after making these statements, Ronald, 33, approached his 142 million followers via Instagram online video, calling this information "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they claimed today is false news," the five-time winner of the Ballon d'Or award told the camera.
"They want to become famous using my name.
This is normal.
They want to become famous at the expense of my name, that's part of my work.
I'm a happy person, and everything's fine," the player added while smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronald's lawyers are going to sue the magazine Der Spiegel for making statements they have called "unacceptable reporting on suspicion in the area of privacy."
Attorney Christian Schertz mentioned that the player would claim compensation for "moral damage to an extent consistent with the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The said incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in the "suite" class room of the "Palms Hotel and Casino" hotel in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed in Nevada State's Clark County Court, it is reported that after dating at a nightclub, Ronald and Majorga went back to the player's hotel room, where he anally raped a woman.
Majorga claims that after the said incident, Ronald fell on his knees and said that he was "about 99 percent "right boy"" but fell in this "one percent" temptation.
According to the documents, Ronaldu confirmed that the couple had sex, but by mutual agreement.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and had photos of injuries sustained in the hospital, but later she agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "fear of revenge" and worried about "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old woman claims that she does not want to accept the terms of this settlement any more, as the said incident left a lasting injury.
At the time the allegations were made, Ronald was about to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid, but this summer he went to the Italian gang Juventus for €100 million.
Brexit: The UK would "forever regret" the loss of automakers
"The UK 'will regret it forever' if it loses its position as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit,' said business secretary Greg Clark.
He is "disturbed" by the fact that Toyota UK has announced to the BBC that if Britain exits the EU without agreement, it will temporarily stop production near Derby's Burnaston plant.
"We need an agreement," Mr Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said that delays on the borders in the case of Brexit could, without an agreement, be at stake in the workplace.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota models Auris and Avensis, last year produced almost 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will be halted," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are worried about leaving the EU without a treaty and how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW claims that after Brexit will close his mini factory in Oxford for a month.
According to automakers, the main concern is the endangered supply chain if no agreement is reached after Brexit.
The Toyota production line operates on the principle of "pass time" where cars made to order receive parts from both UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the UK withdraws from the EU without agreement on 29 March, there could be disruptions at the border, which could cause some delays and shortages.
According to the company, Toyota would not be able to detain more than one day's worth of equipment at its Derbyshire plant, so would have to stop production.
Mr Clark said that the withdrawal plan (Chequers) developed by Theresa May for future relations with the EU was "accurately calculated to avoid such checks at the border".
"We need an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that would allow, as I would say, not only to benefit at the moment, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he said on "BBC" Radio 4 on "Today".
"The evidence for this, not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, is that we need to be able to fully pursue the very successful strategy of supply chains."
Toyota was unable to say how long production could be stopped, but warned that in the long run, rising costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and would ultimately endanger jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnastone for 24 years and has been working at the factory as union unification coordinator, said that his comrades feel more and more alarmed: "I can say from experience that as soon as a post disappears, it does not return."
A government spokesman said, "We have presented an accurate and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, reports White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "delayed for another week" as the fight in relation to Supreme Court judge candidate Brett Caveno continues, so the White House reported on Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates interference in Russian elections, the link between Trump's tools and Russia, and the alleged disregard of the rule of law by the President.
For months in Washington, D.C., it has been gossip about whether Trump will fire Deputy Attorney General and thus threaten Miller's independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had been discussing recording a conversation with Trump and the possibility of suspending the President by Amendment 25.
Rosenstein denied this information.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, where he gave talks about his resignation.
Instead, Thursday's meeting with Trump, who was at the time in the UN General Assembly in New York, was announced.
Trump said that he would not "be more willing" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, in which both Caveno and one of the women who accused him of committing sexual misconduct — Dr. Christine Blaisie Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into Caveno's charges, continuing to delay the Senate ballot.
Trump Press Secretary Sarah Sanders visited Fox News Sunday.
Taught about Rosenstein's meeting, she replied, "The date of the meeting has not yet been set, it could be this week or postponed for another week, given all the cases that happen around the Supreme Court.
But that's what we'll see, and besides, I always want to inform the press about the news."
Some reporters contest this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press briefing since September 10.
The manager, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of bryffings is not due to a dislike of the "slave" of television reporters, although she added, "I don't detract from the fact that they are the lusts of fame."
She then proposed direct contact between Trump, resulting in increased press interest.
"The president engages in more question-and-answer sessions than any president before him," she argued and, without giving further details, added, "We've been interested in their number."
Sanders claimed that the briefings would still happen, but, "if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States questions directly, it's undeniably better than talking to me.
We're trying to do a lot of it and you see we've done it a lot in recent weeks and it's going to take the place of press briefings when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when exiting the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences attended by important persons.
Individual press conferences are rare.
Perhaps the president demonstrated the reason for this this week in New York City, devoting an uncontrollable and sometimes strange expression to a crowd of reporters.
Minister for Health writes to EU staff at the Scottish NHS about fears related to Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to EU workers working for the Scottish National Health Service (NHS) to express their gratitude and wish endurance after Brexit.
The MSP of Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government is already committed to covering the costs of permanent status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote, "During the summer, negotiations continued between the United Kingdom and the EU over the withdrawal that led to the decisions expected this autumn.
However, the UK Government is also preparing for a possible scenario in the absence of an agreement.
I know this is a very turbulent time for you.
I would therefore like to emphasise once again how much I appreciate every employee's involvement, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from both within and outside the EU provide valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and benefit our patients and communities.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Following a head injury, Christien Abercromby undergoes emergency surgery
Tennessee State Tigers guard Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after a head injury, which he scored in a Saturday game in which the Vanderbilt Commodores conceded with a score of 31-27, reported Tennessean sports reporter Mike Organ.
Tennessee State team head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury was sustained shortly before half time.
"He came to the sideline and so to say collapsed," said Reed.
While Abercrombie was on the sideline, the coaches and medical personnel gave him oxygen, then put on the stretchers and brought him for further examination.
A Tennessee state official told Nashville, Tennessee's WSMV reporter Chris Harris that Abercrombie had been removed from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that, for the time being, "there is no information about the type/severity of the injury", and the Tennessee state team is attempting to understand at what point this injury was sustained.
Abercrombie, a redshirt representative, is in his first season after replacing Illionysa for the Tennessee state team.
Before leaving Saturday's game, he had made a total of five blocks, which totaled 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher excise duty when buying property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher excise duties when buying property in the UK, and the additional funds raised will be used to help the homeless under the new "Tory" plan.
Such a move will counteract Corbin's efforts to attract new voters.
The increased excise duty will apply to persons who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The Treasury expects up to 120 million pounds per year to be collected to be directed to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher excise duties when buying property in the UK and channelling the extra funds obtained to help the homeless, it will announce Theresa May today.
Such a move is seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract new voters with promises to provide housing at more favourable prices and addressing the wealthier part of society.
The increased public levy will be applied to people and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK, with the extra money raised being allocated to the government's efforts to combat the homelessness problem.
The premium included in the current public levy, including the introduction two years ago of a higher level of fees for the purchase and rental of a second home, could be as much as three percent.
The Treasury expects that such a move can complement its budget up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the newly built London properties are purchased by non-residents, thus striking prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to get to their homes.
Many areas of the wealthy country, especially in the capital, have become "spoke cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy was introduced just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the state fee so that more young people could afford to buy their first housing.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by seizing land but not using it, and urged Mrs. May to give up quotas on affordable housing to address Britain's housing problem.
Mr. Corbin has proposed a series of attractive housing reforms, including reforms on rent control and eviction from housing for no reason.
He also wants to give councils more powers to build new housing.
Mrs May said, "Last year I mentioned that I would use my position as Prime Minister to restore Britain's dream — namely, every young generation must have a better quality of life.
And that means putting our damaged housing market in order.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and arrange their lives here.
However, it is not right that housing can be bought as easily as foreign companies and people who do not live in the United Kingdom, and the hard-working British people.
For many, the dream of their home has become too distant, and the harsh problem of homelessness remains acute."
Jack Ross: "My biggest goal is to lead Scotland"
Jack Ross, manager of Sunderland, claims his greatest goal is to become head of Scotland at some point.
Scott, 42, has accepted the challenge to rebuild the Northeast Club, which currently ranks third in the first league with three points from the top.
This summer, he moved to Stadium of Light after directing St Mirren back into the Scottish Premier League last season.
"As a player I wanted to play for my country.
I won the B Cup, and that was all," Ross told Scotland's BBC transmission Sportsound.
"But I grew up watching the Scotland games at Hampden Park with my father, and it has always invited me to come back.
However, such an opportunity would only appear if I was successful in running the club."
Ross' predecessors in running the Sunderland club are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former chief of Alloa Athletic claims to have not felt the commotion, following in the footsteps of such a large club's recognized managers, having previously rejected the offers made by Barnsley and Ipswich.
"My success will now be assessed by whether I will be able to return this club to the premier league.
Because of the structure and opportunities of this club, it undoubtedly fits into the premier league," he said.
"Returning the club to the premier league will not be an easy task, but I'm more likely to believe that I'll only be successful here once that task is accomplished."
Ross is only for the third year of his career as manager, previously acting for some time as deputy director at Dumbarton and spending a period of 15 months as part of the Hearts coaches.
He then helped club Alloa recover from falling to the third tier and helped St Mirren win the title the same season.
Ross claims that he feels much more comfortable at the moment than during his player career at clubs Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a true crossroads," he recalls, taking responsibility over Alloa.
"I really believed management was my real call — much more appropriate than playing.
Sounds strange because I was successful, could live from it and enjoy certain heights.
But playing can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot of things every week.
I still feel it because of work-related stress and pressure, but management is my field.
I've always wanted to lead and now I'm doing it. I think I'm in the right place, I haven't felt so good all my life."

The survey found that the best time to enjoy the pint is 5.30 pm on Saturday afternoon.
The summer heat wave has caused Britain's less popular pubs to shrink, but it has increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The aggregated data revealed that in July, sales of pubs and bars had increased by 2.7 percent, but in restaurants they had decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, who represents the business consulting agency CGA that collected the data, said, "The continuing sunny weather and England's protracted participation in the World Cup meant that July had a similar trend to June, namely that pub profits had increased by 2.8 percent, while restaurants experienced a decline.
Restaurants, whose trade dropped 1.8 percent in June, experienced an even more severe situation in July.
The situation in drink pubs and bars was most grateful, as they experienced a much larger uphill than restaurants experienced a downhill.
Food - based pubs also suffered from the sun, but not as dramatically as restaurant workers felt.
It seemed that people just wanted to go out for some drink.
Sales of drinks in pubs and bars increased by 6.6 percent per month while food sales dropped by 3 percent."
RSM recreation and hospitality analyst Paul Newman said, "These results continue the trend observed in late April.
The weather conditions and the impact of a wide range of social or sporting events are the major factors determining the turnover outside the home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to fight, although the drop in sales by 4.8 percent compared to the respective period of the previous year will be particularly painful for the additional constant cost pressure.
For food providers, the long and hot summer could not come at an even more inappropriate moment, and the time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we usually experience in August will provide much-needed respite."
The total increase in sales among pubs and restaurants, including new companies, reached 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a decline in brand sales.
The "Coffer Peach Tracker", the sales supervisor for the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector, collects and analyzes data from 47 business groups with a total turnover of over £9 billion and this has incorporated the industry criterion.
One in five children has a secret social media account that it hides from its parents
The survey reveals that one in five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, has a secret social media account, which they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in fake Instagram pages.
This news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "main" account to show to their parents.
One in five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, create social media accounts they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed that fake profiles were growing rapidly on the photo sharing site Instagram.
This news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students mentioned that they had a "pure main" account to show to parents, and also private accounts.
A mother who stumbled upon the secret site of her 13 - year - old daughter discovered a teenager who encouraged others to rape her.
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent School Leaders Conference (HMC) revealed that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, with only half of them admitting to maintaining private accounts.
HMC chief executive Mike Buchanan claimed, "It's scary that so many teenagers make online profiles where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eileid Doyle will be a "lightly-talked voice" on the Scottish Athletics Board
Eilidh Doyle's annual general meeting of the board was elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as a non-executive director.
Doyle is Scotland's most awarded indoor and outdoor athlete, and chairman Ian Beattie described this step as a great opportunity for those who are driven by sport to take advantage of her extensive experience at international level over the past decade.
"Eiles is being given enormous respect throughout the Scottish, UK and worldwide athletic community, and we are confident that Scottish athletes will gain an enormous amount by engaging them on the board," Beatty said.
Doyle mentioned, "I want to act as a 'light-hearted voice' and hope I can really get involved and help direct this sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres event at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, thus winning a total of four Olympic gold medals, and is currently a regular BBC pandit, was unable to pass after a transient ischaemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "On this day a month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors claimed that only time would tell if and to what extent I would recover.
It was a terrible job, but I fully recovered, learned to walk again and can do dexterity drills today!
Thank you for your inspiring words!"
Opinions are divided on breast milk pump advertising, which compares mothers to cows
The breast milk pumping company has taken care of shared views online in relation to advertising comparing nursing mothers with milking cows.
To mark the release of the so-called "world's first silent breast pump", consumer technology company "Elvie" released an ad for a sticky blacksmith to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump provides to breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a wall-filled cowhouse at a song whose words read roughly like this: "Yes, I wipe myself out, but you don't see any tail" and "if you haven't noticed, they're not udders, they're my breasts".
The song continues, "Suck out, suck out, I feed babies, suck out, suck out, I sweep my ladies."
However, advertising published on the company's Facebook page has brought widespread resonance online.
The 77,000 times viewed and hundreds of times commented video has received shared audience reviews, and many claim that it highlights the "horror" of the dairy industry in the light.
"The very wrong decision to use cows for advertising the product.
Just like us, they have to get tough and give birth to milk in order to produce milk, but their babies are taken away from them a few days after they were born," someone wrote.
"Elvie" breast milk pump unobtrusively falls in the breast of breastfeeding women (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment states, "I understand it's traumatic for both mother and baby.
But why not use them to advertise the breast milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
There was also such an opinion: "The advertisers didn't know what they were doing."
Others defended the ad, and one woman admitted that she felt the song was "enjoying".
"I think it's an excellent idea.
I'd buy one if I were still breast-feeding.
The sucking of milk made me feel just like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I understood the idea behind it.
This is a genius product," someone wrote.
Another comment states: "It's a fun ad, meant for moms who are sweeping milk (unused at workplaces or toilets) and feel like a "cow".
It is not advertising that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the ad, a group of women discover that they were all dancing with the inconspicuous pumps placed in their bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the observation that many women who sweep milk claim to feel like cows.
But the "Elvie Pump" pump is completely quiet, it has no wires and tubes, and it is unobtrusively part of the breast for breastfeeding women, allowing them to move freely, keep babies and even participate in events outside the house.
Anna Balarin's partner and creative director of "Mother" commented: "Elvie Pump pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative placing on the market.
By drawing parallel between women who milk and dairy cows, we wanted to pay attention to milk milking, while demonstrating in an entertaining and understandable way the staggering sense of freedom that the new pump will carry."
It's not the first time the "Elvie pump" pump has come to the spotlight.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the tongue in a show of Martha Jakubowski using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent campus at the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has increased rapidly, although relatively many people cross the border every month as before, partly due to harsh rhetoric and policies by the Trump administration that have made it difficult for children to be housed with sponsors.
Generally, most sponsors have also been undocumented immigrants themselves, fearing that by openly applying for a child to be admitted, this will threaten their ability to remain in the country.
The risk increased in June when federal officials announced that potential sponsors and other members of their household would have to be allowed to take fingerprints, and this data would also be passed on to other authorities related to immigration.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs enforcement official, testified before the convention that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsors of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not been previously punished.
"Nearly 80 percent of the individuals who are either sponsors or members of the sponsor's household are staying here illegally, and much of these individuals are criminal aliens.
So we continue to pursue such persons," Mr Albens stated.
According to asylum workers, officials have introduced new rules in an effort to deal with children's cases more quickly, requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of detention rather than after 60 days, as the previous standard required.
Many will use the video conference call option instead of coming in person to defend their legal status before an immigration judge.
Persons who will be considered unfit for release will be swiftly expelled.
The longer children are held in custody, the more likely they are to become restless or depressed, which may lead to violent attacks or attempts to flee, reportedly according to information provided by asylum workers and evidence retrieved from the system in recent months.
Advocates claimed that these concerns would be exacerbated in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where signs that the child is suffering are more often overlooked due to their breadth.
They added that moving children to a tent campus without taking enough time for their emotional preparation or the opportunity to let their friends say goodbye could cause injuries that many are already struggling with.
Syria forces the "occupant armies" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country has been going on for the eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, claimed that foreign forces are in Syria illegally under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "this will be addressed accordingly".
"They must resign immediately and unconditionally," he told the Assembly.
Moualem insisted that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been forced to leave their homes, "the war on terrorism is almost over".
He stated that Damascus would continue to "fight in the holy war until all Syrian territories are cleared", cleared of both terrorist groups and "any foreign military presence".
The United States has deployed about 2,000 troops to Syria who mainly train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opponents of President Bashar Al Asad.
France has sent over 1,000 men to this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Mualham stated that the circumstances had been great for them to return, and blamed "separate Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" which made refugees unwilling to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"These people are politicizing what should only be a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive aid for the reconstruction of the country before an agreement is reached between Asad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats explain that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone at the foot of the last rebels in Idlib has created an opportunity to speed up political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on a province of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement "has set deadlines", and expressed hope that military action would be directed against the Jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-affiliated group "Jabhat al Nusrah" who would "be destroyed".
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of the new committee, which will include government and opposition representatives, to draft the Syrian constitution for the post-war period and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian state's participation in the committee, stressing that the group's work should be limited to "revising the articles of the existing constitution", and warned of interference.
Why Trump Will Be Elected to a Second Term
From this point of view, Mr Trump will be re-elected in the 2020 election, unless, and this is probably hoped for by many liberal spectators, impeachment and scandal will not prematurely put an end to his presidency.
And in that case, "it will be the most dramatic Presidency finale ever!"
At the moment, there is no sign of the waning of the observers.
As of 2014, ratings at most favorable CNN broadcast time have more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million viewers, while at MSNBC they have almost tripled, reaching 1.6 million viewers.
Fox News' most favorable broadcast time starring 2.4 million viewers, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, informs the company Nielsen, while MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" (the Rachel Medow Show) is at its highest spot in the cable rating with 3.5 million main-news viewers in the evening.
"It's a fire that attracts a lot of people because it's an incomprehensible thing for us," explained Neal Baer, the backing of the ABC drama Designated Survivor. This drama tells the story of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack is destroyed by the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a comedy writer-veteran and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club" has her own theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The manager told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
She wanted to know why.
"He replied, 'Because he's laughing at me,'" said Miss Scowell.
Chaos is entertaining to some extent.
Of course, unlike everything else seen on TV, news from Washington could determine what will happen with the Rou v. Wade judgment, whether immigrant families will be able to unite, and the state of the global economy.
Ignoring is a luxury that only the most privileged observers can afford.
And yet it is more than being an informed citizen when, at six o'clock, you watch a group of experts discuss how Bob Woodward has used unnamed sources of information for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000-dollar bomber-type jacket from ostrich feathers and leather ("the outfit from which the arrogance sucks," stated "Washington Post") and what role Stormy Daniels will play in the passionate description of Mr. Trump, so to speak, of the anatomical details.
I, for example, will never again take Super Mario the way before.
"Part of what he does, which makes the impression of the reality show, is that he bestows information on you every day," Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the show Pawn Stars, explained about Trump's show's changing team and everyday twists (queen with N.F.L., Kim Chenun's glorification).
You can't afford to miss even one episode, because you'll be behind otherwise.
When I got to Mr. Fleiss that week, the time on the north coast of Kauai was sunny,80 degrees (~27 Celsius), but he was sitting in rooms where, without a glance, he was watching the MSNBC broadcast, while recording CNN.
He was unable to stand down, not when Brett Kavanaugh had to stand before the Senate Judiciary Committee and his future in the Supreme Court is threatening to stop.
"I remember the times when we made all those crazy shows and when people claimed that 'this is the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleis told me.
"I think it's such a joke, but it turns out they were right."

The money flows from outside into the pre-election campaigns of the most tense parliamentary interim elections
No wonder Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional constituency aims to receive money thanks to the conversion of Congressional districts, which will result in two existing MPs fighting for one seat.
This newly converted outskirts of Pittsburgh is affiliated with Democrat Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in a special election last spring in another district.
Lamb will fight another existing MP, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally divided in favor of the Republicans, the maps were revised.
Competition in the new 17th District has sparked a battle between the main financial groups of the parties: the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee and the National Republican Campaign Committee.
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania when he won the widely watched March election at Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional Precinct by a slight margin.
The seat had been held by Republicans for over 10 years, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Policy experts predict Democrats a slight lead.
The U.S. considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but then changed its mind
Diplomats admitted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing without much pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and stayed at a hotel in Panama until partners put out behind the door the Trump organization's management team.
State Department officials decided to withdraw heads of United States diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama, on the grounds of "the recent decision no longer to recognize Taiwan", its department's spokeswoman, Heather Nauert, stated in a statement earlier this month.
However, penalties were considered to be limited to El Salvador, which received an amount of about 140 million from America in 2017, including for drug control, development, and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which would include reducing financial assistance and restricting targeted visas, would be painful for a Central American country where unemployment and murder have reached its highest level.
In the course of internal meetings, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic well-being, which would have followed a similar meeting last year, which was recognized as an rapprochement effort to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
In mid-September, senior officials of the country made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, essentially ending the considerations completely to punish El Salvador.
Diplomats informed that Vice President Mike Pence now decided to attend the conference scheduled for mid-October to show how seriously the administration emphasizes the meeting.
And three American ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new and serious statements or penalties from Washington.
The White House spokesperson, who spoke on behalf of Mr Bolton, did not want to give more information about the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to consult in internal negotiations if their anonymity was maintained.
Their narration was testified to the administration by a close external analyst who also spoke on the condition that his anonymity be maintained.
Studying History
A second stone in the garden could be a report by special prosecutor Robert Mueller that Mr. Trump may have obstructed justice, which has a great deal of evidence at the public disposal.
It is alleged that Mr. Miller will also investigate whether the Trump campaign has secretly cooperated with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the other party prevails in Congress, Trump will have to answer this body and perhaps his fellow jury just at the moment when he is about to meet voters again.
There's a lot of "but" and I don't argue that Trump's fall is inevitable or that it will happen to his associates in Europe.
There are choices that we will have to make on both sides of the Atlantic, and these choices will show the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to make a coup against Hitler, if only the West had opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years-long carnage.
History revolves around such turning points, and the unstoppable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans now have to face a number of such turning points.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Miller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been having a hard time since it was reported that last year he suggested that he secretly record a conversation with the president and wondered about his unfitness for office.
Mr. Rosenstein claims the story of The Times is not accurate.
"How do we respond if the newly requested FBI investigation into Brett Caveno is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed for the post of a Supreme Court judge despite his unfair testimony and credible allegations of sexual assault?
And, most importantly, will we vote in the interim election of Congress, which will call Trump to account?
If we do not pass all these tests, democracy will come to a long winter.
But I believe that we will succeed by referring to what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once lived in my embassy house.
She survived, emigrated America, and 60 years later sent me to light Sabbath candles on the table with a swastika.
How can I not be optimistic about our future if I have such a legacy?"

"Rangers" star Grem Dorans (Graham Dorrans) feels optimistic about fighting the Vienna Rapid
The Rangers will host the Vienna Rapid on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians after the impressive draw game in Spain with Villarreal earlier this month will allow them to take a stable position to qualify from the Europa League Group G.
Road injury prevented center striker Grem Dorans from resuming to participate in season games until the draw with 2:2 with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this score as a springboard to achieve even more.
"We can be happy about this because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old footballer.
"We went into the game believing we'd be able to make good progress, and we got that point.
Perhaps we could have beaten them in the end, but the overall draw is an honest result.
They were probably better at the first half time, but we loosened at the second half time and were a better team.
And Thursday will be another important night for Europe.
Hopefully, we will get three points, but it will not be an easy game, because they got a good result in the previous game, but I am sure that, with the help of our supporters, we will be able to continue to fight and achieve good results.
The last year, with all my injuries and changes in the club itself, was clearly heavy, but now there are new breezes that I feel good about.
The team is great, and the guys enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope we can continue the fight, leave the past season behind and succeed."
Women cannot sleep because they are worried about their pension savings
Although the respondents knew clearly what kind of care they wanted, few had discussed the matter with family members.
About half of the individuals in a nationwide study indicated that they did not talk to a mate about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent replied that they had talked to their children about it.
"People want to be cared for by family members, but don't do anything to pronounce it," Holly Snyder, vice president of the National Life Insurance Agency, reveals.
This is where we should start.
Talk to your spouse and your children. You cannot prepare your family for the need for care if you do not make your wishes known well in advance.
Collaborate with your consultant and family to discuss where and how to get care, as these choices can be an important factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial advisor. Your consultant can also help you figure out how to cover these costs.
Your ability to provide long-term care funding may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid insurance policy with the amount of money to cover these costs, or a provision through your property — the main thing for you to have money.
Make your legal documents. Prevent legal battles before they start.
Talk to your health representative so that you can have a reliable person who will monitor your health care and ensure that experts act in accordance with your wishes if you are unable to express them on your own.
Consider also the possibility of conferring a mandate on finance.
Choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf, who will take care of paying your bills if you are unable to do so on your own.
And don't forget the seemingly small details! Imagine that one of your elderly parents is being taken to the hospital for emergency treatment.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Set out these facts in a written plan so that such a situation does not surprise you.
"And it's not just about finances, it's also about who the doctor is," Martina said.
"What are the medicines used?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Make sure such a plan is in place."

Police described the shooting at around 2.30 p.m. BST as "accidental".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries do not endanger his life, and police are calling for witnesses to apply.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to the government, a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Pala on Friday have killed at least 384 people. The death toll is expected to increase.
Due to the ruined communications, rescuers have been unable to obtain any information from the Dongal (Donggala) area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
Over 16,000 people in Palu were evacuated following the devastating natural disaster.
Here's a background on Pala and Dongal, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island. It is estimated that in 2017 it had a population of 379,800 people.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when an earthquake and tsunami broke out.
Dongala is an area extending about 300 km (180 miles) along the northwest coast of Sulawesi Island.
It is estimated that the district, which is an administrative region part of the province, had a population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the economic pillar of Central Sulawesi Province, especially in the coastal Dongal area.
Nickel mining also plays an important role in the province, but is mainly concentrated on the opposite shore of Morovali (Morowali), Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Prevention Agency, Palu and Dongala have suffered several tsunamis in the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongal.
Tsunami also overthrew over the western part of Dongal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is in the seismically active Pacific fire ring, which regularly produces earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of Aceh Province in northern Sumatra on December 26 sparked a tsunami affecting 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of which were in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, Nia, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake erupted in Java, Indonesia's most populous island, south, causing a tsunami that hit the south coast, thus killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake erupted near the town of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of Mentawai's islands off the coast of Sumatra, causing tsunami waves up to 10 meters high that devastated dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: An earthquake close to the surface struck the area of Pidi Jaya in Aceh, causing damage and panic as it recalled the destruction carried with it by the 2004 devastating earthquakes and tsunamis.
This time, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapsed buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes struck the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and temporarily prevented hundreds of tourists from returning home.
Sarah Peilin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Peelin, has been arrested because he was charged with assault.
According to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, 29-year-old Peelin, who lives in Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence and resistance to arrest.
According to a police report, when an acquaintance-woman tried to call the police to report, as she claimed, the crimes that occurred, he took away the phone from her.
Peelin has been detained at Mat-Su's pre-trial detention facility and has a US$500 bail on him, reports KTUU.
He appeared before a court on Saturday, where, when asked about whether or not he found himself guilty, he stated that he was "certainly not guilty".
Peelin has been charged with three Class A offenses, for which he may face a year-long prison sentence and a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with class B misconduct, for which a day-long prison sentence and a US$2,000 fine can be obtained.
It is not the first time criminal charges have been brought against Peelin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father Todd Peelin.
His mother, Sarah Peelin, called the police and reported that an attack had taken place.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, obstructing the report on domestic violence and carrying a drunken weapon in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claims he hits it with a fist in the face.
In 2016, veteran groups expressed criticism of Sarah Peilin for linking her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress syndrome, returning from service in Iraq.
Tsunami of earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian islands of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and has devastated thousands of dwellings.
Electricity and communication networks have been destroyed and the number of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake broke out near central Sulawesi, southeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos showing the moment of a collision are spreading on social networks.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when a tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors want to demand the imposition of the rarely used death penalty on a person suspected of a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors want to demand the execution of Saijfullo Saipov, who is suspected of a terrorist attack in New York City when eight people were killed, a rare form of punishment that has not been committed in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
It is claimed that 30-year-old Saipov used a "Home Depot" rental car to carry out an attack on a cycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October, where he hit pedestrians and a cyclist on his way.
To justify the execution, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused a serious injury, as mentioned in the notice of intent to claim the death penalty filed in the Southern District Court of New York.
According to a court document, the death penalty can be imposed in the case of both of these charges.
Within weeks of the attack, the federal grand jury passed an indictment article on Saipov's prosecution of 22 charges, which included eight charges of murder for extortion, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as charges of cruelty and damage to motor vehicles.
The attack required "significant planning and prior intention", explained prosecutors, citing that Saipov's assault was "sharp, ruthless and inhuman".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov wounded, harmed and caused damage to the families and friends of these people: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Anna-Lorie Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Ernan Ferruchi, Ernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci," the statement of intent states.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since prosecutors in the Southern District Court of New York implemented the charge in a case that could result in the death penalty.
The accused, Kalid Barnes, was tried for the murder of two drug suppliers, but he was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in 2009.
The death penalty was last executed in New York City in a federal case in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple sentenced to death after being charged with complicity in espionage during the Soviet Union's favor of the Cold War two years ago.
The Rosenberg couple were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, as days and months went by, Uzbekistan-born Saipov showed no remorse for the attack carried out.
According to the police, he has stated to the investigators that he feels good about what he did.
According to an indictment article, Saipov told officials that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police informed that he had also asked for permission to display the ISIS flag in his chamber.
He has rejected a 22-indictment article.
David Patton, one of the federal public advocates representing Saipova, said he was "just naturally frustrated" about the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the intention to demand the death penalty rather than to accept guilt in exchange for life imprisonment without the right to release will only prolong the ongoing resulting injury to all involved parties," Patton explained.
Saipov's defense team has previously called for prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.
Conservative MP declares that the management of Brexit must be entrusted to NAIJEL FARRAGE
Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the nation's army" during a protest today at a Conservative conference.
The former leader of the British Independent Party stated that politicians should feel the anger of the Eurosceptics when one of the MPs of Theresa May suggested that negotiations with the EU should be entrusted to him.
Conservative lineup member Peter Bone told the march in Birmingham that Britain would have withdrawn long ago if Mr Farage were Brexit's minister.
However, the challenge that Mrs May will have to face in trying to rally her controversial party was demonstrated by the Conservatives, who support remaining in the EU and joined a stand-alone city protest against Brexit.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain her compromise plan on the future relationship between Britain and the European Union (Chequers compromise) and is facing attacks from those who want to leave the EU, from those who want to remain in the EU, and also from the EU itself.
The allies insisted that she would make a determined effort to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the negative reaction, and would make Eurosceptics and Labour choose between her bid and "chaos".
Mr. Boun stated at a "Leave Means Leave" (Exit means withdrawal) rally in Solihull that he wanted to throw away May's plan in the dungeon (to chuck Chequers).
He proposed making Mr Farage an ally and entrusting him with negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been at the saying, we would have already withdrawn," Boun stated.
A member of Parliament from Wellingborough added, "I will support Brexit, but we have to dump the May Plan!"
In support of his opposition to the EU, he said, "We did not fight to be crews!
We want to make our own laws in our country!"
Mr. Bouna ignored the assumptions that public opinion may have changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is absolutely false."
Brexit's supporter, Andrea Jenkyns, also took part in the march, and told reporters, "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is not popular with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and our supporters, who actually do all the work and elect us.
Please give up Chequers and start listening."
In a message directed at May, she added, "Prime ministers remain in place when they fulfill their promises."
Mr Farage said politicians present at the rally should feel pressure if they are going to ignore the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's a matter of trust between us — people — and our politicians," he said.
"They're trying to hand over Brexit and we're here today to tell them we're not going to let that happen."
In his message to an enthusiastic crowd of people, he fills: "I want you to let our politicians who are planning to pass on Brexit feel the pressure.
"We will call on the people of this country who allowed us to win the fight for Brexit, and never relax until we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the Stayers marched through Birmingham before a two-hour rallies were held in the city centre.
ignorant activists greeted the Conservatives with anti-Brexit banners after the group met this weekend.
A spokesman for the Workers' Party, Lord Adonis, mocked the Conservatives for the security issues they experienced with the party's app at the start of the conference.
"These are the people who claim to us that they are able to maintain the order of the IT system and all their technology for Canada and more and more, for undivided border, for free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
"It's an absolute farce.
There is no such thing as a successful Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to carefully consider running for President of the United States
election. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "carefully consider" running for the United States presidential election after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke on Saturday about her future at West Massachusetts City Hall.
Warren, who frequently criticizes President Donald Trump, is in a re-election in November and is standing against GOP state Republican Geoff Deal, who was Trump's 2016 vice-president of the Massachusetts campaign.
It is speculated that she will be the main one to dare stand against Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon event Holyoke had her 36th meeting with voters using the city's town hall since Trump took office.
A visitor asked her if she was planning to stand for presidential elections.
To which Warren replied that it was the right time for "Washington to have women who would 'find' the imperfect government, which also means woman-presidents."

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the team lets him beat Sebastian Fettel
From the moment Walter Botas qualifies on Saturday before Lewis Hamilton it became clear that Mercedes' team work would play an important role in the race.
From the start, Botas started well and nearly left Hamilton dry, defending his place in the first two runs and invited Fethel to attack his teammate.
Fetel first entered the garage and left Hamilton in the drives to deal with the others, it was most likely decisive.
Mercedes pilot filled a circle later and fell behind Fetel, but Hamilton continued to rise to the leaders after balancing forces, which saw Ferrari driver persistently leave inside free, risking to lag behind after a double maneuver to defend in the third corner.
Max Verstapen started from the back row and was seventh on his 21st birthday at the end of the first lap.
He then was in the lead for a large part of the race as he focused tyres to quickly reach the finish and overtake Kimi Raikonen in fourth.
He eventually arrived at the garage on lap 44, but was unable to increase his speed on the remaining eight laps as Raikonen remained fourth.
This is a hard day, because Walters did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman.
The team did an extremely important job to get one two," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diana Feinstein at Saturday's rallies for her persistence in not disclosing Christine Blaisy Ford's letter in which she accuses Supreme Court candidate Brett Caveno of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a rallies in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about Ford's testimony, which it gave to the Senate's legal commission, but made a comment that what happened in the Senate shows that people there are "evil, nasty and unreliable."
"One that can happen and something beautiful that already happens in the last few days in the Senate, when there is anger, when you see angry, evil, nasty and unreliable people," he said.
"When you read the press releases and the leaked information and then they say, 'Oh, no, I didn't.
I didn't."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak the information?
Remember her answer to the question...Did you leak the document? — "Oh, oh, what did I do?"
Oh, no.
I didn't."
All right, hold on a second.
Did we do it...No, we didn't," he added, in the Senator's intonation.
A letter was sent to Feinstein in July explaining in detail what Ford accuses Caveno of, and the contents of the letter were disclosed in early September, but Feinstein denies it would have happened in her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't leak her story," Feinstein told the commission, reports "The Hill".
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I did."
But her denial disliked the president, who commented on the situation at the Saturday evening rallies as follows: "I'll tell you it was a very bad body language.
Perhaps she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
While continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate, who is accused by three women of sexual harassment, the president suggested that Democrats use the charges for their own benefit.
"They are purposeful to regain power by any means."
Do you see the evil, the nasty, they don't care what they hurt, what they have to destroy in order to gain power and control," the President says in "Mediaite".

The Giants got an early lead when Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bovillier scored the goals.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowney, under the leadership, nominated the homers before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Franz Buhard equalised the score for Dundee before two words scored by Lucas Lundwald Neilsen secured the team's victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League this season to the Adam Keefes guys who won the Dundee on Friday night by 2 to 1.

Air traffic controller dies, allowing hundreds of people on board to escape during earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is lauded as a hero after he sacrificed himself to have the plane take off safely from land with hundreds of passengers.
Over 800 people have died and many are missing after a powerful earthquake on Friday rocked Sulawesi Island, causing a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue in the area and many are trapped in mud in the city of Palu.
However, despite his colleagues saving their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Ganavan Agung refused to leave his job at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in the control tower of Palu Airport, which swayed strongly.
He remained at his post to make sure that on board Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would safely take off in the air.
He then jumped off the traffic control tower, thinking it could collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Indonesian air navigation spokesman, Johannes Sirait, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC news reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Pala.
"We are heartbroken at hearing it", he fills.
Meanwhile, state authorities are concerned that the death toll could reach thousands, the state's disaster prevention agency claims that access to Dongalas, Sigi and Butangao (Boutong) is limited.
"It is believed that beautiful will grow as many more people's bodies are under the rubble, as well as many cannot be accessed," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves reaching a height of 6 metres devastated Pala, which will host a massive funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft continue to supply assistance and necessary goods.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, "Sky News" said, "It's every minute the ambulance brings in new victims.
Clean water is a deficit.
Small shops are stuffed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN, "The Indonesian Red Cross rushes to help the survivors, but we don't know what we're going to find there.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can all get worse."
On Sunday, Indonesian President Yoko Widodo arrived in Palu and told the country's military bring in, "I ask you to work day and night to accomplish all the tasks pertaining to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was already rocked by earthquakes in Lomboca this year, which killed more than 550 people.
Airplane Disaster in Micronesia: Now "Air Niugini" says one of the people has disappeared after an airplane disaster in the lagoon
The airline made a flight during which it fell on a plane in the Pacific lagoon of Micronesia and now claims that one of the people had disappeared, although it was reported before that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini announced in a press release on Saturday afternoon that they could not answer for one of the passengers, a man.
The airline announced it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the missing man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more detailed information on the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local residents with boats helped save other passengers and crew after the plane fell into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials, Friday, said seven people were hospitalized.
The airline stated that six people remained in hospital until Saturday, and all of them are in stable condition.
The causes of the crash and the sequence of events remain unclear.
The airliner and the U.S. navy report that the plane fell into the lagoon shortly after takeoff from the runway.
Some eyewitnesses felt that the plane overestimated the length of the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane was very low.
"It was really very good," said Janes.
Janes says he and other passengers were able to get out of the sinking plane using emergency exits as the water was just up to the waist.
He said that the stewardesses panicked and shouted, as well as that he had an easy head injury.
U.S. navy sailors who worked nearby to improve the ship's pier also helped in rescue efforts by using an inflatable boat to bring people ashore before the plane sank about 30 metres (100 ft) underwater.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died on PNG registered airlines in the past twenty years, none related to "Air Niugini".
Psychoanalysis commentator explains the course of events during the night in which a woman was burned alive
The indictment on Saturday provided evidence in the retrial case, where the man is accused of burning a living woman in 2014.
U.S. Department of Judicial Expertise Psychoanalysis commentator Paul Rowlet testified for several hours as a witness expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He outlined to the jury how he used the information obtained from the phone to put together how 29-year-old accused Quinton Telis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers acted on the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several phones suggesting that Telis was with Chambers on the evening of her death, challenging his previous testimony, reported "The Clarion Ledger".
When data showed that his phone was at Chambers at a time when he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to question Sanford.
Sanford testified in the courtroom on Saturday that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecution asked if Telis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said he was "melling because my car was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy was that Telis said he knew Chambers only about two weeks after she died.
The phone records show that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said a bit after Chambers died, Telis erased text messages, calls and contact details received from Chambers from his phone.
"He erased him from his life," said Hale.
The defenses are expected to deliver their final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to be handed over to jurors later that day.
Group "The High Breed": What is conscious hip-hop?
The Hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative views of this music genre, with their music giving a positive message.
"The High Breed", from Bristol, claims that hip-hop deviated from its origins on messages of a political nature and such when dealing with problems of a social nature.
The band wants to return to the genre's roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent revival in the UK with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Black again?!
In New York, a babysitter has sued the couple for dismissal after receiving a "racist" message
In New York, a babysitter has sued a couple for discriminating dismissal after she received an erroneously sent text message from her mother, who has complained that the babysitter "is black again."
The couple deny that they would be racists, likening the trial to "extortion".
Lindsey Plasco-Flacksman, the mother of two children, expressed her rejection by learning that the young child caregiver, Gisele Mauris, was black when she came to work for the first day in 2016.
"IN THE WEEK, OPEN BLACK," Plasko-Flacksman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, she sent a message not to her husband but to Mauritius, and twice.
Realizing their awkwardness, the "smacked" Plasco-Flacksman discount Mauris, stating that their previous nanny, who was an African American woman, did a bad job and that she was said to have been waiting for the Filipino, referring to the New York Post.
Maurie was paid for her one weekday and sent home with Uber.
Maurie has now sued the couple, claiming compensation for dismissal, and wants to receive $350 a day for six months of work with secured living, to which she initially applied, and without a contract of employment.
"I want to show them that such things don't do," she said to the Post on Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple reject accusations that they were racist, arguing that the termination of Maurie's employment was a reasonable decision because they feared that they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
"My wife sent her what she didn't mean to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco, husband, said "Post".
"But would you entrust your children to someone whom you treated rudely, even if it happened only by mistake?
Your newborn?
Think about it."
Comparing the hearing to "extortion", Plasco said his wife had only given birth to the baby two months ago and was in a very "complicated situation".
"You're really targeting someone this way?
This is not an acceptable action," added the investment banker.
While proceedings are still ongoing, public opinion quickly courts across social networks, derogating them for their behavior and logical thinking.
A new letter reveals that Paddington's book publishers were concerned that readers would not be able to associate with a talking bear
Bond's daughter Karen Jenkel, who was born shortly before the book was approved, said of the letter, "It's hard to put yourself in someone's shoes" who reads the book for the first time before it is published.
It's very surprising to find out now what we know about Paddington's great success."
Telling that her father, who worked as an operator on the BBC before feeling inspired to write a book for children about a small teddy bear, was optimistic that his work would be rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was "sweetly bitter" after his father passed away last year.
Speaking of Paddington, who she calls "a very important member of the family", her father was quietly proud of her eventual success.
"He was a quiet, quiet man and was not boastful," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a kid who achieves something: you're proud even if you haven't done it yourself.
I think he looked at Paddington's success in a similar way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always gave all merit to Paddington himself."
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone
After a touchdown, her daughter was taken with the ambulances to Nice Hospital in Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors were constantly fighting for her life.
"Neds called regularly and said she was very bad and expected to not survive," said Ednan-Laperousa.
"Then I got a call from Ned, saying she would die within the next two minutes and I have to say goodbye to her.
And that's what I did.
I said, "That's it, I love you very much, darling.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicine that doctors gave her to maintain her heart rate slowly ceased and left her body.
She would have died even sooner and it all ended now.
I had to sit down and wait, knowing that all of this was happening.
I couldn't howl or scream because I was in a situation where there are families and people around.
I needed a lot of strength to temper."
After all, then already a daughter's loss grieving, Ednan-Laperous boarded the plane with other passengers who had no idea what she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I stabbed my head down and tears flowed all the time.
It is difficult to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt deep sympathy for Ned.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women attach cards on bridges to prevent suicide
Two women whose loved ones have committed suicide act to help others not to take their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hamfrey strengthen cards at Welsh Bridge with an inspiring message and phone numbers so people can call and get support.
Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, but he committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to have to experience what I have every day," she said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with an addictive smile.
"Everyone recognized him after a smile.
Everyone always said his smile "lit out" always and everywhere."
However, he gave up his job before he died because he was "in a very, very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time. was the one who found him after Tyler had committed suicide.
Davis said, "I am constantly worried that this will have consequences."
Davis created cards, "to make it clear that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
You don't have to sit in silence — you have to talk."
Hamfrey, who has been a friend of Davis for years, lost Mark, her spouse for 15 years, shortly after his mom died.
"He didn't say he would feel sad or be depressed or anything quotes would feel," she said.
"Some days before Christmas, we noticed that his attitude had changed.
He reached his lowest point on Christmas morning — when the children opened gifts he did not make eye contact with them or anything like that."
His death was a major injury to the children, but they have to deal with it: "It irritates the whole family.
That's what makes us different.
But we must all continue and fight."

Bret Caveno's future hangs in the air as the FBI launches an investigation
"I think if we could really get what he's asking for — in terms of time and scope in a limited investigation — we'd probably be able to reach a small consensus," Flake stated on Saturday, adding that he is concerned that the commission is "dividing" between fortified guerrilla arrivals.
Why do Caveno and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their abstention is only a coincidence.
The by-election is in five weeks' time, on November 6 — if the Republicans are expected to go bad, then their attempts will be much weaker to elect a man from among themselves to the highest court.
George W. Bush calls the Senators, lobbying them to support Caveno, who worked at the White House during Bush's time and thanks to him met his wife Ashley, who was President Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 seats currently belong to the Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear if Caveno can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to settle the vote and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
Kim's leadership has "reduced" North Korea's number of political asylum seekers
North Korea's number of political asylum seekers in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong came to power seven years ago, the South Korean legislature said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea's unification ministry, said there were 1,127 political asylum seekers last year, compared to 2011, when they numbered 2706.
Park said tighter border controls star North Korea and China and high rates of human smugglers are key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of political asylum seekers from North Korea are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most travel through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarization Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers political asylum seekers to be illegal immigrants and deports them forcibly.
Relations between North Korea and South Korea, which remain technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss delayed denuclerisation negotiations.
This came after a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jongun in Singapore, when, on large trains, they agreed to work together to rid the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions since these negotiations were not progressing.
"If there is no confidence in the United States, there will be no faith in the security of our country, and under such circumstances we will by no means disarm unilaterally first," said Ri in his address at the UN General Assembly in New York."
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Caveno "histeric" and claims he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
The House's minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, called Supreme Court candidate Brett Caveno "histeric" and claimed he was unfit to serve in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman had behaved like this, they would call her "histerical," said Pelosi about her reaction to Caveno's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Caveno emotionally denied charges of sexual harassment to Dr. Christina Blaisy Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his starting argument, Caveno was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and smoking, talking about his family and high school years.
He particularly condemned the Democrats in the commission, calling the charges against him "grotesque and concerted destruction of the character" organised by the Liberals, who are angry at Hillary Clinton's loss in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that she believes Caveno's testimony is a justification for not being able to serve on the Supreme Court because it shows that he has a bilateral attitude towards Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with such allegations and attitudes with which he targets Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi objected when asked if she would attempt to question Caveno if he was confirmed and if Democrats obtained a majority in the House of Commons.
"I'll say so — if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not fit for office not only in the Supreme Court, but also to work at the existing workplace in the court," said Pelosi.
Caveno, currently, is a judge on the Washington County Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added saying that as a Democrat, she is worried about the possibility that Caveno makes decisions against the "Affordable Care Act" or Roe v. Wade because she is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation talks, Caveno bypassed questions as to whether he would reject Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not a good time for a hysterical and bizarre man to work in court, but we'd be expected to be happy to say, 'Isn't that wonderful?', said Pelosi.
But women must hold themselves in their hands.
It's a denunciation, for months and years, all accumulated "over the edges", but she's not allowed to get it all out of herself crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Ms. Steinham told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's anything unusual, what do you think?"
She continued, "Once I was very helped by a woman who was herself a manager in a company who said she too wept when she was angry but made a technique — when she got angry and began to cry, she stated to the person she talked to, "You can think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm mad."
And then she kept going.
And I thought it was great."
Tears are only partially recognized as a type of discharge of anger, as they have been misunderstood fundamentally.
One of my most vivid memories is from the earliest work of men, where I wept once because of undisclosed anger, when an older woman, a restrained manager (woman), grabbed me by a shrivele of me, was always a little afraid of me, which dragged me to the stairwell.
"Never let them see that you're crying!" she told me.
"They don't know you're overcounting.
They think you're sad and they're just gonna be glad you managed to "shut under your skin."
Patricia Schroeder, then a United States Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his pre-election campaign for president.
In 1987, when Hart, caught out of wedlock, left the ship, also called "making fools" and withdrew from the election, Schröder, deeply disappointed, considered that there was no reason why she could not stand for president.
"It wasn't a carefully thought out decision though," she laughed at me 30 years later.
"The election already had seven other candidates and the last they wanted another one to show up.
There were those who called it "Snow White and Seven Dwarves."
She was late involved in the campaign, she fell behind in fundraising and promised that she would not participate in the election unless $2 million was raised.
It was a lost fight.
She discovered that many of her supporters, who donated $1,000 to male members, only donated $250 to her.
"Do they believe I'm getting discounts?" she wondered.
When she stated in her speech that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was very emotional — grateful to those people who supported her, disappointed in a system that made it very difficult to raise money and address voters rather than delegates, and angry about sexism — in which she was "smothered".
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalled how the press reacted to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor."
I remember thinking what they'd be writing on my tombstone.
"She cried."
Why the U.S.-China Trade War May Be Beneficial to Beijing
The main excuses for how the trade war between the U.S. and China began are hidden and until the fight sees an end, disagreements between countries may be favorable to Beijing in the long run, say experts.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year, taxing major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel, and aluminium.
The most significant escalation began this week with new rates affecting units worth $200 billion (£150 billion), immediately imposing half of the goods exported to the United States from China.
Beijing also "kindly" responds every time, the latest being five to ten interest rates for $60 billion American goods.
China has stated that it is committed to responding to the US one-on-one and it is doubtful that the world's second largest economy could be mincing in the near future.
For Washington to resign, it would be necessary to agree to certain demands, but publicly bowing to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressure of the US trade war can have a positive effect on China in the long run, reducing the interdependence of the two economies with each other.
"The fact that a quick political decision, either in Washington or Beijing, could create uncontrollable economic conditions in any of the countries that are really more dangerous than it was recognized by observers before," said Abigail Grace, a New American Security researcher who focuses on Asia.
Syria is "ready" to readmit refugees, stated Foreign Minister.
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild a country ravaged by war for more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Almualham said conditions in the country were improving.
"The current situation on land is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore areas destroyed by terrorists to their normal condition.
There are all the conditions for refugees to voluntarily return to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their livelihoods.
The UN assumes that 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the outbreak of the war in 2011.
Six million more people still live in the country and need humanitarian assistance.
Almualham said that the Syrian regime would accept aid for the reconstruction of the devastated country.
But he stressed that the state would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that helped sponsor the riots.
European golf team sensationally wins Raiders Cup in Paris
The European golf team won the 2018 Raiders Cup, beating the U.S. team by a score of 16.5:10.5 "Le Golf National" outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost in Europe six times in a row and has not won the Raiders Cup since 1993.
Europe regained the cup when a team led by random Dane Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points needed to beat the United States team.
US star Phil Michaelson, who had a hard time going all over the tournament, hit his T-tree in the water at PAR 3's 16th hole, conceding the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari brilliantly played in all his stages, becoming one of four players who ever managed to get a 5-0-0 score since 1979 when the tournament is played out according to the existing format.
American Jordan Spite lost sensationally to European teams, by rating, the lowest player Torbjorn Olesen of Denmark, by 5 to 4.
The world's best player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 to Ian Polter of England, for whom this was probably the last Raider Cup.
A veteran of eight Raider Cups, Spanish Serhio García, became the tournament's best ever player from Europe with 25.5 career points.
"I don't cry normally, but today I can't hold tears."
This was a heavy year.
I am truly grateful to Thomas that he brought me out and believed me.
I'm very, very happy we've recovered the cup.
It is the merit of the team and I am glad that I was able to help," Garcia commented emotionally after winning the European team.
He further gives the name to his compatriot John Ram, who won the U.S. golf legend Taiger Woods on Sunday with 2 in 1 in singles.
"The pride I feel in winning Tyger Woods, I grew up following the course of this player," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all his four matches in France and currently has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Raiders Cup.
Unusual statistics for one of the best players of all time who won 14 top-tier golf tournaments, being second behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend to find their opportunities except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf for the entire tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furick said after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of the guys, they fought.
This morning, there was a moment when we were able to put little pressure on the European team.
We fought.
With all due respect to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played a very good game.
We will restructure, I will work with the American PGA and US Raiders Cup Committee and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You need to tap your hats.
We were won."
Latest news on red tide: Concentration decreases in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Committee (FWC) points to a general decrease in red tide concentrations for part of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, flowering spots have been reported in Pinela, Manatí, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Collier — suggesting a decrease in concentration.
The red tide bloom extends for about 130 miles from North Pinella to the sea shoreline of the Southern Lee area.
The spots can be found about 10 miles from the maritime coastal zone of Hillsborough County, but in some places take about a week.
The red tide has also been cleared in Pasco County.
Last week, average concentrations in Pinela County or its maritime coastal zone, low to high concentrations in the maritime coastal zone of Hilsboro County, low to high concentrations in Manatí County, low to high concentrations in the Sarasota County or its maritime coastal zone, low to moderate concentrations in the Charlotte County, low to high concentrations in the Lee County or its maritime coastal zone, and low concentrations in the Collier County have been reported.
Respiratory irritation is still reported in the Pinela, Manatí, Sarasota, Lee and Collier areas.
No respiratory irritation has been reported in Northwest Florida last week.
