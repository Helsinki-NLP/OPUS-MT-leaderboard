28-year-old cook found dead in San Francisco supermarket
This week, a 28-year-old cook who recently moved to San Francisco has been found dead in a supermarket staircase .
But the victim's brother says he can't imagine anyone who'd hurt his brother, stating that, "His life finally began to improve."
The body, found at the Westfield supermarket on Wednesday, has been identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, said a spokesman for the San Francisco Bureau of Judicial Medical Expertise.
San Francisco police stated that his death was recognized as a murder and is currently under investigation.
The victim's brother, Luis Galicia, tells San Francisco's ABC KGO station that Frank previously worked as a cook in Boston, but six months ago he got his dream job at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco.
A spokesman for the Sons & Daughters restaurant informs that the news of his death shocked them and shocked them.
"We're a small team working as a cohesive family and we're going to miss him a lot", a spokesman said.
In this difficult time, we're thinking with Frank's friends and family.
Luis Galicia says that Frank had been overnight at the hostels at first, but lately life has finally improved.
"He moved into a new apartment and met with a girl", Luis tells radio station KGO.
Luis Galicia claims he does not know who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He was a good man with a wide heart.
"He always pampered his family by making a delicious meal and cooking lunch", said Luis Galicia
He never wanted to get involved in the controversy.
He was the brother who adapted to the others.
"Taking into account everything that went wrong in the world, he was like a crude diamond that glowed brightly every day", he says.
Anyone who has information about the incident has been called to call the SFPD Information phone 415-575-4444.
New doctors strike: calls for new protests
Representatives of young doctors demand their trade union to launch protests in a dispute over the new treaty.
The New Physicians Committee of the British Medical Association (MAA) (JAK) is about to request a council to support wider protests in early September.
JAK believes that ministers have failed to allay doubts about the treaty.
In July, the new doctors and medical students rejected the AAL's proposed contract.
58% of all members who took part in the vote voted against the treaty.
In a message published on Twitter Thursday evening, JAK council member Ellen McCort states that the government continues to remain silent on the issue and therefore the contract offer has been rejected.
She said, "Having taken this into account, as a result of the JAK vote, the contract offer has been completely rejected and a decision has been made to request new formal negotiations to discuss the most important issues."
In response to the government's silence, the JAK formally requested a meeting with the AAL Council today to authorize the drafting of new treaties that would take effect in September.
As a result of the dispute, the young doctors took part in six strikes, including having stopped working for the first time in NHS history.
After the vote rejecting the terms of the agreement proposed by the AAL, recommended by the BMA, the representative of the AAL's new doctors, Dr. Johan Malawana, resigned.
Before meeting 54,000 new doctors and medical students, he had told BMA members that the offer was good and would be accepted.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt informed that a contract would be made with English medics.
Russia and Turkey: An Alliance of Disfellowshipped?
A gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met Tuesday to shake hands and announce the end of the eight-month war of names and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin greeted the Turkish leader at the St. Petersburg Palace, he had the impression that this partnership was more necessary for Ankara.
However, the two would shake hands.
Vladimir Putin's smile looked artificial and did not cause warm emotions, even given his usual abstinence.
In contrast, redjeep Tajyip Erdogan called Putin his "expensive friend" at least five times, a review of the meeting states.
I got lost in the count.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only improve to the pre-crisis level, but would become even stronger.
The next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan was acting like nothing had happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm gives rise to conflicting feelings.
But the radiant coolness of Putin shows that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
The first thing he mentioned in his address was the shooting down of a Russian aircraft on the Syrian border.
Back then, Moscow reacted sharply.
Putin accused Ankara of stabbing a dagger in Moscow back.
The offense was even more painful given that it came from a friend's side.
It will be very difficult, if not impossible, to restore true trust.
Russia's public position has, however, changed since November.
For several months, government-controlled television spread aggressive accusations against Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that the Turks were responsible for everything.
The most serious were accusations that Erdogan's own family profited from the illegal oil trade with the Islamic State-controlled part of Syria.
He denied it himself, of course.
But the main message of the St. Petersburg meeting is that it is time to forget the past.
Eventually, this meeting took place only because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia could see it as a kind of victory.
Ankara's benefit from peace reconciliation is obvious.
First, Erdogan needs all possible friends after the failed coup last month in which he was attempted to overthrow.
The countless terrorist attacks have also shaken his position.
There are also economic motives.
Russia's sanctions have caused serious damage, particularly the charter ban, which usually provides an influx of several million Russian tourists into Turkish resorts every year.
The number of tourists fell by almost 90%.
Russian tour operators and charter companies will also breathe in relief when scheduled flights are restored.
They are hoping for a vacation fever in the Mediterranean at the end of the season.
Already this week, the state TV predicts a drop in the prices of fruit and vegetables, as imports of Turkish fruit and vegetables will be restored.
As quoted by local newspaper Vedemosti: "Tourists for them, tomatoes for us."
But the visit also had other political motives from Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for what they believe is the weak response to the coup attempt.
The dissatisfaction with the protracted EU accession negotiations and the intervention of Putin, who is happy to take advantage of Turkey's alienation from the West, can also be looked at.
The Russian leader undoubtedly won additional points in Ankara's eyes, expressing support for its elected government after the coup attempt.
Note that Moscow understands this well, because there is a deep-rooted fear of regime change in the country itself.
The summit, which took place in this luxurious seaside palace, gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present, as one analyst called it, the "outdated alliance", two countries that feel excluded from the West join forces.
However, despite the publicly demonstrated unity, there are still considerable differences of opinion between the two countries.
The main disagreements concern Syria, where Russia presents itself as a peacemaker, but in fact Russia and Turkey support the opposing parties.
After more than three hours of initial talks, without wanting to disclose the information, the two presidents announced at a press conference that they had not discussed the matter.
The Turkish President purposefully avoided issues of disagreement between the two countries, while President Putin wanted to highlight them.
There is no clear consensus on how the two countries could find a common language on the Syrian issue.
After months of openly hostile relations and a potential disaster, however, when a NATO member, Turkey, hit a Russian combat aircraft, the situation has improved, as both leaders have at least resumed negotiations.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland
SKB will have a supporting role in the future, as announced by its CEO.
Outside Scotland, the SKB will no longer be available.
Ross McEwan tells the BBC channel in Scotland that the SKB brand was associated with the bank's ambitions on a global scale.
It has given up these ambitions because eight years ago the bank almost went bankrupt and needed financial assistance.
Meanwhile, branding strategy experts have used the SKB brand to protect other consumer finance brands.
The bank received millions of pounds from international sports sponsors, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon tennis champion Andy Murray.
But it is now decided to bring other national brands to the forefront.
The Royal Banaka of Scotland will be available to Scottish customers, but it will not be initialised.
In England and Wales, all SKB references, outside the head office and official stock exchange listing, will be changed to NatWest.
The brand The Ulster Bank is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Smaller private finance brands, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank, will now also be noted.
McEwan was interviewed during a outing with clients and staff around Invernessshire.
He told the BBC Scotland channel, "SKB will become our brand of investors and our employees work with, because now we become more of a brand bank."
In time, the bank itself became a global brand and SKB became a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have global ambitions, we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in their industry and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
SKB has already announced that it will not continue sponsorship of "Six Nations" and engage various brands in sports sponsorship.
"It's time to become a brand bank, because we have long asked ourselves how to become a better bank for our clients?" says the CEO.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical if we announced that we would become a great bank for our customers and develop these brands.
But thanks to hard work and focusing on customers' needs rather than our own, we have obviously made a big difference.
We can revive these brands again, so I think that now is the right time.
Frankie Detori wins the 3000th win, winning first place at Newmarket with the horse Predication
Detors uncork champagne, winning their 3000th win twice finishing first in the race at Newmarket.
On Friday, jockey Frankie Detori won his 3000th victory in British history, winning first place at Newmarket.
He achieved this by winning the second win in this race, held in his hometown, riding a Predition, coached by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey who has achieved such a result in a horse sprint race.
He has joined Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Pigot, Pete Ederry, and Willie Carson.
The three-time champion jockey Detori, who previously won by horse Ghayyar, said, "This is something special."
I'm very moved because my family is here.
I'm very glad it happened in Newmarket because I've been living here for 30 years.
This is not a big race, this is not the Royal Ascot, but an ordinary Friday night with 20,000 people.
I feel relieved and very grateful.
After the victory, Detori and Predication are greeted with applause and cheers.
Two jockeys have achieved this record in races with obstacles - champion Richard Johnson and career-ending 20-time champion Sir Antony McCoy, who set several records in his career, winning over 4,300 wins.
Lester Pigot, a nine-time derby winner, won 4,493 wins during his career.
Frankie is one of today's best jockeys and it is no surprise that he has achieved a success that only few are able to achieve.
He is stylish and powerful, but his sense of tactics distinguishes him from other jockeys.
He is a fantastic racing representative, his enthusiasm and charisma for years attract fans for this sport.
A few weeks ago at the Epsom race, I told Frankie that he would have won 6,000 wins if he didn't just take part in the weekends and big races.
To be serious, however, it is a real pleasure that Frankie has been winning the UK race regularly for 30 years.
He's a lively one that's great in British racing, besides being a great jockey.
Frank Detori noted this achievement with his brand name - the flying jump.
From finishing at wind speed to a flying jump, Frankie Detori has been the face of British horse racing for twenty years.
This has been an adventurous road.
He has won countless major races, including the famous 1996 "Great Seventh" in Ascot, and in addition he survived the plane crash and disqualification for using preparations.
Three years ago, he found it difficult to return after six months of disqualification, but he demonstrated his strength of character by challenging those who questioned him by returning to his best form.
And he could take part in the race for some more time - Detori has previously said that he would be happy to continue to participate in the race until at least 50 years of age.
Russian President Putin dismisses the head of administration, Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin will unexpectedly fire the head of the administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was among Putin's closest people for many years.
The 63-year-old politician is currently appointed Special Representative for Nature and Transport.
A Kremlin statement says that Putin "decided to relieve Ivanov of his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration" without mentioning the reason.
Ivanov was appointed to the post by Anton Vaino, who had been his deputy since 2012.
The 44-year-old Vaino is a former diplomat.
Vaino was born in 1972 in Tallinn, Estonia, and graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MVSAI) and later worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
According to the Kremlin website (in Russian), he later presided over the Presidential Protocol and the administration of government employees.
After his appointment, he told Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
In my opinion, the main job of the administration is to support your work as President of the State by drafting laws and controlling the execution of your decisions.
Putin told a Russian broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov himself wanted to leave the position and recommended Vaino as his replacement.
Do smiles convince?
This step has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov is an ancient and close ally of Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, once worked in the Soviet security service in the KGB.
In this capacity, he was one of the most influential men in Russia.
At a sitting broadcast on state television, the two men announced that Ivanov was resigning on his own initiative.
But despite the smiles of the cameras, rarely does such an explanation convince, especially before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of a power struggle?
Nobody knows.
However, the official statement that the man, who was considered to be a possible president, suddenly wanted to become the head of Russian environmental policy himself is perceived with great scepticism.
In the notes published on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov says to Putin, "It's a fact that in early 2012 I asked you to entrust me with this difficult post, one might even say, problematic post, for four years.
Turns out I've worked in this position for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He previously served as Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB State Security Service, as he is Putin.
In the late 1990s, Putin headed the Federal Security Service, which is the successor to the KGB, Ivanov held the position of his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusts most.
At the end of Putin's second term, Ivanov was considered a potential candidate for President of Russia, as Putin's re-election to a third term would be unconstitutional.
But then another close ally of Putin - Dmitry Medvedev - became president.
Putin became Prime Minister, and returned to the office of President three and a half years later.
The Stumbling Appearance of Fish in a Garden in Banff
A man from Banff asks for help to find out the conditions that the species appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bane thinks that 75 fish could be sand eels who have travelled with a water-room .
Mr. Bane, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, made a video available on the fish website Periscope, hoping that someone could know how these 5 inches of fish came into his garden.
Queensferry junction: The bridge is now connected to Faifa.
The £1.35 billion project is currently scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern part of the Queensferry junction and viaduct, meaning that the bridge is now connected to Faifa.
The first of the four connecting parts is complete, meaning that the construction of the bridge is nearing completion.
The structure of the Faifa Bridge is 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It consists of 10,000 tons of steel, 20,000 tons of concrete, and 46 supporting cables.
The £1.35 billion project is currently planned to be completed in May 2017.
Economic Secretary Kate Brown had come to the construction site today and was one of the first to climb the bridge.
He said, "This is a symbolic and historic moment in the construction of Queensferry Bridge."
In this project, we see an unparalleled engineering solution, where only this part has been built with more than 30 000 tonnes of cement and steel.
Despite the enormous weight and size of the bridge, connecting the bridge and viaduct is an extremely delicate process that requires enormous precision.
Overall, more than 79% of the bridge deck has already been built and the last section that will connect the bridge to Rosita will be enclosed today, meaning that all parts of the bridge are ready for laying.
Michael Martin, director of the Fourth Bridge Connection project, says, "The first connection is a very important point in the construction of any bridge."
In this fantastic project, the first connection demonstrates high-end civil engineering.
After installing the last section of the road and connecting it with the support of the north tower, we were allowed to connect the northern section of the road to the land section, or viaduct.
This was done by pushing the viaduct portion of the northern accessway 700 millimetres to the south.
It was a huge and at the same time very delicate operation.
Huge because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled obliquely by about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerance in both directions that the team worked with was only a few millimetres.
Luckily, it worked well.
Simone Bayles wins gold in gymnastics for women.
Forget the tension.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Bayles doesn't bother with all this.
Dynamic jumps.
Exercises on a log are performed effortlessly.
Unsurpassed on the floor.
Absolutely perfect.
And finally the Olympic Champion.
On Thursday, the 19-year-old American gymnast won a gold medal, fully demonstrating the difference between herself and the rest of the world on the Olympic stage.
Her total score of 62,198 was a head court superior to that of silver medal winner and her teammate Aly Raismane and bronze medal winner Russian athlete Aly Mustafina.
On Thursday, US athlete Simona Bayles performed an exercise on a log in the sports gymnastics individual multi-fight final for women at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Bayles became the fourth American in a row to win a multi-fight champion title and the fifth best gymnast, gradually establishing her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and perhaps the best gymnast in history.
When the final result was announced, she burst into tears as the long road to this point was over.
This achievement places him next to such unbeaten athletes as Michael Phelp, who picked up his sport at another level.
Bayles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 medals at world championships, including 10 gold medals, performing combinations of exercises so outstanding, accurate and ambitious that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lu Retone called her "the best gymnast she ever saw."
In Brazil, she was met with the final test, where she had to compete largely with the expectations placed on her rather than with the other athletes.
She would be disappointed if she returned to her home in Spring, Texas with no gold medals.
U.S. athletes Simon Bails (left) and Aliya Raismane hug after winning the gold and silver medal respectively in the sports gymnastics individual multi-fight final for women at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which took place on Thursday.
Bailsa won the first gold medal on Tuesday, making a special bye party for the team coordinator Martha Karolji.
Although Bayles claims that she had not expected anything of this kind on her long journey to the peaks of fame, it is not true.
Part of her performance in free movement, which includes her special acrobatic transition, is accompanied by Latin music that would fit perfectly on the street next to the Rio Olympics arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl, who was adopted by her grandparents when she was still an infant and was discovered by the mother of coach Amy Bourman on a tour to the gym where Bourmann'sterns were held, has now become a force to be reckoned with.
She has not lost a multi-fight race since the summer of 2013 and the winning series can continue as long as Bayles wants it.
Although Mustafina took a little lead during the two rotations, it was only an illusion.
The balance beam and free movement - the part of the race where Bailsa will defend her title of champion is still ahead.
She took the lead with a score of 15.433 on a log and strengthened the lead with a score of 15.933 in free movement
Raisman gently embraced her while they waited for the results, which was only a formality and she blurted into tears of joy when the dream she had once recorded in her notebook came true.
Raismane's result was as little revenge for four years old events when she shared third place with Mustafin, yet lost the fight for the bronze medal.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, called "grandmother" by Americans, took a convincing lead.
After her performance in free movement, which dispelled doubts about her return, she was able to devote an air kiss to the crowd.
Meanwhile, the 19-year-old Bails' viral Twitter recording r, which she published this week, now has a completely different meaning.
6-year-old Mahay Brown "lodge-holed" survives gunfire in Philadelphia.
Police say that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, stating that it was already the second six-year-old to be shot in Philadelphia this week.
Child's grandparents confirmed to the CBS Philadelphia News Channel that it was Mahay Brown.
Grandparents say Brown was shot several times, including in the groin, leg, arm, and abdomen, but was still conscious when he was taken to hospital.
His grandmother, Delores Melendez, tells television: "His little body was just bullet-holed".
I can't believe it.
The boy has been hospitalized in critical condition and has already undergone several operations.
The family informs that he will surely recover.
He had to start going first in the local primary school.
Brown is one of four people who were shot in a part of the city of Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man.
Channel CBS Philadelphia reports that one of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition, while the condition of the other two victims is stable.
The channel states that the child was found in the front seat of the car next to the 29-year-old victim in critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating if any of them were attackers.
The investigator told channel CBS Philadelphia that several gunmen were most likely involved in the shooting.
Gun cartridge shells belonging to various weapons have been found at the scene of the event.
Looks like it's been a long-running gunfight.
Shells have been found on both sides of the pedestrian sidewalk.
"So it looks like there have been a number of armed gunmen here who actively participated in the shooting," says Philadelphia Police Captain Antony Ginaldi.
Several homes and cars have also been damaged.
No one has yet been detained and police are reported to be checking surveillance camera records.
On Tuesday, during the shooting, a stray bullet hit a 6-year-old girl in her arm while she was playing in front of her house in the Westouklein area.
She is gradually recovering, but the police are still looking for the culprit.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
I call it the Women's Olympic Athlete Team of the Year for a number of reasons.
First of all, I've been to all the Summer Olympics since 1984, and the US team has never been that good.
Secondly, this team features three athletes, Simone Bails, Gabby Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who are inspired by many young girls of descent.
People may be proud that this team also includes Aly Raismane, who is Jewish and Madison Cocian, who is Catholic.
Finally, this team truly represents America.
It has also strengthened the participation of black and Latin American athletes in this sport.
For the past four years, the best gymnast is an American of African descent.
Last year, Simona and Gabby took 1st and 2nd place.
These are impressive results.
At the previous Olympics, Gaby Douglas surprisingly became Olympic champion, and America could rejoice.
Now the world has seen incredible exercises performed by triple world champion Simone Bayles, Douglas, and Laurie Hernandez doing unprecedented but masterful exercises.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth consecutive American woman to have won a gold medal in an individual multi-fight for women.
Her teammate Aly Raismane won the silver medal.
We have seen the best that this sport can bring, but in the rest of the country, the situation in gymnastics is completely different.
Simone, Gaby, and Laurie entered the Olympic team as did Allie and Madison.
They are the Olympic Five, as the next Olympic gymnastics team will only have four athletes, and this is coach Martha Carroll's last year as coach.
Gymnastics is actually an expensive sport. Gymnastics are mainly trained by private athletic clubs, and are maintained by parents who pay for training, premises, travel, uniforms, hotels (trainers, athletes and their families) and other expenses.
Most of these athletic clubs are located in urban areas that can afford this sport.
In these clubs, athletes conduct all their training, and it is an expensive and long investment for athletic families.
Amy Boorman - coach of Simone Bayles and Maggie Haney - coach of Laurie Hernandez have coached their athletes since both girls started athletics.
We need to provide young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gaby and Laurie, with cheaper gymnastics opportunities.
I founded my athletic organization 20 years ago.
My organisation is based in Harlem, and we offer more than 15,000 young people in the city (mainly black and Spanish) free of charge or at a low price.We have also trained national and international champions.
In September, we will open a branch in Detroit (my hometown) to provide local youth with an opportunity to get to know this great sport.
Athletics develops strength, flexibility, and body coordination, as well as teaches hard work, discipline, and pursuit.
This combination ensures a long life with good health and success both at school and at work.
This team will inspire thousands of young girls to train in athletics and it's fantastic.
Dealing with this sport is very important, especially for young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thanks to Simone, Alija, Gabija and Madison for the great "Girls Force" demonstration, winning the Olympic gold medals and motivating countless young girls of different backgrounds to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After rejecting Jeremy Hunt's offer, the young doctors plan to roll out more strikes.
Ministers hoped to end the disagreement by reaching agreement on changes to the agreement with representatives of the British Medical Association. However, this was rejected by 58 percent of the 37,000 new doctors who took part in the vote.
In July, Hunt announced plans to enter into a contract, stating that the NHS was in a state of instability and further delays would only harm employees and patients.
The first new doctors have already signed the new contract, which provides for changes in the conditions for night shift and weekend work to improve working conditions during non-standard working hours.
Last night, BMA's spokeswoman for new doctors, Dr. Ellen McCourt, stated that young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially that it will deepen the labour crisis and it does not provide for equal conditions for all doctors.
There are eight weeks to go before the first group of young doctors sign the new contract, so progress needs to be made because there is not much time left.
BMA's efforts to resolve the problem through negotiation have been met with the unwillingness of the government to engage and sometimes with complete silence.
This has happened despite the fact that even last month Jeremy Hunt said that his door was always open.
Jeremy Hunt must take immediate action, stop inaction and cooperate with new doctors.
If he doesn't, then the new doctors are ready for new protest actions.
Over 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were postponed during the last strike in late April, while nurses and consultants attempted to replace doctors who had gone on picket.
Ministers hoped to end the disagreement by reaching agreement on changes to the agreement with representatives of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants to raise the rate for weekend work for 54,000 new doctors to be covered by the new contracts.
NHS employment CEO Daniel Mortimer called on young doctors not to go on strikes.
Mr. Mortimer explains that strikes do not solve anything, but only increase pressure on the busy workers and worry, cause stress and hindrance to patients, caregivers and their families.
For the last two months we have spoken to the new Committee of Physicians and together with the Ministry of Health and other institutions we have answered positively to their questions about the guardians and rapporteurs.
Employers hope that active cooperation on other important issues, such as placement of employees, flexible training, additional training for those returning after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of training programmes, abandonment of studies and gender pay inequality in medicine, shows that employers, England health education institutions and the Ministry of Health are serious about implementing agreements concluded with BME in November, February and May.
Medicines of 2 pounds a day may reduce the risk of a heart attack.
Thousands of patients who have had a heart attack are likely to be treated with the medicine at a rate of 2 pounds per day as the official representatives recommend that it be used by more people and for longer periods.
The anti-clotting medicine Ticagrelor reduces the risk of recurrent heart attacks in people with heart disease.
This medicine is already prescribed for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of another heart attack.
NICE, represented by NHS, is recommended for 4 years after a heart attack to further reduce the risk of a heart attack in people with cardiovascular problems.
However, it is recommended that NICE, currently under the responsibility of the NHS, be administered 4 years after the heart attack in order to further reduce cardiovascular risk.
Each year about 140,000 people in England experience a heart attack and a quarter of them experience a recurring heart attack or stroke.
Heart attack and stroke are caused by the accumulation of fat in the walls of the heart forming a blockage.
If the obstruction breaks, it can cause a clot by blocking the flow of blood to the heart and causing a heart attack.
On the other hand, if the clot separates from the wall of the blood vessels, it can get further into the bloodstream and block the blood’s access to the brain, causing a heart attack.
People who have had a heart attack are more at risk of having a heart attack again.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British firm AstraZeneca and marketed under the name Brilique, reduces the risk of blood clots forming.
The new NICE guidelines published today recommend that humans take Ticagrelor 90 mg for 12 months and another 60 mg twice daily with aspirin for 3 years.
NICE's Director of Health Technology, Professor Carol Longson, explains, "Despite the availability of medications to prevent a recurring heart attack, over a quarter of people who have had a heart attack experience another heart attack or stroke, often with severe consequences."
Fear of a recurring heart attack can have a negative effect on a person's quality of life.
Evidence suggests that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of a recurrent heart attack and heart attack in people who have already experienced it.
When we provisionally recommend treatment with Ticagrelor, we are glad that we can expand treatment options for thousands of people, who are thus the beneficiaries.
In view of the limited information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor, in particular the risk of bleeding when the medicinal product is used for more than three years, the draft guideline does not recommend its use beyond this time limit.
The culture of political correctness promotes electoral fraud in Muslim communities
Lutfur Rahman, former mayor of the town of Towerhamlet, was dismissed for corruption, according to a management report.
A government report reveals that a culture of political correctness is turning a blind eye to large-scale fraud in Muslim communities.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickle criticizes police, election supervisors, and city councils that they ignore signs of fraud in the election process because they "are afraid to offend ethnic and religious interests."
The former community secretary, who has now become head of the anti-corruption organization, says that bullying by voters for religious reasons is so common that police should allow guards to be placed at polling stations to protect bullied voters.
He also recommends that voters should present a personal identity document when they vote to prove their true identity.
Voters are currently required to give only their name and address.
He even recommends marking the fingers of voters with special ink to prevent double voting.
The whistleblowers must also provide more protection, says Sir Eric.
He felt that the press should have greater access to Council documents and decisions taken by informal committees and working parties.
He says, "The goal is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to protect the local government from a wider culture of corruption and fraud that goes hand in hand with it."
The report was ordered by Downing Street following a scandal surrounding the Tauerhamlet city election.
Last year, the special election court decided to remove city mayor Lutfur Rahman from his position as city mayor due to corrupt and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman "cinically distorted" the religious outlook of his Muslim community and silenced his critics by accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
"Rahman has run his election campaign with a stance that religious Muslims have a religious duty to vote for him."
About 300 votes were rigged or in doubt, as one person had voted on multiple occasions.
Sir Erick also points out that there are signs of fraud across the country.
He pointed out that fraud in postal voting was particularly worrying, where senior members of Muslim communities forced others to vote for candidates they wanted.
Sir Eric recommended a series of measures to improve the electoral system, including the presentation of an identity document to clarify the identity of the person.
His report states, "Evidence shows that vulnerable members of ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, are being forced to vote for candidates chosen by community elders, particularly in Bangladeshi and Pakistani communities."
"There is concern that county authorities are not paying attention to these problems because of political correctness, because ethnic and religious interests could be offended."
Sir Eric outlined 50 recommendations on how to improve the electoral system, which also includes a ban on political activists running with voices handed over by mail to prevent "voice-raising".
The report, which is being reviewed by Theresa May, also calls for a more thorough check-in to prevent voter lists from being used for immigration fraud and benefits.
Consider requiring voters to produce an identity document before voting.
Mark the fingers of voted voters with special ink to prevent double voting.
Systematic verification of the nationality of persons to ensure that a person has the right to vote.
Set a three-year limit for requests for automatic postal voting.
Prohibit political campaigners and activists from working with votes handed over by mail and ballot envelopes for vote by mail.
Provide the police with the authority to designate a security guard at polling stations.
Make changes to the law to facilitate the prosecution of individuals for intimidation under the Human Rights Act 1983.
Prohibit photography at polling stations.
To require only English (except in Wales) to be used in polling stations.
Step up training to ensure that the voters go to the ballot boxes one by one.
Sir Eric harshly criticizes the Metropolitan Police, expressing his perplexity that no charges have been made in the Towerhamlet case .
He says, "The election court only disqualified Luftur Rahman and his representative for activities related to corruption and fraud."
He was conclusively found guilty by the standard of criminal law evidence based on irrefutable evidence.
He also criticizes the "checkout" of ineffective city council voters at voter registration stations.
Sir Eric states, "The court's decision last year is an alarm bell.
Our land is known as the birthplace of parliament, but the alarming and covert spread of electoral fraud and the pretense of the authorities that there is no fraud threatening this good reputation.
A passion for a cyclist - Kate's counterpart and other Rio Olympic celebrity counterparts
Fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics are thrilled by French cyclist Paulina Ferrand Prevot, who has been found by fans to be extremely similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
However, the 24-year-old cyclist is not the only athlete who fights for gold this summer, which, according to the media, boasts of her celebrity counterpart.
Therefore, in honor of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces that are currently seen on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympic players that is quite similar to the Hollywood stars.
Hunter and Wolf: U.S. arc shooter teammate Brady Allison, left, has been compared to Leonardo Di Caprio since childhood
Apart from Kate's counterpart on the cycling track, many people on the Internet point out that this bow-shot could be the twin brother of superstar Leonardo Di Caprio.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. men's arc shooter team, caused a storm on Twitter when photos were published where he closely resembles Wall Street Wilk.
The athlete himself also noticed the storm on social media and admitted that he was compared to Leonardo Di Caprio since he was a child.
"I personally don't see a great resemblance except for the beard", Brady tells the publication Huffington Post.
"He's a handsome guy, so I take it as a compliment."
This year, one of the most popular pairs of London's Olympic counterparts will undoubtedly gain even more popularity: the stunning similarity between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian athlete Aliya Mustaffin, thanks to her large, expressive eyes, is compared to Cuban-born American singer Gloria Estefan.
Speaking of swimming, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burg has been compared to "Created for the Stage" star Matthew Morrison for several years.
Change: this user has noticed that Nathan is an `sportsmanlike version' of the actor in the film "Inception".
Also ancient counterparts are tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who have similar eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist, swimmer Julia Efimova and actress Annaline McCord can be proud not only of sun-tanned skin and blond hair. Meanwhile, fans believe that athletic US athlete Nathan Adrian is like Joseph Gordon LeWitt.
Serious Women: Football star (left) Houp Solo and series Dexters actress Jennifer Carpenter (right) have a similar face shape and eyes.
Not one: one Twitter user was pleasantly surprised to learn that others also see these similarities
Theory: this user believes that there may be a reason why both look so similar
Recently, a Twitter user declared with true pleasure that "other Internet users are said to agree that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter actually look identical."
The US football star and actress of the Dexters series do indeed have a very similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerry Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linnie. Also, the gold medal winner, Gaby Douglas, boasts a beautiful, wide smile similar to that of "Bring It On" star Gabrielle Uniyon.
A commentator for the CBC Olympics apologises for her comment that the Chinese swimmer is said to have 'died like a pig'.
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the finish of 14-year-old Ai Yanha in fourth place in the 4x200 m freestyle relay for women, called for a storm of outrage in CBC viewers.
The Canadian channel CBC was forced to apologize, as one of its commentators made comments that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer from the race had "flyed out of the race that he laughed" and "died like a pig".
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when the 4x200 m freestyle women relay set out his personal opinion at the end of the final .
McDonald, who was included in the CBC commentators' team to give the comments lively, said, "That little fourteen-year-old from China is unable to keep up".
"Too run into, she flew out of the race that smothered alone and ended up like a pig".
Thank you very much.
14-year-old Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhana's score in the second stage was 1:57.79, it is 1.61 seconds slower than that of Canadian Taylor Ruck, allowing Canadians to catch up with China.
Spectators across Canada reacted immediately on the Internet as they were shocked to hear such tone and expressions.
Emmett McFarlain recorded on Twitter: "Did a direct CBC commentator just say that a 14-year-old swimmer from China "died like a pig"???".
Idiot didn't realize they were still on direct air.
Ai Yanha of China in the 4x200m freestyle final was named "a little fourteen-year-old from China who doesn't keep up."
Criticism of Byron MacDonald quickly took effect as many demanded explanations.
Twitter users could not believe in hearing Byron MacDonald's insensitive comments.
Twitter user Sarah Paradi wrote, "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You're representing CBC and Canada and because of you, we all sound like racists. #disgusting.
Soon after, Scott Russell, who was directing the CBC live at the time, apologized for McDonald's comments, saying, "We apologize that the comment on the swimming score came on direct air."
It was an unfortunate choice of words and we are very sorry that it happened.
The CBC apologised to more than 90 people who had responded on Twitter to the comment.
McDonald's colleague Scott Russell had to apologize for him.
The CBC then copied an apology to over 90 Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comment.
The channel also quickly published an apology and statement.
We very much regret that such comments were made and came on direct air.
Yesterday we reacted immediately and apologized to all live viewers and followers on social media.
For the sake of clarity, it has to be said that Byron's comments were made about the swimmer's performance, not addressed to her personally.
But they were in any case unprofessional and unsuccessfully chosen statements and Byron deeply regrets what happened.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald personally apologized on direct air and attempted to explain that he did not think his comment would be treated as a personal attack.
He said live at the CBC Olympics, "I would like to take advantage of the moment and apologize for the comment I made yesterday after the women's freestyle race."
I'm talking about the swimmer's performance, not about her personally.
Needless to say, I didn't mean to show disrespect, and I'm really sorry that that happened.
Primark's buyers are shocked by a woman who brazenly tries her underwear in the middle of a shop.
The buyers felt uncomfortable when the woman began undressing to try on the panties in the middle of the store.
As the situation worsened further, she used them to make sure they fit her and then took off, putting the panties back on the store shelf.
She went on to look for clothing at the Folkestone Bouverie Place shopping centre store and timed four more panties.
The Primark store at Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone – the place where this woman pitted her underwear and then put it back on the shelf.
At the time, Jenny Davidson, the mother of two, was also in the store, who tells us that the unfamiliar woman put on her clothes and left the store without buying anything after fitting her underwear.
She points out that people could not believe their eyes.
Standing in the middle of the shop, she took her underpants off the shelf, took off her tights and trousers, and surveyed them locally.
She didn't even try to find a more discreet place to survey them, she just tried them right there.
Everyone watched her take off her panties and apparently the woman didn't like them because she just put them back on the shelf.
She surveyed three more panties until she decided she didn't like any of them and left the store.
He didn't seem to be worried that someone was watching or thinking about the person who was going to buy the clothes she was trying on.
Miss Davidson (33 years old) from Kent says, "Derza's thought that someone would buy clothes that were timed by another person and not washed out afterwards."
The incident occurred Tuesday afternoon.
Miss Davidson adds, "I assume that shop staff removed the said clothes from the store shelves after she left - which is also acceptable."
I can't imagine buying a new underwear and finding out that another woman had timed it and then hadn't washed it out.
A Primark spokesman indicated that Primark is known about the incident, which occurred on Tuesday, August 9.
The particular clothes have been removed from the store shelves.
How to protect yourself from firearms using Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer.
To find out how to protect ourselves in a close distance from attackers with a firearm, we talked to Krav Maga's Grand Master from New York, Ron Mizraki.
Whether you are attacked from the front or the back, this video shows how to protect yourself and win over the attacker.
Mizraki indicates if the attacker attacks from the back, then one must first turn to see the attacker clearly and avoid the path of the shot.
The weapon must then grasp between his front arm and shoulder and strike the opponent's face with his free elbow.
Then follows a kick with a knee down the groin and while the attacker freezes in pain, takes away the gun from him, punches him in the face with a gun-pin and retreats, continuing to direct the gun against him.
If the attacker approaches the front, the situation is similar - avoid the path of the shot, grab the weapon and fold it in such a way that the villain cannot fire.
At the same time, put pressure on the weapon and strike the opponent through his chest and finally take the gun away from him and retreat further to aim at him.
Sounds complicated?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizraki does it.
But remember, if you're not Krav Maga's master, then it's safer to give your money back to the robber.
The Vandal family emboldens the Saltash Cornwall social house and is laid out on the street.
The Vandal family has been put out of residence for terrorizing neighbors, causing damage to a social home of 50,000 pounds.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Sean Trebilcock were only put out of the property in Saltash in Cornwall, as several complaints were filed against them.
When they had been forcibly laid out of the property, shocked housing officials found that the property had been completely destroyed.
There were holes in the floors and walls, there were trash spills everywhere and the walls were covered with graffiti.
The family has now been put out of property and is likely to live in some private property.
Donna McEvoy, manager of the Cornwall Housing Service, says there is concern that it will not be possible to renovate the housing.
She says that the people who lived here have been extremely difficult and she believes that people can't live like that.
In this case, a number of factors need to be considered, as this property will not be of good repute in Cornwall in the future.
This family is famous and their name is well known.
The couple had three sons who periodically resided in the property and police say that their terror took the form of violence, dimmering on the street with baseball sticks, bullying by local residents, drug abuse, drug sales, and loud screaming and swearing.
The 47-year-old Skeldon, on whose name the property was named, was sentenced in June for antisocial behavior.
Several rooms in the desolated house have found trash.
In a house where previously trafficked drugs are possible, several floorboards have also been ripped out.
Neighbours say that they have regularly climbed the street and have constantly been called police.
The Cornwall Housing Service forced them out of the property when they had been given 11 weeks to move out of the house voluntarily.
The desperate neighbors were very happy for eviction because their lives were said to have been absolute hell.
One said, "They didn't care about other residents."
We lived next to them for 20 years, it's always been crazy.
I can't believe how often we've seen the police here.
We couldn't sleep this morning.
We woke up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, here's going to be wonderful.
Adam Fitzpatrick, who is the head of the Cornwall Housing Service's neighbourhood protection said the family did not cooperate with local security authorities.
The family has lived here for 20 years and the police have been called here regularly.
Various old and unusable objects were found in the overgrown garden of the house.
He also said, "It is a great pity that tenants showed no responsibility for their behavior, because eviction from the house is always the last step considered by the Cornwall Housing Service."
This was a very difficult case because their behavior was extreme and neighbors were said to have been very hard to watch in their behavior.
I appreciate the work of all my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, and the members of the commune who were brave and cooperating with us in providing the necessary information on this matter.
I hope that this event will make life easier for neighbours and show that antisocial behaviour is unacceptable.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons were said to have lived here in different periods of time, but all were about 20 years old.
Dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the rooms after eviction.
Service staff will now have to clean up a pile of garbage left in the house.
In 2014, police conducted a search at the house and found over 70 grams of marijuana, weights, accessories and 1,700 pounds in cash.
Skeldone has only been found guilty of possession of Class B drugs with a view to distribution.
She insisted that the money was intended for a monument to her son Lee Sheldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After eviction, it has become known that they are currently renting some private property in Plymouth.
graffiti were drawn on many of the walls of the house.
Police say they will continue to put out tenants who violate their rental contracts.
Angela Crowe, a spokeswoman for the Devon and Cornwall police, points out that this eviction is a clear warning to other tenants who continue to break the rules.
She also said that, "This is a warning to those who believe they are allowed to behave like they want and will have no consequences."
The Devon and Cronwall police do not accept criminal and anti-social behavior, and the police will continue to work with our partners to protect local communities.
Expenditure can give a boost to the economy.

The mayor of the Cannes has banned burkini swimsuits on the beaches.
The mayor of Cannes, a southern French resort town, has banned wearing burkini swimsuits on the beaches of that city, which almost completely obscure the woman's body and are very reminiscent of the hydro suit, local officials stated on Thursday.
Cannes Mayor David Linar has signed an order that "access to beaches and swimming is prohibited for anyone who does not have a swim suit that respects good customs and secularism" as a fundamental principle of the French Republic.
"A beach suit that outwardly shows religious affiliation at a time when France and places of worship are the target of terrorist attacks may pose a risk of public order disruptions (friction, clashes, etc.), which need to be prevented", the ordinance states.
"We are talking not about a ban on wearing religious symbols on the beach, but about outward clothing associated with the trust in the terrorist movements that are at war with us", explained Thierry Migul, municipal utility manager.
He added that burkini swimsuits have not been seen on Cannes beaches since July 28, when Linar, a member of the right-wing center party Republicans, signed the order and it came into effect.
This week, the water park in Marseille cancelled a planned private event for Muslim women who would have been dressed in burkini swimsuits, as politicians from both the right and left voiced outrage at such an event.
In France, the wearing of face-covering headscarves by Muslim women is prohibited, but religious symbols or appropriate clothing are not prohibited.
On 14 July, 85 people were killed in a terrorist attack in the resort town of Nice, close to Cannes, for which the Islamic State group took responsibility.
On July 26, two attackers who had sworn allegiance to the "Islamic State" brutally murdered a priest in a church in northwestern France.

Last year, the household retailer Jysk Linnen'n Furniture Ltd. ("Jysk") grew its turnover by 5%, reaching EUR 23.66 million, according to "Firmas.lv" information.
The company's turnover in 2014 was 22.57 million euros.
The profit of the company also increased slightly - from 781 235 euros in 2014 to 785 896 euros last year.
The management report says that last year the company reconstructed the existing store in Riga, Slokas Street and closed the store in Riga, Kurzemes prospekts.
This year as well as other years, the main task of the company is to further increase both turnover and profits.
Meanwhile, it is recommended to leave the profits made last year undistributed.
Jysk is an international network of shops offering goods for home improvement.
Jysk Linnen'n Furniture Ltd. was founded in 2001.
The company's share capital is EUR 3,500 264.
The company is owned by the Icelandic registered company "Joska Eignarhaldsfelag ehf av PLC".

Festival "Cuban" has begun in Lucavsala.
On the evening of Thursday, August 11, in Lucavsala, one of the last festivals of this summer was given a start - there will be "Cuban" until Sunday night.
The first-night gatherings were spoiled by bands such as "Enter Shikari" from Britain, which was expected last year, but without noticing from the program disappeared, American punks "NOFX", DJ Maxim from the band "The Prodigy" and others.
In the next few days of the festival, the program also features noteworthy words - "Guano Apes" and "Garbage", punk rock legend "Ramone" drummer Marky Ramone with "Marky Ramone's Blitzkrieg", "Brutto&Lyapis" with Belarusian punk rock leader Sergei Mihalok, popular Georgian actor and singer Vahtang Kikabidze, Ukrainians "Vopli Vidoplyasova" and a number of other but full programme of the event can be viewed here.
This is the second year when the festival "Kubana" takes place in Latvia.
Last year it suffered a financial failure and huge losses, but it did not stop the organizers from rehearsing - they added a longing to the name, also included a Latvian group in the programme (on Friday night at 19:15 "All Day Long" will climb the stage) and stated that the festival has now become "closer and acquired local colour alongside such symbols of Riga as its skyline and cats".
Whether these efforts will be justified, it is too early to judge, because the festival has just run, but, as Delfi Entertainment observed on the first evening, at least huge crowds of people have not managed to attract, and the number of visitors was similar to last year.
The British track cycling team doubles the Olympic record and wins the sprint.
The British track team corrected the Olympic record twice on Thursday and won the sprint race for men.
The first Olympic record was corrected by the British in qualification, but was re-corrected by the New Zealanders in the first round of the competition.
The Sprint final met the British team with New Zealand, and the British stripped the New Zealanders of the title of owners of the Olympic record, leaving them with silver medals.
The final British team won by a score of 42,440 seconds, with the New Zealanders outscoring 0.102 seconds.
In the fight for bronze, the French team beat Australia.
It should be noted that the record was also corrected in the qualification of the women's inning ride - the British team corrected the world record, which is now 4:13.260.
The President Who Stayed in the Shadow: Gustav Zemgal - 145.
On Friday, August 12, it is 145 years since the birth of the second President of Latvia Gustavs Zemgals.
Zemgals proclaimed the state of Latvia, but it is undeservedly left in the shadow of the widely described first President of Latvia Jānis Čakste and the last President of the pre-war period Kārlis Ulmanis.
None of our statesmen have defended democracy and the rule of law as much as Zemgals, Arnolds Auziņš writes in the book dedicated to Gustavs Zemgals ten years ago.
In conversation with the portal "Delfi" Auzins emphasizes that Zemgale is one of the few politicians in high positions who have had a sense of humor.
The rest of the strings, always very right.
He taught not to be, today it could be similar to that of Raimonds Vējonis.
"He was one who is close to the people", says Auzins.
Modern politicians know history poorly, they referred to Carl Ulmann as the leader of the good, but rarely does anyone know how disgusted he was.
The only person to whom he had not shouted at will sit in the government was General Balodis.
Even if in pictures he is kind and smiling, by nature he was hysterical.
"Zemgals, with his sense of humor and democracy, leaves exactly the opposite impression", says Auzins.
In a conversation with Delfi, the professor of the Faculty of History and Philosophy of the University of Latvia Aivars Strangs agrees with Auziņš' assessment of Zemgale as a calm and weighed statesman.
He also notes that Zemgale distinguished himself with respect for minorities, and regularly invited Jewish representatives to the presidential palace.
"At that time, it was not usual to do so, after the Zemgal Presidency, Albert Kviesis took over this tradition," the historian says.
He was such a quiet and weighed man who had to be persuaded to become president for a long time.
He didn't pursue it himself, just don't crave fame.
He was also quite critical of himself because he did not know French, but he felt that the president should definitely be able to do so.
"During the Presidency, however, the basics of French were learned", explains Stranga.
Zemgal did not allow himself to be repeatedly persuaded to stand as a candidate, he did not really like high positions at all.
In all respects, he is a very respected personality in the history of Latvia; he was already in a serious position before he got to the Presidential Palace - he was a highly sought-after notary.
Zemgals also managed the famous Zemgal Kassis at Suvorova Street 3, where the Savings and Savings Publishers Society was located, and practically the Latvian State was formed in the negotiations of the government.
He was always progressive.
He was not a great admirer of Ulmann, but he was neither objected to in public.
"In private conversations, however, it has sometimes been said that the real actions of Ulmanis do not sympathize with him", according to Stranga.
He lived a peaceful life, there is no suspicion of lawlessness or corruption.
How does Zemgal remember today?
It is a pity, but for a large part he only associates with a street in Riga.
He was an absolute Democrat, views were centered.
"There were no major shocks in his time, namely, he could associate himself with such a truly stable presidency", sums up Stranga.
During the Presidency of Gustavs Zemgals, from 1927 until 1930, the Latvian state visit to Sweden took place, which at that time implied full recognition of Latvia in the neighbouring country and integration into the family of Northern European democratic nations.
On 28 May 1929, Zemgale arrived on a state visit to Stockholm.
The reply visit of King Gustav V of Sweden to Latvia took place on 29 June 1929.
The second President of Latvia was born in 1871, but passed away in January 1939.
Simple ways to help your child cope with fits of anger.
I often face the fact that my parents view anger, anger, and the appearance of rage as wrong and insane.
When the child openly shows her anger - we don't know how to react, "Econet" is indicated by psychologist Yekaterina Kess.
The specialist encourages a small conversation about these so natural and human feelings - the anger and rage that everyone experiences periodically.
Aggression - it is already a physical activity addressed to another person, and it usually appears when you feel angry.
When we adults are angry, excited - we usually know what's happening to us and how to deal with it.
We can express our anger and rage within ourselves: express, suppress, hide, keep within ourselves, tell about it to our friends or other loved ones, we can sniff a sofa in anger, smoke a cigarette (this is not the best way to dispel anger!), take a shower, hit it with a couch on a table and do other things we don't usually do.
We do not turn our aggression against others because we know different other ways to deal with these emotions.
When anger strikes, children do not understand what is happening to them, how to name them, and how to live with them.
They can say, "Go away!", "You're a fool", "Bad Mom", "I don't see you", "I won't be friends with you" - and very rarely when I'm able to say, "I'm mad at you".
Children live in the literal sense, they are entirely here, at this point, they are spontaneously and truly in showing their feelings, and often are also held captive by various emotions.
It is very important that the parents do not prevent the child from showing feelings, including anger, not being ashamed of it, and not abhorring it, but, on the contrary, helping the child.
Do you need a pause in the relationship?
There are so many reasons why you would like to "switch off" for a moment, a day or even longer from all over the world.
Is it possible to pause the relationship for a moment and breathe in a little bit?
Or does it show that each partner has his or her own way to go?
Gentlemen of different ages share their opinions.
John (23) is brief and concise: "In my view, if you need a pause in a relationship, then you are not with the right person".
Meanwhile, Eduard (30) has discovered a scheme that can possibly help someone.
If you feel that your partner is starting to fall on your nerves for every little detail, then surely it is the right moment to look into other hunting fields to see if you miss him, or especially don't think about him, or even don't even want to see him anymore.
So the answer is, yes, holding a pause can help save time and understand how important the other half is to you.
Cameron (29) reveals his theory.
In my opinion, you have to keep a pause from each other on a daily basis, because if you spend time with a person 24 hours a day, seven days a week, then disputes are inevitable.
They are caused by the fact that you notice every detail that the other does, and it begins to fall on the nerves.
People get tired of each other, especially when there's nothing more to talk about, just about what you've done during the day.
My personal experience makes me think so, so I haven't passed the relationship for more than a couple of months.
If you're thinking for a while about the fact that it's better elsewhere or elsewhere, why does this woman you're with deserve one who can think about not being good enough here and there's a paradise field behind the mountains?
Thinking alone is the little betrayal.
If not, then not.
"I do, so a little condemn those who don't". says Edmund (46).
Carl (33) has the opposite view.
I think everyone needs a moment for respite.
You can't look each and every moment, all the time, from morning to evening in each other's eyes and rejoice in the enduring love.
Come on!
There are so many things - friends, work, parties.
Everything has its time.
Of course, for a friend or wife as well, however, if both can hold that balance between family life and the rest of the world, then it can live up to the edge of the grave.
That's it, and that's it.
Martins (27) says, "It is hard to say - you need or don't need, you may or may not take a pause, but one thing is clear - its initiator doesn't have something in the relationship to the end, something is missing."
If this question is raised, it should be taken into account that in the near future there will be some change - for the better or for the worse, it depends on itself.
I think, while you're still young and crazy, you need a pause all the time, but when everything remains serious and the relationship goes into a completely different phase, then you can't talk about rest.
You decide to spend the rest of your life together!
"If you can't stand each other's society right now and you need some respite from time to time, then what will happen when you are pensioners, who comment on how passing cats are nudging or arguing about the day on which the garden should be better weeded", explains Kristaps (19).
All the names of the lords have been changed.
With his rapturous and rapturous personality, Rozentāls first awakened the interest of the Latvian people in fine arts.
"In this sense, he was the first love of the Latvian people, which as such will remain eternally memorable", Romans Suta wrote about the old master of Latvian painting Janis Rozentāls.
Also in 2016, the opening of the old master's extensive retrospective exhibition in the restored main building of the Latvian National Museum of Art is clear - Rozentāls is the first love of Latvian art.
The exhibition was opened on August 12, but already from August 13 it is open to visitors and will be on view until October 30.
The Latvian National Museum of Art honors painter Janis Rozentāls (1866-1916), whose 50th birthday is included in the UNESCO calendar of ceremonies, with a wide retrospective in the newly opened Great Exhibition Hall.
The retrospective exhibition, featuring more than 150 works, is one of the central events of the Jans Rozentals anniversary year programme.
The selection of works of art is mostly made from the collection of the Latvian National Museum of Art, which convincingly represents the main stages and genres of the classic's creative work, stylistic variability and variety of techniques.
Exhibits from the Axeli Gallen-Callel Museum, the Museum of Writing and Music, the Liepaja Museum, the Tukums Museum and several private collections in Latvia and Finland have also been used.
The atmosphere of the turn of the century is revived by the presence of photographs, the mobile application of the exhibition reveals the interplay of individual works of art with photographs taken by the painter with his own camera for creative purposes.
The Finnish-Latvian Commonwealth Society "Rozentāls-seura", named after the Latvian classics, simultaneously offers the first stop of a small informative travelling exhibition "With a glance in Finland, with a heart in Latvia" at the Latvian National Museum of Art.
A similar exhibition with a presentation in English, Finnish and Swedish will be opened at the Virka Gallery in Helsinki in autumn.
Matt Leblanc looks forward to returning to the show "TopGear".
Matt Leblank, the host of the television program "TopGear" ("In the gas floor!"), has said that he is looking forward to returning in the second season of the car show, but has admitted that he does not know what the future awaits him.
Nothing is officially happening so far.
"If there is, then the BBC will announce it", Leblanc revealed in a conversation with television critics.
Doubt about the future of "Gase in the floor!" arose in July when Leblanc's partner Chris Evans announced that he was leaving the show.
After leaving, Evans admitted that Leblanc and "Gases in the floor!" were "as created for each other".
Evans describes the former star of the series Friends ("Friends") as a "real and good man", thus dispelling rumors that the friendship between the two went wrong during filming.
When asked by Leblankm what he liked most about the show, he replied that travelling to other countries such as South Africa, Morocco and Ireland.
The telechannel tells the BBC that the show's new 24th season does not plan to replace Evans for the time being.
Kalvins: Meldonia could already be removed from the list of banned substances for athletes this year.
It is expected that this year meldonium from the product Mildronate, manufactured in Latvia, could be excluded from the list of banned substances for athletes; on Friday morning, the director of the Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis, academic Ivars Kalviņš, said in LNT broadcast 900 seconds.
He told that he would travel to Canada in September to discuss the issue of meldonium with representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
The scientist expressed the hope that Mildronate would be removed from the "blacklist" already this year.
Two cyclists were taken to hospital in Sigulda after the collision.
In Sigulda, on the Swiss street, two cyclists have run into various injuries, according to the State Police.
The accident involved men born in 1987 and 1990, both of whom were taken to a medical facility.
A cyclist also suffered a fall in Koknese.
A man born in 1989 fell on the street of 1905, and was delivered to medical care.
In Dobele County, Naudīte Parish, in 1989, a motorcyclist tried to avoid a dog that ran out on the road and overturned.
He's in the hospital, too.
Last day in Latvia was registered in 71 road accidents, which affected 16 people.
In some places it'll get colder and cooler.
Also on Friday in Latvia, temporary rain is expected in some places and it will become another degree cooler, agency LETA learned at the Latvian Centre for Environment, Geology and Meteorology.
In places there is a possibility of thunder ducing.
According to forecasts, rain is mostly expected in Kurzeme and in the north of Vidzeme.
The maximum air temperature will be only within +16, +19 degrees.
In Riga, the day will pass without precipitation and mostly the sun will shine.
However, the air will not be warmer than +18 degrees.
Behind the scenes of the US model business, his interpretation has gained the glance of a perversely sophisticated photo shoot and the intolerableness of a horror film.
In essence, a very provocative work on the balance of sophistication and banal vulgarity, in which the borderlines between European art house film and the territory of Hollywood genre product are difficult to draw.
The film, with Vigo Mortensen in the lead role, highlights the question of whether the conceptually chosen life models of parents (ecology, vegetarianism, alternativeism and isolation from consumer society's gleaning and values) bring blessing or destructiveism to their children.
The father of six children, an idealist after the death of his wife, is confronted with questions about the correctness of the choices and the true values.
A moving, life-smart film by Matt Ross won the Cannes Festival Award for directing this year.
Of course, sharks just do it like attacking beautiful girls - in Jaws it was a swimmer, in this case a brave surfer, represented by Blake Laivley.
The work has required of her a profound heroism.
This survival soloum can be compared to James Franco's activism demonstration in the film 127 hours and Ryan Reynolds's game in the film Buried Alive.
Perhaps the main role played by Mila Kunisa is also to blame, whose transformation from a role model to a creative populace and a fanciful of almost family values seems only to be created by a fantasy of rather desperate Hollywood screenwriters.
The Islamic State has captured 2,000 civilian inhabitants in Syria.
The Islamic State militants of the terrorist group, fleeing Menbig, in the Syrian province of Aleppo, have taken captive about 2,000 civilians used as living shields, announced on Friday the U.S.-backed Kurdish-Arab alliance and observers.
"We didn't shoot at them because they took civilians with them as they fled to Jerabulus", stated a spokesperson for the Kurdish Menbig Military Council.
After two months of fighting, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (QSD), a U.S.-backed Kurdish-Arab alliance in northern Syria, announced on Friday that Menbizh had been liberated from the Jihadists.
The Islamic State captured Menbiz in 2014.
The QSD already evicted most of the Islamic State militants from Menbig last week, but some held and showed fierce resistance.
On Friday, however, they left the city, taking their captives with them.
The Islamists travel to Jerabulus, located on the Turkish border.
The London-based Syrian activist organization Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) also reported that approximately 2,000 people were kidnapped by the "Islamic State".
SOHR reported that Islamists hijacked the city's residents' cars, forced people to get into them, and then took them to Jerabulus.
Islamic state militants have also carried out mass kidnappings in the past.
In January, Islamists abducted more than 400 civilians, including women and children, by conquering territories in the Deir ez Zoras province in eastern Syria.
Later, some 270 were released from captivity by Islamists.
How many Islamic State militants have fled Menbig is unknown.
A spokesperson for the Kurdish Menbig Military Council reported that QSD managed to rescue 2,500 people held captive by Islamists in Menbig.
Information collected by SOHR shows that at least 437 civilian residents, including 105 children, have lost their lives in the battle for Menbiz.
299 QSD fighters and 1019 jihadists have been killed.
Colegowa refuses to run for the post of SRS manager.
Inga Kolegova, Head of the State Environmental Service, decided to withdraw her application for the post of the Director General of the State Revenue Service (SRS), told the agency LETA at the Ministry of Finance.
Colegowa points out that discussing her candidacy has increased controversy among the parties of the ruling coalition.
It seems that the real reasons for the discussions are related to the visible, but more often invisible interests of politicians and have nothing to do with the assessment of my professional abilities.
"It is also unacceptable for me", emphasizes the applicant for the post of Head of the SRS.
In case her candidacy would be confirmed in the government, it is clear that it would not be a convincing vote and it would not allow to fully work and realize the necessary changes to the SRS, feeling the support of the entire government.
Without it, a full work would not be possible, concludes Kolegowa.
"I have repeatedly stressed publicly that I do not want to be politically dependent, but now my entire candidacy process is overly politicized", explains the official.
"Thanks for the trust and support shown to me, it is an experience that I consider to be a benefit", Kolegova writes in the submission to Reizniece-Ozola.
Unity expressed on Wednesday that during the meeting with Kolegova there was revealed "substantial contradictions" between the candidate's explanations and information available in public registers about payment of dividends of Pallogs Ltd., because publicly available Pallogs members' meetings decisions provide no profit sharing.
Currently, Deputy Director General Dace Pelēka serves as the head of the SRS.
The Livani police are involved in rescuing two small unattended children, informs the Latgale Region Authority of the State Police.
The message about unattended carriages with infants was received on Friday around 7 p.m.
They were in Livani by the former shop building.
The two little girls are immediately put in the hands of medical practitioners for help.
There was also a purse with documents and a cell phone left in the cart.
In less than half an hour, law officers found out the possible location of the children's parents and went there.
Upon arriving at the woman's civilian's home, police officers found out that the woman was sleeping because she was under the heavy influence of alcohol.
After initial information, the woman, born in 1992, visited a friend, where she consumed alcohol.
As she walked home after a joint meeting, the woman decided to leave the children at the shop under uncertain circumstances.
The police immediately informed the orphanage, who will also decide on the further fate of the children.
The Freeport of Riga has implemented all the recommendations of the SAO regarding the Russian island project.
The Freeport of Riga Authority has implemented all of the five recommendations of the State Audit Office (SAO) regarding the development of the infrastructure of the project on the Russian island for the transfer of port activities from the city centre, the portal Diena.lv informed the company.
Approval of the project is planned for the next meeting of the board of the Freeport of Riga.
In order for the recommendations to be implemented in accordance with the opinion of the SAO, when preparing the necessary documentation for implementation of the recommendations, the Riga Freeport Authority was also guided by the conclusions of the legal and operational audit carried out by the international auditor Deloitte in the Freeport of Riga Authority and the recommendations given for improvement of the project management at the next stage of the project.
Information on the implementation of the recommendations has also been sent to the SAO today.
Despite the fact that the Freeport of Riga Authority does not agree with the SAO's opinion on the usefulness of the implementation of the Russian island project, we are very responsible towards the implementation of the project and the provider of funding - the European Commission (EC).
I would like to stress that all the works planned under the project have been fully completed within the set deadlines and within the planned scope.
"In order to prove to all those involved in the implementation of the project, including the EC, the SAO and also the Stividors, that the main goal of the Freeport is to successfully implement the project, we have fully implemented all the recommendations of the SAO regarding the project management and supervision issues", says the project manager of the Russian island Sanita Kaire.
The long-term action plan for the control and monitoring of the goal of the project was supplemented with the most important planned activities of the involved parties and the deadlines for the necessary decisions, the definition of meetings and regular reports and their deadlines, the tools for monitoring the planned construction process, as well as the definition of the most important border points.
The approved action plan for achieving the project goal by 31 December 2018, in accordance with the recommendations of the SAO, has been supplemented with performance monitoring activities, thus reinforcing the control of the deadlines of activities of other parties involved in the implementation of the project from the Freeport of Riga.
To improve project management and reduce potential risks, a project management plan has been re-developed, defining the areas of project management and indicating the documents developed that provide a control and monitoring mechanism for each of them.
To increase the project capacity, a project management structure has been developed that reflects the planned project management team structure, qualification and functions of the employees.
In order to improve communication between the Freeport of Riga Authority and the parties involved in the project, a stakeholder communication plan has been developed, which, in addition to the parties identified in the project action plan, defines the interested parties for the successful completion of the project, the principles, types and periodicity of the information exchange.
In order to improve control of the use of financial resources, the need for the conclusion of a service contract or the commencement of procurement and the rule of law will need to be further substantiated in future.
Within the framework of the project, the port infrastructure of the world standards - four new deep-sea piers, rail connections, as well as engineering communications have been built on the Russian island.
Constructions co-financed by the Cohesion Fund have been completed and put into operation already at the end of last year, achieving savings of 10.6 million euros.
Security at airports has been strengthened in Slovakia due to threats.
After receiving non-specific threats, Slovakia stepped up security measures at several airports on Friday, the Ministry of the Interior stated.
"In light of the threat, we have stepped up security measures at international airports in Bratislava, Poprad and Košice", a spokesperson for the Slovak Interior Ministry told the AFP news agency on Friday.
"The National Security and Analysis Center is currently analysing the information we have received", he added.
On 16 September, the Slovak capital will host an informal European Union (EU) summit with all the bloc countries except the United Kingdom.
The meeting will discuss the consequences of the British Brexit referendum and discuss the future of the EU without Britain.
Slovakia holds the EU Presidency until January.
German researchers discuss the number of "Berlin Wall victims".
According to a new study, the death toll at the communist yoke of the former East German border could be much higher than previously thought, but doubts about the true number of victims have still not been allayed.
According to data released on Wednesday by the Berlin Wall Museum Checkpoint Charlie, between 1945 and 1989, 1,841 people tried to get out of their controlled territory at the border with western Allied zones and later West German communist authorities murdered.
The museum has been studying border-related deaths for years and adjusting the number of victims from time to time.
This year, 11 more deaths have been added to the list, including including among the victims a six-year-old boy drowned in an attempt to get his family to West Germany through the then Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
Among the new victims of the Berlin Wall are deserters of the Soviet army.
"The ultimate extent of the damage caused by the double evil of communism and socialism is not yet fully documented", admits the director of the museum, Alexandra Hildebrant.
"Our job is to ensure that the graves of those who died trying to escape the Communist-controlled state are cared for and not lost", the statement circulated by Hildebrant underlines.
Other researchers, however, have already questioned the new figures.
"Number 1841 is inconclusive", says Jochen Statt, an expert in East German history at the Free University of Berlin, in an interview with the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung.
He and other researchers at the Free University of Berlin are currently reviewing possible suspicious deaths at the border, and so far they have only managed to confirm 260 cases.
Previously, researchers estimated that only 138 people were murdered by the Communists at the Berlin Wall.
In view of the people who died trying to escape through the Baltic Sea or to get to the West through the territory of neighbouring countries, according to the State, the number of victims could reach about a thousand.
However, it is still considerably less than 1841.
One of the reasons for the different numbers of victims could be different methodologies.
The Checkpoint Charlie Museum also lists all cases of suicide by East German border guards, whether or not they were directly related to their service.
The museum also lists deaths unrelated to direct violence.
"If seniors aged 70 to 80 died of a heart attack after contracting border control, it must be the consequences of this "killing border", Hildebrandte believes.
However, the state is convinced that a distinction needs to be made between the old folk who may have died as a result of their treatment and those whose death was caused by prolonged waiting in hot weather on a bus at the border.
Regardless of this, record keeping of victims is not easy, as communist East German authorities did not accumulate such statistical data, and researchers have to evacuate documents in various scattered archives, states the State.
However, the State Group has recently come up with new documents and could therefore come up with a new estimate of the number of victims in the near future.
LPF President Pone went to Rio with coach accreditation; it's a surprise for himself.
In recent days, the notorious President of the Latvian Swimming Federation (LPF) Kaspars Pone has arrived at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro with the accreditation of a coach, yet he himself feels surprised about it.
On Wednesday, widespread excitement arose after statements by Olympic swimmer Alona Ribakova coach German Yakubovsky, who revealed that he decided to go to Pone at the last minute to Rio de Janeiro while the coach was to stay home.
Initially, swimmers Aļona Ribakova and Uvis Kalniņš, coaches Jakubovsky and Dave Collins, as well as Federation President Pone were approved on the rider list.
The Latvian Swimming Federation registered five participants for the Olympic Games, and even before his departure Aldon Vrublevsky claimed that German would be and was being searched for tickets.
"However, apparently for objective reasons he did not", voiced Pone, expressing the opinion that this did not affect Ribakov's score.
At the request of the federation, Uvya's coach undertook to help her.
Pone, who is himself a member of the LOK's executive committee, strongly criticized the LOK's activities, bringing the blame to the organization overseeing Olympic sports.
In my view, it is unethical for the LOC Executive Committee to confirm five persons and not take any of them.
"I don't know why there wasn't enough room for the Swimming Federation," Pone expressed that the work of the Federation and their presidents had not been appreciated by the public, reminding them that the Federation presidents were not receiving salaries.
Pone also criticised Jakubovski himself, stating that before the London Olympic Games, when Ribakova was not approved among the participants, he complained to the International Water Sports Federation (FINA) and invited Latvia not to send any athletes.
Pone, however, could not tell why he was with coach accreditation at the Olympics, which was likely to be due to Yakubovski.
"I had been applied for as president of the federation ("team leader"), but I got coach accreditation for unknown reasons and now I don't get in anywhere."
The situation changed every day, the number of accreditations available changed.
Until the last minute, I thought German would be, because I didn't have any other information.
According to the agency LETA, a couple of days before the start of Ribakova, she had a conversation face to face with Poni and had a swimmer with tears in her eyes after it, however, the president of LPF himself said that it was a casual conversation with the desire to tune athletes before the start.
Pone recalled that the LPF oversees five sports that are in the Olympic programme, and four of them also conduct training for children in Latvia.
The President of the Federation said that drowning issues are also very important in Latvia, and he also talked about such programs, while he was in Rio for almost two weeks.
He praised the work of the federation and said that the World Cup stage could take place in Latvia in 2018.
Being in Rio is not my vacation, I'm working here, I'm wasting my time, and I'm trying to implement four-year programs.
600,000 salmon juveniles will be introduced into the Daugava.
During the Latvenergo AS fish resource recovery programme this week in Daugava near Mangaļsala there are introduced salmon and sea trout juveniles, and this year more than 600,000 annual salmon and sea trout juveniles grown in the fish farms of the scientific institute Bior Tomes and Dole are planned to be introduced.
Latvenergo Agency was informed by LETA that the release of fish will continue for the next few months as well - every year 6 300 000 juveniles and larvae of different species are admitted into the water bodies of the Daugava basin.
In the spring and early summer of 2016 pike and lamprey larvae will be released, in June - bustard, in July - one-summer salmon, in August and September - zanders and vimbas.
Latvenergo Production Director Māris Kunickis explained that concern for the environment is one of the cornerstones of Latvenergo Group’s sustainable development.
"In measures for the protection and propagation of fish resources, every activity is focused on environmentally friendly actions in close cooperation with the scientific institute Bior, performing both the rearing and licking of juvenile fish in the Daugava basin and other activities", Kunickis pointed out.
This year more than 600,000 annual young salmon and sea trout will be allowed into the Daugava estuary.
For the second year, juvenile fish are marked before being introduced by cutting off the fat fin.
Today's cargo has 25,000 salmon juveniles with an average weight of 31.3 grams.
Each year, the introduction of juveniles and larvae into the river Daugava and its basin water bodies is carried out in a scientifically justified composition and quantity of species.
The reproduction of fish resources in Daugava and its basin water bodies shall be carried out by Bior, in accordance with the regulatory enactments, on the basis of an assessment of the losses caused to fish resources as a result of Latvenergo’s economic activities and providing an opinion on what compensation measures are to be taken to ensure the diversity of fish resources.
The State Environmental Service, on the basis of the said expertise, decides on the amount and type of compensation.
Latvenergo annual compensation amount in the fish resource recovery programme is EUR 1 035 000.
In the spring of 2016, Latvenergo, in cooperation with the association "Wes zidzis", places 400 artificial fish spawning nests in Daugava near Kaibala and Ikskile for the fifth year.
Cooperation with the association, promoting natural spawning of fish, is an additional supported initiative by Latvenergo within the framework of the programme for the restoration of fish resources.
The placement of artificial spawning nests in the reservoir is an important measure that promotes the protection and reproduction of fish resources in Daugava.
In the festival "Sansusi Concert Hall" there is a country courtyard, forest, axe.
Sleep in the tent, eat like in a restaurant, walk in the kedas and listen to the exquisite chamber music, enjoying the quiet peace of nature - such a combination is offered by the alternative chamber music festival in Sansais, which already for the third summer invites to Aknīste district.
The festival will take place in the courtyard of Sussāja - a no longer existing village - in the former parish house, next to forests and axes.
In three days - from 12 to 14 August - you can combine a carefree exquisite enjoyment of nature and academic music on five stages.
The theatre and contemporary circus, performances and installations meet music here.
Opera and academic music, especially in its latest manifestations, find new listeners in a free and open environment without the stiffness of concert halls.
The distance from here to Riga is about 150 km, but to a smile in the face and lightness in the legs for only a few minutes.
"I ask not to look for the programme, because we have deliberately chosen not to publish it in advance, so that people do not go to one particular event or artist, because the real taste of Sansaisi can only be captured by spending all three days in it", invites the initiator and host of the festival, the opera baritone Armands Siliņš.
The festival gate is open Friday at 17.00, and the first concert is at 19.00.
Of course, there will be software on the site with all the information.
For those who have to choose one day, we recommend Saturday, because it is the most saturated - from 9 a.m. till the next dawn.
"The names of the artists are available on the website www.sansusi.lv", says Armands Siliņš.
For example, violinist Eva Bindere, cellist Kristīne Blaumane, opera star Inga Kalna, clarinetist Guntis Kuzma, trumpeter Jānis Porietis, pianist Reinis Zariņš, quartette Quadra and RIX, and even Estonian air acrobat Grete Gross, who together with Latvian musicians Ēriks Kiršfelds, Mārtiņš Zilberts and actress Ancis Strazda have created contemporary circus performance Confines for the artist's inner struggle.
New works have also been created for the festival.
In the performance "Kukainis" for children, composed by Oļesja Kozlovskis and Jēkabs Nīmanis according to the motives of F. Kafka Transformation, along with Armands Siliņš, musicians and actors will participate entomologist (insect researcher) Uģis Piterāns.
Oskars Herliņš has composed the first String Quartet, while Anna Ķirse - Tree Opera, a performance, the main characters of which are Andris Kalnosol's directorship with Katrīna Neiburga's video projections and Andris Eglītis' screenplay will be trees in three small clusters in the wide clear cut of three hectares.
Singing in the voices of Laima Lediņa, Dinara Rudane and Zigmar Graš, they will end up in a romantic relationship, just like in the study of the Swedish natural scientist Karl Linnaeus of the Enlightenment era in Tree Wedding (1729).
The Rio Olympic Games are launched today by Laura Ikauniece-Admidiņa, one of the biggest hopes of the Latvian delegation.
Ikauniece-Admidina at 15.35 Latvian time will start the race in the 100 metres hurdles race, and at 16.50 there will be a competition in the high jump.
On the other hand, the push of the bullet will begin at 2.35 a.m. on Saturday, while at 4.05 a.m. - 200 meters sprint.
The seven-fight competition will be concluded on Saturday, when the long jump, javelin throw and 800 metres race will take place.
Prior to the Olympics, Ikauniece-Admidina, who last year won bronze at the World Championships, was listed as an Olympic medal candidate.
In May, Latvians still set a new national record (6622 points) and won second place in the prestigious seven-fight competition in Gecis, Austria.
Ikauniece-Admidiņa also participated in the 2012 London Olympic Games, when she won ninth place with repeated Latvian record.
In the last year and a half, the athlete has corrected the national record four times.
Today, at 16 p.m., the Latvian judo fighter Artūrs Nikiforenko is scheduled to compete in the weight category above 100 kilograms, leading the fight with Azerbaijani athlete Ushangi Kukauri in the first round.
For the Judist, this will be the first Olympics in his career.
The agency LETA has already announced that on Thursday the loss of up to 100 kilograms in weight category was already experienced by Latvian judo wrestler Evgeny Borodavko in his first fight.
He conceded to Japanese Hagu Ryunoski, who subsequently gained bronze.
In 2000 Vsevolods Zelonijs brought Latvia the Olympic bronze award, but in the next four Olympics, the Latvian Judiths won only one victory together in seven battles, which was done in London by Borodavko.
At 16:30 Latvian time, Dainis Upelnieks will start the qualification competition in the shooting booth, but the selection will conclude on Saturday.
Upelnieks received the Olympic sign only on the day when the composition of the Latvian delegation was officially announced, but later he revealed to LETA that he had been quite safe about driving since April.
The athlete has arrived at the Olympics venue as one of the first Latvian athletes, trying to make the most of the training opportunities in the race shootout.
At 19:05 Latvia's time, the final three trips will be made by Latvian 17-year-old Latvian sailor Kathy Birzule, who competes in sailing for windboards in the RS:X class.
After three days or nine trips, Birzule is currently in 25th place overall among 26 athletes.
The decisive final race for the medals will take place on Saturday.
Today it is finally planned to host a competition in academic rowing, where the Latvian national of Ireland, Sanita Pušpure, is to participate.
On Wednesday, the race was cancelled due to adverse weather conditions.
Pushpure will compete in the C/D semi-finals for single ladies at 19.10 p.m., fighting for 13th place in the Olympics.
On Tuesday, she won fourth place in the quarter-final drive, from the third position, which would allow her to continue fighting for the medal, trailing by a mere 0.65 seconds.
Pushpure won 13th place already four years ago in London, when he also represented Ireland.
Today at the Olympic Games, 24 medal sets will be split - archery, athletics, track cycling, equestrian, fairytale, tramp jumping, judo, academic rowing, shooting, swimming, tennis and weightlifting.
Reid claims if Clinton is elected as president, then she will appoint Garland as a Supreme Court judge .
Senate Democrat Party leader Harry Reid is convinced that if she becomes president, then she will nominate Merrick Garland as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court .
The Senate Republican Party has blocked Garland's approval since March, when he was nominated by President Obama.
Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell announced that the next president would choose who would replace current Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Thursday during his conference, Reid announced that he was confident that Clinton would choose Garland.
Reid's spokeswoman later told him that he had not personally spoken to Clinton on the subject and these were just speculation.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team would not want to "swing the boat" with a different choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the United States District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Reid said that the Republicans blocking Garland's nomination were "putters" and were acting in the interests of Republican Party presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also said that Trump was not fit for the job of president.
The treat announces a nude photo calendar for women and men.
Treat magazine will work with photographer David Belmer to create the 2017 calendar Pirreli in the style of the 1970s.
In its 2017 NU Muse calendar, it is planned to showcase the new supermodels, not naked celebrities.
Earlier this year, Steve Shaw, president of Treats magazine, stated that his erotic arts magazine was different from the old-fashioned Playboy because "Playboy is a male magazine".
This magazine is for women.
Looks like he's also talking about the calendar.
In a press release on the creation of the calendar, Shaw states, "We must return to portraying a persistent and classic nudity in pictures, where a woman's body does not confuse, but inspires both women and men."
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a great work of art.
Models can send in their photos electronically or personally at casting sessions in Los Angeles and New York.

The owner of the motorcycle had wanted to sell the vehicle by advertising.
At the agreed time, a potential buyer arrived, climbed a motorcycle as if to try it and left.
The employees of the Ogre Police Station of the Riga Regional Authority of the State Police ask to refer to anyone who may provide any information useful for the investigation in relation to the offence.

Greenland shark is the longest-lived vertebrate - video review
Scientists say that Greenland sharks have the longest life span of all vertebrates on our planet.
Shark researcher Julius Neilsen says that the long-lived record belongs to a female that could be 272 to 512 years old and five metres long.
A French court rejects the request to demolish shops in the Jungle refugee camp.
A French court rejected Calais authorities' request to demolish dozens of self-created shops and restaurants in the Jungle Camp, where several thousand refugees live.
At a court hearing in Calais this week, the authorities indicated that the state should demolish 72 self-created shops, where people in the camp area sell various goods, such as cigarettes and energy drinks, offer barber services, tea for 50 cents (40p) and simple meals for some euro in self-created restaurants.
The prefect's office in Calais pointed out that these self-created businesses should be demolished because they form a shadow economy and do not pay taxes, and pose fire and sanitary risks.
The representatives of the humanitarian group explained to the court that these small businesses are essential because the food provided by the government and support groups does not meet the needs of the camp, in which the population continues to grow.
They also pointed out that self-created shops and restaurants often offer free shelter and food to those most in need.
Lille's court ruled that there was no legal basis for expelling people who created 72 self-created shops, but it understands Calais' prefect's concerns.
Justice Jean-François Moll said that food, coffee and restaurants play a bigger role than simply providing food to people who live in "extremely humble conditions".
He pointed out that these places were peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places at risk of demolition is the camp cafe "Jungle Book Kids", which provides more than 200 free meals a day, English and French language classes and provides asylum advice to hundreds of vulnerable minors without accompanying adults.
Over 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect a children's cafe.
A letter addressed to the Guardian indicates that the dissolution of the cafe "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old."
On Friday, two charities "Help for Refugees" and "L'Auberge des Migrants" reported that the number of residents of the "Jungli" camp has grown to 9,000 people, the highest since the rapid influx of migrants in the summer.
Britain wins silver in rugby-7 series fight when Fiji's national unit masterfully wins gold.
The impressive performance of the British team in the rugby-7 series ended on Thursday when, in an exciting final race at Deodoro Stadium in Rio, the Fijian national unit convincingly crushed them with a score of 43:7.
Fiji demonstrated a masterclass in ball management, balls play with a leg, a support game and a brutal power game, winning gold - the first Olympic medal in its history.
The defeat brought a respectable consolation award - the silver medal that was Britain's third medal that day. The British team can be proud of their success in the first Olympic rugby-7 tournament in which they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The heavy fight in the semi-final, in which the Boks team defeated by a score of 7:5 a.m. in the first half of the day, probably replayed for Great Britain in the final.
But anyway, the Fijian team is currently in its best form to also win the 15-man squad.
Although unlikely, however, some consolation for Britain might be the fact that at least one British won the gold medal. It is the head coach of the Fijian team Ben Ryan - a former English coach from Wimbledon.
It was an exciting adventure for Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's guidance, they lost all games in the rugby-7 series stage in Adelaide.
They only lost one game this time.
Defeat is painful, but growth is amazing.
Fiji spectacularly started the match by repelling British power techniques for joy.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and the members, it was like rushing several opposing buses and World Series champions took the lead with 5:0 when Osea Collinisau scored the first touchdown.
In the last four minutes, Jerry Tuwai also further increased the lead by realizing a touchdown on the right wing.
The score at 12:0 and the British team hadn't even really touched the ball.
Mitchell's excellent power technique prevented the stupendous Leoni Nakarava from scoring three points, but this only slightly affected Fiji's score.
In the seventh minute of the game, Jasa Veremalua scored a touchdown in the right corner, securing a lead over Great Britain to 17:0.
After the rematch, Nakarava further increased the lead and had more than a minute left by the end...the end of the first half-time.
Vatemo Ravouvou avoided some awkward British power techniques and crossed the line, scoring.
The touchdown provided a score of 29:0.
Fiji seemed to have been born to play in rugby-7 matches while the British were still learning.
In fact, it is true.
The British team made a profound change at half time, breaking the line of Fiji players... the full four minutes, which was good by the standards of the first half time, until Joshua Tuisova, after a fantastic team-play, scored a few more points for the Fijian team.
Dan Norton managed to score for the British team, making a touchdown in the left corner and achieving a score of 36:7, but the game had already been lost, meanwhile South Sea Islanders fans sang, waving flags and dancing in stands.
One cannot fail to admire Fiji's joyful attitude.
Mata Viliame made Fiji's victory even sweeter with another touchdown at the end of the game.
Playing the end of the game whistle, Fiji could begin to celebrate, but the British were able to sit down in the grass after defeat alone.
In the first half of the day, Fiji defeated Japan by a score of 20:5, while the British were superior to South Africa, where in a very fierce fight both teams scored through a touchdown and the South Africans lost by just a few points.
In the first half time, Kyle Brown put the Boxing team in the lead, but in the second half time, Dan Norton crossed the line with shining mastery and delivered the ball between the poles, securing the British victory.
Marcus Watson, who is the brother of Antony, the England rugby-15 team player, the excellent power technique at the end of the game ensured the team won and another silver medal.
The coach's battle with cancer has inspired Helen Glover and Heather Staning to win the rowing race.
It will be the most emotional gold medal in this race and it already expresses a lot.
From the first to the last beat, Helena Glover and Heather Staning's golden moment played a special role on the Estacio da Lagoa track.
Although the boat has only two athletes, they were accompanied by an echo of Robin Williams, who inspired them up until winning the second Olympic gold medal in pair rowing for women, becoming the first women in British sports history to achieve such success.
They undoubtedly dominated, as for the 39th time they scored an unbeaten, unprecedented victory.
The two great athletes, with the elegance of the swan sliding on the surface of the water, do not fully reflect this triumph.
A whole team is standing behind each acquired gold medal in rowing, working hard for athletes to continuously improve their performance and the biggest contribution to their success has been made by a coach who, 30 months ago, did not know if he would experience this day because he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to him, it disappeared as quickly as it appeared.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of those you can and did operate.
If it didn't, it'd spread all over the body.
And the situation would become out of control.
It changes your vision a little.
Williams discovered cancer in December 2013.
This trio was fortunate that William could start a recovery procedure at the start of the 2014 midseason and reduce the duration of the break to a minimum, if you can say so.
I needed an income, so I had to recover quickly.
This stimulated the recovery.
I was in the hospital and walked distances of 6, 10, and even 15 meters, although the doctor said that a few steps would be enough.
That's how it all started.
Airing is a challenge in itself, but this time it was even bigger.
After the victory, the first thought was at once about Williams, who was very worried all morning and spoke more than usual under the influence of excitement.
Staning, who has served in the Royal Artillery Unit in Afghanistan, said, "This was an emotionally difficult week, but it means a lot to me."
It just confirms how much it means to us and how much I, Helen and Robin have worked.
The 3 years with Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin, we wouldn't have achieved anything, so thank you very much to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I can't think of a better training fellow or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Staning have not lost any races in five years.
The couple achieves such an enormous speed that competitors cannot compete with.
Even in the last 500 metres, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Staning and Glover's predominance was too great.
We felt every moment.
Helen shouted, "Keep the rhythm, keep the rhythm."
It's really important not to lose concentration.
We managed a good start, but at the same time we had no high expectations.
That day we had no intention of overthrowing records, but just paddle and win the race well and we did.
A couple of years will rest to decide what to do next.
The following month will be the wedding of Glover and television adventurer Steve Bashal.
For now, she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say this was my last race.
It would have been too much pressure.
It took me about six months in London to understand that I am the Olympic champion.
It was a new experience and I was very excited.
This time it took about four minutes.
She said, "The feeling is fantastic."

Colegovu will be "directed to the last" as head of the SRS.
According to him, it is already "principlely important" for Prime Minister Māris Kučinskis (Green and Farmers' Union) and Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Green and Farmers' Union) to approve the nominees headed by the Minister of Finance Kolegovu as the head of the SRS.
Rajevski estimated that both Kučinski and Reizniece-Ozola in this government approval of the head of the SRS is "the first big decision" that can affect their future as politicians.
If now the position will be changed in the choice of the SRS manager candidate, then it will negatively affect their image in the public administration.
The agenda of next week's meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers includes the issue of transfer of the head of the VVD Kolegova to the post of the Director-General of the SRS, according to the government agenda.
Kolegov was promoted to the position of head of the SRS by the Minister of Finance Reizniece-Ozola after Inara Peterson resigned from the management of the service and when the competition for the post of SRS general manager ended without result.
In an interview with Latvian Radio on Thursday, 11 August, the Acting Head of the SRS Dace Pelek admitted that if she was offered to run for the position of Head, she could agree.
The Minister of Finance, however, later admitted that he did not consider other candidates for the post of Head of the SRS.
Raivis Dzintars, the head of the Saeima faction of the National Association, also admitted that the NA still supports Kolegov under the direction of the SRS.
In Spain, the failure to form a government threatens the chances of reducing the deficit.
On 12 July a month ago, the European Commission (EC) expressed the opinion that Spain and Portugal had not taken sufficient measures to bring the deficit level down to the 3% of gross domestic product (GDP) required by the euro area.
It is estimated that despite the austerity measures implemented, Portugal's budget deficit at the end of last year was 4.4% of GDP and in Spain it was 5.1%.
The European Commission, however, decided not to impose economic sanctions on both countries, while at the same time setting fiscal targets for the near future.
One of the reasons why the EC did not introduce sanctions against these two countries, however, is the growing Euroscepticism in many countries of the European Union.
Additional sanctions would only increase such negative sentiment.
Critics point out, however, that the EC is not consistent in its decisions by agreeing from the outset on uniform rules and then being unable to apply them in life.
For example, the President of the German Bundesbank, Jens Veidmann, has pointed out that Europe is losing its trust in itself in this way, giving citizens the impression that the European Union's rules are recommendative, not binding.
The EC has now proposed and all Member States have approved an extension of the deadline for the correction of the deficit until the end of this year for Portugal and until 2018 for Spain.
The European Commission promises to examine the progress made by the two countries in the coming months, while pointing out that both Spain and Portugal must be prepared to introduce additional austerity measures if circumstances so require.
Initial forecasts suggest that Portugal could achieve its target within the prescribed time frame and that the budget deficit could drop to 2.5% of GDP already this year.
This means that, as part of the Stability Programme, this country's government has to implement austerity measures amounting to 0.25% of GDP this year.
These measures should be included in this year's budget, with an additional focus on controlling the costs of purchasing goods and services.
In the case of Spain, the situation is much more complicated.
This year, the budget deficit should be reduced to 4.6%, next year to 3.1% and in 2018 to 2.2% of GDP.
Moreover, in the next two years, consolidation measures should amount to 0.5% of GDP annually.
The achievement of these objectives is particularly difficult due to the fact that Spanish political parties have not been able to agree on the formation of a government for eight months now, and it is becoming more and more likely that Spain may have to hold early parliamentary elections for the third time in a year.
However, opinion polls show that the third elections would not change the political picture in the country substantially either.
The most popular party remains the popular party led by current Prime Minister Mariano Rahoy, who would win less than 33% of the vote again in the election.
Only the Socialists have gained some popularity, while the popularity of the anti-absence parties Podemos or Together We Can and Ciudadanos or Citizens has diminished somewhat.
The People's Party wants to get the Socialists and the Ciudadanos into government as late as this month, otherwise it will not be possible to adopt and submit the draft budget for 2017 to the European Commission for approval by mid-October.
As stated by Rafael Hernando, representative of the People's Party parliamentary faction, if the government fails and the parliamentary elections are held for the third time, Spain will become a laughing stock for Europe as a whole.
The cleanliness of the beaches in the Gulf of Riga is critical.
During the fifth year of surveying the beaches, activists concluded that unfortunately, the number of waste found is increasing each year, and most of the bathing area visitors are to blame.
The most polluted bathing areas are located in Riga.
The city council explains that bathing areas are cleaned up every day, but fighting dirty visitors is quite difficult.
In addition, the waste left on land may be flushed into the water during rainfall, thus significantly impairing its quality.
Apart from Liepaja beach and separate places in Kurzeme, the cleanliness of beaches elsewhere in Latvia is critical.
Such a statement has been distributed this week by volunteers of the "My Sea" campaign.
While walking the road along the Gulf of Riga for the fifth year, activists concluded that the amount of waste left by the inhabitants has increased every hundred metres.
Unfortunately, this year this criticism has come to an end.
"We see that this will be a year when the number of waste on the beach 100 meters may even exceed 200 units", says Jānis Ulme, spokesman for the expedition "My Sea".
Latvian Radio called, he was on the beach of Tūja, where the volunteer march along the Gulf of Riga continues.
This year, activists have had to collect even daylight bulbs left in the sand of the sea.
The participant and organiser of the hike Ulme says, it is the residents who are responsible for the pollution.
"The main source is the beach visitors themselves, because more than half of the total amount of waste is plastic, various waste, starting with bags, pieces of plastic that are already in the process of degradation, they can no longer be identified, and cans, bottles, corks", says Ulme.
Among the dirtiest beaches are also bathing areas in Riga.
For example, almost 800 waste units have been collected in Daugavgriva every hundred meters, which is critical.
The campaign organisers also explain that almost every step of the campaign is tossed by ridicules and warning or prohibition signs not placed everywhere.
"The average figures for all three bathing areas in Riga - Daugavgrīva, Vākabulļi and Vecāķi - unfortunately come large and far beyond the desired goal, which Latvia is moving towards, to reduce the number of waste units to 135 by 2020," concludes the environmental advocate.
Bathing in Riga takes place every day, on the hottest days of summer even twice, says Uģis Vidauskas, the representative of the City Council.
However, fighting dirty visitors is quite difficult.
We are returning to the cultural issue of these people.
"On those who fertilize, consume alcohol, smoke and do all those things that should not, even special signs don't work", Vidauskas points out.
Therefore, Vidauskas invites bathing visitors to report contaminants to the police as well.
You can call the police, safely point out these abuses and that way everyone fights.
Perhaps some new warnings may be put in place, but, as I said, it is unlikely that this will radically change the situation.
"Since all together must simply turn and be intolerant of such offenders", he emphasizes.
Meanwhile, water quality measurements have already been carried out for the fourth time this summer by the Health Inspectorate, which may impose a ban on official bathing areas.
This year, like other years, water quality is good and satisfactory everywhere.
The current situation is that all 56 bathing areas have had good water quality at all times and no restrictions on bathing.
"For the last time, we will take the analyses at the end of August", according to Normunds Kadikis, a senior environmental health specialist at the inspection.
Waste left on land during heavy rainfall can be washed into water.
This, in turn, may affect its quality, according to an environmentalist.
Rotations in the Russian elite continue - the change of leader in the Putin administration.
Did he leave the office himself?
Vladimir Putin has announced to the Russian media that Sergei Ivanov has wanted to leave this position himself and will henceforth be the President's Special Representative for Nature Conservation, Ecology and Transport.
Announcing the changes, Putin gave Ivanov a commendation in front of the television cameras: "Dignified Sergej Borisovic, you and I have been working together for many years and doing it successfully."
I am pleased with the way you are carrying out the duties assigned to you.
I remember well about our agreement not to use you in this position as head of the presidential administration for more than four years.
That is why I understand your desire to change the scope.
And I hope that you will also make full use of your knowledge and experience in your new position.
However, it is highlighted that running the Presidential Administration is a very important position and this made Ivanov one of the most influential people in the country.
Considering that elections to the State Duma are expected in Russia next month, rumours have been made that this step is related to the struggle for power in the Russian political elite.
Ivanov was also called a possible alternate for Putin as president, so the claim that he himself wanted to hold the position of Presidential Representative for Nature Conservation and Transport raised doubts.
According to Lsm.lv archive, Ivanov is the general colonel of the KGB and the Federal Security Service.
Ivanov has been an ancient and close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He started his career in special services in 1975, where he met Putin.
Later, as Putin became head of the Federal Security Service, Ivanov became his deputy.
At the end of the reign of the first Russian President Boris Yeltsin, on the other hand, he was appointed secretary of the Russian Security Council.
In 2000, after Putin's coming to power, Ivanov's "Information Security Doctrine" was approved, which, among other things, envisaged reviving the state's censorship mechanisms in Russia.
In 2001, Sergei Ivanov became the Minister of Defence of Russia, and already in 2005 - Deputy Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov and was responsible for the development of Russian defence industry companies and arms exports.
Now, after leaving the post of Head of the President's Administration, Ivanov will also retain a seat on the Russian National Security Council, while the new Head of the President's Administration, Vaino, will also work.
Vaino comes from a family in the Soviet party elite.
The position of head of the President's administration is said to have been suggested by Ivanov himself.
Anton Eduardović and I have long been known.
Still from when we worked under your leadership in the government.
And for the last nearly five years, we've been communicating practically every day.
"So I am sure that by all professional and personal character qualities he is ready for this work", said Ivanov.
Vaino comes from a family that belonged to the Soviet Party elite.
His grandfather Karl has held senior positions in the Estonian Communist Party, including serving as its first secretary for ten years until 1988.
The online edition "Meduza" with reference to the book "Estonian Self-Determination and Independence" writes that at the end of the 1980s Karl Vaino had asked Moscow to grant permission to use force against demonstrators.
However, he was said to have been refused and soon lost his position.
Shortly after, Vaino has moved to live in Moscow.
Anton Vaino is a graduate of the Moscow Institute of International Relations and manages the Japanese language.
However, he has left the diplomatic service to work in the administration of the President's Protocol.
It has already been reported that the latter did not give Russia a boost by the suspensions and even arrests of a number of high-ranking officials, including the replacement of governors and federal representatives of several districts.
According to political scientists, President Vladimir Putin is re-aligning the ruling elite before the elections to be held in 2018.
One of the main features is that more and more representatives of power structures are being placed at the top positions.
Judo wrestler Nikiforenko also loses the first fight of the Olympics.
This was a fight in the first round, and the Latvian judo wrestler has finished his participation in the Olympics, finishing 17th.
Coach Oleg Baskin admitted to Latvian Television that Nikiforenko had very little hope, and it was already clear before the race.
He also revealed that a judo wrestler suffered a shoulder injury in the fight.
It is noteworthy that, in order to get to the Olympic sign, Nikkiforenko had to compete in a different weight category than usual - that is, in a weight category of up to 100 kilograms.
Azerbaijani wrestler was 25 kilograms heavier.
It has already been reported that Evgeny Borodavko fought in the weight category of up to 100 kilograms against Ryunosuki for two and a half minutes until the opponent managed a throw worth a clean victory.
Consequently, Latvia has concluded the judo competition in Rio.
Dreams disappear in the sand of Rio.
The Thursday was preceded by Judist Evgeny Borodavko.
Yes, he had a more titled opponent in return, but the ambitious sometimes have the ability to make a surprise.
He didn't get it.
Arthur Nikiforenko's task was even more complicated, as experience smaller and opponent also respectable.
As a result, although he held on to Tatami for almost a minute and a half longer than Borodavko.
Unfortunately, in recent times, the Latvian Judiths lack the most ambition.
Since Gunārs Ķirsons and his financial stadt Vladimirs Šestakovs passed away from the Federation management, Aleksandrs Jackevičs left Latvia, no longer "Golden Score", - Judo development is going down a downward curve.
Jackević, who advises Kazakh judists here, and Vsevold Zelonia does not see the heirs.
But if you don't grow up, there won't be either.
And that's the prerogative of the federation.
Therefore, the promise of the President of the Latvian Judo Federation to win medals in Rio was sounded as from another galaxy in the Morning Panorama.
Flight far from reality.
In the evening we were looking forward to the beach volleyball match Samoilovs/Šmēdiņš - Evandru/Pedru Solbergs.
Intrigue as in "death" group - losers are out of play.
The Latvian duo, however, had a slight departure - it could also lose, but not more than four points in two sets.
The tension was further increased by the protracted previous game.
No one wanted to die - this feeling over the windy court was whining the entire length of the match.
The gusty wind caused additional complications for the players.
At first it seemed that it could be an ally of ours - which is more comprehensive -.
But he didn't.
It was easy enough to play against the Latvian duo here.
Serve so to Samoylow and wait for him to tear.
Against Canada cracked, against Cuba cracked at the end of the first set and the beginning of the third, as the load was no joke.
Schmidt could be fishing at the time because there was little work, but when there was, he did it honorably.
The Brazilians Samoilov with Shmedin could be defeated in two sets, as the first took over with 16:15, however on 16 also remained, exhausting the lost point limit.
But it was possible to lose by 0:2, because in the second set the deficit was -4, but thanks to the wind, it was possible to win.
The third was already in Evandi's service drawing.
A chain was formed - an inconclusive serve was taken, the second pass often flies too close to the net and Samoilov had few options for a successful attack.
If there was a foreign Samoilov in the square against the Cubans, then this time he was more successful, and only to Sasha bring the loss to the unprofessional.
Kreil was also wrong, and it is symbolic enough that he hit the last ball in the block.
A losing team.
This time there was definitely a lack of success - in the third set alone, two attacks by Evandi almost flew out of the court, but the bomb hit the line, however.
Two aisles were next to the line.
The controversial episode was also ruled in favor of opponents in the video.
If in the first two games Evandru was plagued with servches, then against ours they were very productive.
Everything summed up in a loss on the tablo.
Now it is necessary to calmly analyse the causes of failure.
Perhaps it was like living next to a stadium, not with a delegation in the Olympic village.
It took two and a half hours on the road.
Maybe a little overconfident was given by a series of seven semi-finals.
Maybe Klagenfurt shouldn't have played, but come here sooner and get better acclimatized.
Maybe there was a failure in finding the top of the sporty form.
So far, more questions than answers.
Our pants are out of their games.
Dream of medals over.
What's next?
There are still a few World Cup tournaments left and also Jurmala's Masters.
Smead with Samoylov has never been and will not be friends in his life, because there are too different personalities.
But that's not necessary either.
When the dream of Olympic medals has collapsed, the idea of divorce may also arise, because the fault will be sought not only in itself, but also in the partner.
It is not difficult to decide, but it will be much more difficult to find a worthy partner in Latvia.
Both brothers play the pike, but John and Tom have already tried and also parted, while Mikhail Samoilov is still too green to start conquering the world's peaks.
You can try Haralds Regžas, Aleksandrs Solovejs, Edgars Točs to return to Mārtiņš Pļaviņš, but it will not be better than this option, which proved itself more than once during the World Cup stages.
The sand of Copacabana did not smile at them this time.
That's it.
Of course, one should also take into account the fact that beach volleyball is becoming more popular, new pairs are coming into circulation, and only the few have a height of less than two meters.
This does not guarantee success yet, but is an essential argument in the fight for victory.
Ours don't stay taller.
Both athletes and journalists have the opportunity to live in the venues offered by the game organisers, as well as to choose their own.
The U.S. basketball team lives on a cruise ship, with some tennis players not staying in the Olympic village.
Also, some beach volleyball players have found a hotel in Kopacabana.
This time, the rather modest accommodations offered by journalists were charged with heavily exaggerated prices.
That's why the choice fell to the apartment rent.
The risk is because sometimes they can be uncomfortable from a logistical point of view.
This time the risk is justified.
Together with Vladimir Vladimirović we rent apartments on the Kopacabana and Ipanema border.
Beach 200 meters away, a bay arena in half an hour's walk.
The district is safe enough, because the favelas are true, but the vigilance must not be lost here either.
Vladimir Vladimirovich is not what some immediately imagine, but the most professional sports journalist in Russian media Vladimir Ivanov.
P.S. Looks like another medal dream was dreamed up on Friday morning.
In the 100 metre hurdles and high jump, Laura Ikauniece-Admidina fell behind her personal records.
But there are already five disciplines.
After a 10-year break, "Porgy and Bessa" sounds in Liepaja.
In Latvia, the opera "Porgijs un Bessa" was first studied in 1973 at the Latvian National Opera.
Since then, the internationally recognized masterpiece has not been performed repeatedly.
That is why the organisers of the Cēsis Art Festival and Liepaja Art Forum have decided in close cooperation to give the audience the opportunity to enjoy Georges Gēršvins's master.
"It is a great pleasure for us that after a break of ten years, when Liepaja was able to enjoy the opera production for the last time, this great version of George Görshwin's "Porgy and Bess" opera concert studio can be enjoyed with us in the new, newly opened concert hall "Great Amber", says Baiba Bože, head of the concert hall "Great Amber".
The opera "Porgy and Besa" is a vivid musical story about love, its volatility, passion, as well as domestic tragedies and simple everyday joys.
It reflects African-American vitality, music and rhythm.
It is this lack of political correctness in this opera that this exclusion of tolerance makes it so alive.
"And yes, this love story is extremely powerful, extremely beautiful and in some way really deep", says director Viesturs Kairišs.
What I like most - listening to or playing this opera, there are always such stops - famous melodies, famous motifs, but these transitions from one character to another, illuminating one character or another character or choir or orchestra.
"It's the most exciting, this building", the opera is appreciated by the musical director and conductor of the concert studio of the opera "Porgijs un Bessa".
Visitors to the opera agree that this is a grand event.
It is a great pleasure for them to hear this world-renowned Guershin Opera.
Blessed is that in Liepaja one can feel the breath of the world.
"Execution professional", the opera is appreciated by visitor Edgars Lāms.
The concert studio was special in that the newly opened concert hall "Great Amber" first played an orchestra in the orchestra pit and first hosted an opera concert performance.
The square near the renovated building of the Museum of Art could be named after Janis Rozentāls.
The Vice Mayor of Riga Andris Ameriks told the opening of the Rozentals anniversary exhibition that the museum's own address could also in the future be not Krišjāņa Valdemāra iela 10a, but Janis Rozentals Square 1.
The director of the museum Māra Lāce admitted that re-registration of the address will result in a considerable bureaucratic burden, however, overall this idea is welcomed and therefore agreed to the proposal of the municipality.
The city of Riga laid a kind of foundation stone for this idea in 1936 by creating the Burkards Dzenis monument to Janis Rozentāls, which stands near the museum.
Vilhelms Purvītis, then director of the museum, was one of the initiators for the construction of this monument.
In this way, this further action could be purely logical.
I'm a little bit of a bit of a hunch all the time - but Wilhelm Purvitis, where are we going to put his name?!
"But if you promise to think, Mr. America"... said Bear.
The National Museum of Art building was officially opened this year in May after a major reconstruction and modernisation.
This week will finally begin the reconstruction of VEF Culture Palace.
The castle will be restored by "Velve" Ltd. for approximately 11 million euros.
It is planned to renovate several rooms of the castle, including two auditoriums, as well as to adapt the building to people with reduced mobility.
The Riga City Council intends to raise six million euro of European Union funds for the project, however, Oleg Burovs, the Director of the Property Department of the Riga City Council, admits that at the moment there is no complete clarity about European funds for the project.
"Despite the fact that the political will to start repairs to the VEF Culture Palace with the involvement of the European Structural Funds is, we are waiting for months for a decision, real action from the officials of the Ministry of Finance, will have its money allocated or not", says Burov.
Last December we were told that everything depends on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance received a letter from the European Commission that you are making your own decision that Brussels is not taking a decision here.
Now we see another round of discussions emerging, and then we will see what we can expect in the next few days.
"I would like to say that the Riga City Council undoubtedly guarantees that this process will be initiated and completed in due time", Burovs points out.
It has already been reported that more than a year ago, in March 2015, VEF Culture Palace organized a farewell concert collectively before the immediate renovation of the building.
Although a year had passed, the renovation of the building had still not begun and collectively continued to work under inadequate conditions.
In the strategy of the Riga City Council Property Department, the renovation of the VEF Culture Palace is divided into seemingly independent reconstruction packages, where each of them will ensure different implementation of the functions of the castle.
The first is increasing the accessibility of the VEF Culture Palace and improving the surrounding area.
It is intended to arrange the surrounding area and engineering communications, as well as restore the facade of the building.
The second is improvement of services offered by VEF Culture Palace.
It plans to restore the interior, walls and ceilings of the building, improve the stage and sound recording studio, as well as arrange the interior engineering communications of the building.
Third - Improving working conditions of creative amateur collectives, which includes plans to improve workshop equipment, space heating and ventilation systems.
Before the 40th anniversary of "Līvu" you can get acquainted with the legendary rock band at the exhibition in Liepaja.
The exhibition will present various characteristic objects of "Līvus" - photographs arranged in a time line to reflect the group's activities from the beginning until 2010, when the group's activities are announced.
The participants' stage costumes, musical instruments, awards and concert recordings, as well as other things not yet seen to the general public that reflected the creative activity of the band "Līvi", will also be shown.
The exhibition will be supplemented with items of Liepaja Museum collection.
The visual design of the exhibition was created in collaboration with the fashion artist and painter Elita Patmalniece.
Musicians who have been associated with the band "Livi" and their loved ones also responded to the call and shared both objects and memories.
The origins of "Līvu" can be traced back to 1972, when a vocal instrumental ensemble was created at Liepaja Culture House, led by Juris Pavītols.
In its original composition, the ensemble participated in the festival "Liepājas ambers" in 1972 and 1974, as well as in the city and republic exhibitions.
In 1976 a fatal meeting took place when Juris Pavītols met Ēriks Ķīģelis and Metalurgs founded a group in the culture palace, inviting Ingrīda Gūtmanis, Andris Krūzins and Jānis Grodums to join.
Over the years, the composition of the group has changed more than once.
The participants have joined, others have gone their way, some have returned.
Most importantly, however, the desire to confirm that Latvian rock music is able to live and exist has remained unchanged.
"What to see was not lacking - denim, hairy and bearded, these boys differed markedly from the stereotype of the generally accepted stage singer", music reviewer Klass Squiere says about the band.
In addition to the musicians mentioned above, the band has hosted such outstanding musicians as Hugo, Vilnis Krieviņš, Modris Sterns, Valdis Štarks, Laimis Rācenētājs, Tālis Pusbarnieks, Ainars Virga, Aivars Brīze, Guntars Mucenieks, Dainis Virga, Thomas Klein and many others.
Entrance free of charge.
The exhibition is open from August 19 to October 30.
On August 27, Liepāja Concert Garden "Pūt, brīviņi" will host the group "Līvi" 40th anniversary celebration "LIVISTEST 2".
For the first time in 8 months, Bulgaria is experiencing inflation.
In July, Bulgaria's national statistics showed 1% monthly inflation.
It is the highest since 2012 and the first above zero since October of the previous year, when it was positive (0.2%).
Average annual inflation by CPI, in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016), compared to the previous year, was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 was 101.9% year-on-year and the monthly average inflation was 1.0%.
As of the beginning of the year, the inflation rate was -0.2% (July 2016 compared to December 2015) and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016 there was an increase in prices for the following groups of consumer goods: food and soft drinks (1.7%); transport (1.8%); entertainment and cultural events (6.3%); hotels and restaurants (1.2%); household goods and services (0.3%).
Prices dropped for clothing and footwear (2.2%); housing equipment, household appliances and regular home cleaning (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the previous month's level for alcohol and tobacco, management, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Zbigniew Stankevich: The time is coming, and the truth rises.
In an interview with the Independent, Zbigniev Stankevich, archbishop of the Latvian Catholic Church, emphasizes that if we want to gain the strength of life, the message of the Gospel should be at the centre of it.
For the power of truth is greater than the emptiness of evil.
Many are already on their way to the festival of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Aglona.
What message will believers receive there this year?
In recent years, the desire to conduct the main service in Aglona has been expressed by the papal nuncia.
As a result, the main content of the message is up to him.
It also turned out to be a kind of tradition that Bishop Janis Bulis leads the Cross Road.
He, too, will shape his own message.
I run a festive Vigilian service the previous day.
Last year, I turned to Pope Francis' encyclical "Laudato si" and updated the common house, the Earth theme in the context of Latvia.
This year...Of course, I'm watching what's going on in the world, and I'm trying to respond to it in my address.
My approach coincides with the Church's suggestion that the Gospel message should be placed at the heart of life.
It must be shown that the Gospel answers the most painful problems of a person's life and gives him inspiration for a further path.
Then it addresses people.
But in Cēsis, in the discussion of Lampa, you said that you should "return to the understanding of the full man".
What do you mean?
Does this mean that a person turns away from the church message?
And does the church today have a resource for such a return?
A man dying on the side of the road is robbed in the capital of India.
In the Indian capital, no one seems to have been aware of a man who was hit by a road dying - it turns out that he has slept an hour on the side of the road and then been robbed, informs the BBC.
It has been reported that the man, identified as Matiboul, was driving a rickshaw by day, and worked as a security guard at night.
Matiboul went home on the road at 5:30 a.m. when he was hit by a car.
A recording of surveillance cameras shows that the driver got out of the car to look at the victim, and then left.
An hour later, when no one seems to have known of the bleeding man, he was robbed by a garnage.
About 90 minutes after the crash, police arrived at the scene and the victim was taken to a hospital where he died of injuries.
Inga Kolegova, the head of the State Environmental Service, has saved the government from falling, according to the Associate Professor Ojārs Skudra of the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Latvia.
Colegova's explanation of the withdrawal of the candidacy in connection with the contradictions in the ruling coalition is due to the fact that she prevented the fall of the government.
In a conversation with the agency LETA expressed that it was difficult for him to imagine that next week at the government meeting "Unity" would support the candidacy of Kolegova.
Consequently, if the Ministers of Unity voted against, but Colegovu would still be confirmed in office, this would lead to the demise of the government.
The expert also believes that prior to the announcement of the withdrawal of the candidacy, Kolegova has consulted both the Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola and the Prime Minister Māris Kučinskis.
At the same time, it is also said to yield to "Unity", which strongly opposed her candidacy.
Projecting whether a suitable candidate could be found through a competition, Skudra acknowledged that there are two options: either a compromise figure will be selected or the institution will continue to be run as acting Director-General by Dace Grey.
At the same time, he points out that if the Minister of Finance has so far claimed that no other candidacy is being considered, it is a hint to Grey that he should not participate in the competition.
LETA has already announced that the head of the State Environmental Service Kolegova has decided to withdraw his candidacy for the post of SRS general manager.
Due to the "Unity" objections, the government suspended the approval of Colegowa as Director-General of the SRS on Tuesday for a week.
Following the government's decision to postpone the decision, Colegowa testified that she was still ready to become the head of the SRS.
Later, however, she changed her mind - in her application to the Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola on Friday, she points out that she withdraws her consent to transfer to the post of SRS manager and this is not an easy choice for her.
The press secretary of Prime Minister Mārs Kučinskis Andrejs Vaivars explained to LETA that a new competition will be organised for the vacant post of SRS Director General.
There was an accident in the centre of Riga involving a police car.
In the centre of Riga this afternoon there has been a road accident involving the State Police car.
The police car with turned on sound and light signals has rushed to the highest category call until Krišjāņa Barona and Dzirnavu street intersection collided with another car.
Police explain the circumstances of the incident, but preliminary information suggests that the other vehicle has not missed a police car.
A woman has suffered an accident.
This year, the population in Riga has decreased
At the beginning of this year there were 638,784 inhabitants in Riga, which is 0.34% less than in 2015, when 641,000 inhabitants were officially registered in the capital, agency LETA was informed by the Central Statistical Bureau (CSP).
In terms of population, the capital of Latvia ranks 30th among the capitals of the European Union (EU) and the large cities with a population of over one million.
According to the data of the EU Statistical Office "Eurostat", Riga has the highest proportion of women - the capital of Latvia is convincingly in the first place among Europe's largest cities with 127 women per 100 men.
All three Baltic capitals have the highest proportion of women in Europe's largest cities: 123 in Vilnius, and 121 in Tallinn per 100 men.
Warning pictograms will be placed at the LNMM.
In the next few days, warning signs - pictograms will be placed at the Latvian National Museum of Art (LNMM), the representative of the Property Department of Riga City Council Baiba Gailīte told LETA.
At the moment, the repair of the damage to the museum's glazed atrium, which had resulted from the operation of skateboarders, has been successfully completed.
In the next few days, warning pictograms will be placed at it.
Its residents will be told that the surface tends to be slippery during rain and snow, not to be driven by cars, as well as to ride bicycles, roller skates, and skateboards.
Ushakov also wrote about this on Facebook, who pointed out that no safety hazards were caused by the damage, but that "it looks unaccurate", and skateboarders "will have to be driven".
Festivals for children and parents - new children's playgrounds have been set up in Riga.
During this summer season, Riga Municipality has installed two new playgrounds in the city, Ķīpsala and Čiekurkalns, which are already available for children.
Ķīpsala beach features a wide, multifunctional playship with various climbing elements, bridges, games, pipes and slides.
The playground is designed for children of all ages.
There are also swings and different balancing elements installed in the area.
Fantasy world for small sailors is amplified by the location of the attraction on the bank of the Daugava with a view to the passenger port and the cruise ships seen there.
The playground between the 4th and 5th line of Čiekurkalns features a playhouse, a trampoline, a step track, a balance bridge, swings, toy balls and other game elements, as well as a gymnastics area with rings for strength and coordination training, co-execution and other sports elements.
Under the field is covered with rubber covering in various colors.
A new, colorful pavement is enclosed from the street side to the playground.
The reconstructed road section has been discovered in honey.
Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis, management of SJSC Latvian State Roads (LVC), as well as representatives of construction workers SIA "Binders" and local governments today opened the reconstructed Russian border of the main state road (Grebneva) - Rezekne-Daugavpils-Lithuanian border (Medumi) (A13) from Medumi to the Lithuanian border (156.4-163.05 km).
Roads are the business card of the country, especially the border roads, so the special satisfaction is to discover a reconstructed section on the border with our southern neighbours.
This is another example of an improvement in the situation on the main national roads thanks to the co-financing of European Union funds.
"As forecast shows, during this planning period the funds available for roads will be absorbed already in 2018, and we have to think about how to continue to maintain the most busy roads in very good quality, and also to ensure mobility of inhabitants in all regions of Latvia without European Union funding", Uldis Augulis stressed.
The Minister of Transport also pointed out that proposals prepared by traffic experts on sustainable financing of roads in Latvia will be presented in the near future to the government.
Construction works in the section from Medumi to the Lithuanian border (156.4-163.05 km) SIA Binder started last year and this year they continued after the technological break.
The cost of reconstruction is EUR 13.5 million (including VAT), and the project was co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
"The reconstructed road section has completely restored the road structure and next year repairs will be started in the next stage from Medumi to Daugavpils itself, so the whole road from the Lithuanian border to Daugavpils will be arranged," said Janis Lange, the Chairman of the Board of the LVC.
The country's main roads are the most congested, and by 2018 we plan to get all the country's main roads in good condition.
The next task will be to maintain them in good quality, ensuring periodic maintenance and replacement of asphalt topsoil every 7-9 years.
"It will, of course, require adequate funding, and all travelers look forward to the proposals developed by the expert group to put the road financing system in order", Lange noted.
Within the project road connections and lighting are arranged in the Hunt centre.
Significant earthworks have been carried out: in four stages large-scale dehumidification and large-scale elequeum and embankment works, leveled longitudinal profile of the road, which was very uneven up to now.
Public transport stops have also been restored and a turning point for public transport has been re-built.
Previously, the road had insufficient carrying capacity and the terrain of the area was not transparent due to mountainous valleys, as well as the old road of common terrain.
In the next construction season it is planned to restore the road section from Daugavpils city border to the now reconstructed section (144.80-156.40 km).
This year, the LVC plans to perform different types of works in more than 1100 km of state roads.
Information on all planned repairs on the national road network is available on the website of the LVC www.lvcelli.lv.
"In order to achieve the desired weight loss results, the right choice of food mixes is very important", admits Lithuanian dietologist Laura Romeraite-Kuklieriene.
In addition, it is easy to do it in the summer period, when fresh fruits, berries and vegetables grow in our own gardens.
A well-considered combination of dietary products can help not only to reduce overweight, but also purposely promote various body processes.
Macaroni and vinegar are a successful combination because they provide a long-lasting satiety and help fight fat.
Studies published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition have shown that vinegar has a positive effect on blood glucose levels and helps us to feel fun.
Cayenne pepper and protein-rich food, such as poultry or protein cocktail, not only creates a sense of satiety, but also reduces the craving after large meals at the next meal.
Such a combination of foods can also increase the amount of calories burned after a meal up to 35%.
Studies have shown that cayenne pepper can help get rid of the layer of fat in the abdomen.
Eggs contain a metabolic nutrient - choline, while sweet peppers are a good source of vitamin C.
The intake of sufficient amounts of these nutrients may reduce cortisol levels and hence the accumulation of fat around the middle body.
The oatmeal of oats, with fresh berries, is another delicious and fat burning meal for breakfast, which is worth including in your menu.
Oat flakes and berries contain fiber, which, according to Canadian scientists, controls the feeling of grelin - an appetite stimulating hormone - and thus hunger.
In addition, the berries contain polyphenols, which are aids in weight reduction as well as preventing the development of fats.
Vegetables and proteins can also perform miracles in weight reduction.
This combination can create a feeling of satiety.
The vegetables contain water and fiber, so they contribute to satiety.
At the same time, proteins slow down the digestive process and provide a feeling of satiety for longer periods of time.
At lunch you can eat chicken with salads or make a protein cocktail from the finished mixture and enjoy it with your favorite vegetables.
What product combinations to avoid.
The fruits contain sugars - monosaccharides or disaccharides - compounds of one or two molecules.
On the other hand, starch found in vegetables is polysaccharide.
The fruits break down mechanically in the stomach, while chemically they do not break down until they reach the third or fourth degree of digestion in the intestine.
The starch breaks down into three different stages that start in the mouth.
Therefore, it is important not to eat sweet food immediately after a meal.
Eating sweet food immediately after a meal, it is "closed" into the stomach along with other dishes, where it is not chemically digested and begins to blow.
Do not eat bread, potatoes, peas, bananas, dates or other products containing carbohydrates with lemons, lime, oranges, grapefruit, pineapples or other acidic fruits.
The enzyme pthialin, which is found in saliva, works only in the alkaline environment.
Fruit acids not only inhibit the digestion of carbohydrates, but also contribute to their fermentation.
Do not eat eggs and meat, nuts and meat, cheese and eggs or cheese and nuts, meat and milk, eggs and milk or nuts and milk and similar combinations of protein-rich products in one meal.
Their processing requires different digestive juices, each with different strengths, characteristics and time to reach the stomach.
Watermelon, honeymelon, muscatmelon and other melons should always be eaten separately from other dishes.
Melons are not digested if they are in the stomach with other foods.
Fat in combination with protein-rich products.
Fats form a successful combination with starch, yet the same cannot be said for fats and proteins - fats inhibit protein digestion.
Proteins can be combined with a very small amount of fat.
If large amounts of protein products are consumed, avoid the consumption of fat altogether.
This also applies to freshening - it is not recommended to combine large amounts of nuts (contains proteins) with whole avocados (contains fat).
Such a combination prevents effective weight loss.
How'd you like to cook?
"Food preparation, heat treatment lead to significant loss of nutrients - about 15% to 55% of the initial nutrient composition of the products", says the nutritionist.
In most cases, nutrients are lost by cooking foods in water.
However, the nutritional value of some foods increases directly by boiling.
After cooking the vegetables, it is recommended to use the remaining liquid for making the soup - in this case you will not lose any nutrients left in the water and you will be able to eat them later.
It is recommended that vegetables are also cooked by steaming.
The heat treatment significantly increases the bioavailability of lycopene in tomatoes.
When boiling tomatoes for 30 minutes, the amount of lycopene increases by 25%.
Thermal treatment also significantly increases the bioavailability of betacarotene found in red, yellow, orange plants such as tomatoes, carrots, sweet potatoes and spinach.
The heat treatment of eggs and meat deprives the natural properties of the proteins they contain, making them easier to digest.
Similarly, the heat treatment of meat and eggs makes iron and other minerals contained in these products easier to absorb in the body.
It should also be borne in mind that freezing products can reduce the amount of vitamin C from 10% to 90%, while freezing the fibre does not affect it.
Beans in combination with tomatoes can increase iron intake in the body, which in turn provides better brain and muscle function.
Our body absorbs up to 33% less non-blood-producing iron found in plant products such as beans, leafy herbs, cereal products, than blood-producing iron found in animal products such as beef, fish and chicken.
You can greatly increase the absorption of non-blood-producing iron in the body by taking non-blood-producing iron products together with sources of vitamin C, such as oranges, tomatoes and berries.
Vitamin C helps to change the non-blood-creating iron so that it is more easily absorbed by our body.
Iron is needed for the production of hemoglobin, which provides oxygen delivery to the muscles and brain.
To get the maximum benefit from salads, add healthy fat, such as olive oil or linseed oil.
When making a salmon sandwich, add vitamin D-rich salmon or sugarless yogurt to the sardines, which is a good source of calcium.
Vitamin D increases the amount of calcium absorbed into the intestine and plays an important role in bone formation.
Oats (as well as other whole grain products) together with sources of vitamin C, such as strawberries, blackcurrants, raspberries and other fruits or berries, help to stabilize cholesterol levels as well as avoid blockage of the arteries.
Snapchat's "Anime" effect is criticized for caricaturing Asians
Spokespersons for Snapchat say this filter has been inspired by animation, but some commentators claim it is racistally insensitive.
With this lens effect, Snapchat allows 150 million users to change reality and play with their identity in a rather absurd way on a daily basis.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or an image that would fit into Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Lens are foggy, image-distorting instruments that generate more than 30 million modified selfies per day.
Any error shall quickly become apparent to the public.
Snapchat's lens effects have been criticized in the past, receiving accusations that the application promotes too blackish or light tones of facial skin as a benchmark for ideal beauty.
This week, the new lens effects were published, which allow users to form splinter eyes, splinter teeth, and round cheeks, and some critics called it a racist Asian cartoon – “yellow face”.
It was also asked whether such contradictions did not suggest that the company had greater problems with diversity.
News and public negations erupted on Wednesday when editions “The Verge” and “Motherboard” told that lens effects had been removed from the application.
The company explained that the objective of the lens was to portray images of Anime, not to cariculate people of Asian descent.
However, for those who have experienced racism, these effects resembled painful stereotypes.
Others vehemently denied the resemblance to Anime.
Korean-born American art student Grace Sparapani's Twitter recording of the images gained widespread resonance. In an e-mail, she states that lens effects are "offensive and uncomfortable to say the least".
She added that it was difficult not to notice the apparent similarity between Asian cartoons and lens effects.
This suggests that the lens effect is not simply a yellow face, but a yellow face in the sense of racism.
Snapchat is not the only company that has fallen into this cultural trap.
American culture is also involved in a never-ending struggle for diversity and inclusion, from business meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices we use on a daily basis.
And Snapchat's large youth audience, representing different races, unlike the older population, is more sensitive to such things.
If Snapchat lenses create an image that offends users, then "now such things don't go unnoticed", said 25-year-old Katie João in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhou, the product manager of the company “Medium”, deleted his Snapchat application and advised others to do the same.
In her article "Medium" and a telephone interview, she explained that she felt that problems with race were due to Snapchat's employment policies, which did not sufficiently support racial diversity.
Jou criticized the company's management, which consists mainly of white men and then concluded its article with reference to #DeleteSnapchat.
"This means that there is no racial diversity in the company, so such decisions are made. Whether some of the representatives of other races are working in the company, but they do not hold such a position as to be able to express their opinions safely and comfortably", says the Chinese American João.
Others share her view, while Snapchat has not responded to her complaint.
The company does not disclose how many employees are represented by different races, stating that it is a private company.
Snapchat refused to discuss the origins of its employees, but its spokesman revealed that the company had hired a staff specialist who would focus on also representing racial minorities that were not widely represented and would encourage incorporation into the company.
João, on the other hand, will not renew his Snapchat account, adding, "It's interesting if they really need more users like us to realize it's not right."
The Congressional Chamber states that military officials twisted reports about the Islamic State.
In a statement issued Thursday, the congressional chamber states that U.S. Central Command representatives twisted the reports, depicting the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria more optimistic than is actually the case.
Central Command intelligence analysts express general dissatisfaction with the interim report of the Task Unit set up by the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee, and the Republican Finance Subcommittee, Republican representatives, stating that their leadership controlled reports of American success in the fight against the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as Centcom, is a military base in Tampa, Florida that oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The latest news on this report states that intelligence reports, confirmed by high-ranking Centcom executives, reflect the U.S. fight against terrorism more positively than is actually the case. The facts were regularly misrepresented, depicting better achievements than other intelligence analyses suggest.
California Republican spokesman Ken Calvert says, "Centcom's actions are unacceptable - our soldiers are the ones who suffer if our policy makers receive false reports."
The management errors of Centcom can be traced back to the organization's top management.
This 10-page report details the existing problems in the Central Command's coverage and analysis of American efforts to prepare Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although it does not provide conclusive evidence that senior officials in the Obama administration had ordered the reports to be distorted, it does show that the Centcom leadership has put some pressure on analysts to portray a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL).
The report indicates that in the first half of 2015, press releases, statements and reports from Central Governance to Congress portrayed the situation in a significantly more positive light than it actually was.
For example, Centcom representatives publicly stated that the Mosul recovery operation could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul is Iraq's second largest city, still under Islamic State control.
Kansas Republican Party spokesman Mike Pompeo states in his report, "A multi-month investigation clearly confirms this."
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, key officials of the U.S. Central Administration twisted the reports, portraying the ISIS threat in Iraq weaker than they were in fact.
The Republican Party formed a task force upon learning that analysts were concerned that information about the Islamic State was being misrepresented.
As the investigation continues, the report published on Thursday will be followed by new findings in the case.
The Ministry of Defence's General Inspection conducts an investigation of Centcom's intelligence activities.
Members of the Democrat Party of the Intelligence Administration Committee released their own report on Thursday, in which they agree with some of the conclusions of the Republican Party's task force.
Democrat spokesman Adam B. Schiff states in his report, from 2014 to 2015, Centcom too limited the production of intelligence assessment reports in relation to ISIS and the Iraqi Security Forces.
Mr. Schiff explains that this process "suspended the dissemination of information", worsened analysts' work ethic, and "disseminated facts untrue."
But Schiff and members of the Democrat Party added that there was no evidence that White House had put pressure on Centcom analysts to produce reports, in line with "pre-determined or political stance".
The Daily Beast published the preliminary results of the congressional investigation on Thursday.
In August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon's Inspector General launched an investigation following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans stated that the Pentagon would not comment on the congressional report while the investigation was ongoing.
He also added that experts sometimes interpret complex data in different ways, and the Ministry of Defence and the intelligence administration are calling for a constructive dialogue on vital national security issues.
The investigation is not limited to the question of whether the American-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is successful (a statement made by more and more representatives of the Ministry of Defence).
But last year's accusations call into question whether President Obama can fully rely on reports from the Central Authority on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other hotspots.
Criticism of Islamic State reconnaissance resembles more than a decade of events when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hoker released a study claiming that the George W. Bush administration launched the Afghanistan War, thinking too little about its possible consequences.
Hoker also played an important role in the discovery of the Islamic State's intelligence issue.
Last year, official representatives reported that Hoker's team discovered that, in contrast to public reports, air raids on Islamic State oil plants had not significantly worsened the financial situation of the terrorist group as they had built temporary plants to sell oil on the black market.
The September edition of The Times reported that this discovery did not end up outside the walls of Central Governance.
General Lloyd Austin III, commander of the Centcom at the time, received sharp criticism as many law makers believed that war reports described the situation too positively.
In April, General Austin retired and was replaced by General Joseph L. Wooll.
In the U.S. duel with Great Britain in women's field hockey, wins the U.S., thus gaining already fourth consecutive victory.
A day after winning over Japan with a score of 6:1, on Thursday Katie Bama scored the first two goals for the U.S. women's field hockey team when the Americans defeated the Indian team by a score of 3:0.
Five goals in two games is a memorable achievement, but 27-year-old Bama said that she could not remember if that was what she would ever have succeeded.
She said, "I have no idea."
I am not of those people who count their goals.
But she knows that the American score at the Olympics is 4:0, which gives them a draw with Great Britain in their group, which remained undefeated on Thursday after winning over Japan with a score of 2:0.
Britain and the United States will meet Saturday to play the last match in the first round matches.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals and the game will determine only which team will take first place in the group of six teams and whose second.
The winner of the first place will avoid meeting the strong Dutch team, which is the leader of the second group, for a little longer.
In spite of the unexploded Saturday game, American women have already called for a surprise storm, four years ago taking last place among the 12 teams in London.
That team also included Bama
She grew up in Blubel, a field hockey bat she took hands for the first time at the age of 3 (her older twin sisters were already engaged in this sport in Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16 years old, becoming the team's youngest player in history.
She did not get to the 2008 Olympics because she did not enter the final.
But 2012 was unsuccessful for her and her team.
The following year Englishman Craig Parham was appointed coach of the team and everything changed for good.
Bama called it "cultural, mentality and physical change."
In London, we did not invest as much as we do now.
We have changed everything.
In Thursday's game, Bama revealed the score, scoring a goal in the first half with a back throw from a close distance.
India started the game without winning their account, but their selection was very fierce and held a minimal score of 0:1 until the end of the third period, when Bama scored a re-run goal.
She introduced the ball into the anti-infants area along the left side of the field, then noticed to get to the middle of the field and send the ball into the anti-infants goal, putting the American woman in a 2:0 lead.
In the middle of the fourth period, Melissa Gonzales scored another goal.
This was the first dry game of U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, scoring one goal in each of the first three games.
She's run into.
And so does Bama.
"We are going very well right now," said Pahams, but how exactly well, will show the game on Saturday.
The most depressing food of the depression period is the "Contentful Meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his election as president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the oval room to have a meal.
President Roosevelt tasted such fine culinary delicacies as goose liver pâté, or fuagra, and Maryland turtle soup.
But that day his meal was much more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato porridge and dessert - plum pudding.
Jane Ziegelmann says, "It's a way to show solidarity in cooking with people who were going very hard."
Her husband, Andriu Kou, adds, "It's also a message to Americans how to eat."
A couple from the Brooklyn Heights area are food historians.
Kou's last book, "Garden stew", describes Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelmann describes life through food in a rental house in the lower part of eastern Manhattan in her book, "97 Apples".
Their new joint work, "The Sacred Meal," to be published by Harper Publishing House on Tuesday, is the story of American food during the Great Depression.
Showing some solidarity in cooking, they held a meal together at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a simple lunch diner located in the Flatiron area and running from 1929, when the major depression began.
Mrs. Ziegelmane, 54, ordered a sandwich with processed cheese and chopped olives, while Mrs. Kou, 57, ordered a turkey, potato porridge and vegetable salad.
When the reporter ordered the fake bunny, the couple admitted that his choice was very appropriate for a conversation about the Great Depression-era food .
Mrs. Ziegelmane said that the fake bunny was very popular.
There was a peanut bunny, a livery, and a bean bunny.
They were prepared from the basic ingredients and other ingredients that enriched the meal.
Imagine what it's like to eat enough peanuts to be in the lunch place.
Mr. Kou was apologizing.
"Frequently it seemed that the belly was full of lead," he added.
In the pre-depression years, the American lunch table resembled the Swedish table, especially in rural areas.
The women were preparing to eat for their husbands-workers and freshly cooked cookies were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
During the First World War, it was the Americans who sent food to Europeans. "The Great Meal" describes how the Americans adapted to the circumstances when America was suddenly no longer a land of abundance.
"At the time, food became the main focus of the American people's daily attention," says Mr Kou, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write on this topic.
Just as important became the new budget diets: unknown dishes such as the fake bunny and stews became everyday, stews were "a great way of using leftovers," Ms. Ziegelmane noted, as cooks could hide the unattractive ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit.
The meat, which had been a key ingredient in American meals for years, now became an extremely rare luxury commodity.
At a time when caloric and nutritional value of food were more important than taste, new, yet unseen formations were born.
In an ancient cookbook, Mrs. Ziegelmane found a recipe for making onions filled with peanut butter.
Mr Kou adds, "It wasn't a popular lunch table addition."
Mrs Ziegelmane stresses, "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and fried onion are incompatible.
Many home food recipes adapted to difficult times.
Household economists such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Household Economics from 1923 to 1943, determined national eating habits that had not been experienced before or after the Great Depression.
By publishing articles and recipes in newspapers and magazines, they suggested that housewives become "economicists" and accept challenges such as turning a mix of pasta and carrots into a delicious meal.
"Saturate Meal" is a feast of historical treats.
Particularly interesting are the evidence of the government's attitude towards its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "let me eat cake" attitude.
Although he spoke publicly about his simple childhood and catering in Iowa, he actually ate as a fine millionaire he had become.
Mr Kou says, "He liked European cuisine, like a fish with cucumber sauce."
He ate in a nearly gilded living room wearing a lunch jacket.
He was completely detached from reality.
President Roosevelt would have made the same mistake unless his wife Eleanor had advised him to set an example with his eating habits.
The book tells us that Roosevelt hired a housemate who did not learn how to cook, so White House became a place "where not only was served one of the most untasking dishes in Washington, D.C., but also the worst cooked dishes".
As soon as the country's economy recovers, most culinary customs of the depression era disappeared.
But we continue to focus on calories and nutritional value, as well as how to apply science to cooking, added Mrs. Ziegelmane.
The couple say that when writing the book, they gained a greater understanding of Mrs. Ziegelmane's mother's eating habits, such as why she was unable to throw out food.
"She was truly afraid to throw out the food," Mr Kou said.
Mrs Ziegelmane said, "She actually ravaged people."
There was once an incident with wind cakes.
After eating in Eisenberg’s diner, a couple of writers pulled a homemade dessert from their bag: a plum pudding that President Roosevelt used to eat at lunch.
"It's plum whipped cream," Ms Ziegelmane said, adding that there was a common habit at the time of modest dishes to give a chic name.
It contains no whipped cream, only prunes, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
All impatiently dipped spoons in the brown mass on the plates.
Surprisingly, it wasn't that bad.
Mr. Kou ate a few more bites.
Sounding like an experienced "economicist", he told his wife, "A pinch would grind a hazel nut."
Gilead will be reimbursed for legal expenses in the fight with Merck for the Hepatitis C patent
The county judge has ruled that “Gilead Sciences Inc." has the right to be refunded for lawyers' services it has paid in the case on breaking the Hepatitis C patent against the pharmaceutical company “Merck & Co Inc.”
In June, Gilead was acquitted in a case of £200 million fine for breaking two of Merck's patents, which threatened it in connection with the successful Sovaldi and Harvoni tablets, when a U.S. federal judge found violations in Merk's activities, such as lying after taking an oath and other unethical activities.
In a hearing on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Bet Labson Freeman indicated that Gilead was entitled to claim compensation for legal expenses incurred by it in defending the case.
Merck attempts to gain a position in the market against Gilead, which dominates the market with a new generation of Hepatitis C drugs that are effective in 90% of cases of liver disease.
The case was started as early as 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other in an attempt to gain ownership of the newly developed active component, sofosbuvir, which is a key component of Gilead's drug.
US-backed forces claim to have taken full control of the city of Manbidge from the Islamic State.
US-backed forces have completely taken control of the city of Manbidge in the northern part of the country at the Turkish border and the last Islamic State soldiers have left the city, a spokesman for the group stated on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) are currently clearing the city of the last opposing militants who have not yet left the city.
They have freed more than 2,000 hostage-civilians who had been captured by militants, the Reuters news agency told Sharfan Darwish of the SDS's ally Manbige Military Council.
"Currently, the city is under our full control and we are conducting a search for militants", he informed Reuters agency.
Clinton income reached $10.75 million in 2015 and the couple paid a 34.2 percent federal tax rate.
Hillary Clinton released the 2015 tax return on Friday, which shows that the Democratic Party presidential candidate and her husband have earned $10.75 million this year and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent, respectively.
During 2015, Clinton has donated $1 million, mainly to his Clinton charity. Former President Bill Clinton has earned about $5.3 million, performing as Speaker and former Secretary of State has earned $3 million in revenue from his book on his work in the State Department, published in collaboration with Simon & Schuster.
Clinton's election ally - U.S. Virginia State Senator Tim Kane and his wife Anna Holton have made public their tax return for the past 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a federal tax rate of 20.3 percent.
"Hilary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set new standards for financial transparency", Clinton's campaign partner Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
Donald Trump, on the other hand, hides behind various pretexts and reservations so that he does not have to comply with promises to disclose his tax information.
Disclosure of paid tax information is a record practice for U.S. presidential candidates, but is not required by law.
New York businessman Trump and his attorneys cite the State Revenue Service audit as a reason not to disclose tax information.
"Your move", on your Twitter record, the tax details of the Democrat Party's candidate were told by Clinton's campaign partner Ian Sam.
On Thursday, Trump's special adviser, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release tax information before audits were completed.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican Party presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republicans, argue that his refusal raises questions about his true estate size, donations amounts, and other commitments of his business, including his commitment to Russia.
Clinton poured oil into the fire by making a video public on Friday, where several influential Republicans are demanding Trump make public his tax information.
She returned to the issue once again during an economic speech on Thursday in Michigan.
She stated to the crowd, "He refuses to do what the other presidential candidates have been doing for decades."
Politico says that Trump has paid very little or no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and on Friday, the author of the New York Times business column said that many accountants and lawyers believe that nothing has changed.
Federal tax rates are a fundamental issue in this presidential election.
Clinton, in support of billionaire Varen Baffett's proposal, promotes the idea that anyone earning more than $1 million a year must pay a tax of at least 30%.
This proposal is also supported by President Barack Obama.
Last week during Clinton's performance in Omaha, Nebraska, where his "Berkshire Hathaway" conglomerate is also located, Baffett invited Trump to exchange tax returns.
Baffett said that he too is being audited by the Revenue Service and Trump fears voters rather than the tax authority.
The Clinton campaign has released tax information up until 2007.
The Clintons now live in Chappakwa, New York and have paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent and an overall tax rate of about 40.5 percent between 2007 and 2014.
The Clintons' 2015 tax review shows that unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income is a salary.
Their main investment was the low-cost index fund, from which the Clintons have received $109,000 in dividends.

Jewish film director criticises hotel in Berlin for turning off Israeli long-distance code at request of an Arab - RT News
The director of French films of Jewish origin raised a storm on social media, when he discovered that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not have an Israeli long-range conversation code.
Claude Lancman, director of the documentary about the Holocaust Shoah, did not hide his dissatisfaction with the Berlin Kempinski Bristol hotel and addressed an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his recent visit, Lancman attempted to find the Israeli long-distance code on the hotel's proposed list.
However, this country was not included in the list of countries you can call directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible that in 2016, in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel has been wiped out and destroyed?
Written by Lancman.
Instead, the Kempinski Bristol Hotel offers to call this country through its call centre.
The director requested an explanation from the hotel staff.
Lancman writes that the response he received "has shocked him."
The hotel administrator explained that "it was a deliberate decision by the hotel management".
The reason for the code's removal further outraged the film director.
"Most of the guests are Arabs and they demanded the deletion of the Israeli code," Lancman quotes the hotel employee's explanation.
Suddeutsche Zeitung states that the Israeli ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, had called the case "a great shame".
We are surprised and shocked by this incident.
It is a great shame in itself.
And the fact that this has happened in Germany is even more humiliation in this hotel network.
No explanation required.
The official stated, "We hope the hotel will make the right conclusions".
The event also gained quite widespread resonance on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.
Others believe that Kempinski's hotel was simply natural for Arab customers.
Another recording heralded "shame", stating that the hotel is located on Kurfurstendamm Street next to the synagogue.
Edition Der Spiegel states that the hotel itself has quickly rejected all accusations, stating that it is all "understanding" and has apologised to Lancman.
"We have not received a direct order to remove Israel from the list of national numbers," Suddeutsche Zeitung quotes a representative from Kempinski.
And adds that the code was added to the list again.
Police are using rubber bullets and tear gas against protesting Brazilian students.
The student and police clash occurred on Thursday in the city of São Paulo, Brazil, where students gathered in a demonstration against government education system reforms.
Police used rubber bullets and tear gas against students.
Problems began when law enforcement officers attempted to drive out students, resulting in police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students attended the demonstration to show their dislike for education system reforms.
São Paulo Governor Geraldo Alckmin's proposal foresees the closure of nearly 100 public schools, while 300,000 students will be relocated to other schools with the intention of saving money.
Some demonstrators drew graffiti on the walls with messages against interim president Michael Temer.
This protest came just days after the previous protest, when students gathered in demonstrations with the aim of expressing their support for the suspended president, Dilma Rousef, whose impeachment was voted by the Senate.
Scott Kelum Skinner finishes first, bringing Britain a gold medal in cycling
Kelum Skinner of Scotland finished first in the men's cycling team sprint race at the Rio velodrome, which took place last night. The British team secured its title of champions, which it won at the 2012 London Games.
The 23-year-old athlete from Glasgow played an important role in this race, making the legendary Scottish Sir Chris Hoy proud and bringing the victory to the favourites for New Zealand.
Four years ago, Britain won an amazing victory when Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they also repeated it at the World Championships in London, although Hoy had already finished his career as an athlete.
Problems were in the stage between the Beijing and London Olympics, as the experienced starting specialist Jamie Staff had to be replaced.
They succeeded at the last minute.
When Hoy left, Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill his place.
The British coaches put their hopes on Skinner, seeing the potential in him, which he later also proved.
Hindes, Kenny - champions who started four years ago with Hoy and Skinner, who set an Olympic qualification record, but the race's better start was for the New Zealand team
However, the British trio won gold medals.
Hinds were in tight drives after their lap, Kenny took the lead and Skinner secured that lead.
The change of strategy played an important role in the win as the Hindes drove with more gear to allow Kenny and Skinner in particular to drive faster.
Hoy watched the race as a representative of the BBC and caught the eyes of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes at the moment they climbed on the podium.
The 23-year-old Glasgow said, "It was an unspeakable honour."
I do everything to defend my name.
In the final we set the Olympic record and defeated the World Champions.
It was just incredible.
There's no better win.
After winning with Kenny and Hoy at the 2012 Olympics in London, Hindes confessed that he deliberately fell on the track after failing to start.
He later refuted this comment and British competitors were unable to prove otherwise.
There were no such incidents this time.
Hinds said, "British flags recalled London in the stands."
Over the last 3 months, we have become a cohesive team.
We have lost so many World Championships, so the victory at the Olympics was really special.
One medal in races for the country that won seven of the ten gold medals in cycling in Beijing and London.
If this achievement is an indicator of team progress over the last five months, then the next five days will be very exciting.
Given Kenny's result, he could really repeat Hoy's success by winning three Olympic gold medals.
For Kenya, this would mean six gold and one silver medal. In addition, Kenny was born on 23 March (it appears to be the British holy date, as Steve Regreiv, Mo Farah and Roger Banister were born on that day).
Hoy was also born on that date.
Kenya's next race is a sprint who starts today and will continue for the next three days.
The 28-year-old athlete from Bolton said, "At the moment, I just enjoy it all.
Team trip is always the best.
Because then you can win with your teammates.
To be honest, winning one is a little lonely."
Hindes said, "If he won two more gold medals, he should be appointed as a knight."
That day, it was the only fight for medals, but it wasn't the only good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggin, Ed Clancy, Steve Bourke, and Ovein Doul showed the fastest qualifying time in a four-kilometre inning.
Their time was 3:51.943
The world record that was set in London in 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and final will take place today in the second half of the day, where Wiggin will certainly be the focus.
He had disagreements with the commissar yesterday before his qualifying drive, when the judges summoned him to measure his stature.
On a women's ride that will continue and conclude today, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsel Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavia set a new record time of 4:13.260.
The British delegation hopes that the British cycling team will win medals in the mid- Olympics, hoping.
Remembering the outstanding and unprecedented performance in Beijing and London, everyone expects the same achievements in Rio as well.
Meanwhile, behind the scenes have gone variously, after allegations of sexism and disrespect, technical director Shane Saton resigned, and Hoy and Victoria Bendleton also end their careers.
At the beginning of the first bicycle race, however, it seems that Britain as always will reach its highest level at the right time.
The future of the Portland smelter becomes uncertain as an ambitious contract is terminated.
The future of aluminium smelters and hundreds of its employees in Portland, Victoria has become unclear as its main client energy company has announced the termination of cooperation.
This announcement is based on the Victorian government's plans to stop subsidising the energy company, which is vital for the company to continue its work.
The 20-year subsidy will be discontinued in November.
As a result, more than 2000 of Alcoa's Portland factory jobs are at risk.
Up to 2,000 direct and indirect jobs could be at risk.
In addition, it will also have unpredictable side effects, as the smelter consumes about 10 percent of the entire Victorian electricity supply.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, which led to the Angleseas power plant's outage.
The Alcoa Portland smelter works at a loss and may be closed.
These events were caused by several years of speculation about the rise in the value of the Australian dollar and the cost of factory production.
The plant's energy supplier, AGL, which supplies energy from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latroubes Valley, says that the other three owners are likely to terminate their contracts as well.
The majority of the power plant is owned by the Alcoa and Alumia joint venture, in addition to the company’s shares are owned by the China CITIC and Japan’s Marubeni Corp holding companies.
AGL hopes to continue the operation of the Portland plant, which would mean further supplies of energy to the smelter," its spokesman said.
AGL announced that the contracts were so-called "risk-limiting agreements", which are expected to enter into force as of November 2016.
The contracts have a period of validity of 12 months and will therefore remain in force until 2017.
AGL plans to receive revenue from these contracts also in fiscal year 2017," said a spokesman for the company.
As of fiscal year 2018, the potential impact on profits is limited by favourable market forecasts for future wholesale electricity prices.
AGL claims that it has already estimated a loss of $187 million in its forecasts, with these contracts expected to be terminated.
Alcoa states that the decision to terminate the contracts will not affect Alcoa’s ability to continue operating the smelter or supply it with energy.
The U.S. company says that in 2010 it concluded a contract with Loy Yang for 20 years, but in November it will be discontinued. The company does not provide any explanation why it will cease cooperation.
Analysts have expressed concerns about both the possible closure of the Portland Ceasehouse in Victoria and the closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle, due to the industry's weak economy.
AGL CEO Stephen Mickelson said last week that according to analysts' estimates, Portland uses 600 megawatts and Tomago 900 megawatts of energy during the year.
If these two plants left the energy market, energy demand would decrease significantly.
And that wouldn't be good at all.
The Community Legal Centre rejects 160 000 people every year.
The demands of more than 160 000 people are rejected each year, and the situation is likely to deteriorate as the budget falls.
Three out of five people in Queensland - mostly pensioners, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the means to fight illegal eviction - are refused free legal aid and representation.
The Community legal centre, which is already overburdened, warns that the situation will only get worse as funding cuts.
As of June next year, these legal centres will receive 30% less funding than before.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Legal Center, said that the latest report by the National Association of Legal Centers states that legal aid is currently being refused to thousands of people in need.
Mr. Farrell pointed out that if this decision was not overturned, the situation would only get worse.
He also says, "The Queensland Legal Center is constantly underfunded, meaning that aid is refused to thousands of people in need of it."
People trying to end violent relations, people in deep debt, families experiencing divorce, workers who are unfairly fired - all of these people have legal problems and this report shows that they are not getting the help they need.
As of June 2017, the federal government will cut funding by 30 percent, meaning that several thousand more people in Queensland will have to deal with their complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Attorney General and Queensland Senator George Brandis to stop funding cuts immediately so that people in need of legal aid can get it.
Last year, the government unveiled its plans to bring the level of legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to pay attention also to the needs of local communities and their clients and to invest in this important area by the Palaphuk government.
Donald Trump's campaign sued as a member of the staff pulled out a firearm
New York: Donald Trump's campaign organizers sued because they did not act upon receiving information that its North Carolina operations manager turned a firearm against an employee when they were driving in the same car in February.
The incident was described in a court claim filed in Charlotte Court on Wednesday by Vincent Bordini, a former campaign programmer.
Bordini said that he had waited for months for an internal review of the case to begin, but realized that this would not happen.
Manager Earl Phillip "worn out the gun, put his right index finger on the cock and turned the barrel against Vincent's knee", Bordini claims in his complaint.
He also claims that by lodging complaints with local and regional campaign management, Bordini learned that at least four more people had experienced the same.
"The weapons don't have to be fired to cause damage", says Bordin in his complaint.
Just two days before this case was filed, a Republican party candidate for the presidential office caused a scandal, telling people that the "People of the Second Amendment", i.e. gun owners and enthusiasts, could act in case his rival Hillary Clinton and his elected judges would win the election.
Trump's campaigners stated that the media had pulled his words out of context, and he had never instigated violence on anyone.
Bordini, with his claim, wants to recover compensation from campaign organizers for negligent surveillance, and from Phillips for assault, illegal use of a weapon, and the creation of emotional stress.
Trump's spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, did not comment immediately.
It's not been possible to get in touch with Phillips.
WCCB - Charlotte local news agency says Philip has recently left the campaign.
Neither has it been possible to call his consulting firm "Innovative Advisory Services".
Republican Party presidential candidate Donald Trump has pursued a controversial election campaign.

A new tradition - a parish and sports festival in Ķūļciems.
On Saturday, for the first time in Ķūļciems people gathered for parish and sports celebrations.
After ten years of celebration, it was decided this time that there would be no more Lake Festival.
A new page has now been turned.
The day began with a sports competition.
This time, the race was not in traditional ways and too serious, because, for example, darts had to be thrown into a sleeping target, the boot flew, with the man's left hand cast, "balling" hadn't been at all at any Olympics.
However, each participant could show how strong, brave, agile and resourceful he is.
After the sports games, everyone gathered in an open-air stage where the parish festival began.
In the meantime, there was also a "children's corner" where the little ones could break out in the inflatable attractions and get a new image in a face-to-face makeup.
A novelty that could also become a tradition was a vehicle parade in which both tractors and motorcycles went.
All were addressed by Inga Kadiķe-Skadiņa, the head of Ķūļciems Parish Administration, who wished a nice rest and a dry time, but it did not disturb much.
The festival continued with the greeting of the youngest inhabitants of Ķūļciems.
It's really good that the parish has topped up with five girls and one guy.
With performances, amateur art collectives from Engure region had come to the villagers – the audience was very fond of the performances of the senior dance group "Audens rhythms", dance performers of different nations "Redas" and youth dancers "Golden Pearls".
And it's okay that someone also happened to slip on the wet stage.
Of course, the famous actor duo Jānis Jarāns and Dainis Porgants, who were once again Mildiņa Nabiņa and Skaidrīte Krāniņa, as well as the attractive wives of Berzciems from the fishermen's farm "Dieniņas", were pleased to the local people and visitors.
Balli was played by the band Bruģis.
Britain must maintain the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow.
Heathrow will not only contribute to prosperity and growth in local regions and London, but also throughout the country.
This, in my opinion, makes Heathrow very attractive, as was the case in London in 2012, where we made a huge effort to make all the regions of the country benefit from the Olympic Games.
Stratford and Eastend got an enormous amount of the Olympics.
And we will do it again by providing local people and businesses with business opportunities near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we will create 10 000 new business opportunities, 40 000 new jobs and finally put an end to youth unemployment around Heathrow.
Like the London Olympic Games in 2012, there will be people this time who believe that this challenge is too great and that the expansion of Heathrow is too ambitious.
People then said that Britain would never manage to prepare for the Olympic Games in time and that it would be a global failure.
The skeptics were wrong about 2012 and they will not be right in Heathrow either.
There are always obstacles to be overcome, but Heathrow has overcome everything so far.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that will benefit the whole of society and not individual individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs, economic growth of 211 billion, creating the ground for both employment and experience at this airport and throughout Britain.
Heathrow has a great team that has created an 11 billion-pound infrastructure investment programme, within the timeframe and budget, starting with Terminal 5, which has been named the best airport terminal in the world for five years and ending with Terminal 2, which has been built between the two most intensive runways in the world.
They are now ready to set up a third runway, which will be financed by private investment of £16 billion.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success, and I am sure that it will also be the expansion of Heathrow.
It is time to revive the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, ensuring the future of our trade and creating a new employment environment that Britain could be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton is a member of the Heathrow Board and former Secretary of Commerce for the Ministry of Economic Affairs.
In Switzerland, a woman runs up on the highway while attempting suicide.
The victim lay down on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are trying to find witnesses to the accident when several cars passed over her early Thursday morning on the highway.
The accident occurred on Thursday shortly after midnight on the A1 road near the town of Morge in the Canton of Vo.
A report by Vo Canton police says that desperately wanting to commit suicide, the woman had been lapped on the road in the dark, where she was driven by several cars.
In a clear attempt to kill himself, the victim, a 49-year-old Swiss man, drove several cars, including a heavy car.
She died at the scene.
Several drivers involved in the accident have already given evidence, but others involved have not yet been cleared, police say, who are calling for references to the drivers involved and witnesses to the accident.
A criminal investigation has also been launched in the case, which in such a case is a logical step, was subpoenaed to Le Tribune de Geneve by lawyer Gilles Hofsteller.
However, it is not yet known if any of the drivers involved will be punished.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
Hofsteller adds, "This will be clarified by the prosecutor."
Two similar cases that have occurred over the past 5 years indicate that none of the drivers will be prosecuted.
In both cases, the pedestrian had walked out on the highway in the middle of the night, so it was decided that drivers could not predict that a pedestrian would be on the highway in the middle of the night, according to a newspaper.
Last year, a policewoman was acquitted of being killed behind carelessness when she sailed a man who slept on the A1 road near Payjerne in the middle of the night in August 2014.
The court found out that the 22 - year - old victim had been drinking and later noticed falling asleep on the road.
The court concluded that a policewoman en route to the scene of the accident drove in a manner appropriate to the circumstances and the judge admitted that the sleeping man on the road was a "totally unpredictable and exceptional case".
Anyone who has information about an accident near Morge on Thursday is invited to contact the police by phone 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
On the Internet, signatures are collected for a new SRS manager to organise a competition.
The petition portal "Avaaz.org" has started collecting signatures for a new State Revenue Service (SRS) head position competition.
A petition addressed to the ministers of the National Association (NA) and the Greens and Farmers' Union (ZZS) indicates that the public wants a transparent and professional process of appointing officials.
The petition was created on August 10 and is currently signed by 55 people.
The nomination process of Inga Kolegova, the SRS Director-General, is opaque and unprofessional.
This brings to mind the best traditions of functionaries of the Soviet Union.
It discredits public administration and once again disappoints society in government and politicians.
"There is a need for a competition with clear criteria against which all candidates must be evaluated", the text of the petition says.
Its author Jānis B. pointed out that the public does not know the criteria as to the choice of Kolegova for the post.
Similarly, it is not clear what the candidate's plans for work in the SRS are.
The petition indicates that the State Chancellery should create a new open competition in which professional candidates are actively addressed, staff selection specialists are attracted and appropriate remuneration offered.
Finance Minister Dana Reizniece-Ozola officially nominated Colegovu for the post of head of the SRS last week, this week the government was expected to approve him in the new position, but all the party's "Unity" ministers voted against, so the issue of the week was postponed.
Samoilov: If we lost, so I played bad.
Beach volleyball players Aleksandrs Samoilovs and Jānis Šmēdins have hoped for the award at the Rio Olympics, however, without being approached, there is no difference in where to conclude the competition, Samoilovs expressed after leaving the tournament.
One of the world's strongest pairs of beach volleyball on Thursday in the final and decisive game of the subgroup tournament with 1-2 (16:21, 22:20, 7:15) lost to Brazilians Evandra Gonsalvesh Oliveira and Pedro Solberg Salgada, concluding his participation in the four-year most important sports forum.
In three sub-group matches, Latvian athletes won one win, but the same ratio was for two more pairs.
The ratio of three pairs of small points was then counted, which, after the overwhelming loss suffered in this match, was most unfavourable to the Latvian duo.
"In the first set we were in the lead, but from 16:15 we stayed on 16 points", Šmēdiņš remembered the course of the game.
I don't even know how we stayed scoreless in the rest of the set.
You can't play like that.
Then in the second set everything was fine and at the end of the set managed to break the game, besides it should have been a good basis for the third set as well.
We started it similarly, but after we switched sides, the result grew only for one team.
We had too many mistakes in the attack.
In the subgroup, all teams were similar, with almost all matches having three sets, so small points were important.
"We should have played more like that, rather than returning 3-4 points in a row several times", said the athlete.
We knew Evandu could be maintained.
"In the first set we got through with it, in the second we let in 1-2 points, but in the third at +4 he already left the game", remembers Šmēdiņš.
We tried to show you the best game.
Sometimes it worked out, sometimes it didn't.
I didn't look at the overall situation before the match, but it was known that as many small points as possible were needed.
"If we lost, so I played bad," Samoilov said.
We expected a good serva from Evandu, and with it we managed quite well in the first sets, but in the third, the serva opened for him and it was difficult to build an attack.
I, on the other hand, made a lot of mistakes in my reception right at Pedro's serve, but I had to deal with it.
Samoilov told us that, contrary to the previous match, athletes were not nervous today.
"We went, played, also the defence was, however, needed a better reception of the service," the athlete said.
"They played well and ended up getting on 'urrah'".
Before the tournament, we immediately said that the draw was the most uncomfortable one we could have been.
We had a chance to fight for first place as well, but we didn't even get out of the band.
"All of us expected a medal and we of ourselves too, but after that there is no more difference - 25th place or fourth", said Samoilov, who predicted that the duo would continue to play together in the future as well.
I think there will be no questions and we will continue to play together, because this is just one tournament.
Samoylov had his third Olympic career in Rio de Janeiro, because in 2008 he competed with Martins Plavins in Beijing, but four years ago he played with Ruslans Sorokin in London.
Meanwhile, for Smedin, this was the second start at the Olympics.
Latvenergo follows the process of opening up the gas market also from the position of a potential trader.
The state energy company Latvenergo follows the process of opening the gas market from the position of both the consumer and a potential trader, the company's press secretary Ivita Bidere said.
"The decision on whether Latvenergo will also join the gas market in the future as a trader will be determined by what gas market model and legal framework will be established."
"For our part, therefore, we are actively involved in creating and commenting on laws and regulations, as well as submitting our proposals", Bidere said.
The BNS agency already wrote that the Ministry of Economics (EM) in cooperation with the Public Utilities Commission and the energy company "Latvijas Gāze" has developed Cabinet Regulations project "Regulations for the sale and use of natural gas", which will change the existing principles of operation of the natural gas market, providing natural gas users with the right to freely choose natural gas trader from 3 April 2017.
As part of its work on the new regulatory framework for the natural gas market, the EM aims to make the process of trading natural gas as simple and user-friendly as possible.
Therefore, the most efficient and user-friendly service solution has been chosen "the centre model of the trader", in which all activities related to customer service are provided by the trader - one contract, one invoice and one information provision and customer service place, leaving to the distribution system operator the technical issues of the natural gas distribution system.
A similar solution is currently being implemented in the electricity trade.
We would like to remind you that the gradual opening of the market is planned for household users – even after 3 April 2017, those household users who do not wish to choose another natural gas trader will be able to continue to receive natural gas from the existing trader at a regulated price, thus becoming related users.
"In such a case, the obligation to supply natural gas to related users at a regulated price is imposed on the public trader", the Ministry informed.
In turn, traders will have to choose the natural gas trader with whom to enter into a natural gas trade contract.
Until the conclusion of the natural gas trade contract, the former natural gas trader will ensure the sale of natural gas for a certain period of time to the traders at a price set by him.
The Cabinet of Ministers Regulations project details the rights and obligations of the natural gas trader, system operator and users.
The Regulations lay down the procedures for supplying and interrupting the supply of natural gas, the requirements for the safe use of the natural gas system, the rights and obligations of the trader, the public trader, the system operator, the user and the owner of the gasified object in the supply and use of natural gas; the procedures for the settlement of received services, the amount of delay interest, the procedures for switching traders and the supply of customers in the event of disruption of the natural gas supply; the procedures for the provision of natural gas to connected customers by the public trader.

Minister: next week it is planned to discuss the increase in the remuneration of the SRS general manager.
Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Green and Farmers' Union (ZZS)) is planning next week to talk with Prime Minister Māris Kučinskis (ZZS) and government coalition partners about the increase of the State Revenue Service (SRS) general director's remuneration.
On Friday, Reizniece-Ozola pointed out to journalists that the issue of increasing the SRS Director-General's remuneration should be addressed as a matter of urgency in order to make this position more attractive to potential repeat contestants.
Also next week there was talk about changing the terms of the competition.
The minister also stressed that she did not have any particular candidate in mind to address for the vacant post.
At the same time, Reizniece-Ozola expressed the opinion that Inga Kolegova, Head of the State Environmental Service, would have been a good general director of the SRS.
In relation to the current acting SRS Head Dace Pelēko, who has expressed readiness to apply for this position, the Minister reiterated his opinion that the new SRS Director General should have a "view from the sidelines" and should not come from the SRS structure.
She also stressed that she was waiting for the Saeima to return from her leave in order to direct the amendments to the laws necessary for the reorganisation of the SRS as soon as possible.
The BNS agency already announced that Inga Kolegova, Head of the State Environmental Service, submitted an application to Dana Reizniece-Ozola (ZZS), the Minister of Finance, withdrawing her application for the post of SRS Director General.
In the submission, she expressed that it was not an easy choice, but over the last two weeks, her loved ones have been under serious emotional pressure, although they have not taken any action condemned by law.
Kolegova also pointed out that discussing her candidacy has increased controversy among the parties of the ruling coalition, which is also unacceptable.
It has also been reported that Inara Peterson, the previous Director-General of the SRS, left office in late June.
Oil prices continue to rise; stock indexes in the US and Europe are rising, as well as the value of the US dollar.
Global oil prices continue to rise on Friday morning, with investor sentiment being positively influenced by statements made by the Saudi Minister of Oil Affairs, which reinforces expectations that major oil-producing nations will take action at the OPEC meeting in September to stabilise the global oil market.
The three main U.S. stock exchange indices reached a record high on Thursday, which had not been observed since 1999.
The main positive factor in the market was the rise in oil prices and the strong financial indicators of several large companies.
The rise in oil price and strong financial indicators of several companies on Thursday were also the reason for the rise in European stock exchange indices.
The value of the US dollar rose on Thursday relative to the euro, relative to the British pound and relative to the Japanese yen.
In electronic trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the price of crude oil for deliveries in September rose by $1.78 to $43.49 per barrel on Thursday.
The price of "Brent" brand crude oil for deliveries on the London Stock Exchange in October increased by $1.99 - to $46.04 per barrel.
The turnover of the canned producer "Blue Lagoon" dropped by 33.8% last year.
Last year, the canned producer "Blue Lagoon"'s turnover was 4,202 million euros, which is 33.8% less than the previous year, whereas the company's losses dropped 5.7 times - to 904,7 thousand euros, according to the annual financial report published by Lursoft.
According to the company's management report, in 2015 the company made losses due to several reasons, including a permanent lack of working capital caused by the withdrawal of Unicredit Bank from the Baltic market by terminating the previous credit line and leaving the Blue Lagoon with concluded contracts without the possibility to execute them.
Consequently, the company did not have sufficient resources to purchase cheaper raw materials in large quantities and to receive a volume discount.
The withdrawal of the respective bank from the Latvian market also prevented the company from implementing European Union structural funds support projects, which would have allowed the plant to purchase new production equipment and modernize the infrastructure.
Similarly, the financial indicators of the company in the last year were negatively affected by the rise in raw material prices and the unwillingness of customers to pay more for the goods produced by the company.
"Only in the second half of July 2016 customers acknowledged price changes and were ready to buy goods for the new - the highest - prices", according to the company's management.
In 2015, Blue Lagoon began discussions with potential investors, including evaluation of the company's movable and real estate.
Investors have already been with the company's largest creditor "Unicredit Leasing", where the parties have met and discussed possible investment plans.
At the same time, the company's activities and development were positively influenced by the implementation of the restructuring and optimisation plan started in 2014 and 2015.
This plan included improving and optimising technological processes, which allows to achieve greater production productivity and capacity.
"A number of equipment was purchased, which ensures a higher production speed", said the company's management.
The management of "Blue Lagoon" notes that the equipment purchased in 2016 will allow the company's manufacturing plant to fulfil such orders that were not possible until now.
The first batch of products to be produced on this equipment will be ready in August.
Since protocols of intent for the sale of the product have already been signed, all production will be sold in accordance with protocols of intent.
The new product will increase turnover by about 300 thousand euros a month", said the company's management.
The company also plans to sign a cooperation agreement on fish products deliveries to Iraq in August 2016.
Blue Lagoon has sent the first experimental container to Israel in 2016, expanded the market to Cyprus and this September will sign a cooperation agreement with a new supermarket chain in the USA.
As a result of all the above measures, the company plans to increase its turnover.
In 2014 "Blue Lagoon" worked with 6,347 million euros turnover and 5,113 million euros loss.
The Blue Lagoon was founded in 1997 and has a share capital of 1.156 million euros.
The company is owned by two Latvian individuals – Mikhail Kaidanov (89.11%) and Igor Shiršon (10.89%).
Welcome pl. 15 to the museum to welcome the cinema diva Zara Leander and participate in a press conference.
Riga can be seen as the beginning of the career and the city of inspiration of the goddess cinema dwarf Zara Leander.
Saar Lendere's visit to the godmother Ruth, who was the Swedish ambassador to Latvia, turned fatal in 1924 in Riga, because it was she who discovered to the woman of Saar Leander the unusual low contralt, which she tried to debut on the stage of the Riga cabaret theatre.
Maybe it was by chance in Riga that it became the fateful turn of Zara's creative path towards the world's fame.
Riga associated Zara Leander with warm memories, and she hoped to come to Riga in guest performances, but unfortunately these hopes were not destined to come true as World War II began.
Using the form of the performance, this meeting will be possible at Riga festival 2016 and the outstanding Zara Leander will be played by the great Ieva Kerēvica.
There are extensive traffic restrictions in the Aglona area.
In order to ensure the safety of the participants of the Blessed Virgin Mary's Celebration of Heaven, starting from 12 August at 17.00 to 15 August at 18.00 the transit traffic of trucks on several state roads around Aglona will be closed, the State Roads of VAS Latvia informed.
Participants in the Aglona festival and public transport will not be subject to these restrictions.
It should be noted that in the section of the road P62 Kraslava-Preiļi-Madona from Kraslava to Kraslava station (0.80.-4.00 km) construction works are taking place and only public transport and pedestrians will be able to cross the construction object at Aglona festival.
For other road users traffic will be provided via a bypass road - a scheme in the attached file.
Traditionally, a large number of participants arrive for this festival, including pilgrims.
Motorists should therefore be particularly careful, as there will be intensive pedestrian movements on the various road routes towards Aglona.
Drivers are encouraged to be aware of the traffic restrictions introduced, to follow traffic organisation procedures, and to take into account the possibility of longer travel times.
The water temperature in all water bodies has fallen below +20 degrees.
With the cool weather, the water temperature continues to drop, and currently in all rivers and lakes, as well as in the sea, it is below +20 degrees, according to data of the Latvian Centre for Environment, Geology and Meteorology.

Kurdish activists occupy the building of a German public broadcaster.
A group of 30 Kurdish people captured the public broadcaster's WDR building in Düsseldorf on Thursday night, where they held a nearly two-hour protest campaign, according to German police.
The demonstrators, who came with posters, chanted different slogans, trying to draw attention to the current situation in Turkey.
Officials say the demonstration was generally peaceful and protesters left the building eventually voluntarily at the request of employees.
The insurer pays compensation to the passengers of the airline flight cancelled at the airport on Wednesday.
If Insurance paid travel insurance to a family for a flight cancelled at Riga Airport on Wednesday, 10 August, due to which it was necessary to refuse to visit the intended music festival.
On August 11, If Insurance received a claim for compensation from a client.
The family had planned to go to the music festival in Belgium, but because this was not possible due to the cancellation of air flights at the airport on Wednesday, the compensation for accommodation booking was calculated for the client, which could not be cancelled anymore, as well as for the purchase of the festival tickets of 204 euros.
On the other hand, the airline has promised to reimburse its customers the money spent on the plane's tickets.
If Insurance from all travel insurance benefits has, on average, paid compensation in 15% of cases for the suspension or cancellation of the trip.
"On such occasions, expenses are reimbursed for purchase, return or exchange of tickets, as well as for booking of accommodation", says Dagnija Rutka, the insurance product manager of Insurance Persons' Risks.
As we know, on the evening of 10 August a private aircraft stopped on the runway of Riga Airport due to technical problems, therefore several departing flights were cancelled, while several incoming flights had to be diverted to other airports.
Due to the repair of the neighbor, the man is forced to leave his home at a shattered ceiling.
The LTV program "4th Studio" was approached by Dmitry Saidyashev, whose neighbor has started overhauling his apartment, and since then Dmitry has been wearing plaster from the ceiling and is not convinced that staying in the apartment is safe.
The problem is that my neighbors carried out arbitrary construction and there is a damaged ceiling in my apartment.
Then I informed the Riga Construction Board, the house manager and other organizations.
The Construction Board said that we are no operational service and we do not have any expert.
"The owner of the apartment must go to the Latvian Engineering Union, and there will be an expert from there", says Dmitry.
The invited expert arrived, recorded what had happened and admitted that the division was in unsatisfactory condition.
However, a month has passed since Dmitry’s first application to the building board, and by the beginning of this week no one was able to answer whether the location in the apartment was life-threatening.
The Construction Board said that this is the legislation, wait, if you are not satisfied, write to everyone in turn.
"Then I wrote to the Riga City Council, but they sent the house to the manager, then the house manager to the building board again, and then there is a dead end", says Dmitry.
After examining the whole stack of papers, it is clear that the work has been stopped, even though one can hear from time to time that someone is working there.
Within a further period of two months, the expert must carry out an inspection and within a period of six months the owner of the apartment carrying out repairs must remedy all these defects.
The independent expert has drawn up his opinion, but it is considered incomplete and superficial by the construction board.
The expert has not indicated whether the metal lattice present in this load-bearing structure is affected, so it is not certain that the owner of the lower apartment is being put at risk.
"This is why we have requested additional explanation from this expert", says Ilze Žūka, representative of Riga City Construction Board.
Despite the ban on any repairs in the upper apartment, it is still heard from there that construction is continuing.
The penalty for arbitrary construction without construction permit is between 70 and 700 euros, but in a particular case the penalty can be much more severe.
While awaiting the expert's opinion, the Construction Board decided that both apartments should not be used, both in which the construction works are carried out and in which Dmitry's apartment is located.
"This is an unprecedented case in the practice of the construction board, where, due to its ignorance or simply unwillingness, the residents may have created a threat not only to their property, but also to the owner of the lower property, as a result of which this owner cannot exploit his property", says a representative of the construction board.
Now Dmitry has to look for another place to live - to relatives, friends, in a hotel or to rent another apartment.
But Dmitry may try to recover the damage from his neighbor on a civil basis, which may take a lot of time.
Due to the arbitrary construction, it is currently prohibited to stay in both apartments until the construction engineer gives his opinion, and it may have to wait for up to three weeks.
The owner of the apartment in which the repairs have taken place will have to bear the resulting losses.
The owner of this apartment, because the building board has not taken into account, also faces a prison sentence of up to six months.
Guess what!
How many lionesses in this picture?
The right answer is five.
In Ukraine, five white lionesses were born at the Demidov Zoo near Kiev.
Everyone feels good and sometimes snuffs up the common, despite the fact that the commoner feeds the young.
Conversion of the former Kemeri sanatorium into a five-star hotel will cost 22 million euros.
Conversion of the former Kemeri sanatorium into a five-star hotel "Park Hotel Ķemeri" will cost 22 million euros, Gita Želve, representative of the future hotel manager SIA "Park Hotel Ķemeri", tells LETA.
The creation of the hotel is the first stage of restoration of Ķemeri's former sanatorium.
The second stage will be "wellness" or wellness clinic, which is planned to open in 2022, while the opening of the hotel is scheduled for May 2018.
Želve notes that the exact cost of the clinic is not yet known.
However, she points out that it will be located in the building of the former Ķemeri resort polyclinic, which has an area of approximately 12,000 square meters.
The clinic will be housed on three floors.
The owner of Park Hotel Ķemeri and the planned clinic is the international foundation G Capital Europe, which invests in European assets.
The owners of G Capital Europe are a number of investors who invest in this fund, says Želve.
As G Capital Europe CEO George Jones said earlier, it is planned to invest between €12 and €15 million in the creation of the former resort polyclinic, totalling over €30 million.
It has already been reported that in the restoration of the cultural-historical park in the area of more than 42 hectares, renovation of access roads and street sections, construction of an interactive nature tourism object, improvement of the territory and construction of a parking lot on Emīla Dārziņa Street, which will contribute to the socio-economic development of Jurmala city and increase the number of tourists, Jūrmala City Council plans to raise EUR 14.5 million from European Union funds, co-financing with three to four million euros.
By the middle of 2017, the design works are planned, but the construction and improvement works will begin in the autumn of next year.
As reported earlier, in the historical sanatorium complex "Kemeri" it is planned to create a five-star hotel "Park Hotel Ķemeri" and a "wellness" or wellness clinic.
However, reconstruction lasted.
In its turn, the 2010 annual report also stated that Ominasis regularly communicated with the hotel operator Kempinski, which continues to provide daily technical control at the sanatorium Ķemeri, and that already in 2011 "the reconstruction of the future Ķemeri hotel" would be completed and preparations for the opening of the Kempinski chain hotel would begin immediately.
In October 2014, "Park Hotel Ķemeri" confirmed its readiness to buy the package of property belonging to the insolvent "Ominasis Latvia" at the auction, but a month later the auction was considered to have failed because the winner had not paid for the purchase within the specified time.
The sales price was determined according to the starting price of EUR 2.86 million for the last auction which had not taken place.
As the agency LETA was informed by the representative of the city council Ieva Aile, the municipality, when signing the protocol, has confirmed that with the support of the European Union Structural Funds, the adjacent infrastructure will be arranged - it will restore the historical Ķemeri park, create an interactive nature tourism object, arrange roads and parking lots.
The President will deliver the Order of the Three Stars to opera singer Antonenko.
The President of Latvia Raimonds Vējonis will present the Class III opera singer Alexander Antonenko of the Order of the Three Stars next week, August 16, according to the President's agenda.
The ceremony of the Order of the Three Stars will take place in the House of Blackheads at 13 p.m.

He studied at the Vocal Department of Jāzeps Vītols Latvian Academy of Music in the class Arvids Luste.
In 1997 he started singing in the choir of the Latvian National Opera, but in 1998 he made his debut with the role of Oberto in the G.F.Hendel opera "Alčīna".
He received the "Great Music Award 2003" for his vocal performance in opera performances and Verdi Requiem.
It is noted that during the 2004/2005 season it has become the most internationally recognized tenor of Latvia, which is organized by the largest theatre in the world.
Since autumn 2004, he has been singing at the Duseldorf Deutsche Oper am Rhein, the Berlin and Graz Opera, the Dresden Semperoper, the Royal Operas of Oslo and Stockholm, the London Coventgarden Opera, the Monte Carlo Opera, the Vienna State Opera, as well as the Geneva, Dresden and Düsseldorf Opera and the Salzburg Festival.
Antonenko debuted in 2009 with great success at the Metropolitan Opera in the role of Prince in "Nar".
In 2011 Antonenko sang the title role of Othello at the Paris Opera, at the Coventgarden Opera, with Ricardo Muti and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, he sang Luigi in the new studio of Camp, and in Stockholm participated in Christoph Loy's production of Girl from the West.
A year later, Antonenko sang the role of Othello in the London Coventgarden Opera with great success.
The e-mail of former NATO commander Briedlow has been hacked by Russian hackers.
The hackers, who hacked the computers of the U.S. National Committee of Democrats (DNC), may have carried out several other cyber attacks, also hacked the email of former commander of NATO's European forces, Philip Briedlow, and the servers of George Soros Institute's Open Society, the business news agency Bloomberg, reported on Thursday.
The hackers have published the information they obtained on "DCLeaks.com".
Among other things, Briedlow's correspondence and details of the work of the Soros Institute are posted there.
For hackers, the Institute's computers have been available for a year.
According to Bloomberg, these cyber attacks were carried out by the same hackers associated with Russian special services that hacked DNC emails.
The Wall Street Journal, in turn, reports that US President Barack Obama's administration is currently examining the issue of imposing new sanctions on Russia in response to hacking DNC computers in this way.
In order to introduce sanctions, the administration will have to formally attack Democratic Party servers against Russia or hackers supported by Russian authorities.
Reportedly, the WikiLeaks website released in July about 20,000 e-mails derived from the DNC's computer system, from which it is understood that the leaders of the Democrat Party have been trying to harm the campaign of party candidate Hillary Clinton's former rival, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, in the fight for the Democratic nomination to run for the presidential election.
According to U.S. press sources, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which conducts an investigation into the hacking of Democrats servers, as well as other U.S. special services, believes Russia's connection to the cyber attack is almost unquestioned.
McCartney: Yoko Ono's presence threatened The Beatles.
Paul McCartney has admitted that the presence of Yoko Ono has created a sense of danger for the legendary band The Beatles.
The 74-year-old rock star currently maintains a "good" relationship with the widow of the late John Lennon, but at the time she went to visit the band in the recording studio, McCartney was frightened by her because Ono was the only woman among the band members - George Harrison, Ringo Starr, Lennon and McCartney.
When asked about the relationship between the two, the singer replied to Rolling Stone magazine, "They're really good."
We felt threatened at the time.
While we were recording, she sat on the amplifiers.
Most of the group could not tolerate it.
We were able to do that, but not quite successfully, because we were very tense.
We weren't sexists, but the girls didn't usually come to the recording studio, they let us work.
When John started dating Yoko, she did not sit in the control room, but in the middle of our four.
The author of the moat "Yellow Submarine" has also admitted that he is now in regular contact with former bandmate Ringo, and occasionally approves the work plans of the recording studio "Apple", but in all other ways, "The Beatles" have "died out".
When asked if he was still dating the other only member of the legendary rock band still living, McCartney told Rolling Stone magazine, "Frequently not."
We meet at social events and parties.
But I don't go to the meetings, I feel a little detached from it.
I went from Apple during a heavy divorce.
In my place, I sent John Eastman to meetings and said, "Retell to me what everyone says because I can't suffer sitting at that table".
It was too painful to see your pet die.
The company is now working in such a way that I just audition for all the records.
I am part of the approval process.
NASA climate model: Venus used to be a habitable planet
Based on NASA's latest climate models, Venus has once been a habitable planet.
Scientists at NASA's Godard Institute for Space Research have developed a model to explore the history of Venus using tools and algorithms that climate scientists also use.
The model was developed to determine whether on Venus, whose surface is hot, where there is no water and whose atmosphere consists almost exclusively of carbon, had ever been Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that the slow speed of Venus is explained by the dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulations show that there was once a thin, Earthlike atmosphere on Venus and it turned slowly.
The model also looks at Venus' earlier topography.
There were more dry areas on the planet than on Earth, but there was enough water and geographical diversity on it to allow life to form and prevent water from evaporation.
In early Venus times, the sun was 30 percent brighter.
In the GISS model simulation, the Venus spin model reveals that the daylight part lasts 2 months on it, explained GISS scientist Antony Del Genio in a press release.
This process heats the planet's surface and causes rain, which in turn forms layers of thick clouds that act as an umbrella, protecting the planet from the sun's heat.
The result is a moderate climate temperature, which is actually a few degrees lower than the temperature on Earth today.
The model represents the history of Venus, which is similar to the theory of evolution developed by scholars in their hypotheses.
Although once habitable, Venus has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation over several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated, and the spirits were burned by ultraviolet rays.
As the water was completely evaporated, only a thin atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse gas, Venus, as we know it today, remained.
Scientists published the results of the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
On Thursday, the coach of the Colorado Avalanche and vice president of hockey operations, Patrick Roy, submitted a resignation, citing, as a reason, the insufficient influence in the team's decision-making process.
Colorado's vice president and general manager Joe Sakik confirmed the message and informed the club that he would immediately start looking for a new coach.
"For the past three years, I have been energetic, enthusiastic and purposeful in my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Club," 50-year-old Roy states in his statement.
During this summer, I've thought a lot about how I could improve the team's performance to give it the required brilliance and achieve higher-level results.
In order to achieve this, the visions of the head coach and vice president of hockey operations must coincide entirely with those of the organization.
He must also be able to influence decisions relating to the team's performance.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakik, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.
Sakik said that Patrick informed him of his decision today.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization and wish him all the best in the future.
In his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014, Roy was recognized as the league's top coach and received the Jack Adams Award.
He helped the club reach 112 points and first place in the Central Division, but in the first round of the playoffs, Colorado defeated the team by Minnesota hockey players. Since then, the club has not entered the playoffs for two years.
The Avalanche ended the 2015-2016 season with a score of 39-39-4 and remained five points behind the Wild team without obtaining the second special invitation from the Western Conference organizers.
Hall of Fame goalkeeper Roy won four Stanley Cups in his career - two with the Montreal Canadiens and two with the Avalanche.
North Sea oil rig workers resume talks and postpone strike
Workers' strikes on North Sea oil rig workers' pay have been postponed as the two parties to the dispute have resumed negotiations, the negotiators say.
Periodically, strikes are held against the oil processing company Wood Group on the North Sea oil platforms, where the company Royal Dutch Shell operates.
The joint statement states that the Wood Group and Unite and RMT trade unions agreed to resume negotiations to resolve the dispute.
Over the following weeks, a number of full-day meetings are scheduled to begin early next week with the aim of re-examining problematic issues.
The trade unions told them that their recent events, organised after more than a 25-year break, were directed against the planned 30 percent wage cut.
This year, due to negative market pressure, Wood Group cut wages for North Sea workers by 9 percent.
As early as 2014, the company cut land workers' wages by 10 percent.
The company explains that additional wage cuts would allow the company to survive the market downturn.
Shell, on the other hand, already reduced wages for several thousand people and announced plans to stop oil and natural gas operations in 10 countries in order to optimise its work in preparation for a large-scale merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of falling oil prices, and the situation is further complicated by Britain's decision to leave the European Union.
Earlier in the week, Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with workers' representatives to discuss one of the most important issues - North Sea strike plans.
He said the North Sea was vital to the region's economy.
In his report, he explains that the North Sea and the country as a whole need an economy that benefits all, not individual individuals.
In 2016, nearly $1.4 billion is expected to be invested in new North Sea projects, compared to $7 billion invested over the past five years.
Kepler measures the speed of stellar spin in the constellation of the Plead.
The newer Kepler telescope mission has helped astronomers compile the most complete catalogue of the speed of stellar spin in the constellation of Plejad.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars in this constellation spin at different speeds, as well as how the speed of stellar spin is related to the formation of planets.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other constellations, we will get more information about the relationship between the stellar mass, age, and even the history of its solar system," Pasadena Caltech Infrared Process and Analytic Center scientist Luisa Rebula told the news release.
The Pleasure constellation is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many stars in this constellation are only beginning to grow, reaching about 125 million years of age.
They spin at maximum speed.
At maximum speed, these rising stars emit large amounts of star wind.
As the winds reach the magnetic field of the stars, they brake the stars.
As the stars age, their speed of rotation decreases.
Kepler measures the speed of each star's rotation by determining the time between the appearance of recognizable areas of stars, such as sunspots.
The latest stellar speed catalogue suggests that larger stars spin slower than smaller stars.
Rebuls compares stars to dancers, larger-sized dancers perform pyrouettes slower than small-sized dancers.
Rebul says that the Plejade "ballet" shows that the slow rotating objects are larger and more massive, while the faster rotating objects are very small stars.
Thanks to being so close to the Plejad constellation, it serves as a great space lab where you can compare star characteristics to spin speeds.
Rebul says that the Plejad constellation helps to create theoretical models for stellar rotation in both directions for both older and younger stars.
We still have a lot to learn how, when and why the speed of stellar rotation and the complete stopping process of it will slow down.
Rebul and his colleagues presented in detail an analysis of the speed of Plejad's stars in three new publications to be published shortly in the Astronomy Journal.
