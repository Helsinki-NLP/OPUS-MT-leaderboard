New questions about California water supply project
Critics and the state legislature say they want to know more about who pays for the $16 billion project supported by Governor Jerry Brown, according to a spokesman for the leading California Water Board, that the Brown administration is offering government funding to complete the construction of two huge water tunnels.
Critics argue that government funding described by the Los Angeles Metropolitan Water Board may contradict the state's longstanding claims that various local water supply administrations, not California itself, would pay for Brown's vision of digging two equal 35 miles of tunnels to drain water south of the Sacramento River, primarily for Central and Southern California.
Initial expenditure on tunnel construction of $248 million, which is yet to obtain permission from the supervising authority, has already begun a federal audit study facility.
On Wednesday, state lawmakers also ordered a state audit of tunnel construction expenditure.
On Thursday, State Speaker Nancy Vogel said that despite an account from the Los Angeles Metropolitan Water Board, no money from the state's general budget would be used to complete the current planning phase of the twin tunnels.
However, tunnel opponents and a group of taxpayers were critical on Thursday, and Assembly spokeswoman Susan Egg, one of the state's lawmakers standing behind the audit commissioned this week, asked the state for explanations on Thursday.
"It's a game with thimbles," said David Wolf, legal director of the Howard Jervis Taxpayers' Association.
In my opinion, this echoes yesterday's audit (request): there are many more questions than answers.
The tunnel project has been approved by Brown and some politically influential water supply administrations and water consumers in Central and Southern California.
Supporters say that the tunnels will benefit the environment and provide Californians with a safer water supply.
Opponents say they are worried that the state will use the tunnels to divert too much water from the Sacramento River and San Francisco Bay, causing damage to Northern California and further endangering native species.
Metropolitan and other water supply administrations, which are expected to receive water from the tunnels, have yet to commit themselves to paying for them for reasons of insecurity as to whether the investment of huge resources will really give enough water to make it pay.
The same water supply authorities also announced this year that they would not pay for the completion of the current preparatory work unless the project first obtained permission from the supervising authority.
Thursday, a monthly review of the tunnel project published by the Los Angeles Water Board mentions that "the state has indicated that additional funding for the completion of the planning phase will come from state or federal budget funds."
After all that local water supply authorities have spent on the project, including $63 million from his water supply authority, "it is expected that the state will use public money to complete the planning," said Bob Muir, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Water Supply Authority.
He went on to direct questions to Vogel, the state's Speaker.
Vogel said that the state plans to allocate money to complete tunnel planning from a fee for the existing half-century old water network, the State Water Project.
Opponents of tunnel construction, however, point to a regulatory framework issued in 2009, which they say prevents the state from spending money on tunnel construction, while the water supply authorities that will benefit from it will not assume payment obligations for them.
"The project contractors have promised to pay for this project and they have used financial tricks to circumvent these obligations," said Patricia Schifferle, an environmental consultant and an old opponent of planned tunnels.
This raises questions about where this money was suddenly found.
Business Group Turning to China on Cyber Security Act
A coalition of international business groups has approached China with a request to change the proposed cyber security rules warning that they will harm trade and isolate the country.
A letter to Chinese Prime Minister Li Kecian has been signed by 46 groups from the United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America, showing global concern that regulations could restrict or suspend access to the Chinese information security product market.
Signatories include the US Chamber of Commerce, the European Services Forum and groups from Japan, Korea and Mexico.
The proposed regulations require suppliers to show the Chinese authorities how security products work and how information about Chinese citizens will be stored in the country.
The last letter, dated Wednesday, states that this could make data stealing easier and reduce access to Chinese customers.
The chemical explosion in Tianjin: a year has passed since the tragedy
Zhang Mengfan claims that the public deserves to know what happened in Tianjin.
Chinese leaders are planning quiet commemorations to commemorate the first anniversary of a large-scale chemical explosion that killed 173 people, but not everyone agrees.
John Sadworth reports from Tianjin.
Almost anywhere else in the world, the anniversary of a disaster of this magnitude would be a moment that the people remember and commemorate.
Not in China, however.
Although a memorial service to commemorate some of the dead firefighters is being held in the town of Taijin, elsewhere such commemorative events have been excluded.
Media controlled by the Communist Party have been told what they can and cannot say, and some survivors, as well as family members of the victims, have been warned not to speak to the foreign press.
However, 23-year-old Zhang Mengfan does not want to remain silent.
"On this anniversary, the public should somehow find out what happened," he tells me.
I don't want silence.
On 12 August last year, Zhang was a radio operator in a military fire brigade just a kilometre away from the epicenter of the explosions.
"The call was received that night at 22.53 p.m. and we started sending my teammates," he says.
They could arrive at the scene within 10 minutes.
Extinguishing the extensive fire in a chemical storage depot also rushed teams from other locations in the city.
None of them paid attention to the fact that large quantities of volatile and toxic substances were illegally stored, far exceeding the permitted quantities and also without proper monitoring.
The fire started when a batch of nitrocellulose - a chemical used in nail polish - was allowed to dry and then ignite in the summer heat.
Then it spread to a huge area - 800 tonnes of ammonium nitrate fertiliser.
Windows and a fire station were knocked out in the blasts, where Zhang Mengfan was waiting at the radio remote from the scene, the roof was invaded.
This information was never received.
"When I saw a mushroom cloud, I fell into despair," he tells me.
I knew what that would mean for my friends.
Of the 26 firefighters of his unit who were sent to the blast site that night, eight never returned.
Many others suffered serious burns and other injuries.
The largest of the two major explosions was likened to an earthquake, and the wave of the explosion was felt many miles away.
The total damage is estimated at over US$1 billion, including over 300 destroyed buildings.
A total of 173 people lost their lives, 104 of whom were firefighters.
The remains of eight people have never been found.
Official government investigative bodies are clearly blaming corruption, political contact and official collusion, which allowed circumvention of regulations and disregard of security systems.
First of all, such a storehouse should never have been built close to residential homes.
More than 100 officials and representatives of the company's management have been subject to some form of disciplinary or criminal investigation.
Thus, while the government can point to the progress that has been made - the thousands of homes arranged and the compensation for the population - these sensitive issues are still relevant.
Tragedy has revealed gaps in a system where rapid economic growth is a priority and the lack of independent supervision is a fact.
The courage and sense of duty of that evening is not in doubt, and yet without the image of the fireman as a hero, there is a not very pleasing picture.
It features a firefighter as a victim sent without advance knowledge to fight a man-made disaster that could have been prevented.
Zhang Mengfan is no longer working in the fire service, but will attend a memorial service in Tianjin.
He will carry in his heart the message of his dying companions.
Most of all, I want to tell them: I've visited your parents and they're doing well.
Leave my parents to me.
Now I'm a member of your family.
I will do your duties as sons.
The cold spring could affect the Scottish ruby shooting season
Scotland's rubble shooting season will begin later as the number of birds has decreased this year due to cold weather.
In several properties, the shooting has been postponed as many of the new rubles have not survived in the cold spring conditions.
Celebrating the start of the season, the Scottish Games Organizers Association (SGA) says that rubble shooting provides more work than Edinburgh festivals.
However, the animal protection charity foundation OneKind calls for an end to "brutal bird killing".
Harry Hughton, director of the organization, said, "The work being invested in securing a large number of birds for shooting is huge and undeniably involves some rather contentious activities."
It is no surprise that society is turning away from this so-called sport and calling on the government to ban the cruel, unnecessary activities enjoyed by only a very small proportion of the Scottish population.
The landowners, however, insist that they commit to keeping the number of birds and that rubble shooting is important for the development of the rural economy.
SGA President Alex Hogg said that the industry provides 8,800 full-time jobs a year in more remote regions and that it has been a "rich labour patch" in precarious times.
He said, "Compared to many European countries, Scotland is not so deeply rooted in the culture of 'hunting', and some people do not even know how shooting seasons affect the country economically."
Hogg said the number of jobs provided during the shooting outnumbers the number of jobs created at the Edinburgh International Festival, the Fringe Festival, the Tattoo Festival and the Old Year's Eve celebrations together.
He added, "The employment situation in Scotland is currently quite worrying, especially in the oil and gas sector, so game organisers and their families want to see the industry flourish.
We want to work with the Scottish Government to ensure that hard-working people can continue to rely on these jobs in the future.
RSPB Scotland believes that at least eight golden eagles have been killed near the living environment of the rubles.
Many game organizers recognize that rubble shooting is not generally popular, but the SGA states that the industry "has taken significant steps forward in terms of best practice."
The opening day of the Rube shooting season is traditionally known as the "Holy Twelve."
However, there is still much discussion about this sport, and the management of rubble shooting sites involves the persecution of some of the violators by nature conservation authorities.
On Thursday, RSPB Scotland said that eight ringed golden eagles had disappeared in less than five years in the Monadliat Mountains, southeast of Inverness.
The Nature Conservation Charities Foundation believes they have been illegally killed near rubble shooting sites and their satellite bracelets have been destroyed.
Scottish Environment Minister Rosanna Cunningham said these reports were "very disturbing and disappointing."
Mrs. Cunningham instructed officials to analyze evidence of about 90 surviving and missing eagles with transmitters to determine if there was a trend in criminal activities.
A group of Scottish moors blame the RSPB for trying to pummel anti-shooting sensations before the start of the rouble season, and also mentioned that there is no clear evidence that the birds even died in the Monadlit Mountain neighborhood.
Rio Olympics 2016: Briony Paige wins silver in tramp jump for Great Britain
British representative Paige wins silver in tramp jump
Briony Paige has become the first British woman to be awarded a medal at the Olympics in tramp jumping, with Rio winning silver.
Paige (25) missed 0.425 points to gold, as Canadian Representative Rosanna McLennan won already the second consecutive Olympic title with a score of 56.465.
World champion, Chinese representative Lee Dana was at bronze, while second British finalist Katherine Driscoll finished sixth.
I can't believe I've won an Olympic medal.
I am so happy," said the emotional Paige clearly.
I had no idea it was a medal, but I was able to show the best performance, so I was so happy that all the training and hard work had paid off.
I'm so happy that I was able to start with Kath in the final, already one representative would be historic in the final, but there were two of us there.
Prior to winning the Olympic silver, Paige's highest achievement in international competition was fifth place at the 2015 World Championships in Denmark.
Trampling was included in the Olympics in 2000, and this is the first time British women have managed to get to the final.
Reaction to the Medal.
British team spokesman Nathan Bailey, the only representative in the men's competition in the tramp jump on Saturday, was in ecstasy.
Hannah Wellan, who is taking part in the Olympics for the second time, quickly began to praise Peige's achievement.
Paige has obtained bachelor's in biology with excellence at the University of Sheffield.
Rio 2016: Fiji fans celebrate gold medal win in rugby-7
A 12-year-old boy to see the game, sketches half a mile both in the sugarcane fields to the nearest television
Fiji, after winning its first Olympic gold medal in its history, begins celebration on an unprecedented scale
Banks closed, shops closed and celebraters took over Suva streets, dancing, singing and rejoicing
Fiji won the gold medal, at Deodoro Stadium in the rugby-7 final with 43-7 shattering Britain.
Thousands of people across the island country stopped their usual jobs to watch the historic game.
Fiji celebrates its first Olympic medal in its history
Many fans were dressed in Fijian colours and rugby shirts, carrying the national flag and encouraging the team.
Surrounded by the whistle of the end of the game, the excited celebraters took to the streets, rejoicing and dancing.
"Some people even stopped their vehicles on the crowded streets of Suva and joined the celebrations with Fijian flags, I will not address the minor congestion they caused," reports the Fiji Times.
The celebration will certainly continue over the weekend and next week.
Irish Premier League: Finn Harps 0-5 Derry City
Aaron McKenef hit two first half time penalty kicks for a visiting team at Finnpark.
Derry City have picked up for second one in the Premier League, scoring a convincing victory with a score of 5-0 in a fight with Finn Harps.
Aaron McKenef put up a "candy strip" lead, successfully pursuing two first half-time penalty kicks awarded for offenses against Lucas Schubert.
Nathan Boyle kicked a goal early in the second half time, and Schubert beat the opponent in the fourth quarter before Keith Vard's late pass, concluding an opponent's smash at Finnpark.
Derry is on one point ahead of Cork City, and the two teams will meet in the deciding game on Monday night in Brendiwell.
It was Derry's first win over their northwestern competitors this season, and they were bothered for me by the HARPS side.
McKenef saved the game's opening kick in the 17th minute after Kiran Cole's walk-out against Schubert, although the offense proved to be out of the penalty area.
There was no doubt about the second penalty kick, with former Caramel Strip midfielder Barry Molloy causing Schubert to fall to the ground and McKenef achieving a score of 2-0 in the third minute after the break.
Boyle put an accurate point after Dean Jervis' pass with the inside of his foot in the eighth minute after the game was reopened.
Derry City goalkeeper Gerard Doherty had a calm evening but managed to superbly secure the goal, beating David Scully at the guests' best opening of the game.
Schubert hit the ball past Cole before making a breakthrough in the 83rd minute, and this was soon followed by Vard's smart rebound over Harps center guard Richard Brash.
It was Derry's biggest win in the race series and a great preparation for the final game with Cork.
Test after massive pending tests at the Inverness College University of Highlands and Islands (UHI) course
The entire course of 20 students could have failed at Inverness College's UHI Higher Media Course test.
Most of these were 17- and 18-year-old students who hoped to use the mark received in the studies to enter the university.
Inverness College UHI claims that quality assurance processes are being applied, adding that the Scottish Qualification Authority (SQA) is investigating the case.
The SQA press secretary said that the country-wide assessment of the highest media of 2016 has been "noted as expected".
Twenty students signed up for the course offered and evaluated by the UHI of Inverness College.
Many of the students were young people living in rural areas who had their studies online, however, often had to go to Inverness College from their residences, such as from Locheiber.
The father of one student said that according to his daughter's publications on social media for not receiving any assessment of her work, at least 10 more also made a statement that she had not received any assessment of her course work.
He told the BBC News Scotland directing that about five other people who took this course at Inverness College last year and who managed to communicate with, said the same thing had happened to them as well.
The situation means that his daughter cannot secure a place at the University of Glasgow, but she will be able to accept another university's offer thanks to school qualifications.
However, her father said that there were others who were attending a media course organized by the college, which failed and who were now in "forgetful" and uncertain as to whether their course work would be reviewed and appreciated with a mark so that they could join universities.
Inverness College UHI is part of the University of Highlands and Islands.
Diane Rowlinson, head and executive director of Inverness College UHI, said, "We have exam results and student success very important."
This is confirmed by the excellent report of Her Majesty's Education Inspectorate (HMIE) this year, as well as by the improved performance levels both in continuing education and higher education compared to last year.
As every year, we carry out the entire published scoreboard, comparing it to the forecasts of each student.
In the case of this particular course, standard quality assurance measures were taken, and the assessment body recently reported "substantial improvements in the delivery and management of this assessment" and confirmed that "the assessments were in line with national standards."
SQA is currently investigating the case at our request.
The SQA press secretary said, "We are pleased that the evaluation of the highest media for 2016 has run as planned and that the candidates had the opportunity to show their understanding of the subject."
Many candidates have shown good performance and saw a slight increase in the A-C achievement rate compared to the same qualification last year.
It was developed according to previous and model documents, and according to our course and assessment specifications.
Brothers put in jail for "bloodbath" of samurai swords in Kilmarnock
Jason Bryden was attacked with a samurai sword, knife and nunchaks
Two brothers have been jailed for killing a man with a samurai sword after a drug-related heist in Ayrshire that turned out in a "bloodbath".
Sacrifice Jason Braden (38) was stabbed multiple times at his home in Kilmarnock on 5 July 2015.
In the High Court in Glasgow, James Clark (36) will be sentenced to at least 22 years in prison after being convicted of murder.
His brother John (38) was sentenced to 10 years in prison after being convicted after a less severe charge of murder without a prior intention.
In awarding the two men a prison sentence, Judge Bill Dunlop told the brothers that they had committed "a ruthless, cruel and savage attack."
He rejected any assumption that Mr. Braden had slept and waited for them, armed with a samurai sword.
Judge Dunlop added, "You plan to illegally enter together with at least one knife and nunchaks."
Jason Braden may have been a drug dealer, yet he was a son, father, and friend.
You murdered him.
After the two men were imprisoned, the criminal police inspector who led the investigation said, "John and James Clark's violent and terrible actions have caused Jason Braden's death."
Going into his sun at the age of 38 under such terrible circumstances is a heartbreaking situation for the family to survive.
The court previously heard that the Kilmarnock brothers decided to kidnap Mr. Braden's gold cuff they had given him in exchange for drugs.
Both under the influence of alcohol and drugs went to his house, masked faces with scarves and armed with a knife and eastern fighting nunchaks.
The sword used in the murder is believed to have belonged to the deceased.
Neighbors said they saw Clarks attack Braden when he was sitting on the couch at the window, and heard him screaming.
Prosecutor Richard Godard said at the hearing, "The attack on this man was endured, chaotic."
The site of the murder was then described as a "bloodbath".
In addition to injuries from knife stitches, Braden suffered a severe injury with a blunt object during the attack.
Three days later, he died at Kilmarnock Crosshouse Hospital.
The two brothers did not confess to the murder.
In providing evidence, James Clarke, who has previously been tried 38 times, including on attempted murder, said, "I didn't want that. It was an accident."
John Clarke, who has previously been tried 23 times, said he only stepped in to help his brother, who according to him was attacked by Braden."
A man has been sentenced to prison for shaking and killing his infant son
David Sinkler admitted his guilt in the murder of a child at his home in Eastkillbraid in 2012.
A man who shook and killed his infant child in an outburst of anger because he did not want to eat has been sentenced to seven years and three months in prison.
David Sinkler shook four-month-old Joshua when he "lost control for a moment" at their home in Eastkillbraid, South Lancashire, on 6 December 2012.
The cause of death was determined only after a forensic examination.
Sinkler (34) was initially charged with murder, but was found guilty of murder without intention.
In the High Court of Glasgow, when he was sentenced to prison, Judge Lord Breiseidle told Sinkler, "You attacked your infant-age son by shaking him, causing injuries from which he died."
Then when you shook him, you had to know, but you didn't discover it.
It is only after thorough medical examination that you confessed to what was done.
Your wife believed you.
Now she feels betrayed and can no longer support you.
Lord Breiseidle described the aftermath of Joshua's death as "catastrophic" for everyone and added, "Nothing will bring Joshua back again."
Previously, the court had found that on the day the child died, Sinkler and his wife Cursty had gone out with Joshua to swim and shop in Eastkillbridge.
At 5:30 p.m., Cursty Sinclair went to meet her mother and sister.
Just 11 minutes later, she was called by Sinkler, who sounded "shocked".
He said to her, "Josh doesn't breathe properly, come home right now."
Then he ended the conversation and called the 999.
The infant was immediately taken to Hermaira Hospital, where he died.
The cause of Joshua's death was initially unclear, but he was looked at by a team of forensic experts who found the consequences of injuries to the eye and brain shortly before he died, and no such injuries could be sustained by chance.
One of the experts, Dr. Peter Richard, a counseling child neurosurgeon at John Redcliffe Hospital in Oxford, said, "This has happened because the child has been shaken and thus injured, as well as touched by more force than in everyday life."
A defense spokesman, Jan Deugid, told the court that Sinkler "extremely regrets" what he did.
Rio Olympics 2016: Chloe Tatone threatens Yulia Yefimova's positions
British representative Tatone slips out of her hands bronze in a 200 m swim
British spokeswoman Chloe Tatone criticizes controversial swimmer Julia Yefimova's participation in the Rio Games after a Russian spokeswoman overtakes her in a 200 m swim.
Yefimova, who was allowed to participate in the games following a complaint filed against the ban on participation due to doping, wins silver, leaving Tatoni in fourth place.
"I would have wanted them to be perfectly clean games," said a 20-year-old Welsh swimmer afterwards.
Not I determined who was in there.
I'm not happy with that, but that's what it is.
Yefimova, who won second place, learned about her participation in the games only three days ago.
I don't want to see people leave the sport, but I don't think it's really right.
She should not have participated in the race, and the 20-year-old British representative had to win the medal.
Rie Caneto won Japan's seventh gold medal at the 2016 Games in Rio, beating Jefimova, who was awarded the silver medal.
Chinese spokeswoman Ginling Shea was at the bronze, just six hundredths of a second ahead of the fourth single remaining Tatoni.
Her British teammate, 20-year-old Molly Renshaw, finished sixth.
"Remaining in fourth place is a bit of a disappointment, no matter what you've got ahead of you," added Tatone.
It's a great experience and I'm a little disappointed about fourth place.
I'm so close to the medal and it would have been a dream.
However, getting to the final is a great experience that I will take with me for the years to come.
It was a little disappointment, but in the long run it will make me strong, and it makes me more and more strive for a medal, so hopefully I'll get closer to it next time.
Tatone was only 0.01 seconds behind the British record in the women's 200 m swimming final.
"Every man must be given a second chance," - Yefimova.
Yefimova, who said she was already tired of answering questions about her doping past, defended her right to start in Rio.
In 2013, she was placed under a 16-month ban after traces of anabolic steroids were found in her body.
The Sports Arbitration Court (CAS) ruled that athletes could not be denied participation in the Rio Games because they had been sanctioned in advance.
CAS dealt with my complaint, and I won.
If someone doesn't like it and someone has a different opinion, they can turn to CAS," she explained.
I don't support doping, and I've never used it.
In the second case, it was certainly not my fault.
Every man must be given a second chance.
When you drive and you get a punitive receipt, no one puts you in jail.
Ben Praud wins a place in 50 freestyle swimming
Previously set a British record to win a spot in the men's 50 m freestyle swimming final.
Union Champion Praud (21) swam the distance in 21.54 seconds to qualify as fifth fastest for the Friday finals (02:44 BST Saturday).
Your delegation is shameless and rude
Indian Sports Minister Vijay Goel has been a rather conspicuous personality at the Rio Olympics, often seen in stands, cheering Indian athletes and hosting selfies after their starts.
However, he and his wide company have apparently caused the anger of the Olympic organizers due to their unbridled behaviour, repeatedly attempting to break through to the competition areas without adequate accreditation and in gross response, being tested, reports the Indian news agency Press Trust of India.
Vijay Goel, photographed in July, justifies his behavior.
On Wednesday, Olympic organizers threatened to cancel Goel's accreditation if his behaviour did not improve by sending a warning letter after he and his company tried to enter restricted-access areas at the venue and arena of the gymnastics competition, where there is a fencing and teikvando.
"We have received several reports that your sports minister has attempted to enter accredited competition areas with persons without accreditation," Sarah Peterson, continental manager of the Rio 2016 Organizers Committee, writes in a statement.
When the staff tried to explain that it was not allowed, the people with the minister became aggressive and rude, and sometimes broke past our staff.
"If our protocol team becomes aware of any other cases of such behaviour, your accreditation of the Sports Minister will be revoked and his privileges at the Olympics cancelled," the letter went on to state.
The leader of the Indian delegation called the case "an elephant blown out of the fly", and Goel himself said he had done nothing wrong, writing it all off as "a misunderstanding".
On Twitter, he wrote, "As far as I know, we have followed all the rules.
We maintain the spirit of the Olympic Games and support our Indian athletes.
Otherwise, the Olympic Games are rather gloomy for India, so far there is no medal.
Hopeless fans on social media pointed out that Michael Phelps had won as many medals - 26 - as India in its history.
Several prominent candidates have already been excluded, including gunman Abhinav Bindra, who won the gold medal in Beijing in 2008.
This time he remained fourth.
Money and opportunity launched in the wind," author and columnist of the sardonic tweet Shoba De.
However, some bright expectations remain, as there will still be competitions in boxing, golf, tennis, athletics and, yes, badminton.
The only Indian gymnast, Dip Karmakar, will compete in the jump finals on Sunday, showing her scary double speed "The Death Jump", a Produnova jump that only a few other gymnasts have attempted.
For a country of 1.25 billion people, India's low number of medals won has always been a cause of indignation.
Analysts say there are countless reasons for this.
National passion is cricket, which is not an Olympic sport.
India has not invested heavily in infrastructure and training the Olympians - Karmakara's first gymnastics tool was made of spare parts of an old scooter.
Parents have always emphasized the superiority of academic knowledge over sport.
And the authorities responsible for sport are overwhelmed with corruption.
The International Olympic Committee has suspended the Indian Olympic Association for violating its statutes in 2012 as it elected leaders against whom criminal cases have been brought.
In Sochi, three participants in the Indian Winter Olympics were even prevented from representing their country, carrying a flag, or wearing anything with the country's symbolism.
They competed as independent athletes.
As people get injured, the turbulence-shattered JetBlue plane on the Boston-Sacramento route is forced to land in South Dakota.
The JetBlue plane was forced to make an emergency landing on Thursday night after 22 passengers and two crew members were injured during turbulence, reports CBS Sacramento.
Flight 429 from Boston to Sacramento landed in Rapid City, South Dakota, shortly before 19:30 a.m. local time.
The airline says that the injured have been taken to hospital for inspections.
JetBlue claims it has sent personnel to help the injured, a replacement plane has flown to Rapid City to deliver the other passengers to Sacramento.
Drug Control Agency (DEA) misses opportunity for medical marijuana
The answer, unfortunately, is: unlikely.
This is a missed opportunity, which may further delay the provision of treatment to countless people.
Until today, there is only one federally approved source of medical marijuana use for scientific purposes at the University of Mississippi.
In seemingly slightly more positive news today, the DEA also stated that it will now allow other places to apply for permission to do the same.
There is a hope that the amount and diversity of marijuana available for scientific purposes could expand.
Although it will attract attention as an emphasis in favour of the study, it will largely be symbolic, because no matter how much marijuana is available, if access to it is still difficult, it does not play a major role.
Imagine a product that is in high demand but is stored behind closed doors.
In response to a demand for goods, someone makes a hard-to-understand decision to produce it more, but to get and it never shuts the door.
This product is marijuana, and its location on list 1 is this locked door.
In such an unpleasant situation, there is medical marijuana.
As marijuana is a substance in List 1 (recently, by definition, it "does not currently have an approved medical application, and there is a high potential for its use for unforeseen purposes"), there are significant obstacles to unlocking doors.
Potential researchers usually first turn to the DEA because it grants permission to undertake scientific research.
Even if an authorisation is granted for the investigation of substances on list 1, the authorities must comply with very strict safety rules and set up high-level safety systems, which can be costly.
There is also an even more subjective consideration of the authorisation of research into substances in List 1 by their academic institution in the first place.
Even if some faculty representatives wish to do this research, university management may not want to have a problem or any potential side effects due to negative press reports.
This was the case at the University of Arizona when Dr. Sue Sisley was dismissed after trying to push forward medical marijuana trials.
Sisley eventually had to seek private funding for her project, and it was not until April, seven years after the initial initiation of the project, that her project became the first DEA-approved medical marijuana trial for post-traumatic stress prevention veterans.
Then, after years of fighting bureaucratic obstacles, the National Institute for Drug Addiction has been at the key to the last lock.
It is currently the largest federal public fundraiser of marijuana research, and is the only supplier of marijuana itself.
Even if more medical treatment is put into free circulation for research, the Institute will still have to approve all the research it funds.
However, the problem is with the name "abuse" in its name.
A spokesman for the University of San Francisco, Dr. Donald Eibram, interviewed by me for my documentary Marijuana, says that the institute's main task is to study substances in the context of their potential addiction, not as medication.
Abram draws attention to an important fact.
Even if the study overcomes all the obstacles listed above, the door may still be closed if the intention is to study the benefits of medical marijuana rather than the harm it causes.
Note: In a quick (and, admittedly, unscientific) search, 1,434 works on medical marijuana were found at the U.S. National Library of Medicine over the past five years.
In the same search, only 57 jobs were for the benefits of medical marijuana.
Most studies were on harm caused by marijuana, such as "A bad journey due to the anticholinergic effects of marijuana", "Marijuana-induced pancreatitis" and "Marijuana use and risk of lung cancer."
Such a disproportion creates a rather distorted picture.
The road to the use of medical marijuana is paved with surprises and hypocrisy wherever the sight opens.
While the DEA tackles List 1 status without looking at the medical effect, the U.S. Department of Health and Social Affairs simultaneously retains a cannabionid patent for large-scale medical purposes.
The DEA continues to put marijuana alongside heroin and LSD as drugs with high addiction potential, although the DEA's own chief administrative law judge, Francis Young, opposed it.
In a strict medical sense, marijuana is safer than many widely consumed foods.
For example, eating 10 fresh potatoes can cause toxic reactions.
In comparison, it is physically impossible to eat so much marijuana as to result in death.
Marijuana in its natural form is one of the safest therapeutic active substances known to mankind.
By rational analysis, marijuana can be safely used in medical treatment by appropriate monitoring.
Again, it has to be said that it was initiated by the DEA judge himself.
And yet, in almost 30 years, little has changed.
Whether we are aware of it or not, we all accept a certain dose of hypocrisy in our daily lives.
Perhaps we do not always have the energy to express it out loud, or we are so dumb or stunned that no one seems to have noticed it.
As for hypocrisy in the context of federal medical marijuana policy, there must be endurance to relentlessly present the facts.
The lives of patients, such as Charlotte Fiji, whose seizures are reduced by the use of medicinal marijuana, and the lives of many others depend on it.
It is worth speaking at a higher level about the fact that the plant can bring so many benefits and still be behind closed doors.
Bloody Beetroots: Donald Trump's "blond Berlusconi"
Bloody Beetroots is known in the context of electronic dance music
Musicians say Trump dominates the media much like Berlusconi
You know, we're used to Berlusconi in Italy, and for me Trump looks like a blond Berlusconi," the founder of the electronic music punk association "The Bloody Beetroots" said to CNN.
The Republican presidential candidate and politician-became Italian media magnate, both known because of their exaggerated personality, ability to attract press attention and the transformed story in the media.
In "Bloody Beetroots", Rifo is known for his electronic dance music and has collaborated with various artists, from legendary Sir Paul McCartney to electropop singer Greta Svabo Bech in 2013 in the song "Chronicles of a Fallen Love."
Rifo was born in Basano del Grapa, Italy, near Venice, in 1977, roughly coinciding with the time of the emergence of punk rock, and the numbers "1977" have been tattooed to the musician on his chest.
"English is not my mother tongue, so I don't understand everything about your world," Rifo said, hiding behind the black fee he is known for.
I'm trying to explore, and I've been trying to improve my understanding of your culture.
Rifo invited Americans to watch "Videocracy", a documentary exploring Berlusconi's monopoly over Italian media.
The documentary is about how "Berlusconi made Italy crazy," said Rifo, adding that Trump had a similar impact on America.
"You see how a man can completely turn the system and fold everything out... along his own," he said.
In my opinion, Trump is not good for this country.
Two Turkish sailors jailed over £500 million in drug case
Two Turkish men have been convicted of smuggling more than £500 million worth of cocaine aboard a ship in the North Sea, each sentenced to at least 20 years in prison.
Mamin Sahin and Emin Ozman were found guilty after a trial at the High Court in Glasgow after about 100 miles off the coast of Aberdeen aboard MV Hamal found three tons of Class A drugs.
The detention in 2015 is the largest single load of cocaine seized at sea in Europe.
Mamin Sahin and Emin Ozman are sentenced to prison for his role in a large-scale drug deal
The vast cargo of drugs found on board is one of the largest in British history
Drugs were found hidden in a specially installed ambush on a tugboat registered in Tanzania that sailed from Istanbul to Tenerife and then to the North Sea.
It was stopped by the British navy frigate "HMS Somerset" and the border force cutter "HMC Valiant".
Sahin (47) was sentenced to 22 years, while Ozman (51) is sentenced to 20 years in the Glasgow Supreme Court.
Judge Lord Kinkleiven said to the men that the amount of drugs was "not only substantial but ambitious", and drug smuggling has a "destructive effect" on people and the surrounding society.
He said, "You were involved in the most commercially ambitious operation, including the transportation of cocaine by ship, an operation that crossed international and truly intercontinental borders."
He said that the ship's captain, Sahin, was not "at the top of the drug tree", but he had played an essential role in the felony, while the other role of Captain Ozman was "something smaller".
Inspectors climbed aboard Hamal after seductive information from the French customs authority DNRED, and when it docked in Aberden, they drilled through a steel plate, accessing a secret compartment in which 128 bundles of cocaine weighing 3.2 tons were found, with an estimated value in the black market of 512 million pounds of stripes.
"MV Hamal" was inspected last year by the Royal Fleet.
Three tons of cocaine were on board.
Inspection of the ships found that its ballast tanks had shaken tons of Class A drugs
The ship was en route from the Bosporus Strait to South America before being stopped in the North Sea.
Access to the site was opened under the closet in one of the crew's team rooms, and the gap was cemented.
Sahin and Ozman were found guilty of transporting and hiding cocaine on board between 20 February and 23 April last year, and of supplying cocaine between 21 April and 23 April.
The two previously unpunished men, who have worked in the shipping industry since graduation, continue to claim not guilty, yet pass the jury verdict.
The charges against four other men lack evidence.
Sahin's lawyer Jonathan Crow, said that a married father of two children was a "glorified mule".
He said, "Someone who was involved in the transportation of drugs."
Someone who was able to lead the ship.
Looking at the drug hierarchy, Sahin is certainly not at the top of the drug tree, but somewhere below.
The huge amount of cocaine on board means that it had to be removed by a crane
The police passed through the entire ship for days before the drugs were distributed over these boxes
Sahin addressed questions about his captain's work to "Hamal" in February 2015, the court heard.
Mr. Crowe said that he was "shocked" for missing important events of his daughter (9) and son (13) and "just wanting to go back to Turkey".
Both men have not seen their families since their arrest in April 2015, as families are still struggling to get visa approval.
Ozman's lawyer, Di Moore, said he "desperately" wants to see his family, but knows that in the foreseeable future it "will not be possible".
Speaking after the verdicts read today, Scottish prosecutor David Harvey said, "International drug trafficking has no borders, and we, who are tasked with destroying it, are working more and more closely together to get us one step ahead.
"Scottish success in the persecution of criminals is indeed on a global level, and in this case we have caused significant economic losses to organised crime representatives."
The drugs were packed in all gaps on board, including under the floors.
Inspectors of these smuggling parcels found hidden in the ship's laundry room
Mr. Harvey added: "Hamal" was identified by intelligence instructions from the French authorities, and after a rapid collaboration with the Attorney General of Tanzania, where the ship is registered, who also allowed to board the ship.
"Our investigation then went from Gyjana, which provided access to essential data on shipments, to Spain, which provided us with very valuable information about the ship's stops in the Canary Islands.
We also worked with colleagues in Denmark, Norway and the United States to put together specific elements of evidence.
Despite the thorough intelligence of carrying large quantities of drugs with Hamal, British authorities in international waters aboard it could not climb without the permission of the Tanzanian government - something they had never granted before.
Sue Peiten, head of the Royal Criminal Affairs Prosecutor's Office (CPS) International Justice and Organised Crime Fighter, said, "In an effort to be quick and accurate, a CPS criminal justice adviser managed to obtain permission from the Tanzanian authorities to board the ship within 24 hours of receiving intelligence information.
Under international maritime law, British officials are not entitled to climb international waters on board a ship flying the flag of another State, unless that State issues a special legal permit to do so.
Without our criminal justice adviser's quick action, there would be a great risk that the ship could escape and that we could never bring these people to justice.
Photographer Brian Romeijn perpetuates the dwindling "East Express" train
Photographer Brian Romeijn of Rotterdam took photos of this abandoned train in Belgium
The images show the rusting inside of the train, the torn seats, the dusty windows and the narrow driving cab
It has already been dubbed the Eastern Express wagon, however it was owned by the Belgian national railway company
The city explorer has taken these remarkable photographs showing the dwindling remains of a passenger train that was once one of the best ways to travel.
Its flower times have long gone by, and the train car and locomotive have been left to rot in the train depot in Belgium, where they have become a popular attraction for photographers and adventurers.
Photographer Brian Romeijn, 40, has taken these fearsome photographs showing the rusty inside of the train, the torn seats, the dusty windows and the compressed driver's cab
The train wagon and locomotive have been left to rot the train depot in Belgium, where they have become a popular attraction for photographers and adventurers.
These trains were a symbol of luxury when they operated under the legendary name between 1883 and 2009.
The locomotive was used by the Belgian national railway company about 50 years ago.
After 126 years on the tracks, the last train to operate under the name of the Eastern Expressor went from Strasbourg to Vienna in December 2009, concluding the famous phase of history.
The East Express was famous on the Paris - Istanbul route.
When it was started in 1883 (operator - La Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits) it was known by the name in French "Express d'Orient".
It became the Eastern Express in 1891, and by the 1930s it already had regular routes throughout Europe.
It should not be confused with the private "Venice Simplen-Orient-Express".
There are very few "Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits" luxury wagons left.
In this photograph, the narrow driver’s cab in which the equipment is rusting is still fitted with measuring instruments and exposed wires
Romeijn said that the driver's cab was "in its own way claustrophobic, and the noise of the locomotive must have been unbearable."
The abandoned locomotive and wagon have become a popular attraction for photographers and adventurers.
After visiting the forgotten train in Belgium, Romeinge MailOnlineTravel said, "I could really feel how it was used in its flower times."

Grim's artistry Katherine Galloway turns into the series "Arrested Development" in Baster Bluth
Thanks to her impressive sinking skills, appearances and transformations, Texian and YouTube censon Kathleen Galloway have come to the fan army.
However, her last transformation into Baster Bluth of "Arrested Development" is quite unbelievable by any standards.
In a three-minute-long video uploaded to her Kiki G YouTube channel, Geloway slowly and continuously turns herself into a failed image with a hook instead of a hand.
She even uses some audio recording from the show at the end of the clip in a terrible, but at the same time great performance.
The talented makeup artist begins her video in her own image of a blond woman.
Then, with the help of her slow photographs, she slowly turns into the spectacled "memmesdell", who is already retreating her hair, and who is Tony Hale Baster Bluth.
Geloway does this with colored contact lenses, shading and pulling contours around her nose and eyes, as well as drawing Baster's face on her head.
Wise Techniques: Using the slowed photograph wisely, she slowly turns into Tony Hale Baster Bluth.
In the course of her video, she also takes over the personality and manners of the cult TV image, drawing the chin accordingly.
The clip, which has been posted on YouTube, has been watched over 45,000 times, and the make-up artist's skills glorifying comments appeared quite quickly:
"You're extremely talented," a person recorded a video placed under Galloway.
In the course of her video, she also takes on the personality and manners of a cult TV image
"I like the way you do it all stay in the image," someone else added.
Videobloger Kathleen Galloway had previously successfully turned into the "Parks and Recreation" character Ron Swenson.
She told her YouTube followers that she hoped to shape makeup transformations every week in the future.

In Lancashire, a father is expelled from the children's school for wearing a T-shirt with llama names
The father of two children expelled from the children's school for arriving on their sports day in a T-shirt with offensive inscription.
Craig Macbeth (36) of the town of Burnli, Lancashire, says he had "accidentally" put on a shirt with the inscription "Laijam and dr.am!"
However, despite the fact that when he noticed his miseed and put on a T-shirt upside down, the next day he found that he was forbidden from entering the school grounds.
The lone father, who works for four years as the head of Park Primary School in Colne, Childle, was unable to come after the children due to a ban, and the staff even called social services and police.
Craig Macbeth (36) of Children says that he has not been allowed into the school grounds after arriving for the children's sports day in an abusive T-shirt.
Mr. Burnley accuses the headmaster of the school, Sarah Midgley, of overreacting.
He says he has been unjustly punished for having made a T-shirt by mistake after rushing before going on to watch his two-children's race.
The father, who no longer works as the head of the school, said, "It was a mistake and carelessness on my part."
I don't think about sports day and I rushed when I put it on.
Nearer the end of the event we had a father's race, and the director noticed my T-shirt and told him it wasn't appropriate.
I apologized and cut it out to the other side, and that ended the case too.
However, the 36 - year - old said that he had received a letter from the Head of Schools that night inviting him to a meeting with the Headmaster the next day, but he did not see the need to do so because he had already apologized.
"Then the school principal called me and said I was banned from entering the school grounds," added Mr. Burnley.
I learned that after sports day, some parents had raised the alarm on Facebook and that many people were interested in it.
Any coherent-minded person would say that this is exaggerated.
Mr. Macbeth, who is editor of the online magazine Love Mini, said that he felt that he could not even come after the children on the last day of the semester because of the ban.
However, this was the reason for a call from school and social services.
On the T-shirt was Craig Charles's image of Lister from the BBC cult comedy Red Dwarf with one of his iconic expressions "Laijam and dr.am."
He commented, "I told them I wasn't there because I'm banned from entering school.
Then I got a phone call from the social services and asked why I wasn't after my daughter.
The school also called the police because I hadn't come to pick up my daughter for about 40 minutes."
Mr. Macbeth claims that he was told that he could no longer come to the school premises and that the ban would last until further statements were made.
He also mentioned that he had been warned that he could be fined £500 if caught breaking this rule.
Sarah Midgley, the principal of Park Primary School, said that the case had now been terminated.
Sarah Midgley, the principal of Park Primary School, said, "I can confirm that Mr. Macbeth has resigned and is no longer the head of our school."
This case has now been terminated and I look forward to returning to normal school life in September."
Childli city councillor Joe Cooney said the school had clear policies and guidelines.
"We all have to bear in mind that, in taking up such positions as adviser or manager, you are subject to higher standards, and unfortunately this time he did not meet these standards," he said.
Councillor Jonathan Nixon added that he did not think that the school should have imposed a ban on him and that an elephant had been blown out of the fly.
Mr. Nixon added, "The wearing of such a T-shirt was foolish, and he apologized for it too."
Lancashire police confirmed they were called from school, but they did not arrive.

The rest of the VEF area, including Berzaunes, is also developing.

Announces a competition for grass mowing in lanes of road compartments.
The Latvian road maintainer of VAS has announced a procurement for mechanized lawn mowing in the road compartment lanes in the regions of Latvia and in Pierīga, informs LAU.
The object of the procurement is divided into 9 lots: Alūksnes, Daugavpils, Jēkabpils, Jelgava, Rēzekne, Valmiera, Talsi and Riga Road Districts.
Tenderers may submit a tender for one or more lots.
Mowing of grass in the lanes of road compartments is necessary to improve the transparency of roads and areas adjacent to them by drivers, to facilitate the delivery of water from the road, and to limit grassing and threshing.
The most ambitious lawn mowing works are planned for farmers in Talsi road district for a total of 637 hiking kilometres on 28 roads, in Valmiera road district for 20 roads for 432 hiking kilometres, and in Aluksne for 17 roads for 384 hiking kilometres.
It has already been reported that in June the company completed the lawn mowing work on the main and most important regional asphalt roads of the country, but on smaller regional roads and on local roads the maintainer of the Latvian motorways of the VAS planned to entrust the mowing work to farmers.
"It is an opportunity for us to use the funding allocated to road maintenance works more efficiently, while at the same time allowing farmers to fully load the machinery and earn", emphasizes Vladimirs Kononovs, Chairman of the Board of SJSC Latvian Road Maintainer.
The deadline for the submission of tenders is 22 August.
Ombudsman: Demagogy on the model of compulsory health insurance with an additional financial burden on citizens does not hold any criticism.
Any demagoguery on compulsory health insurance, which would impose a direct and increased burden of payment on residents, does not hold any criticism, according to Ombudsman Juris Jansons.
Jansons met today with Health Minister Anda Čakša to discuss the situation in the health sector.
After the meeting, Jansons told journalists that the sector funding model proposed by the Minister of Health was sustainable and would develop the healthcare system, making it more accessible to patients.
He noted, however, that in this case, additional funding for health care should be discussed, as it is currently insufficient.
Jansons also stressed that any demagogy on compulsory health insurance, which would impose a direct and increased burden of payment on the population, did not hold any criticism, especially when the Dutch model is invoked.
Jansons said that the Netherlands allocates 11% of gross domestic product to health, while Latvia - only 3%.
So the government and parliament must be responsible enough to understand that from this freezing point, the Ombudsman said that otherwise the model proposed by the Ministry of Health (VM) would not work.
Čaksha thanked the Ombudsman for his support and pointed out that the main concern is that the patient should get a doctor, which in turn means that the health care system needs additional funding.
The Minister pointed out, however, that with an additional EUR 35 million planned, it will be possible to do only the most acute things next year regarding oncological patients and remuneration of maternity specialists.
As a result, the MFA has developed a plan and submitted a request for an additional €41 million to be allocated to health care in order to reduce queues with specialists and for examinations.
"A question of priorities, whether it will have the means or not", said Chaksha.
However, this amount does not include an increase in remuneration for medical practitioners.
Commenting on the fact that the medics are not enthusiastic about directing all three variants of the healthcare funding model, including one that provides for an additional payment to patients, to the HM for consideration in the government, Chaksha said that directing all three models gives the government the opportunity to choose.
Jansons also added that by directing all three models, it is possible to show clearly that Latvia is not ready to impose an additional burden on the population.
It has already been reported that the MoU will defend the variant of the healthcare financing model, which does not foresee an increase in the overall tax burden, but requires a part of the social tax to be directed towards health, says the conceptual summary of the report "On the change of the financing model of the Latvian health care system".
At the same time, the Ministry indicated that the best variant of the model for financing health care will be chosen as a result of discussions by the end of September.
The local watermelons are ready.
Watermelon has given up this year, admits Rolands Dambis, the landlord of Grobiņa municipality Medze municipality.
Watermelon is already available in the Liepaja market.
Several early varieties have begun to be produced, but the later tubers have gone well, according to the regional newspaper Kursas Laiks.
"This year, watermelons are growing better than last year", says the grower of large berries in Rucava region Artis Ķūsis.
In terms of weather, too, this summer is much more favorable than the previous one, when it was cold and windy.
Liepaja theatre guest performances in Riga begin.
On August 12 and 13, the Liepāja Theatre will visit the Dailes Theatre in Riga, offering to the audience performances nominated for the "Pēlmaņu nakts" award, as well as a bright intrigue - the mono-show by Liepaja theatre director Herberts Laukšteins, the portal "Delfi" informs the theatre representatives.
On the evening of August 12, viewers will be shown the human drama Blueman, produced by director Laura Groza-Kibere.
It is the story of a real historical person - John Merrick - who lived in Victorian-era London and had been nicknamed the Ivory Man because of his crippled, inborn disease's deformed body.
In the studio, the title role is played by actor Egon Dombrovskis, who has received the "Players' Night" nomination for Actor of the Year for his role as Merrick.
As his performance has been described by critic Normund Acott, Merrick is "a "heart-passed" role in which the born image is not repeatable".
On August 13, viewers will be offered a production of "Portraits".
The show has received six "Player Night" nominations, including "The Big Form Performance of the Year".
The director has created the production as a peculiar portrait gallery, giving equal importance to every image of the play, so each of them is both a centre and a background.
The show consists of a series of mini shows, which close together in a unified whole.
It is an observation of human nature, where the main conflict is between true emotions and cold-blooded calculation, brightly revealing how a person changes in different situations - each of the characters is sometimes a wolf who, for the sake of covetousness and his own good, breaks up the surrounding, sometimes a sheep, which is torn apart by someone else.
On both of these dates, Liepaja theatre director Herberts Laukšteins' mono-show "The Man Who Avoids the Lift" will be played in the Small Hall under the direction of Galina Poliščuka.
It's not necessarily a sad, but humorous story about how someone's only friend becomes an elevator.
Despite the cemetery stylistics that dominate the visual image of the performance, the dominant intonation of the production is nevertheless light and even optimistic.
"The man who shuns the elevator" is not about the doom of loneliness and age, but about the fact that life is worth loving.
Even if it seems that there is nothing to do with the performance," written critic Līga Ulberte.
Tickets for all productions can be purchased at the "Biļešu paradīze" box offices and online.
Detective Olga: My work is not a series, but a real life.
I am already halfway through Olga Zelika - owner and investigator of "Riga Detective Agency".
She laughs loudly and leaves a very positive human impression.
Dressed in white pants and white jacket - a very elegant woman who overturns all my notions of what a female detective should be like.
She's waiting for me with champagne, which I'm kind of giving up.
I'm telling you I addressed her because I found it interesting that a woman was doing such an unusual thing.
It's always seemed a man's job.
Olga has a higher law education - a master's degree.
She once worked for the criminal police.
He realized that he wanted something of his own and founded his own company.
That's enough knowledge.
"I really didn't want to go back to the police", Olga says.
It's routine.
There, in the criminal police, we investigated the cases, we gathered the information.
We work with suspects.
"This year we celebrate the 10th anniversary of "Riga Detective Agency"".
She calls for an anniversary celebration: "There will be no drinking."
Everyone's a man of promise.
When asked about her business, Olga says, "Business is very specific."
For the first five years, I had a team.
After that, I realized that teamwork was sometimes dangerous.
It's such a business when, if someone works unprofessionally, one can get into a very bad situation.
If journalists are the fifth power, then we are the second.
The sphere, of course, is not simple.
Many try to set us up because we are dealing with a marriage mate’s fraud.
Let people think so.
Many come and require, or can be imposed eavesdropping machines, to attract dogs.
Many have seen movies.
Detective business is serious.
"It's gathering information," Olga says.
If a crime is committed by law, I must warn of it.
We make green tea and laugh to have at least a mug to stick to and negotiate with.
I've had a client whose husband constantly punched.
She was looking for protection, of course.
We also have security.
Her husband was a maniac.
At first everything is always beautiful and good, but then it starts.
"It's the most terrible thing," Olga says.
The psyche is broken, and it happens that you can be treated like a cattle.
It may end badly.
Don't give God, with suicide.
It's very dangerous.
People become victims at some point.
"Many women try to walk away from their families and then return again", she tells.
I gave up my last order.
"It happened for the first time in my life", reveals Olga.
There was a strange situation.
The woman was married, she had a son.
"Her husband beaten her son and made her disabled", Olga recalls.
I believe that a woman has a mother's instinct, and first of all must protect her children.
When all of this happened, she came to me with a request to get rid of that man.
There are people who are obsessed with revenge.
The most terrible thing is that the mother turned her eyes on it.
I can't understand that.
Her child is now disabled.
We couldn't find a body once, and the dog helped a lot.
The drug department can't do without dogs at all.
"I understand that there are adequate people and there are those who don't have a whole psyche", she says.
Of course, the facts of fraud are current.
Or there is a divorce in the family and information needs to be collected.
The culprit is determined.
The last thing I've ever had about the subject of having other girlfriends tricked.
It's interesting because once men smack, now women.
Even the best friends are fighting!
Women "throw" girlfriends for 100 and more thousands of euros.
Women need to be careful when going abroad because they can be sold into slavery.
"Latvian women are intelligent and trust too much", Olga believes.
There have been cases of couples going abroad to remarry.
It's not legal.
Olga says that she had a husband similar to Jesus Christ.
Long, long hair.
When I was 22, a tragedy happened.
He had a severe head injury.
He came back as a completely different person.
"I pulled him out", Olga remembers.
It can be compared to hell, it was terrible.
When asked what is the most unusual thing that has ever been faced, Olga says, "All are special, but it's the most crazy thing to use trust."
When a girlfriend "throws up" a girlfriend.
He borrows and doesn't give the money back.
If you have a lawyer's education and experience in the police, you can work as a detective.
"One thing is to feel like a detective, the other - to be it", Olga says.
Situations of infidelity are quite crazy, as women are often not ready to solve the situation.
They're not ready to accept the score.
This is an unpredictable situation, for a person is not prepared to lose his family.
Not every woman ready to accept reality.
Often young girls who feel the taste of money use rich married men.
One man who traced his wife said she could not have a lover because all his wives had cheated on her.
"He was married three times", Olga recalls.
Well, I guess that's a man's problem if all the wives cheat on him.
Olga relates the case of a woman leaving a man with all the children, and she asked him if he had ever raised his hand against him.
Actually, I constantly beat him, he answered.
In such cases, I refuse to work.
I find it interesting how things are solved - whether photographs are taken and shown to a spouse if there is evidence of fraud.
How?
"Parallelly for detective work there is protection of personal data", Olga says.
That is a provocative question.
One law allows all things to be done, the other law allows nothing.
For personal interests we may take such photographs and videos, but not for public viewing.
If material is presented in court that does not comply with the law, then there may be major problems.
To become a detective is not enough education and experience, one must also be mentally healthy and meet the criteria.
We don't take fingerprints, the police do.
I'm telling clients, shut off the series, here's real life!
In fact, when I worked in the (police) system, dogs had to be used as well, they helped a lot.
"The drug department can't do without dogs at all", Olga says.
Some clients turn to me in connection with the murder investigation, but I don't like to take on such things.
These are very hard things.
Now there are more and more male clients, because women tend to mock men.
It used to be different.
Now women are having fun, but men are sitting at home with children.
"Of course, decent people suffer the most", that's Olga.
I like Dale Carnegie.
He says stop worrying and start real life.
We all know the saying that if you hit one cheek, you have to turn the other, but you can't!
It has to be said that it's unpleasant to you.
This must not be the case.
There must be no fear of losing what interferes with life!
You must not become a masochist, besides what we allow ourselves to do is happen to us.
Yes, my first case was directly related to her husband's infidelity when a woman was not ready to accept the fact that her husband was cheating on her.
She called all the time and asked her what to do.
"I'm now asking all the customers if they're willing to accept a situation when they find out that the man is really cheating on her", Olga says.
It's not entertainment, it's life.
If you come and hire a detective, you have to take responsibility.
It's not theater, it's show, it's real life.
I'm also a Reiki specialist.
It's a heart thing and related to Japanese medicine - hand treatment.
It's a very interesting thing.
Why have I started doing this?
This is due to a large amount of adrenaline, and you need to calm yourself somehow.
Reiki not only calms down, but restores energy, illuminates.
"People exit my office positively and satisfied", Olga says.
She has reiki signs on the wall in the office, and Olga tells us that she writes them not with the help of a brush, but with her fingers.
I didn't just get to it like that, the book about the Reiki literally fell into my hands.
I felt it as a sign.
However, it is very personal.
Find out more about the Reiki here.
Olga sings, too.
It's her hobbies.
We were all afraid of creativity.
From 11 years on, I played guitar.
I've recorded songs and clips.
I'm positive and smile, but you have to rest in order to rebuild.
Others are saved by alcohol, I'm saved by the Reiki.
Alcohol is sinking.
The police use it a lot because the work is full of stress.
"It causes aggression, and the moves may be unpredictable", she tells.
I'm interested in sports and the Reeks.
For 15 years, I did tennis.
I also enjoyed riding horses.
I'd like to write a book.
The detective's work has a fine limit when the work comes into your life.
"It's a job that shouldn't be allowed into life", she tells.
When asked how work can be combined with private life, Olga says, "My beloved person is in Italy."
We have very strong feelings.
That must be the truest love of my life.
It's enough for me to think about him, and I feel better already.
Detectives usually don't trust, but he's accepted my job.
In fact, I separate work from private life.
I'm not equally caught up in this business.
The Reiki has directed me.
Already when I was a child, I saw more than others.
Thanks to the raids, the intuition opens.
There are many detectives, but few actually working.
In any case, it's working with the brain, and it's hard to shut down.
You also need rest.
"Otherwise you can't rebuild", Olga admits.
The worst case I've ever worked with is the story of Constance.
I've been working on that thing for a year.
The man was literally mocking that woman.
I did so that the baby and Mom left for England - further away from danger.
There were no other options.
We must not feel sorry for ourselves.
We're looking for compassion.
This cannot be done.
You have to be happy about every day we have.
Thank God.
You have to say three good things to someone else every day.
You have to do a good job or devote a day to yourself.
We mustn't babysitter with men like that.
It's a big mistake.
You have to understand we have a man next to us, not a child, and need him to take care of us.
If it's not okay, you have to turn around and leave.
You can go to church, it's helped me a lot.
Don't be a fan, but do what likes and helps.
Nothing will change if there is no change, one has to leave and change one's life.
Under no circumstances should we put ourselves and our children at risk.
Don't sit back and wait for something.
People are designed to do good and to support each other.
If God created us, we are already needed by someone and are not in vain in this world.
Never be allowed to sit on the spot!
How to prepare for a family photo shoot.
The summer is still in full swing, as is immediately the next school year, which families can capture in photo memory.
To make the pictures look happy and beautiful, it is worth considering how to prepare for the photo shoot in advance.
Advice "Ihappymama" is provided by many children's mom Alexandra Nesterenko and professional photographer Marina Levickaya.
You have to take pictures in nature, because it is much more natural and harmonious.
It is much more difficult for children to get involved and relax during their studies.
It is recommended to choose a uniform style of dress for the whole family, preferably in the same range of colors.
For example, Alexandra says that she chooses clothing for all six family members so that the clothes are in no more than three shades of color and as few inscriptions as possible on the clothing.
Don't forget the good mood.
Have fun, joke, play, but do not scream or psyche if the children are not as obedient as they would like.
And here’s the next advice from a professional photographer’s dowry box!
You have to understand exactly what you want to capture during the photo shoot and tell the photographer about it.
For some, they will be beautiful, accurate children and an ideal family picture, for others, "life is what it is like", namely, the desire to see real, true emotions in the pictures, or, as the photographer himself loves to say, "refugees in the backs", "faced with eyes", "torn up the nose".
Of course, it happens that someone wants "two in one" as well, but it rarely happens.
In any case, when you go to a photo shoot, you have to understand that it's just a couple of hours from your life, and the less you'll be stuck, the better.
Be yourself - there's no rigid mom who works, cooks, raises and so on, and not the always busy dad who's constantly talking on the phone.
And neither is the man who lives in you behind some unknown shell.
Be a family, remember how great it is to hug each other, smile at your own and make fun of yourself.
And then the photographer's job will be to capture the real moments of the emotions that prevail between you.
If you have chosen a photographer, trust him.
Stop asking 250 times to show what's happened, listen to his advice on choosing clothing, a place for better shots.
Bend and iron all the clothes in advance, so that the day of the photo shoot no longer needs to be dealt with.
Plan the route and think about how long it will take for you to get to the photo shoot (especially if the photo is in the studio and the time is limited).
If you have young children, choose the time for the photo shoot that corresponds to the day of the offspring so that it does not happen at the time the baby normally sleeps.
And, of course, don't forget to bring food, cookies, water and a favorite toy with your children (to be used only in extreme situations).
While preparing his dad that he may have to take his socks off, she doesn’t usually write about it in such articles, and only the photographers know what the problem is, says Marina.
Don't drink much water before the photo shoot and get a good sleep before.
And it would be advisable to have some entertainment together after the photo shoot.
Go to the amusement park, eat some ice cream, take a ride with roller skates - which the family likes more.
This way you will have at the same time acquired great pictures and pleasant memories of the day you spent together.
Krasnopjorov and Fadejeva: Raising the minimum wage - a miracle boom or a brake for the economy?
The issue of raising the minimum wage in public debate has almost the status of a sacred cow: either promotion should be supported or there should be mentioned some non-spoken, general phrases.
Taking into account the significant increase in the risk of stagnation of the economy (just barely avoided technical recession), we believe it is important to stress that raising the minimum wage is not a miracle that will reduce income inequality with one hint, will bring Latvian wages closer to the level of Western Europe and will fill the state budget.
On the contrary, if the minimum wage is raised too much, it does more harm than good, because it undermines the competitiveness and employment of businesses, especially in low-income sectors and regions.
At first sight, it seems that, despite several increases in the minimum wages in the post-crisis period, the minimum wage in Latvia is not so high that raising by the usual few tens of euros a year would significantly weaken the competitiveness of businesses - only 370 euros, while in some European Union (EU) countries the minimum wage is around one and a half thousand.
However, a different picture can be seen if we compare it with the average wage in the country (%) - the minimum wage in Latvia (44%) exceeds the EU average.
Since Latvia has a significantly higher share of the minimum wage recipients than neighbouring countries (17% in Latvia, 11% in Lithuania, 6% in Estonia[1]), a similar increase in the minimum wage is binding for most companies.
According to the results of the survey of Latvijas Banka companies, one in five Latvian companies replied that, as the minimum wage increased at the beginning of 2014, it was important or very important for it to increase the prices of products.
This means, firstly, that the rise in the minimum wage was partly financed by consumers (i.e. residents of Latvia); secondly, the increase in prices for several companies meant a loss of competitiveness both in the domestic market and abroad (i.e., increased imports and limited exports).
Due to weaker competitiveness and shrinking production volumes, it was important for almost one in fifteen Latvian companies to lay off employees (which means more unemployment and emigration).
In addition, almost one in eleven companies responded that it was important for him to limit the recruitment of new employees as a result of raising the minimum wage.
It is worth remembering that in 2011 - 2013 the minimum wage in Latvia did not change.
Therefore, even if one in five companies considered the improvement of productivity to be important when assessing the 2014 minimum wage increase, this does not mean that a similar result could be expected in 2017 (the fourth consecutive increase of the minimum wage could exhaust the possibilities of increasing productivity).
Another important result is that, due to the rise in the minimum wage, it was also important for several companies to increase the remuneration of employees earning more than the minimum wage.
Thus, the impact of the minimum wage was significant even for companies where none of the employees received the minimum wage.
In recent years, the rise in the minimum wage in all three Baltic States exceeded the increase in nominal labour productivity (real labour productivity + inflation).
Thus, a further increase in the minimum wage, despite the overall rather low level in euro, will have a negative impact on the competitiveness and employment of enterprises.
When assessing the validity of raising the minimum wage, an analysis of the economic average is not enough.
It is also necessary to assess whether raising minimum wages is "surmountable" in sectors and regions where minimum wages are most commonly used.
The results of the Bank of Latvia survey show that the greatest concentration of employees with minimum wages is in small enterprises (the number of employees is from 10 to 19 employees; 25%).
At the end of 2013, the share of employees in the industrial and service sectors with minimum wages was higher (respectively 16% and 19%) than in trade (15%), construction (11%) and financial and insurance (2%).
On the other hand, for Latgale, where the minimum wage is 64% of the average wage (and more than two thirds of the average wage in the private sector), its further rise may be more detrimental by reducing labour demand (i.e., maintaining already high unemployment) and contributing to the sustainability of the shadow economy.
Some signs indicate that the substantial rises in the minimum wage (by 27% in total) implemented in 2014 - 2015 have slowed the development of Latgale.
For example, Latgale is the only region of Latvia where unemployment was higher in 2015 than in 2013.
It should be noted that Estonia and Lithuania do not have any regions that fall so far behind in terms of average wages from the rest of the country.
In Estonia, for example, the average wage in all regions is at least twice the national minimum wage.
Lithuania has the lowest wages in the Tauraģe region, but there too the minimum wage in 2015 was 54% of the average wage (after two rapid minimum wage increases in 2016 this indicator could reach 58%).
The public debate has occasionally called for the minimum wage to be raised to 68% of the average wage in the country (see, for example, here) lacks economic justification and cannot be achieved in the short or long term.
Firstly, such a high figure of the average wage, or even as close to it, is not present in any EU country.
Secondly, it would mean raising the minimum wage above the average wage in several branches of the economy (which would mean bankruptcy and mass redundancies of companies in these branches), for example, in the production of clothing, leather products, fish processing, catering services, as well as veterinary services; moreover, it is more than the current average wage in the private sector of Latgale.
Raising the minimum wage from January 2017 to 400-410 euros per month, as currently offered by the Ministry of Welfare, would make the minimum wage in Latvia (% of the average wage) one of the highest in the EU.
If nominal productivity increases by 4% and the minimum wage is at least twice as fast, this has clearly negative consequences for business competitiveness and employment.
Such negative consequences will be most prevalent in those sectors and regions where the current minimum wage level is often used, for example, in Latgale.
The fact that a significant increase in the minimum wage is currently unaffordable means that other mechanisms must be applied to support low wage earners.
An immediate effect can be achieved by travelling with a tax-exempt minimum (within the limits of the budget) of personal income tax.
Insufficient levels of education, inadequate education and poor quality of education, and poor health (which often occurs without recourse to a doctor due to the cost of medical services and long queues) are among the real causes of income inequality.
During the survey 521 responses were obtained from the Latvian company regarding the response to the rise in the minimum wage in January 2014.
The survey was conducted as part of the Wage Dynamics Network (WDN) project.
These figures represent companies with a number of employees of not less than 10.
This also explains the low proportion of workers with minimum wages in construction.
11 fires were registered in Latvia last day, according to operational information of the State Fire and Rescue Service (VUGD).
In terms of value, the biggest fires occurred in Ogre municipality, Ogresgala municipality, where 80 square meters of unmanaged residential house burned and Railwaymalas street in Jēkabpils, where an open flame burned with shavings filled shed in 30 square meters.
On Thursday, firefighters also went on calls burning garbage, tires, two passenger cars, a building wall and ceiling, barns, a house roof, and unattended burned food.
The service has also participated in 21 rescue efforts during the day.
No casualties, casualties or rescued people are reported.
In total, over the course of the past day, VUGD responded to 38 calls, six of which were misleading.

The Vice Prime Minister of Russia meets secretly with ZZS ministers in Riga.
Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev Arkadijs Dvorkovičs met three ZZS politicians at the fish processing factory "Kaija" last week - Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola, Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis and Minister of Agriculture Jānis Dūklavs, Friday writes portal "skates.lv".
According to the portal, none of the parties involved had informed about such a meeting, but the fact that the meeting had taken place was confirmed by Reizniece-Ozola, who was responsible for organising secret negotiations to Dūklava.
In his turn, the Minister explained that the organizer was Alexander Vesnyakov, the Russian ambassador.
The Minister of Finance has revealed that negotiations have been held on the possibility of lifting sanctions on fish processors, as well as whether Russia will continue to "bush" gas into Inčukalns gas storage.
Dvorkovic has explained that it is not a matter of government, but of an energy company.
Contrary to diplomatic practice, the Foreign Ministry has not been involved in the conversation.
Dūklāvs has justified this because he has not seen such a need, because "it is a foreign minister on vacation", says the portal.

Legendary editor Hafington leaves The Huffington Post.
Arianna Hafington, co-founder and editor-in-chief of the influential U.S. media holding The Huffington Post, has announced his departure from the company after 11 years of work.
Established in 2005, and awarded with the Pulitzer Prize, The Huffington Post, which offers both serious political and economic journalism on a daily basis and provides entertainment coverage of internet sensations, is considered to be a pioneer in media development at a time when digital technology solutions have rapidly evolved.
The media, starting in 2005, offered innovative and interactive content solutions for their time under conditions when Twitter did not yet exist, but Feisbuck only gained popularity among students at state colleges.
Shortly after the re-election of Republican Party spokesman George Bush as President of the United States, Hafington did not hide that media journalists represented liberal values, and will also produce news material with such a world view.
Now Hafington has revealed on Twitter that she is going to start a new business after she leaves - she plans to set up a startup app called "Thlive Global", which would deal with workers' health and congestion.
It is not yet known who could take her place under The Huffington Post.
During her run, the portal declined the anonymous comments, with Hafington stressing that freedom of speech is granted to people who stand for what they say and who do not hide behind anonymity.
Also under her leadership, the decision was made in the summer of 2015 to post news of U.S. presidential nominee Donald Trump in the entertainment news section.
The court, however, in late 2015, stating that Trump's rhetoric was dangerous to the U.S. public, news of the odious candidate was again published in the policy section.
Reportedly, in 2011, U.S. Internet Media Group AOL decided to purchase the fast-growing news website "The Huffington Post", which was visited by nearly 25 million readers each month at the time of the deal.
The deal totaled $315 million.
In 2015, the telecommunications giant "Verizon" purchased AOL for $4.4 billion.
Also, "Verizon" bought over parts of the internet business of "Yahoo" in 2016.
With these deals, The Huffington Post, a once influential and independent medium, became a small piece of a giant corporation.
Currently, the content of the famous label's medium is available in nine international versions, with a total of 81 million unique monthly visits.
Four people have been killed in the blasts in Thailand.
There have been nine explosions in the Thai resort town of Huahin and the country's southern provinces in the last 24 hours, killing at least four people and several dozen injured, authorities stated on Friday.
In southern Thailand, there were two explosions in Surātthānī Province on Friday at around eight o'clock local time.
One bomb exploded in a flowerpot in front of a naval police building, killing a municipal worker and injuring a man, stated Vongsiri Promchan, governor of the province in Surātthāni.
"I think this is due to the explosions in Huahin", said the governor.
A second explosion occurred in front of the provincial police station.
There were also two explosions in southern Thailand on Friday morning on the tourist-favorite island of Phuketa.
On Friday morning, two bombs exploded at the bell tower in Huachin, killing one and injuring three people.
It has already been reported that two explosions hit the resort town of Huahina on Thursday night shortly before midnight, killing one woman and injuring another 19 people, including foreigners.
The woman killed in Huahin on Thursday was Thai.
Of the 19 wounded, three were in serious condition, and seven of those wounded were foreigners - four women and three men.
The bombs in Huachin were hidden in two flowerpots, located 50 meters apart.
The blasts were detonated by mobile phones half an hour apart.
Before that, on Thursday, one person died in an explosion that occurred in Trana Province in southern Thailand.
Policemen rescue the infant from overheating in the car; parents for knocking out glass threaten court actions.
In Riga yesterday municipal policemen rescued the infant from a hot car, while the child's parents threatened police officers with court proceedings about the broken glass of the car, the agency LETA informed the Riga Municipal Police (RPP).
Yesterday, an upset man ran up to the patrol, who told him that he noticed a car in the shopping centre's Spice parking lot, where an infant is present for half an hour without the presence of adults.
When arriving at the scene, an eyewitness's designated car was looked up, which was parked in the sun.
The front passenger seat had a child seat containing the infant.
It was the rays of the sun that shone on the child.
The infant shouted loudly, breathed intensely, and his face was reddened and sweaty.
Given that the owner of the vehicle was not on site, an immediate decision has been made to knock out the rear glass of the car in order not to endanger the health and life of the infant.
The child with the entire seat highlighted from the hot vehicle, and called medics.
The child breathed shallow, the skin was reddened and hot, so by the time medical doctors arrived, the caretakers put a cool compression on their forehead.
Medical and child's parents arrived almost simultaneously at the scene.
The infant's father, upon seeing the broken window for his vehicle, remained aggressive and the medics were not allowed to the child.
Discussions with parents and it is explained that children under the age of seven are forbidden to leave one unattended.
In addition, the child was left behind in life - threatening conditions.
After the discussion, medical doctors looked at the victim and found that there was no need for hospitalization.
The child’s parents, on the other hand, categorically refused to give any explanation about what had happened and threatened court proceedings about the broken glass of the car.
During the discussions with their parents, there was no evidence that they were under the influence of alcohol or could harm their child in any other way, so the baby, less than four months old, was taken into the care of the two.
Case materials have been sent to the Division for Prevention of Offences in Children, whose employees will assess parental responsibility.
The RMP reminds us that even if the outside is not very hot, a car left in the sun heats up very quickly.
If a child or a pet is left in such a car, it can endanger their lives.
LPF members could request the suspension of Poni.
The members of the Latvian Swimming Federation (LPF) could in the near future request that its current leader Kaspars Poni be removed from the office of the president of the federation, the former vice-president of the federation Jānis Dzenis told LETA.
Dzienis said that, in the face of criticism of Poni and his activities in the Federation in recent days, several members of the LPF have signed a letter asking for the convening of the LPF general meeting, which is the highest body of the federation, and it is entitled to decide any question raised at the LPF general meeting.
The members of the Federation are not satisfied with Pone's leadership style, moreover, his departure to the Rio Olympics, which in turn did not have the opportunity to go to the Latvian record at the Olympics, corrected by swimmer Alona Ribakova's coach Germans Jakubovskis, is regarded as unethical and unworthy of the President's actions.
Dzenis pointed out that LPF members, as well as the general secretary of the federation Aivars Platonovs, had done a lot of work for the development of the federation and the sport, however, Pone's contribution to the federation is not very welcome.
Dziens, who worked for a long time in the Federation, explained that the Federation had a noticeable attempt to concentrate power in the hands of one person.
Consequently, the members of the federation could also request that the statutes governing LPF's activities be amended, which would exclude this possibility in the future.
Dzienis explained that dissatisfaction with Pone's work had existed in the Federation for a long time, however the events of the last days were said to have served as members of the "last palace" federation to make the decision that action should be taken.
The former vice president of the federation expressed that during Pone's run, the work of the board of coaches and judges was greatly diminished.
Dzienis explained that, in order to ensure a faster process of progress and decision-making in the Federation, LPF members had decided at a general meeting to allow a board composed of Pone and two vice presidents to lead the federation.
However, as Dzenis admitted, Pone deceived members of the federation.
Federation members trusted Ponem, believing that this would allow the Federation to make faster decisions.
"He let down the trust of the members, because he practically took power in his hands, taking an unethical step", Dzenis pointed out.
"This attitude cannot be from a person who should serve as an example for other sports representatives", Dzenis admitted.
In the drive's view, Pone has tried to satisfy his ambitions as president, which in turn also does not honor him as president of the LPF.
The long-term secretary-general of the LPF, Vladimir Maslovskis, told LETA that a letter to the federation could be submitted next week, so the general meeting of the LPF should meet within a month.
In his view, the general meeting should "speak out all the painful issues" and decide on the way forward.
Pone had not yet been informed on Friday that LPF members were planning to convene a general meeting where his suspension could be decided.
I don't know anything about convening such a meeting for the time being, so I don't have any comments.
As for the fact that the members are dissatisfied with my work, there has been only one case so far, with the already mentioned coach Yakubovski, when some dissatisfaction has been expressed.
Before the London Olympic Games, when Ribakova was not approved among the participants, he complained to the International Water Sports Federation (FINA) and invited Latvia not to send any athletes.
"After this incident, Jakubowski lost the senior coaching position of the team because his actions were not in line with the interests of the LPF either", said Pone.
He also stressed that the general meetings of the members of the LPF, in which he had reported on the work done, had not received any rebuke so far.
"On the contrary, we have received recognition that the quality of the federation's work has improved", said the president of the LPF.
Pone also explained that he did not go to the Rio Olympics to have fun, but to work.
For the wider part of Latvia, it is not clear and they do not understand what the functions of the presidents of the federations are.
People do not understand that we are volunteers in these positions, and, unlike the leaders of the Latvian Olympic Committee (LOK), for example, we do not receive salaries.
At the same time, we must ensure that the sport federation has enough funding, as only 10% of the required amount is received from the state LPF.
During the Olympic Games, I have had formal and informal meetings with representatives of the international federation and various international programmes, including international sponsors.
"Likely, talks have been entered and I have been working to ensure that one of the World Cup stages will take place in Riga in 2018," said Pone.
According to the data of the portal Firmas.lv, in 2015 LPF revenues totalled 249 444 euros, which is almost 36 000 euros more than in 2014.
About 40% of this amount last year was made up of targeted grants, the amount of which increased by approximately 10 000 euros compared to 2014.
Similarly, in the form of members, accessions and other annual contributions, LPF received approximately 43% more revenue or 109 442.
Last year, the Federation received another 35 532 euros in the form of donations and gifts.
Last year, the Federation's expenditure increased by around 70,000 euros compared to 2014, spending a total of 263,876 euros in 2015.
The largest expenses were not related to cash payments to individuals, material expenses or salaries - 215 733 euros are indicated in the report as "other expenses".
In cash payments, 20 549 euros have been spent on individuals, while 14 684 euros have been paid in salaries.
If the 2014 federation had concluded with a positive balance sheet, then the 2015 LPF concluded with a negative balance sheet.
As reported, the Ministry of Education and Science requested clarification to the Latvian Olympic Committee (LOK) about the participation of LPF President Pone in the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, which in turn was not visited by the coach of Latvian swimmer Ribakov.
Latvian nationals have not been affected by the bombings in Thailand, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) entry on the social site Twitter.
According to the Ministry, according to the information available to the honorary consul of Latvia in Thailand, Latvian nationals have not been harmed by the explosions.
LETA already reported that the MFA invites travellers to regularly monitor information on the development of the political and security situation in the country, as well as to verify the security of the place of stay, pointing out that there is a high threat of terrorism in the country.
Latvia's MFA calls for people to avoid meeting places, be particularly careful and watchful when staying in public places, and follow the instructions of local authorities.
Travellers who are in Thailand's resorts or plan to go there are invited by the Ministry to contact tour operators or airlines, specifying whether the journey will be carried out as planned.
The Ministry also invites travellers to regularly monitor information on the development of the political and security situation in the country, as well as to verify the security of the place of stay.
There is a high threat of terrorism in the country.
In view of the unstable security situation in the country, the JAS does not recommend going to the Thai and Cambodian border, as well as to the provinces in the border area between Thailand and Malaysia - Patani, Jala, Narāthivāta and Sonkhla.
In an emergency, the Ministry invites to contact the consular officer of the 24-hour department immediately by phone +371 26 33 77 11 or by e-mail palidziba@mfa.gov.lv.
The MFA also strongly recommends that anyone travelling abroad buy a life and health insurance policy, which also provides for repatriation in the event of illness or death, as well as register with the Consular Register, before travelling.
Messi, however, will not leave the Argentine football team.
Football superstar Lionel Messi, however, decided to return to the Argentine national unit after a short moment of reflection, announced on Friday by the player himself.
In July, the Argentine team failed in the finals of the Copa America tournament for the second year in a row, with the decisive match repeatedly recognising Chile's superiority.
Immediately after the loss, Messi announced that he was finishing his career in the national unit, but it was then reported that he could return to the sample.
"I was considering quitting the selection, but my love for Argentina and the selection is too great", Messi, aged 29, stated.
Spanish granda Barcelona striker Messi's national team ranks a total of 55 goals in 112 games, which is the best ever score.
Along with the adult team, Messi has not had much success, although still in 2014, Argentina became the world's vice-champion.
Messi is named the world's best footballer five times.
For Chinese Dzeņa and Dzeliņš the double win in the 20 km walking distance of Rio.
Chinese marchers Van Dzen and Cai Dzelin won a double win in the 20 kilometre march of the Rio Olympics on Friday.
Dzen, who made the distance in an hour in 19 minutes and four seconds, finished 12 seconds ahead of Dzelin, was crowned Olympic champion.
On the other hand, Australian walker Dane Baird-Smith, who lost 23 seconds to Poetry, won the bronze.
Household favourite Kai Bonfim corrected the Brazilian record, but he missed five seconds to climb on the podium.
Poison won a bronze award four years ago in London.
Also for him at the same distance two silver medals at the world championships.
Judo coach Baskin: Nikiforenko is not the real heavyweight.
Latvian Judist coach Oleg Baskin acknowledged in good faith that Artūrs Nikiforenko had hardly any chance to beat the much heavier Azerbaijani athlete Ushangi Kukauri at the Rio Olympics.
Practically there was no chance, only minimal, if he had managed to catch him on some technique or parterre.
We had already expected it to be.
Prepared he was right, likewise fought correctly, but the opponent was stronger.
The opponent was said to be well known, as Nikiforenko had already fought against him twice and both Arthur lost.
He's heavier, though.
Arthur has been artificially relegated to the heaviest weight category to enter the Olympic team.
The weight category of up to 100 kilograms was already occupied, so Arthur used the European quota in the heavy weight category.
Arthur, with a weight of 100 kilograms, fought against a Judist who is 140 kilograms and who has won serious tournaments a couple of times.
There are very few random moments in the heavy weight category at all.
If there are all kinds of turns in the light weight categories, then the heavy ones are very rare.
When asked if it would be better for Nikkiforenko to fight one degree in a lighter weight category in the future, Baskin answered affirmatively.
I think yes - Arthur would be better off fighting in the category of up to 100 kilograms.
It's his real weight category.
He's not the real heavyweight.
65% of Venezuelans want to suspend Maduro, the question is whether they are willing to fight for it.
Two of the three Venezuelans want to suspend President Nicholas Maduro, but the question is whether they are willing to fight for it.
The day after the National Board of Elections announced that there was "no time" for the recall of the vote held this year, with which Chavismo will be in power until 2019, - people on the streets of Caracas continued their usual daytime runs as if nothing had happened.
"I didn't hear the news because I was watching the Olympics and how Michael Phelps won two more medals," said Rafael Deian, a 36-year-old office worker who was resting in Altamira Square on Wednesday.
Altamira Square, located in eastern Caracas, was the epicenter of sharp riots in early 2014 protesting against the Maduro regime.
However, now that the opposition has to put more pressure on it than ever before to bring about a referendum this year, people across the country are no longer showing such energy.
"I want a referendum, but I'm not going to take part in the protests for security reasons," Deian said.
Others, more informed, want to mobilize in the future, yet admit that Venezuelans are less motivated.
Tibisei Lusen, chairman of the election board, comments on the claim that the government is delaying the recall process.
I will protest whenever the opposition calls for a protest, yet I know some of my friends are scared," Roberto Reijes, (60), said Fox News Latino.
So, in addition to all the barriers that the government has built to obstruct the referendum, the opposition is now facing a new challenge: to motivate people to take to the streets and protest.
Until recently, there was broad support for the referendum initiative: during the process of collecting signatures, people arrived in unprecedented numbers.
However, when it comes to protesting against government moves to block efforts, the number arrived at the rallies is noticeably lower.
"Some people focus on building food queues, while others are afraid of many after 2014 arrests and deaths," said Cipriano Eredia, the opposition's representative legislator.
After Lusen announced that until the next step of the referendum process - the collection of an even greater number of signatures across the country - will have to wait until October, those who are against the socialist government argue that President Maduro and his followers are simply trying to take away the courage of Venezuelans, making them believe that the vote is virtually impossible this year.
According to the Constitution, if a referendum were held in 2017, Maduro could be suspended, but he would be allowed to name the next president.
If he was suspended today, he is obliged to announce a general election.
The U.S. State Department addressed the issue in a Thursday afternoon statement calling on Venezuelan authorities to guarantee respect for Venezuelan constitutional rights.
"The other steps towards the implementation of the presidential abolition referendum must be taken clearly, concretely and immediately, thus contributing to a rapid and effective resolution of the country's current political, economic and social difficulties," it stated.
Luis Salamanca, a policy analyst who was a member of the electoral board between 2006 and 2009 that changes are not expected so soon.
"I think there will be no referendum this year unless social unrest and protests become even stronger," he said to the FNL.
He said that Lusen and the government were breaking the law, but they would achieve their goal as a result if people did not protest loudly.
The opposition called for a broad manifestation in September. First in Caracas, to demand that the process be accelerated so that the recall can take place this year.
We want people from all over the country to mobilise in the capital this day.
The government will feel the pressure," said Eredia.
Salamanca, on the other hand, believes that it is not possible to wait so long in this situation.
"They should respond to Lusen's statement faster and stronger as it practically kills the referendum," said expert FNL.
Congressman Eredia admitted that some opposition parties want to get the manifestation to happen faster, while other groups want more time to organize.
The opposition now needs to be cautious.
If people feel insecure in this situation, there is a risk of low turnout in the second campaign for collecting signatures," Salamanca said.
The referendum process, if it is to be activated, must receive support from twenty percent of the country's electorate, which is almost 4 million people.
Salamanca and other analysts are convinced that even if the recall takes place in 2017, Chavismo will be saddened.
However, some people are less optimistic.
Our party wants political change today.
"If the government closes the road to the election, we will have to explore other legal options," Eredia said to FNL.
The director of LNSC, A.Pukīte, is temporarily suspended.
At the extraordinary meeting of Lielvārde County Council on 12 August, the majority of members supported the suspension of the director of Lielvārde County Sports Centre (LNSC) Ainara Puķītis from his duties for the duration of the service inspection.
In the near future it is planned to find out the conditions that a visitor to the gym has written about in his application to the municipality.
Namely, during a gym visit, a LNSC client suffered a head injury.
Vaint is Lielvārde County Sports Centre.
Taking into account the seriousness of the situation and the possible recourse of the client to the court, a commission has been established by order of Vita Volonte, the vice-chairman of Lielvārde District Council.
Its task is to carry out an inspection of the service at the Sports Centre and to give an opinion by 16 August of this year.
An extraordinary meeting of the council is scheduled to be reconvened next Tuesday to decide on further action.
It should be noted that at the time of the specific accident A.Pukītis was on vacation.
The acting director of the sports centre from Friday to the probationary period of the service is the deputy director in the training work Oksana Grimaluka-Nazarov.
For Ogre seniors, sport is a celebration.
Today, the Sports Festival of the Ogre Pensioners Society took place at the Sports Centre Stadium of Ogre County.
Sanita Tauriņa, the work organizer of the Ogre County Sports Centre Sports Development, welcomed seniors in the stadium, who had prepared a special programme for participants of the Sports Festival.
Individual results will not be evaluated this time, but participants of sports festivals will be divided into four teams.
"The contributions of each participant will be summed up as a result of the team", explains S.Tauriņa.
Participants will have to perform four tasks - basketball speedball, construction of Eiffel Tower together with memory game, floorball dexterity relay, summer skiing.
In order to successfully start all four disciplines of the festival programme, participants had to perform warm-up tasks - "Vienibas aplis", "Riņķa dancis", "Izplētnis", as well as three relays - horse riding, frisby and badminton elements.
All tasks were prepared in attractive form, and participants of the sports festival performed them with joy, smile and fun comments, supporting each other.
Summer skiing, which took place in the costumes prepared by the organizers, was especially exciting.
The competition was followed closely by volunteers of Ogre County Sports Centre, who led the tasks, recorded results and did not forbid advice.
The Ogre symbol Chiekur was also present everywhere, who inspired the participants of the Sports Festival.
Ogre seniors proved themselves to be neat enough, attractive and in good athletic form.
Within one minute, Peteris Zeps, a representative of the Green Team, threw the ball into the basketball basket eight times; only one successful shot was behind his teammate Jānis Staudzs.
In Ogre, pensioners are active.
The tours are always full of buses, about 300 people arrive at the parties.
"Twice a week we meet at the Family Support Centre, where we can play novus, table tennis, use gyms", says Jānis Staudzs, Chairman of the Ogre Pensioners Society.
At the conclusion of the sports festival all participants received gratitude for their participation, but the greatest benefit is movement in the fresh air, good mood and time spent together.
2016/2017 Premier League scheduled No.19 West Bromwich Albion
Guardian journalists predict position 14 (Attention: it's not just Alan Smith's prediction, but our journalistic advice in general)
Last season's 14th position
Chance to win the league (with Oddschecker) 1000-1
Until last week, it looked like a new season case, such as the old Bromwich Albion: The 2016/2017 season will again be a struggle for satisfaction or stagnation, depending on how "empty a glass is" under the even more pragmatic Tony Pulis.
However, Jeremy Pies then sold 88% of his club stock to Guochuan Lai and Pulis, in archetypically secure hands, which the bookmakers immediately made a favorite in the unpleasant role of the first sacked manager.
The situation has undeniably changed in Balack Country - and not only the Hawthorns, but also a few miles to the north-west in Wolverhampton, where the new Chinese owners, without wasting time unnecessarily, gave up Kenny Jacquet's services.
Pulis, however, confirmed that his work was not immediately threatened, and the businessman has also expressed his desire not to change the club's culture.
"I don't want to change the club's virtues or start unsustainable fun," he said, taking over duties.
I want to be a good owner and invest in this club in the long run.
First of all, our aim is to ensure that we stay in the Premier League and then get even further, I would like to see the club established at the top of the division.
I think it's the best league in the world, and I want to take this club as far as I can.
These are the achievements of Pulis, the first aspect should not be difficult.
The next goal is to break to the top of the table, but it will be important for the new owner and the increasingly divided fan base to hope for a quick breakthrough in the table up to realize that this is an extremely difficult task given the thorough work recently invested by other teams in the middle of the table.
To get beyond last season's 14th place to get up will certainly have to work more.
Only Aston Villa, located at the bottom of the table, hit less goals, and it is worth recalling that on Christmas Day Albion averaged less than one kick through goal in 90 minutes, almost or the division's worst score.
They failed to score a goal in 13 of 38 games, and kick more than one goal in just nine games.
Of their 10 wins, no games failed to score more than one goal, and seven games ended in 1-0.
As expected, a dozen of a total of 34 goals were scored from standard positions.
No wonder the Hawthorns team was in dissatisfaction, perhaps most noticeably after the shocking 0-0 draw with Villa at the end of January, when the guest team looked better.
On the other hand, only the top six teams had better scores in defence - although no club has managed to list four centre midfielders.
These guards are often undervalued, especially Johnny Evans, whom they want to be Arsenal in view of their recent crisis in terms of injured players.
The Northern Ireland international team had a great start at the European Championships, and Albion will have to spend a lot to sell.
Ben Foster is reliable in the gate, and they are well-equipped in the middle line.
Darren Fletcher, largely similar to Evans, demonstrated largely that he was still able to play at a high level at the age of 32, and Claudio Jacob is underrated.
It is bothering to all sides that the long and curved story of Saido Berahino's future is still unclear.
Pies being in the owner's round stakes from Stoke and Crystal Palace were refused, but they still remain calm and Mark Hughes is ready to wait.
After the last season, being close to liquidation, it is worth all the parties involved to act.
The attacker is, of course, talented, but as Pulis has already mentioned it several times, while pulling him here on one side, here on the other side, it has been seen for a long time that such a relationship has not worked.
Albion insists on signing the papers for the change before allowing a former member of the England U-21 team to go, but their £15 million move with Diafre Saho broke up a few days before taking over, with the club claiming that he passed a medical check-up and had agreed on everything, but he had a back injury, which would mean he would have to skip the start of the season.
This puts great pressure on Venezuelan Salomon Rondon, who looked very hopeful for a moment last season, but has to improve his nine goal performance, especially if Ricky Lambert continues to be so ineffective.
The decision to release Victor Aniceb and Stephen Cesegnon in retrospect also looks strange.
Pulis is notorious throughout his career for his slow promotion of young players up and three teens - the appearances of Jonathan Lecco, Sam Field and Tyler Roberts in the last game of the previous season with a 1-1 draw with Liverpool, will hardly become the norm.
He will return to those already tried and tested, yet it is worth keeping an eye on Lecco.
The 17-year-old attacking midfielder participated in a total of five games the previous season, becoming the first player born in 1999 in the Premier League, who is also highly regarded in the English youth football system.
Matt Phillips, with a 5.5 million contract with Queens Park Rangers, will be quick, but he is the only young player to participate in the first weekend of the competition.
It would not have been boldly said if the end could be quite hurried.
"Everything," Puliss said last month to Express and Star about what should be improved.
Every position you see.
We need to strengthen the back players, the midfield players, and those in the front positions.
The goals are, we know what we want.
It turns out to be much harder than expected to get them, mainly because of the uncertainty about the takeover process.
The season could be determined by how they have started, with seven largely winning games before the difficult race with Tottenham, Liverpool, Manchester City and Leicester from mid-October.
For that time, the pressure on Pulisa will have become less or unbearable.
And who knows, maybe even Berahino will have found a new club.
Tata Steel UK closer to the rescue deal after authorised aid changes in pensions
Pension trustees behind Tata Steel UK said that the scheme could be restructured without involvement in the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), increasing the company's chances of a bailout.
The British steel sector pension scheme has a £15 billion liability and an estimated deficit of at least £700 million, creating serious impediments to the conclusion of a rescue deal between Tata Steel UK and Port Talbot Steelworks in Wales.
Tata Steel is increasingly convinced of securing the future of the British business, which employs 11,000 people, after negotiations with the Minister for Economic Affairs and the pension regulator.
The company plans to merge its European activities, including British business with ThyssenKrupp, a German conglomerate.
However, the conclusion of the deal depends on whether the British steel pension scheme will be restructured and the government will provide financial support.
Alan Johnson, the chairman of the pension trustee, said that this scheme could avoid PPF if the benefits received by the employees were modified.
Although this is well-funded compared to other schemes, with a deficit narrowed to £300 million for individual measures, Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp wants to control their liabilities.
Johnston said that the trustees admit that it is "not realistic" for the joint venture or any buyer of Tata Steel Uk to take responsibility for financing the current and future deficits.
The modification of the benefits from the scheme was a much more binding option than joining the PPF, he added, where employees should accept less favourable conditions.
Tata Steel sources warn that it could still sell Port Talbot.
The company has consistently refused to guarantee the future of the steelworks since the start of negotiations on the future of its British business in March, and it has been used as a trump card in negotiations with the British government.
Kushik Chatterier, CEO of Tata Steel Europe, said that the Indian conglomerate wanted to make its steel business "more sustainable".
Speaking at the annual meeting of Tata Steel in India, Chatterier said that negotiations on the restructuring of pension schemes were moving forward, however, he insisted that the scheme was well funded.
"We are talking to a variety of stakeholders, including the British government and other stakeholders such as the Welsh government, etc.," said Chatterier, reports the Times of India.
There is a belief that pensions have some impact on the business of goods such as steel, so we have to find a structural solution that does not prevent the business from moving forward.
The willingness of the pension trustees to cooperate in the negotiations on the restructuring of the scheme will be supported by Tata Steel.
Potential changes to the scheme include shifting how the annual inflation-based benefit increases are measured from the retail price index to the lowest consumer price index, as well as limiting future pension payments to the statutory minimum.
Johnston added, "The authorised and its advisors have provided Tata Steel, the government and the pension regulator with evidence of the scheme's ability to pay the modified benefits for an indefinite period and with a low degree of risk outside the Pension Protection Fund.
Our investment strategy has meant that the financing position of the scheme has not been affected by the recent decline in the stock market in the same way as in other British pension schemes. We remain convinced of the scheme's ability to provide benefits at a self-sufficient level.
CBS commentator confuses Michael Phelps and Ryan Lochte throughout the race
A commentator for the Canadian broadcaster CBC Olympics on Thursday night caused anger by mixing Michael Phelps with his rival Ryan Lochte.
Elliott Friedman confused the two over the entire 200 m individual swim, won by Phelps, winning his 22nd Olympic Gold Medal.
When Phelps crossed the line, Friedman held him as Lochte, a Phelps compatriot and an old rival world swimmer at the top of the chart.
Friedman exclaimed, "In the end, he'll do it!"
Ryan Lochte will beat Michael Phelps in this race!
Phelps might not even get on the podium.
However, Phelps won, while Lochte finished fourth.
Immediately after Phelps got to the gold, the CBS broadcast entered silence.
Friedman miraculously acknowledged his mistake.
I'm sorry, I mixed the tracks.
Phelps with gold," he said.
A Canadian commentator, whose professionalism on a wide scale was welcomed after the error, acknowledged his mistake once again within hours of the event and apologized to viewers on Twitter.
I'm sorry.
I was surprised.
"No excuses," he wrote.
In the meantime, Phelps surpassed a record of 2 168 years old as the winner of the largest Olympic wins ever.
The previous record belonged to Leonidas from Rhodes, who is said to have won more Olympic titles than anyone at the ancient Olympics.
Russian hackers have attacked the computer of a former NATO force commander.
The hackers have made public General Philip Briedlow's lists and data on the work of one of Soros' foundations.
The same hackers, who might have carried out an attack on U.S. Democrat Party emails some time ago and made public its lists, could also be to blame for a new series of attacks, reports Agent Bloomberg.
According to its information, these cyber attackers attacked the correspondence of former NATO European Force Commander General Philippe Briedlow and the services of the Open Society Institute, which is part of the projects supported by millionaire George Soros.
The attackers have published the information obtained on the link DCleaks.com.
Briedlow's correspondence and data on the activities of the "Open Society" Institute are posted there.
Hackers are reported to have had access to the Foundation's computers for about a year.
The news agency claims that it is about the same hackers who carried out the attack on the computers of the U.S. Democrat Party and who are run by the Russian Special Service.
U.S. intelligence has warned Congressional dignitaries a year ago of a possible hacking attack on the Democrat Party.
The news agency Reuters says that it has information that the special services told a number of politicians back then - cyber attacks are coordinated by two Russian intelligence services or their controlled organizations.
Congressmen, however, have not been able to pass this information on to the victims of cyber attacks because it has been secret.
The scandal over the attacks on the computers of the Democrat Party began after about 20,000 e-mails written by the party during the US presidential pre-election campaign were published on the Internet.
Party candidate Hillary Clinton stated that these letters were leaked by Russian special services.
Russian Presidential Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov has stated that Russia has nothing to do with cyber-terrorists.

Parking in the happiest place on Earth will be even easier in the future.
Disneyland has released information on its long planned parking structure, consisting of a transport hub and a new pedestrian bridge on the east side of the amusement park.
The project, located east of the amusement park near 5 Freeway, includes a parking structure of 6,800 places and a transportation hub where buses, en-route buses, taxis and other vehicles can skip park visitors.
A pedestrian bridge over the harbour boulevard connects the recreation park with the parking structure and transport hub.
This structure, along with the planned Star Wars land 14-acre expansion project, is part of the US$1 billion investment promised to the city of Anaheim in exchange for a 30-year entertainment object tax exemption.
Construction of the project, which synchronizes with the East Gate, will be started next year.
The parking structure will be created over the parking lot of Disney's hero Publa, which has approximately 1,300 seats.
The transport hub will replace the commercial property purchased by the amusement park in 2014.
The project is expected to open in 2018.
"The East Gate is part of our substantial investment in the city of Anaheim, which will provide additional parking spaces for visitors and help relieve congestion near the recreation park as we continue to expand Disneyland Recreation Park," said Disney spokeswoman Susie Brown.
Saturday and Sunday, the embankment will be closed, to be reckoned with.
"This has been the case every year, and people already know that these days there is a different traffic flow to be reckoned with," says Andris Ameriks, deputy head of the municipality.
In turn, the costs of the Riga Festival will amount to about 500 000 euros.
"In addition to port events, which have been supported by advertising - both 24-hour basketball and channel regatti and big evening events - the cost is about half a million euros", according to America.
This year Riga is 815 years old, and film has been chosen as the theme of the festival, because exactly 120 years ago the first film session took place in Riga.

In the race of politicians of the Krastu match, President Vejoni will be replaced by ex-premier Dombrovskis.
The organizer of "Krastu macha" Edgars Jaunups told the Latvian Television programme "Morning Panorama" that the basketball race "Krastu mačs" will take place one day in 24 hours.
One game will last for an hour, and a total of 48 teams with more than 600 members will compete.
The team of "VEF Riga" will start the "Krastu match", which will also present its gamers for the next season.
The Krasta match, in turn, will traditionally be concluded by a team game of politicians.
This year the Latvian ex-premier will return to the field, the present Vice President of the European Commission Valdis Dombrovskis, who missed the previous year's game and who has played in five of the six Krastu matches in total, told Jaunups.
Dombrovskis will replace the President of Latvia Raimonds Vējonis, who was captain of this political team last year.
The Dombrovskis team will face Rigans with Riga Vice Mayor Andris Amerika in the lead.
In Liepaja, the insulation of the house will have to be agreed to by two thirds of its inhabitants.
If the owners of the apartments are very harsh and specifically talked about the technical condition of the building, if there is such an opportunity to receive support and arrange the building in all possible ways, then it is quite easy not to use it.
One of the most significant changes is that any apartment building will be eligible for EU co-financing from this year, but the condition is that the facade of the building should be warmed up.
Previously only serial apartment houses were allowed to use it.
The biggest concern for house managers, however, is the organisation of meetings of apartment owners.
A significant problem where this process is currently delayed is the fact that 67% of the apartment owners' consent is required.
"The previous programme required 51%", says Toms Cīrulis, project manager of "Liepājas nams" Ltd. (LNA).
"Of course, it is very difficult to ensure this because in a large number of general meetings this amount of apartment owners does not arrive", says Gints Ločmelis, the project manager of the company "Namu serviss APSE".
The largest house managers in Liepaja - "Namu serviss APSE" and the LNA, which serve about 900 buildings, plan to renovate at least 50 apartment houses in the new planning period by 2020.
They do not exclude the possibility that at the beginning of the work it will be difficult to convince people to vote for renovation works, but the attitude of citizens should improve with each project implemented.
I had to get a bank loan, too, and 76% of the people in the house needed it.
"Speaking, explaining what will be - I got those signatures," points out the most energy-efficient buildings in Latvia by the oldest Vita Iesalniece.
She is agreed by John, who also lives in a insulated building.
Well, you can't make up a party, and the other side plus one person then disagrees.
"No, of course, it's important that everyone agrees with the whole event", says John.
Such a change of rules has been initiated by representatives of the financial institution ALTUM.
They explain that with 51% of the votes in banks it is not possible to raise the necessary funding, which has also been experienced in the last planning period.
In most commercial banks, two thirds of the evidence from apartment owners was required.
Anda Lagzdiņa, Head of the European Union Funds Unit at the Ministry of Economics, mentions as one of the recommendations to house managers an opportunity to introduce the residents with the already existing examples and various benefits that would arise from renovation of the building, for example, energy saving.
As a young man, Aaron was long furious to the world for the death of his mother.
The alleged suicide bomber's detention operation in Canada was worthy of a spy film.
Everything started when Canadian police have received a video recording intercepted by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Very early in the morning, the Royal Canadian Police have received reliable information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Among other things, it contained a so-called "movement" video recording recorded by an unknown man who was clearly in the final stage of preparing the attack.
"And he was going to do it with a homemade bomb", said Deputy Chief of Canadian Police Mike Cabana.
A man dressed in a black mask in English and Arabic on the video made threats to Canadians and vowed revenge for everything they have done to Muslims.
Within about three hours of using face and voice recognition computer programs, the Canadian police have managed to recognize the man.
It was 24-year-old Aaron Driver.
He was already under the supervision of the probation service for glorifying the ideas of terrorism and radical Islam on the Internet.
A court ruling prohibited Driver from doing so in the future and also from engaging in any radical organizations.
By then, however, the authorities did not believe that Driver could pose any physical danger to those around him.
When police arrived at his home in the Stratroy town of Ontario, the young man had come out and sat in a taxi.
At that point, the order guards attempted to arrest him, however, the Driver, sitting on the rear seat, had triggered the explosive device.
To prevent the detonation of a second explosive device, policemen fired at the young man.
He is dead from his injuries.
The taxi driver hasn't suffered.
The father of the neutralized terrorist, Wayne Driver, said in an interview with Canadian television that his son had turned to Islam during his teenage years.
This had initially helped him deal with drugs and alcohol.
However, Aaron was a problematic teenager who had been long-runningly furious to the world for his mother's death, added his father.
Only when I saw that video on the news today did I realize how far he had gone.
I had no idea that he was so radicalized.
"And I also didn't know he knew how to speak Arabic so well", says Aaron's father.
Canadian police admit that if they had arrived a few hours later, the developments might have been much different.
Radēviča will go to Rio as a tourist and support Latvian athletes.
Former Olympian and Athlete Ineta Radēviča said in the LTV Olympic Studio that the Friday performance of seven-fight athlete Laura Ikauniece-Admidina in the first two disciplines is not bad, given that the athlete had an injury.
On the other hand, in the high jump, Laura made her springboard with her right foot, not as usual with her left.
Radēviča pointed out that it was comparable - just as a person who was used to writing with the right hand would suddenly be forced to writing with the left.
Therefore, the result of Icauniece-Admidina, given the injury, is not bad.
Radēviča revealed that she has not yet contacted Ikauniece-Admidiņa, but she is actively following her start and sympathizing with her.
Ineta learned of Laura's injury recently and expressed support for the athlete, stating that the athlete did not start making safety pillows for herself, but showed the character and spirit of the fighter.
In terms of other sports, Radēviča believes that the Olympic norms are very high, therefore it is wrong to accuse one of the Latvian athletes that he went to Rio as a tourist.
She recalled that when she traveled to the first Olympics, where she won the 13th place, she was also called tourists, and this creates negative emotions.
Ineta sometimes remembers her starts, not just in the Olympics.
"I like to remember my emotions, not the results", remembering her experience in sports, revealed Radēviča.
She told me that it was always important for there to be a man in the stands who would give the energy of siding.
Radēviča herself will be a tourist this year - she will be going to Rio next week to support Latvian athletes in person.
She points out that she will definitely go to the athletics competition.
Ineta Radēviča won the European title in 2010.
In 2004 at the Olympic Games in Athens, she took 13th place in the long jump and 20th position in the triple jump, but at the Olympics in 2008, the athlete did not start because she was waiting for her son.
In London, as already mentioned, Radēviča was 4th in the long jump.
Murjani will show the film "Quanta Code" with physicist Kashcheev in the lead role.
The film's annotation states that, in parallel with electron fission in the laboratory, Kashcheyev is a dreamer, teacher, socially active and civic-minded husband and father who seeks a connection with the Almighty.
The film's character in the Latvian Television programme "Morning Panorama" pointed out that making a film was an interesting experience for him.
I learned about how cinema is made, how it is filmed, how it is recorded.
"And actually fantastic work", said the physicist.
He admitted that the film was made in two years.
The biggest disagreement with the director has been about the film's title.
I am vehemently opposed to this name.
There's no quantum code.
"There is no secret that you can find out from watching the film and it's clear," added the associate professor of the University of Latvia.
Kashcheev admitted that he liked the fact that the film would premiere directly on Murjani's outdoor cinema evening.
They are organized by friends from the foundation "Easy", and these screenings will take place every evening until September 9.
In Thailand, four people died in bomb blasts in tourist attractions
After the Thai people voted to adopt the Constitution, there were a series of bomb blasts on Thursday and Friday in five southern provinces of Thailand - popular tourist destinations - in which four died and many people were injured.
The first two explosions threw off at a seaside resort in Huahin on Thursday evening, the next - Friday morning.
The town is about 200 kilometers south of Bangkok.
Police stated that one Thai woman was killed in the first explosion and 20 people were injured, 10 of them foreigners.
Authorities confirmed that other explosions slumped the southern cities of Phooket, Trana, and Suratthani.
Two bombs exploded in the suburb of Phuketa in Patonga and two more in Phanna Province - a tourist region north of Phuketa.
There have been 11 bomb blasts in Thailand in the past 24 hours.
On Friday, a Thai Royal Police official, Colonel Chrisana Patanacharoen, stated that the blasts were unrelated to Islamic extremists and were considered local acts of sabotage.
"It is still too early to draw conclusions," he said.
"But we absolutely know that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, in fact it's local sabotage, and we're trying to find the perpetrators."
After a small power bomb explosion in Huachin on August 12, 2016, investigators collected evidence from the crime scene.
On 12 August, officials announced that four people had been killed in a series of bomb blasts in Thailand's important tourist areas. Competent authorities are trying to determine the motive and find the perpetrators.
There are no conflicts in the country that could cause terrorists to be in the country.
"So we can say these incidents are not terrorist attacks," he continued.
No group has yet assumed responsibility for the attack, and the competent authorities have not charged any specific groups, but the explosions occurred the same week that Thai voters approved the new Constitution.
All three southern provinces - Huahina, Phuketa and Phanna - rejected the military-backed referendum, and in the southeastern provinces of Thailand, where the majority of the population are Muslims, more than 6,500 people have died in the riots since 2004.
The explosions occurred on the birthday of Queen Sirikita of Thailand, which is a national holiday in Thailand.
Huachin is home to the royal palace of Klai Kangwon, or "the castle far from the worries", in which the Thai royal family often tends to reside.
King Bumibol Adulyadei was the longest reigning monarch in the world.

Let's help us find it!
Please help!!!
In Mangel parish, Ogres nov. on the night of August 12, tractor-grass mower Macculloch M200-117T has been stolen!

Porgy and Bess - what we deserved a long time ago!
There are many operas that have never sounded in Latvia.
There is something that sounds very rare.
However, it seems strange if, since the 1970s, George Görshwin's opus Porgy and Bess have neither been staged nor played, apart from the periodic display of chrestomatic solo numbers such as Summertime on stage (including as the title sound at the summer festival hosted by Inese Galante), individual student projects, guest performances, and the like.
There are reasons for this - since Latvia is a civilized country of the Western world, it is bound by the Guershin family's heirs' regulations and copyright licenses, which are in force for Porgy and Bess until 2030.
Harmonisation procedures are not simple.
In addition, in creating a full production, the author wished that all fourteen soloists should be black.
In Latvia, of course, the discussions and contexts that exist around this opera in the USA from a racial point of view are little known and the composer's desire to perform would be difficult.
The concert performance, created by compromise, with the help of four artistic black American soloists and their Latvian counterparts, performed brightly on the 10th anniversary of the Cēsis Art Festival on 6 August, recalling Guershin's charming soundwriting, in which the European traditions of classical music are intertwined with American jazz rhythms, gossip, early 20th century fashion dances and memorable hits, telling the aching annals of Ketfishrova's crippled beggar Porgy and the light butterfly Bessa's love story in a musical quality that would deserve to be documented in the history of music life.
First of all, because of LNSO and conductor Andra Butga.
Despite the complex spatial location of the concert performance in the open-air park of Cēsis Castle, the orchestra is on the next stage alongside the stage, on which the soloists performed and sang (and danced!) the choir While, the overall sound was stylistically nuanced, contrast-rich and accurate in both strings and metal wind instruments and in the piano party (Mārtiņš Zilberts).
Second, because of the outstanding team of soloists.
Harismatic dramatic baritone Lester Lynch (Porgy) is a beloved singer in Europe and America, with both baritone and bas-baritone parties in the repertoire, especially in Verdi operas.
Porgy's role has been sung countless times, on several occasions also Krauna - he felt like a fish in the water in this opera and also inspired stage partners even to conjure up the emotional atmosphere of the fishermen's village's poor people's solidarity in the concert performance.
Leton Moore revealed in his second concert performance of Porgy and Bess (the first one held in 2012 no more, no less than with the Berlin Philharmonic and Sir Simon Rettle) as a vital plastic combination of different vocal styles with a dramatically tinted timbre and fantastic piano in the upper register.
It is not for nothing that she is one of the brightest modern Aids.
The attractive Yamaician-born tenor, Jermayne Smith, once watched by Andris Poga in a Boston production, the image of the drug dealer Sportinlaif is the firm's role on four continents.
In it, he demonstrates his synchronized dancing and singing skills as a well-trained musical actor.
Smith is one of the rare nuggets in whose voice it seems still lies as yet undiscovered vocal possibilities as 15 years ago, when the opera's voice was accidentally located, caricaturing it to smile at peers.
It is unbelievable that even from line 24 and relative darkness, Jermain Smith's expressive language of gestures allows him to see the dust bag of happiness in his hands, even if it is not there at all.
How can poor Bess not follow such a mephistophelic tempter who, in an empty place, believes the illusion of a wonderful life in New York?
The role of Crown was played by the timbrally generously endowed Rodney Clark.
The biggest vocal surprise for the Latvian soloist team in Cēsis was the Sirina portrayed by Sonora Vaice - a luxurious upper register, a skillful balancing between spoken and sung text, with a corresponding change in voice position, a performance filled by vocal acrobatics and dramatism, both in Sirina's lament My Man is Gone Now and in the stylized fore singer's ample in prayer Oh, Doctor Jesus.
The voice of Margarita Wilson sounded good in the role of Clara, but the iconic Summertime at the very beginning voiced the cradle a little about loud and nervous, getting its real character in reprise.
Collorites and magnificent voices were given to Mihail Chulpayev, Rihards Mačanovskis, Andris Lapins (especially the Krabiju salesman placed on the walls of castle ruins in reply to Irma Chef's soundy Strawberry salesman in soprano theatre).
Bright characters in Ilonas Bagheles, Rihards Millers, Emils Kivlenieks, as well as in the spoken roles, where Ivo Martinsons's investigator and the director and actor Juris Žagars, unexpectedly presented to the audience in the image of the white lawyer Archdale.
In the spatial concept of concert performance created by Viesturs Kairišs, the choir worked on steps, soloists - mainly in proscension, rarely coming up or going down stairs.
In sufficiently dynamic activity, a little comical situations were done in the hands of Latvian soloists in the sheet music folder.
Their presence, however, has a rather prosaic explanation.
First, some soloists sang several episodic roles (which sometimes caused difficulty in tracing their stage identity).
Secondly, there are many dialogues in Porgy and Bess, a phrase inserted in the conversation, a replica that is easier to track with notes in front of.
The titular machine helped listeners to go into the details of the opera plot in Cesis.
The weather didn't spoil and the first part of the concert performance rained long enough.
However, this did not prevent most listeners from staying until the end to cheer artists.
At nine o'clock in the evening, however, it is quite late to start a full-length opera, especially if there is a longer journey from Cēsis, but the opera Porgy and Bessa have returned to the Latvian musical circuit and are likely to become one of the most outstanding musical adventures of this summer.
Also in Liepaja, where it was heard last night, as well as in other acoustic conditions.
In Riga, a man has feared children with an axe on the playing field.
Yesterday, August 11, at about eight o'clock in the evening, the State Police received a message from the grandmother of a terrified child who was alarmed at the fact that there was a man on Lomonosova Street, a square of children, who feared children with an axe.
The law enforcement immediately responded to the summons and arrived at the scene where he also encountered the man with an axe, who was under the influence of a very high alcohol of 3.07 promiles at the time of the event.
It was established that a man born in 1962 had previously frightened children so that they would not make noise.
This time, however, for bullying children, the aggressive man used an axe to beat the equipment of the children's playground.
The man was detained.
In the context of what has happened, criminal proceedings have been initiated for gross obstruction of public order, which manifests itself in apparent disrespect to society or impudence, ignoring generally accepted standards of conduct and disturbing people's peace.
Such crimes shall be punishable by imprisonment for a period of up to two years or by temporary imprisonment, or by forced labour, or by fines and by probation monitoring for a period of up to three years.
Federation presidents generally use guest credentials at the Olympics.
The presidents of the sports federations usually arrive for a few days at the Olympics venue and use the accreditations of guests who can change names, so they have several owners during the competition, the representative of the Latvian Olympic Unit (LOV) Marita Vilciņa told LETA.
On Wednesday, widespread excitement arose after statements by Olympic swimmer Alona Ribakova coach German Yakubovsky, who revealed that at the last minute, Kaspars Pone, head of the Latvian Swimming Federation (LPF), decided to go to the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, while the coach had to stay home.
It later became known that Pone arrived in Brazil with coach accreditation, for which the president himself expressed surprise because he "now gets nowhere".
As Vilciņa explained, only the presidents of two federations - Pone, as well as Guntis Zālītis, the head of the Latvian Athletics Union (LVS) have lived in the sportsmen's village at the London Olympic Games.
Athletes live in the Olympic village, as well as official persons including, for example, coaches, doctors, administration of the delegation.
As a result, Ponem is likely to have had coach accreditation in London as well.
"The other presidents of the federations arrive as guests, and their accreditations are changeable - they arrive for a couple of days and then someone else already uses it", Vilciņa explained, explaining that the presidents of these federations do not live in the Olympic village either.
Pone arrived in Rio de Janeiro as early as late July and Brazil will leave on August 13, so he is likely to be there the longest of all the presidents of the national federations.
It is significant that Latvian athletes competed in swimming only one day - on August 10.
Latvia will be represented in 11 sports at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, and LETA's calculations show that the presidents of six or seven federations will be taking part in the four-year most important competition.
The hall will arrive in Brazil on Saturday, President of the Latvian Cycling Federation (LRF) Igo Japiņš will be on the scheduled BMX competition next week, President of the Latvian Windsurfing Federation Ansis Dāle has planned to fly to Rio de Janeiro on August 16, when both Kathy Birzule's starts will be finished, and President of the Latvian Fight Federation Dzintars Urbančiks - a day earlier.
The next week the President of the Latvian Shooting Federation Kārlis Krēsliņš has also planned to arrive, when the start of the shooter Dainis Upelnieks will be over.
Raimonds Rublovskis, President of the Latvian Judo Federation, was not in Rio de Janeiro at least during the Latvian athlete competition, even though his arrival was planned, the Latvian Canoe Federation currently has no president, but the Latvian Weightlifting Society is still in conflict and its athletes are invited to international competitions by the Latvian Olympic Committee.
Meanwhile, the President of the Latvian Volleyball Federation Atis Sausnītis and the Head of the Latvian Tennis Union Juris Savickis decided not to arrive in Rio de Janeiro.
Vasiljevs appreciates natural breasts of Latvian women.
The world-famous Russian fashion historian, interior decorator, stage designer, book author, lecturer and collector Aleksandrs Vasiljevs has visited Latvia very often in recent years.
Most recently, he judged the contestants in the final of "Mis un Misters Latvija 2016" and admitted that Latvian beauties, unlike representatives of the beautiful sex of Russia, can be proud of natural breasts and lips that are not improved by silicone and botulinum injections.
In a conversation with "Vakara News", Aleksandrs Vasilyevs told that for many years he has already been the president of the jury in the popular "Mis Russia" beauty competition.
That is why he has also been very interested in evaluating the participants of "Mis un Misters Latvija 2016".
Asking what differs Latvian beauty competition standards from similar competitions in Russia, Vasilyev emphasized that Latvians and Russians have very different figures: "Russian beauty contestants have bigger breasts than Latvian contestants."
Latvian young women, however, are beautifully dressed and saphred, as well as can be proud of the natural beauty rather than the miracles of plastic surgery.
Therefore, I especially congratulate the participants of the Latvian beauty competition for their natural beauty.
Due to his professional activities in Latvia Vasilyev has large plans.
Currently, the fashion historian's collection exhibition "Tamed Nature" is on view at the Museum of Decorative Arts and Design.
In turn, Vasilyev's exhibition "Weddings 1860-2010" is on view at the Livonian Order Palace in Ventspils.
Vasilyev loved Ventspils so much that for a couple of days he also enjoyed the hospitality of the city and went for a walk along the sea.
I like it very much in Latvia.
Especially now that there is a threat of terrorism across Europe, there is a real corner of paradise here.
"To spend time and relax in Latvia is the pure pleasure", admitted the fashion guru.
Moreover, on November 23, Aleksandrs Vasiljevs will open a private fashion museum in Old Riga.
Ask for help!
Please donate to the treatment of our son, brother, grandson.
We, Rinald's family, are grateful to fantastic people around and to God that there was a chance to save Rinald, but unfortunately, there is currently no way to fully cover the cost of medicine on our own.
Rinald Grinberg is an 11-year-old Tunisian who was diagnosed with a brain tumour in late July.
This year he graduated from 4th grade in Milzkalne Primary School with excellence, a strong athlete and a very talented artist.
I guess everything turned out to be good with him.
Healthy, joyful, persistent, diligent and active boy.
Always smiling and kind.
July 26 Our family will be remembered forever.
The last couple of weeks were plagued with nausea, headache, but doctors bequeathed it to the belly virus.
And at first I thought it was.
For who could have imagined that there was something far more serious by the fault of such "innocent" symptoms, which was beyond the reach of the mind.
On July 26, we received a diagnosis - Rinald has a brain tumor.
There is a rapid accumulation of fluid in the brain, but all doctors in Latvia can help is to perform a bypass operation to remove excess fluid, because for direct surgery the tumor is practically not available.
Nor can it be determined whether the tumor is benign or malignant.
Further state-paid plan: start radiation and watch what's going on.
It seemed like an evil nightmare -- we're going to expert here, look at the results.
Fortunately, it was possible to show Rinald's test results to Dr. in Spain.
He is the vice president of the World Neurosurgery Association, one of the world's leading neurosurgeons.
He undertook to perform an opera, and in addition it turned out to be necessary to operate immediately.
The tumor exerts enormous pressure on the brain, and the risk of complications is too great.
It is also urgent to understand whether the tumor is benign or malignant in order to develop a plan for further treatment.
Without thinking for a moment, the parents chose to go to Spain to save their son.
At a fantastic rate, as early as August 8, Rinald and Mom Evie were in Spain and were operating on August 9.
A very complex operation of more than 6 hours was performed.
The operation took place at the Santa Elena Clinic.
It was possible to remove most of the tumors, relieve the pressure, obtain samples of analysis.
Rinald is now getting up from the bed and as a proper teenager, demanding fries for dinner.
Now just wait for the results of the oncological tests.
Thanks to Dr. Araez and the management of the clinic, who understood the situation and operated urgently without receiving full payment for the treatment before the operation.
They, trusting that the remaining amount would be paid, demanded only a €10,000 first instalment to operate and save Rinald's life.
The parents managed to provide 6 000 euros by selling the machinery, while the rest of the necessary amount for travel expenses, living, the hospital's first contribution managed to borrow from relatives and friends.
But at least another 24 000 euros are needed to settle for the first treatment period in Spain and to return the money we have borrowed for the first instalment.
Please help us repay this surgery, so important to Rinald's health.
Each euro is important to help cover the costs of the operation already carried out and to be able to successfully continue Rinalda treatment.
Signs of unrest in Ukraine make you ask the question: What is Vladimir Putin thinking?
It has become apparent that these claims are true.
Ukraine denies them, while the US and the European Union claim that Russia has not provided any evidence.
The open analysis group, the Digital Forensic Research Lab, has found some signs of Saturday shooting, but quite little to be able to hinder Moscow's major plans.
Russia is known for distorting or misinterpreting events for political purposes, especially in the context of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.
This does not mean that all Russian claims are unfounded.
Members of the Ukrainian resistance forces damaged last year the electricity pylons supplying the current to Crimea, some of which are also involved in criminal activities and human rights violations.
The attempted attack in Crimea is still a topical issue, although there is little reason to suspect that the Ukrainian government would sponsor a scenario of such events.
Whatever happened, images found by open source analysts show that Russia has been increasing its military presence ever since at least last Saturday - before the anticipated attack took place.
They show heavy-arm convoys moving along the peninsula, including missile systems designed to protect the coast.
Disturbingly Known Escalation of Russia
Separate reports indicate that the Russian forces in Crimea had already planned rotation around this time, which could help explain the activity, although it would be a very coincidence that it just happened to happen in one of the fullest times of tension since the annexation in 2014.
Whatever has become known over the weekend, Mr Putin has undoubtedly turned to Ukraine even more in his statements, choosing to use this episode, however real it may be, for what greater purpose.
Analysts point to worrying parallels with Russia's treatment just before previous military actions against Ukraine.
In February 2014, similar speeches and military manoeuvres provided a cover for the Crimean volunteer members of the resistance force to occupy the peninsula, which was still controlled by Ukraine at the time, only to reveal that in fact they were Russian special units that initiated the military occupation.
In August, when Russian-backed separatists failed in Eastern Ukraine, Putin deployed forces along the border, warning that they might be needed for the "protection" of ethnic Russian civilians in Ukraine who are being attacked according to him.
He arranged a relief convoy to the region, which according to NATO was only a cover-up of Russian invasion forces.
What does Mr. Putin intend to do in Crimea?
Some have guessed whether only Moscow is planning another military intervention.
The fighting in Eastern Ukraine has escalated, as it was before the invasion in August 2014.
But this supposed parallel could be the point when it is intended to introduce a fear of military action, not of actual action, - this will give Putin a trump card, both in his relations with Ukraine and with Western countries.
Mark Galeoti, a professor at the University of Nuyork who studies Russia, pointed out that Crimea would have little meaning as the point from which to start military actions against Eastern Ukraine, which borders the land part of Russia rather than the Crimea, and that the rest of the country is better protected.
"There's a pretty little chance if the Russians really are planning some large-scale offensive", Mr Galeoti said.
Rather, "we can observe a classic Russian strategy of creating a pressure."
International peace talks on Ukraine, once a mechanism with which Putin imposed contacts with Western leaders who ignored him due to the annexation of Crimea, are increasingly seen by more and more people as unsuccessful and irrelevant.
By promising that there is a danger that the conflict may flare up again, Putin gives a new meaning to the negotiations: to get him off the edge of the abyss.
"It's standard Putin's tactics - he wants to try to start from a position of strength," Galeoti said of the next peace talks scheduled for early September.
"And the only strong point is to say, 'If I wanted to, I could make everything even much, much worse.'"
Reaching an agreement with the West
Putin also said this week that during the Crimean tensions there was little point in continuing the negotiations, forcing other parties to convince him to return to the negotiating table and to come to the centre of the process.
What does it actually give him?
Firstly, it allows Russia to continue to establish itself as a world power, although its economy is smaller than that of Australia.
Secondly, it positions Moscow as having the right of veto over the sovereignty of Ukraine, keeping the country under Russian control to some extent.
It may also benefit Putin's long-held hopes of a large-scale agreement with the United States, which would resolve their disputes on the issue of Ukraine and Syria, on favourable terms for Moscow, naturally, also ending Western sanctions against Russia.
Putin has hinted at this goal since the country's economic deterioration in 2014, has been made several times, mainly due to the country's declining value of its oil and gas exports.
Since his invasion of Syria last autumn, he has repeatedly called on the Western powers to join him in the great coalition to fight extremists.
However, Russian leaders may believe that they would need to secure such an agreement before January, when President Obama's term expires.
Russian officials basically believe that the next president will be Hillary Clinton, who is more hostile to Moscow.
Donald J. Trump, although noticeably friendly to Russia, is still considered unpredictable.
Obama, on the other hand, is considered to be one who "searches for solutions rather than conflicts," Galeoti said.
So it makes sense to close the window of opportunity to get something done quickly.
Meanwhile, if a large-scale agreement is not reached, it seems that Putin is satisfied with keeping Russia's weak neighbour by citing what will be next.
An earlier version of this article misstated the year that Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine.
This was in 2014, not in 2013.
As Congress enters a dead end, the White House directs funds to fight Zika virus
The Obama administration said on Thursday that it would divert US$81 million from biomedical research and anti-poverty and health care programs to pay for the development of a vaccine against the Zika virus, resorting to emergency measures as Congress did not approve new funding to combat the virus.
Sylvia Matthews Barwell , Secretary of Health and Humanities, in a letter to members of Congress, indicated that without the funds diverted, the National Institute of Health and the Biomedical In-Depth Research and Development Authority would remain without money to fight mosquito-borne disease until the end of the month.
Therefore, the vaccine would have to be discontinued at an important moment as the number of Zika disease cases acquired in the country increases in Miami.
Last week, there were 7,350 cases of Zika virus reported in the United States, mostly in Puerto Rico (according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).
Mrs. Barwell said that 15 babies were born to birth defects related to Zika virus.
The virus can cause brain development abnormalities and other severe defects in children born to infected mothers.
The prevalence of the disease in the continental United States, when the first cases were recorded at the end of last month, has raised political rates into a federal government response.
Hillary Clinton stopped in Wainwood, a neighborhood in Miami on Tuesday as part of the campaign, which saw an outbreak of locally transmitted Zika virus cases, and put pressure on Congress to return from its five-week break to confirm emergency funding to fight the virus.
President Obama and Congressional Republicans have been in conflicting thoughts for most of the year on Zika virus issues.
Obama claimed US$1.9 billion in emergency funding in February.
The Republicans stopped this by demanding a more detailed account of what the money would be spent on.
Lawmakers have been arguing for months about how much money should be allocated and how it should be spent.
Last month, Democrats blocked consideration of the measure proposed by Republicans when they would allocate US$1.1 billion to fight Zika virus , but would include provisions that would prohibit the allocation of funds for family planning to provide contraceptives for a virus that can be so transmitted through the sex route.
Because of this impasse, the White House in April was forced to divert $589 million to fight against the Ebola virus, the Zika virus. About two-thirds of the funding is to be used within the country.
On Thursday, Mrs. Barwell said that her department had spent most of the money and that it would be spent in full by the end of August.
"The failure to make a decision on emergency funding for the fight against Zika virus has led the administration to choose between postponing the work of developing the important vaccine and catching up with other valuable national programs to temporarily avoid this postponement," Barvela wrote.
Democrats clung to this statement to accuse Republicans of not giving extra money to fight Zika virus.
At the news conference, spokeswoman Nancy Pelosi of California, a minority leader, invited Representative Paul D.Ryan, Speaker of the House of Representatives, to remind Congress of moving this event forward.
"All the opportunities are exhausted and now we turn to the National Institute of Health," Ms Pelosi said.
Mr. Ryan's advisers say that channeling funds is a step that had to be taken a long time ago and has been delayed by the Obama administration in order to extort maximum political benefit from the Zika virus problem.
Last week, the National Institute of Health announced that it had started clinical trials of the vaccine against Zika virus with 80 people, and hopes to start a second phase in the "Zika virus epidemic countries" in early 2017.
However, as officials claimed on Thursday, without immediate additional funding, the study will stop.
Barwell said she would divert US$34 million from the National Health Service funds for the search for cures for other diseases, including cancer and diabetes, to fight Zika virus.
A further 47 million will be transferred to the Biomedical in-depth research and development facility supporting the development of medicines and vaccines in response to public health emergencies.
This money will come from a number of accounts, including US$19 million from a program that grants heating fuel oil subsidies to underprivileged families, and US$4 million from substance addiction programs such as opioid addictions.
Even then, as Barwell said, extra money will only be enough for the next month, when agencies will have to "fundamentally narrow their operations" in the fight against the Zika virus if Congress fails to act.
Over the past four months, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention has spent $60 million to help states protect pregnant women, $25 million to strengthen their preparedness for and plans to fight the Zika virus, as well as $16 million to help it set up data acquisition systems to quickly detect microcephaly and other symptoms associated with the Zika virus.
Thai leader links attacks on tourist favorites with constitutional changes
The head of the Thai junta on Friday has called on the people of the country to be patient until investigators find out what is behind the string of deadly bomb blasts in Thailand this week.
General Prayut Chang-ocha, head of the junta and prime minister, said that the criminals had been "bad people" protesting against the new Constitution, which voters approved in a referendum held on Sunday.
"There are still bad people and they acted already before the referendum," he said in an address to the people.
Bomb blasts in five provinces on Thursday and Friday, including Phuket and Huahin, among tourists in popular places, killed four and injured dozens of people.
Authorities say that attacks by arsonists elsewhere in the country are linked.
Analysts say the bomb blasts have not been aimed at killing many people, but at harming the tourism industry, one of Thailand's economy's bright spots.
At least nine foreign tourists were injured in Juanhin.
"Whatever the motives, explosions and arsonist attacks overturn the junta's claim that the post-referendum situation will be stable," said Sunay Fasuk, senior researcher at Human Rights Watch, the organization.
These attacks are causing discrediting consequences for the authorities, terrorising society and harming the tourism-based economy.
Photo Thai rescue workers are looking after those injured in a bomb blast in Huahin on Friday.
Police say that in their view these explosions are unrelated to international terrorism or the protracted Islamic unrest in southern Thailand.
They see the attacks as "sabotage of a local character" rather than terrorism.
The time and location chosen for the attacks have a strong political symbolism.
The explosions occurred on Friday when people had prepared to celebrate Queen Sirikita's birthday, which is considered Mother's Day in Thailand.
The four explosions threw off the royal residence in the city of Huachin, approximately 125 miles from Bangkok, where most of the injured were also.
The Constitution prepared by the military will diminish the influence of political parties and give the military greater powers even if the government is again under civilian control.
The junta helped secure its victory by preventing opponents from campaigning against it.
Murray Hiebert, an Southeast Asian expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., pointed to the military's suspicion that the attacks were carried out by people unsatisfied with the vote.
The explosions were "exactly coordinated, but visibly targeted at creating fear and excitement rather than mass damage and fatalities and injuries," he said.
Last year, in an explosion at the popular Yerevan shrine in Bangkok, 20 people were killed, mostly tourists from China.
Thai officials linked the blasts to Uighur militants who were dissatisfied with the return of over 100 Uighurs to China.
General Preiyut, who has been leading the junta since 2014, when the civilian government was agilely suspended, said that this week's explosions "pain Thai hearts."
Why now that the country is doing better, when the economy is doing better, and the tourism industry is doing better?" he said.
We have to ask why and who did it.
The Golden Reaction: What the Historical Moment of Simone Manuel Look Like
When I started a fight tonight, I allegedly tried to remove from my shoulders the weight of the black community, which is something I carried with me just being in that position.
I hope, however, that all of this will be gone.
I am more than happy about the fact that I can serve others as inspiration and hopefully diversify this sport.
At the same time, however, I would like to have a day when we have more, and that's not Simone, a black swimmer, because the designation black swimmer makes it look like I don't have to be able to win a gold medal or that I don't have to be able to beat records.
That's not the case, because I work as hard as everybody else, and I love sports and want to win like everybody else.
Struggle for the defense of students - lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons (L.G.B.T.) - in Colombia
Two years ago, 16-year-old Sergio Urrego struck down by jumping off a shopping mall in Bogotá, before leaving a message of his suicide on a Facebook record, citing Pink Floyd's song "Goodbye Cruel World" ("Goodbye's evil world").
His death was the origin of the contradictions that erupted in Colombia this week, where efforts to extend the rights of L.G.B.T. were viewed in the wider political struggles that have divided the country into two camps.
After his death, Urrego's mother, Alba Reijes, filed a complaint with the court against school officials blaming them for excluding her only son when it was revealed that he and his classmate had had an intimate relationship.
A year later, the Supreme Court of Colombia delivered a favorable verdict to her, calling on schools across the country to develop clearer policies to prevent discrimination.
The decision was part of a series of legal victories of the Colombian gay rights movement. Some time ago, this movement celebrated its decision to legalize same-sex marriage.
However, this week they faced an obstacle in their fight for equality, as Gina Perody, the education minister who is openly gay, got caught up in a scandal over the application of this rule in the scandal.
The scandal began when sexually exposed content from a pornography magazine began circulating in social media, with people spreading the talk that it was part of a handbook published by the Ministry of Education.
Perody quickly exposed it.
Although the ministry offered schools assistance on issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity with the idea of helping them to pay attention to the rule, it has not however attempted to impose standardized rules.
"What we want for schools are tools for conflict resolution," Mrs. Perdodia said in an interview on Thursday.
Discussions began before the national debate on the future of the country, where peace talks will take place between the government and the revolutionary Colombian armed forces, or FARC, a guerrilla group.
A coalition of politicians in the government's opposition and leaders of the Catholic Church have mobilised extremely quickly, accusing the government of presiding Juan Manuel Santos of same-sex union and promoting gender change.
To make it even more difficult for everyone, a government delegation negotiating with the FARC in Havana recently reached an agreement on gender and L.G.B.T. equality calling on the government to adopt more inclusive policies.
Government criticism and peace talks put on the 42-year-old Perody, the rising star of Colombian politics.
They showcased word-spoken posters at the rallies and some have also threatened violence against her and her partner, Cecilia Alvarez-Correa Glen, a former trade minister.
Perody maintained an admirable calm throughout the troubled week, trying to correct the mistake and resume the debate under constructive conditions.
"Partly what makes me stand and keep my head clear is the awareness that there are children who will only be revealed," she said.
This is a very tight field and a very lonely time.
She also pointed to the connection between the peace process and the debate on L.G.B.T. students.
While Colombians continue to assess the benefits of a deal with the FARC, which would be a turning point like an earthquake in the country, they have to think about the origin of the conflict, she said.
"Is a peaceful country one that promotes inclusion or exclusion; is it one where everyone has equal opportunities?" she asked the question.
Although this week she has not been pleased to be the target of insults and rebukes, she is pleased that in modern-day Colombia gay students can take an example from her and think that they too may one day try to become ministers.
"It is very important to me that they are calm and aware that they can fully realise their potential," said Mrs. Perody.
We can't wait for a new suicide to start making a difference.
Keep the vote cyber-safe - The New York Times
"U.S. seeks ways to keep hackers away from ballot boxes" (news article, August 4)
Internal Security Minister Jeh Johnson says the Obama administration is thinking about additional security protection for the country's electoral system.
These changes may be necessary and should be considered immediately.
Cyber threats in various forms and the recent discovery that external forces, perhaps national states, are increasingly interested in influencing our elections, demand that the federal government pay additional attention to the provision of our electoral system and may consider it to be part of an essential infrastructure for our country.
Johnson should immediately contact thousands of national jurisdictions that help make elections and offer the Homeland Security Department's help, advice and leadership.
While the diverse and diverse nature of our voting infrastructure hampers efforts to ensure this, it tells us that the process must start as soon as possible.
The writer, a Democrat from Mississippi, is a high-ranking member of the national security committee.
In Pennsylvania a boy injured in carousels, this week is the third case in amusement parks
On Thursday, as a result of falling off a carousel, a boy was injured and taken to a Pittsburgh hospital. The ambulance and park officials say this is already the third accident in the U.S. amusement parks in which children are affected.
The child, whose name is not revealed, was only taken to a children's hospital in Pittsburgh about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of the Aidlvailda and Soukson amusement park in Laijonier, Pennsylvania, said a spokeswoman for the Westmourland County ambulance services.
The three-year-old boy, who was visiting with his brother while he was being given help on the spot, was at the consciousness, informed in an e-mail by park spokesman Jeff Krushor.
Kroshor said that the attraction "Rollo Coaster" would be closed for the duration of the investigation of the event.
Children must be at least 3 feet (91 cm) long and those shorter than 4 feet (122 cm) should be accompanied by adults to ride at the carousel in the Aidlvailda.
The attraction, according to information published on its website, was built in 1938, and the state's Department of Agriculture indicated that it had been inspected in August.
A spokesman for the hospital refused to comment on the boy's health condition.
On Sunday, a 10-year-old boy died from a neck injury from the world's tallest water mountain in Kansasistia, Kansas.
On Monday, three 6, 10, and 16-year-old girls who fell from a height of more than 30 feet (9 meters) overturning the basket of a panoramic wheel during a fair in Greenville, Tennessee, have been taken to the hospital, reports local media.
Japanese Prime Minister Abe on the anniversary of the Second World War will not attend a shrine honoring the memory of those who died in the war: Jiji
News agency Jiji reports that Japanese Prime Minister Sindzo Abe will not attend the controversial Tokyo Shrine on the anniversary of Japan's defeat in World War II, which honors the memory of those who died in the war.
On Thursday, Jiji reported that Abe, however, was planning to send a ritual gift to the shrine of Yasukuni on Monday in honor of the anniversary.
The shrine also honors the memory of 14 Japanese warlords who have only been convicted as war criminals, and China and South Korea see it as a symbol of Japanese wartime militarism.
Abe has not visited the shrine since December 2013, when he announced that he visited it to show respect for those who died for his homeland.
The new Japanese Defense Minister, Tomomi Inada, has not answered the question whether she will visit the shrine, explaining that it is a matter of conscience.
Inada - a close ally of Abe and supporter of amendments to the Japanese pacifist constitution - has visited Yasukuni regularly in the past.
Kyodo, a news agency, reports that Masahiro Imamura, the Minister for Reconstruction of Areas Victims of Japan Disaster, visited the shrine on Thursday and said that he prayed for Japan's peace and prosperity.
Relations between China and Japan, Asia's two largest economies, have become more tense following the increasing presence of Chinese coastguards and other state ships near the disputed islets in the South China Sea, which is called Senkak in Japan, and Diaoudge in China.
Two suspects detained in Rio Olympic terror planning: police
On Thursday, police detained two people suspected of supporting the Islamic State of the group in a possible attack planning during the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Prior to the operation on Thursday, 12 individuals had already been detained by police, all suspected of working with Islamic State militants.
Brazilian federal police report that three other persons were questioned and later released.
The two arrested on Thursday are Brazilians, but police do not disclose their names and other information.
Although there have been no conflicts with known militant groups in Brazil's history, the government reports that the Olympics have made the country a more pressing target, especially as nations fighting against the Islamic State participate in the Games.
Its militants control certain areas of Iraq and Syria, and the U.S.-led coalition has made air attacks against them.
The group has supporters around the world who have carried out civilian shootings and bombings.
The new suspect is officially charged with murdering a French priest
As part of an investigation into the murder of a French priest last month, official charges have been made against a man arrested on Monday, with Reuters reporting a source of information to police on Friday.
The 21-year-old suspect is being investigated for his cooperation with terrorists and is said to have planned attacks on people, a source of information mentioned.
The man is said to have been in telephone contact with Adel Kermich and Abdeu Malik Petitjan, who interrupted the church service in Saint-Tétienne du Ruvé, West France, on July 26, and cut his throat to the 85-year-old Roman Catholic pastor, Father Jacques Amel.
Both were shot dead by police.
The suspect had come from his home near Toulouse to Saint-Tététienne du Ruwe and spent the night there in the days before the attack, the source mentioned.
The young man, who had not previously had a criminal record, admitted to having spent the night there, however, told investigators that he had left the next day because he had no good relationship with Kermich and Petitjan, the source of information said.
Investigators are trying to find out whether Kermitch and Petitjan had accomplices in France and whether they were affiliated with the Islamic State, which has assumed responsibility for the attack.
Petitjan's cousin was placed under pre-trial detention at the end of last month.
Dorus de Vries undergoes medical examinations before transferring to Celtic
Nottingham Forest club goalkeeper Dorus de Vries has come to Glasgow as he hopes to conclude an agreement to move to Celtic.
De Vries was photographed, entering Roshola Hospital before a medical examination after Hoop agreed terms with Sky Bet Champions Club.
Parkhead club manager Brendan Rogers is looking for an experienced center guard to have competition for the current number one Craig Gordon.
However, Roger trusts the 35-year-old de Vries because he has worked with the Dutchman at the Swansea Club.
He played 51 games for Swansea, which they won under Rogers in 2011 the right to advance to the Premier League.
He replaced the Welsh form to join the Wolves that summer, and has been at the City Ground since 2013.
He has also played for Scotland during his career after a season spent at Diunfermline, after moving back in 2006.
His stay at East Tendpark ended in frustration, however, with Pars experiencing double agony, being "sent into exile" from the highest level, before losing to Celtic in the Scottish Cup.
The goalkeeper had still a year left in Forest under contract, and it was reported that Celtic would only have to pay a nominal fee to get his signature.
Macy's will close 100 stores.
Supermarket giant Macy's has announced on Thursday its plans to close 100 stores, which is a dramatic step towards helping the store chain to get ahead from the potentially huge problem: in America, it claims to be an era of online shopping for too many stores.
Macy's regularly reduces its store's portfolio, often closing several dozen insufficiently profitable stores immediately after the annual holiday fever.
However, with its summer announcement that it would close 15 percent of its 728 outlets, store chains seem to have taken a much more aggressive stance than many similar retailers in terms of reducing its stores by adapting to a very changing shopping environment.
Pedestrians and buyers go past the Macy's store in New York City.
The retail giant announces that it plans to close 100 stores.
Macy's has many reasons to try to change something: many of its stores are located in small regional shopping malls, as the number of buyers has been particularly affected by the boom in e-commerce.
The supermarket category as a whole has come to tougher times, as buyers increasingly choose lower-priced retailers such as T.J.Maxx and fast fashion operators such as H&M to buy clothes.
These factors, along with short-term complications such as ever smaller international tourist spending and seasonally inappropriate weather conditions, which have placed Macy's in a fragile situation that has been stretching for over a year.
On Thursday, the company announced that its comparable sales in the last quarter fell by 2.6 percent, a rather weak indicator, which was however an improvement given the very poor 6.1 percent drop in the year-on-year, which was found in the previous quarter.
The retailer's revenue was US$5.87 billion (7.64 billion Canadian dollars), 3.9 percent less than that period last year.
Macy's said that closing stores would cost it about US$1 billion in annual turnover.
And closing such a large number of stores at the same time could be seen as a recognition of the retailer's defeat.
However, the value of the company's shares fell by 17 percent on Thursday, suggesting that investors perceive the move as a proactive measure that airs a stronger future for Macy's.
In a way, the fact that Macy's reduces the number of stores should not be a surprise.
Terry Lundgren, the Director-General of the Retailer, said earlier that there are quite simply too many shops in the chain.
Top executives said for some time that they had adopted a new strategy where particular emphasis is placed on 150 of its most profitable stores, seeking to achieve higher sales at already beneficial outlets.
Jeff Janet, Macy's director, who has been appointed to replace Lundgren as of 2017, said in a statement almost all the stores the company plans to close are those where sales and profitability slide down.
"We are aware that these outlets are not yet getting an adequate return on investment and often do not have the level of customer shopping experience that reflects our efforts in relation to the Macy's brand," said Janet.
The company announced it would come up with a list of stores to close later.
Macy's said that it was still being decided on the closing stores and that it was therefore not yet known exactly how many employees would be laid off.
The retailer will not leave entirely the main markets where it currently has stores, but it will think about closing stores located in less active locations.
This move is unlikely to be liked by shopping mall managers who count on large tenants such as Macy's to attract and hold other smaller stores in their shopping malls.
Do you have dangerous bacteria in your bottle of water?
According to a new study, drinking from refilled bottles may be "much worse than licking your dog’s toy" given how many bacteria you will have to face.
The website Treadmill Reviews commissioned EmLab P&K to inspect 12 bottles of four different types of water - with a screw cap, with a flip-off cork, with a flip-off cork, and with a straw.
Each bottle had been taken by the athlete for a week without washing.
Your refillable water bottle can be as dirty as a dog toy.
"On the basis of 12 bottles of water we tested, we found that there may be an alarmingly large number of viable bacterial cells in the reusable drinking dishes: over 300,000 colony-forming units per square centimetre (KVV/qcm.)," says Treadmill Reviews.
In bottles with sliding caps, the largest amount of microbes were found, with more than 900,000 colony forming units per square centimetre (CFU/qcm.)
The bottles contained microbes that can cause skin infections, pneumonia or blood poisoning.
Bottles with pressable caps were the next worst with 162,000 CFU/ sq.cm., while containers with screwable caps contained only slightly less than 160,000 CFU/q.cm.
"Drinking water from such bottles may be worse than eating from your pet's dish", is stated on the website.
A good picture is seen for straw bottles where only a fraction of the bacteria in other bottles were found - only 25 CFU/cvm.
This could be because the water drops to the lower part of the straw instead of sticking to its edges and thus attracting moisture-loving microbes.
The microbes in the bottles with the straw are described as "largely harmless."
"Based on the results of our test, we recommend choosing a bottle with straw, both because of the small number of bacteria and the absence of harmful microbes," said the website.
We also know that when it comes to bottles and bacteria, stainless steel is a better choice than plastic.
In addition, water bottles without cracks and hard-to-clean sites will have fewer microbes.
The website advises readers to wash bottles after each use, ideally with a weak bleaching solution.
Religion Needs to Become Modern or to Be Forgotten
In the United States, the Democrat Party has recently nominated Hillary Clinton as its presidential candidate.
If the results of the latest polls prove true in the election itself, America will inaugurate its first president, a woman, in January.
In the previous week, across the ocean, British Prime Minister Theresa May discussed Britain's withdrawal from European rules with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Women raised in Western society have been brought up in such a way as to be aware that, thanks to education, ambition and hard work, they can be competent and successful in any field of professional activity.
And today, young girls can target a number of existing role models, operating in the highest field of leadership.
So, is the long and hard fight for women's equality really over at last?
Hillary Clinton is ready to become President of the United States at any time, however, in the field of religion, female leadership remains a controversial issue.
Okay, not completely.
In the religious field, female leadership remains a contentious issue.
Last week, Pope Francis announced the creation of a new commission with the aim of assessing whether women should be consecrated as deacons in the Catholic Church.
The Anglican Church consecrated Libya Lane as the first woman-bishop in January 2015, but this was only after a failed attempt in 2012.
While women have been ordained in the reform Jewish movement since the early 1970s and the conservative movement since the early 1980s, in orthodox Judaism, the concept of female rabbi still has a very fierce resistance.
In November 2015, the American Board of Orthodox Rabbis published a rather harsh message in its third attempt to stem the ever-increasing wave of support for the rabbinic prescription of Orthodox women that the concept of female-rabbi is contrary to the law.
Not without irony when Hillary Clinton was nominated as a Democratic presidential candidate, a group of American leading Orthodox rabbis who oppose the ordination of women launched a series of "discussions" on this controversial issue.
Why is there a difference between secular and sacral?
Orthodox Judaism, like most other religions, seeks stability in what it sees as enduring traditional values.
It manifests itself in being able to resist pressure to adapt to a changing society.
Those who are against female ordination do so on the grounds that it is not "traditional."
However, overwhelming with the preservation of traditions in this way has its price.
And the price of such one-sided thinking can paradoxically undermine tradition in its own right by depriving the traditional community of the oxygen it needs to maintain vitality.
In the book "August Guns", in the military history of the First World War, Barbara Tachman emphasizes the danger of giving priority to the tradition in what has become known as the "tragedy of red trousers."
Until the outbreak of the First World War, when warfare moved from warfare over close distances to heavier artillery being transmitted from a further distance, it became advantageous to hide the soldiers as long as possible.
The British and German armies responded to these changes by replacing their bright uniforms with boring greys and browns.
French soldiers, however, still wore the same red hats and pants, which made them light targets.
The proposal by the French Minister of War Affairs, Adolf Messimí, that the armies under his command could act similarly, was perceived with ridicule and resistance.
The red pants reflected the pride and prestige of the army, and the military traditionalists were not prepared to abandon it.
Speaking in parliament, former Minister of War Affairs Eugene Etienne spoke on behalf of France.
"Abandoning the red pants?" he exclaimed.
Never!
"It's the unspeakable and idiotic appendix to the most obvious of all colors," Messimee then wrote, "had to have evil consequences."
Faith leaders who fight to include women in leading religious roles could fall into the same trap.
Focusing solely on the "traditional" religion, not asking the important question, "What change is needed for religion to flourish?" they risk losing about 50 percent of their followers.
They also take away from the whole community the talent, skills and enthusiasm that women would otherwise provide.
To insist that men continue to wear pants when it comes to religion may be traditional, but as the destruction of red trousers suggests, it may not be worth it.
Dina Breiver is a founding member of the JOFA (Women's Orthodox Feminist Association) in Britain and a student of orthodox rabbinism at the Yeshivath Maharat in New York City.
The children of Roja region learned new skills in the camp.
From 1st to 6th of August, at the Rojupe Children and Youth Initiative Centre, camp "Varavine Bridges" took place, during which participants creatively manifested themselves, sported, as well as acquired new skills.
We arrived at the camp on the closing day, when the children were eager to paint glass jars.
Māra Folkmane, a youth specialist at the Rojupe Centre for Children and Youth Initiatives, told that this was one of the activities that participants liked most.
A visit to Einārs Kalniņš carpentry "Mazbrīņi" was also a great pleasure.
The children were most fond of the laser engraving, as it was possible to see how the drawing on the computer was gradually applied to the board.
E. Kalnins has explained what subjects should be studied in school if he wants to work in carpentry, namely, the main thing is mathematics, especially geometry, computer science, as well as technical drawing and drawing.
He also emphasized that the profession should work more with the brain than with the muscles.
There are individual orders in the small hall, and it is important to plan everything first.
In order to get to know each other better as the camp began, the participants participated in various games, as well as co-created the camp's "combon".
A hike along the sea from Roja to Jocene took place on Wednesday, natural materials were collected along the way, which were later used to make cards.
There were also sports games, which are of particular importance to participants.
We went to an apartment home where we have a sports and recreation area, played football and a net ball.
Children like athletic activities, we have a lot of boys playing football, basketball, and every time they demand something athletic.
Girls like more peaceful activities.
On another day, with the help of a self-hardening mass, we decorated jars that could later be used as pencil holders.
There was also a talent evening, the children themselves chose who to perform with, and one evening was devoted to performances.
Board games were also played, each of them could show their knowledge during the photo orienteering, where objects had to be found and photographed with the pictures.
The task was to make different in each picture.
We also painted mandalas - some like it more, some less.
There will never be one lesson that everyone will like - sport is closer to one another, and creative lessons for another.
"Now it looks like everyone is enthusiastic about painting glass", explained Mr Folkmann.
At the end of the camp, diplomas on creativity, sportsmanship, as well as helpfulness were issued - several children helped directly in economic works.
The name of the camp "Varavīksne Bridges" has been created because of the participation of children from three associations - the Rojupe and Melnsila Children and Youth Initiative Centre, as well as the multifunctional centre "Strops" in Roja district.
They're such unifying bridges.
If the rojeants come up with something sooner, we borrow ideas; if the other way round, they borrow from us.
We share our experience.
This year 30 participants were involved in the camp - children who were active during the year.
"They expected there to be 30, and that's how it worked out", says Mr Folkmann.
The camp was in place for the fifth year.
It started in 2010, when Roja County Social Service decided that large families and children of poor families should organize camps in summer.
In the meantime, however, the situation in Roja has improved, and now the camp is intended for residents of the region who come and operate in youth centres.
The goal is to have meaningful and comprehensive leisure time.
Two camps were previously held and 20 children participated in each camp, but currently only one camp is being held due to the reduction of the number of children in the country as a whole.
Similar activities take place during the rest of the year.
Children draw, paint glass, Einārs Kalniņš came to visit, who taught wood burning, machine making from wood, and sawed various shapes with a figure saw.
There is also a new technique - encaustics, it is painting with hot wax chalk.
Under the direction of the teacher Ilze Šelkova, there were classes in the formation of polymer material, we made coulombs and various dishes.
We make paintings from natural materials, interesting mandalas from beans, peas, linseeds, we collect leaves in autumn.
We're trying to use what's around us.
The youth centre works from 15.00 to 20.00 in winter, and from 14.00 to 20.00 in summer.
"The average attendance at the youth centre is 15 children a day," says Mr Folkmane.
She stresses that Roja County Council is very supportive, which understands the need to allocate funds to children because they shape our future.
A Charlton Athletic fan "can only get a season ticket if he signs a behavior contract" and will agree not to criticize the club on social media.
Although we acknowledge that everyone has the right to his or her own personal opinion, the publication of confusing comments on such websites is not good.
A fan working in the administration was then told that he would have to receive a ticket in person from former police senior inspector Cliff Iger, who joined the club last month after a 35-year career in the police force.
The letter goes on to say, "I must inform you that the award of a season ticket will be renewed for you on condition that you sign the 'Connected Behavior Contract' (ABC), which will state that you will refrain from publishing in the future derogatory or confusing comments about the people representing the club or club on all kinds of social media websites, or any other kind of behavior that might be considered antisocial."
Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, the fan described how he called the club after paying a season ticket, which was never received, and a letter was received two days later by mail.
Yesterday, he went to a meeting at the club and said, "They told me I had "tweeted too much", causing others to tweet as well, which is funny."
Cycling holidays along the Dalmatian coast
What do you mean by the word "grace"?
I am driving here with all my strength," said Colin, a former U.S. naval commando who has just travelled 25 miles of cycling along the central part of a rough Croatian island, leaving nothing there, except a bucket of sweat and grass in the lush expression of sailors, anointed in the hostile mountains.
Some cyclists sing hymns or count kindergarten poems to get on the mountain more easily.
Colin's girlfriend Patty suggests The Little Engine That Could.
Others count rumbles or simply suffer in silence, wondering what it takes to end up in a trance-like state spoken of by hardened cyclists.
Colin's swearing is poisonous rather than diverse.
Driving a few yards ahead of her is as if chased by Hugh Grant as the beginning of the film Four Wedding and One Funeral.
Her and my mission is a week-long "luxury" yacht and cycling along the coast and islands of Croatian North Dalmatia organized by Freedom Treks.
Cycling in the summer heat in such a steep mountainous place as Croatia may not correspond to everyone's understanding of luxury, yet it is said that Northern Dalmatia is easier to drive out than Southern Dalmatia, our saddles are soft, and when we filled the booking forms, free and convincingly before all those months, there was a box that we didn't mark that could have provided us with a battery-charged e-bicycle.
The luxury part of the deal is our floating house for a week, brand new "Melody".
At the end of the trip, we can shack our bikes in front of our guides Ivana and Ivana and jump the hearing in the blue water at the stern of the ship, without encountering sea urchins, sharp stones and other people on the narrow stone lanes called the beach by Croats.
In June, the water temperature at sea is perfect, everyone agrees: cool enough to chill, but not cold.
On "Melody" there are masks and breathing pipes and some kayaks, either if someone feels energetic after a heavy morning on the saddles.
Instead, most of us return to our cabs with air-conditioned ones, where Helen, the ship's masseur - I'm not joking - will have already laid on our beds, topped up our mini-bar supplies, and left a new box with chocolates on the table.
Ivan says that stretching out after cycling is very important, and we learn to stretch out on our beds in the afternoon or the pillow-covered lounge chairs on the upper deck with the bartender Antonio, who is always ready to make some of his cocktails.
"Melody", 42 m long with 15 cabins and half a dozen crew, is not a famous superyacht, but a stylish small cruise ship.
It turns towards a small island port between fishing boats and fleet holiday yachts, and we are proud to belong to it.
Colin and Patty belong to a group of meetup.com friends from Washington, D.C. (in the District of Columbia): to sports and public activists after 45, as they call themselves.
Last year's barges and bicycle holidays in the Netherlands were so successful that they decided to try something even richer for adventure, and so they are in Croatia.
The rival chapel from their church is on a boating and bicycle holiday in Provence, and every afternoon air is thickened by a competitive Facebook publication ping-pong rally.
An element of holiday adventure can be exaggerated, because our schedule is nothing unless a specific regime is set.
"The brocades and dinner are at eight," Ivan told the new attendees at the inaugural meeting when we started our way from the beautiful old port of Trogir, located near Split.
One of the ship's bells indicates that the buffet is open, while the other calls for silence at the end of the meal and listens carefully to further information.
"Good morning!" is a cultural context that may have been lost everywhere but not in the British contingent.
There's a difference - the fun has already picked up, the jokes fall from the horn of abundance, while Ivana gives out the day's excursion maps, but we all pretend that we are frightened by swinging, blurring contours and profiles with highs and lows, although anything else would be a surprise for the Croatian bike race, which starts and ends at sea level.
"It's like a heart monitor," says Ivan.
Complete smoothness is not recommended.
Ivan leads the information meeting in parallel, freely switching from English to German.
There are weeks when he has to deal with a dozen different nationalities, but we are a simple group - the Swiss, the Germans, the Americans and the British, who easily sit at tables during meals, where two speak English and one speak German.
On the road, we're all friends.
Cycling promotes comradeship, and the only competition is within, namely with itself.
I do not remember when the group's dynamics would have been more harmonious and relaxed.
Soon we're tuned on Ivan's wave.
A small climb is a slope that should not be confused with roughness, which is a good thing.
Matadatas are serpentines and straight forward means straight: simple, but not always easy.
Cycling instructions are always the same: "Ride one by one, keep the distance, and it's not a race.
I'll meet you on the quay at nine.
All right, five couples - I forgot you're on holiday.
Take a lot of water with you.
From Trogir, let's go on a two-day cruise north through the Kornati Archipelago, where almost the whole length of the trip is to Dugi Otok - in Croatian "long island" - and after a little nap, let's take a walk through Telašcica Nature Park to admire its steep cliffs and salt lake, where sea water flows through the underground canal.
It is said that those who swim in it, thanks to its strength, are getting younger.
If we paddle through it, will our feet feel younger and stronger?
On the small island of Molata, we turn south again, jumping from the continent to the nearby islands by seemingly chance.
Most of our trips are on empty small roads on the country's outskirts with extensive views of the sea and diverse vegetation: olive groves, vineyards, sharp vegetal briskets, Mediterranean smells in the air and countless butterflies in flight.
As we go forward, there is always a breeze, but when Ivan makes stop, there is always a big shadow, and the small puddles are like a reward for those who have come faster.
Sports and social activists take many bike trips on weekends, and they know the standards of conduct, sending out warnings through the queue and leaving vacant spaces so that motorists can perform overtaking manoeuvres much more safely.
"You were almost hit," one cyclist says to the other after the driver of the truck decided to perform an overtaking manoeuvre in an opaque bend and braked rapidly.
Luckily, the brakes worked.
Ivan divides us into three groups every piece of a short section of driving on the main roads, with Ivan at the very rear to encourage and "put the pace" as Ivan says.
If you have to cross the main road, we all get together, get off the bikes and get safe after switching with our bikes on the other side as instructed, not before.
"Do you think Ivan is aware that he is not talking to a group of children?" asks a Swiss cyclist when we stand on the side of the road and wait for the signal when we can cross it.
Not the whole afternoon can be spent on relaxing.
A survey of the city in Zadar reveals a Roman forum and a marine organ playing music that sounds like a moaning of a imprisoned marine monster, through pipes embedded in stone in the promenade and open water.
Zadar's famous sunset falls perfectly between the main dish and pudding, and after dark we return to the sea organ and watch the wave-powered lamp in the game's glass trotuary, which is actually the dance floor.
When "Melody" starts its way to the bustling Biograd resort early in the morning, the organ song is nothing more than a whisper.
On the fifth day we are completely free from cycling.
A trip up the River Krka estuary to see its waterfalls; then an afternoon tour of Sibenik, where we see the thought cathedral, the masterpiece of the Dalmatian Renaissance, as well as a twilight-time walk through the peaceful island of Zlarin, looking for its local treasure choir, make this day interesting.
Lurda prepares to welcome pilgrims in the shadow of attacks
People gather at the shrine of Our Lady of Lurd during the annual Catholic pilgrimage.
French security forces are in high alert readiness as thousands of Catholics gather at the Shrine of Lurd on an annual pilgrimage in the shadow of several acts of terror.
Each year on August 15, tens of thousands of people gather at the shrine at the foot of the Pyrenees Mountains to celebrate the Ascension Festival to celebrate the reception of the virgin Mary in heaven.
This year's pilgrimage comes at a time when Catholics are shocked by the killing of an elderly French priest on 26 July by two Islamic extremists who invaded the church in northern France during Mass and cut his throat.
The murder of Jacques Amel took place two weeks after a Tunisian -- investigators say he was radicalized by the Jihadist online footage -- crashed into a truck in a Bastille Day celebration crowd in the city of Riviera, Nice, killing 85 people.
After three large-scale attacks in 18 months, many French people are cautious about attending public events.
The number of tourists declined dramatically, and the authorities feared that the number of pilgrims this year could plummet.
However, fear of mass withdrawals did not materialize -- and some organizers say there has been even an influx of visitors' applications at the last minute.
The arrival of some 25 000 believers is expected, including large groups from Italy and Belgium and a delegation of approximately 200 Orthodox representatives from the Eastern branch of Christianity.
Many pilgrims have stated that they will not be intimidated.
"We don't mean to stop living," a 66-year-old visitor, Christian, told AFP agency, describing prayer as "the only weapon" in the fight against violence.
"It's important to show that life continues," said Matier Guinar - one of the coordinators.
We will not give up our faith, our beliefs, and our way of life just because some fanatics are trying to sow fear.
Due to security concerns in France, several large-scale events have been cancelled since the attack in Nice, including a huge stock market in the northern city of Lille and the European Cycling Championships on the highway, which was to take place in Nice in September.
"Last week, I live in fear that my phone will call in one call to withdraw applications," Fabien Ležesne said last weekend - the priest in charge of the official pilgrimage process.
"On the contrary - it seems that the attacks have mobilized believers," he said and announced the influx of last-minute applications.
The head of the local hotel workers' trade association, Christian Göll, confirmed "an increased interest" in pilgrimage following the attacks.
Around the holy place where the virgin Mary was said to have appeared in the grotto in 1858 to a poor shepherd, Bernadette Subirou, there were extremely strict security measures set.
Approximately 250 police officers and two dozen soldiers have been assigned to protect the site, including bomb neutralization experts and experts with explosive search dogs.
As pilgrims thronged through security barriers, bags were checked at the entrance, with access points reduced from twelve to three.
Catherine Simcox, who traveled from northeast England on a pilgrimage to Lurd earlier this month, described the reinforced security measures.
"By Thursday morning, there were armed security guards in the shrines, and then through the gate (with metal barriers) only could enter one by one, as well as the bags were searched," she told The Local.
"This all frightened my three children, who are used to Lourda, and it was hard not to scare them when they asked why this was happening," she said.
It hasn't ruined my impressions, but I became sad at the fact that it was necessary, and I realized that many people were calmed down by these measures.
The route of Friday's opening procession has also been shortened - instead of starting in the city of Lurd and moving on to the shrine, it will begin and end in the shrine.
Other measures include closing airspace to flights over Lurd, closing streets near a traffic sanctuary, and replacing garbage bins for transparent plastic bags.
French Interior Minister Bernar Kazenev will test the security measures on Saturday.
About six million people travel to Lurda a year, making it one of the largest Catholic pilgrimage destinations in the world.
Many visitors lead relatives who are sick or disabled and who come to swim in a spring cave in which Bernadette reportedly saw Mary, believing in the healing properties of water.
Thierry Castijo, one of the organizers, described this year's gathering as "a little unusual", given the "threat as the roots seem to be in France."
However, he claimed that this would not affect the quality and depth of their experiences.
Françoise, a 58-old volunteer who helped sick pilgrims, admitted that, in her opinion, the presence of soldiers dressed in civilian clothing was "a little depressing."
However, if it soothes everyone, it's good.
Zaragoza shopping centre shooting two injured
Two people were seriously injured after a man opened fire at a shopping mall in Zaragoza in northeastern Spain.
The incident occurred at 11 o'clock Friday morning at the man- full Aragonia shopping centre in Zaragoza.
Initial reports suggest that the gunman might have shot a woman who might be his former partner.
After the shooting, the armed criminal fled, and is currently being sought after by police.

The opening of the waterfowl hunting season is approaching.
A waterfowl hunting season is opened annually on the second Saturday of August.
This year it will begin on 13 August at 16:00, therefore the State Police calls both hunters and residents to be particularly careful and to comply with the security rules.
Waterfowl hunting takes place not only in hunting areas, but also in public water bodies, and although weather conditions do not promise heat like other years, it is permissible that these water bodies will be used by holidaymakers together with hunters.
We encourage hunters, holidaymakers and those living near water bodies to be particularly cautious about lakes and rivers and to comply with safety rules, thus not endangering themselves or others.
As in previous years it has been observed that during the first days of the season, a large number of hunters are involved in waterfowl hunting, the State Police in cooperation with the State Forest Service will also carry out reinforced hunting control this year.
Law enforcement officers during the control will pay attention to compliance of arms and ammunition movement with the norms of the law, as well as will monitor that the hunting process takes place without the influence of alcoholic beverages and intoxicating substances.
The police recall that the use of semi-automatic firearms with a total capacity of more than three patrons in waterfowl hunting is prohibited, including the attention to amendments to the Arms and Specialities Movement Act, in particular Article 22 (91), which states that persons with long firearms or large-energy pneumatic weapons registered for hunting or sport and during a short stop for up to two hours when they are being transported to or from hunting have the right to store the weapon and ammunition in the vehicle during the hunt, but must be placed in the safest place possible so that the case or other packaging containing the ammunition or weapon is not visible from the outside of the vehicle, is located behind locked doors and is equipped with an alarm device, thus ensuring that they do not accidentally enter into the hands of unauthorised persons.
Police call to take care of the safety of your and your fellow people during the hunting season, and if you see any violations or threats to security, we call 110 immediately.
In the event of any threat, law enforcement officers are ready to respond to the information provided by citizens.
The New Caledonian coast is shaken by a 7.2-magnitude earthquake
The New Caledonian coast was rocked by a 7.2-magnitude earthquake on Friday, reported by seismologists, indicating that there were no tsunami threats.
The epicenter of the earthquake was located at a depth of nine kilometers 109 kilometers east of New Caledonia, Ilantaire at 1.26 Greenwich time (at 4:26 p.m. Latvian time), stated the U.S. Geological Research Centre.
The Pacific Tsunami Alert Center indicated that there were no warnings or recommendations at this point in time regarding a possible tsunami threat to the region.
"The earthquakes in this region are not known to be unusual, nor are the activities unusual lately", said Phil Cummins, senior seismologist at the research center Geoscience Australia.
Potentially it could be felt in the Vanuatu or New Caledonian Islands, however, I doubt whether it is so strong as to cause damage.
New Caledonia is in the "Fire Circle" - a zone of Pacific tectonic activity where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur frequently.
Colombia and Venezuela agree to open the border.
Colombia and Venezuela agreed to open checkpoints on the border of the two countries, which closed on Venezuela's initiative a year ago, were told on Thursday by Colombian and Venezuelan presidents Juan Manuel Santos and Nicholas Maduro.
Initially, border posts will only be open to pedestrians.
From Saturday, five border posts will be open every day from 8 AM to 20 PM.
It will be possible to open the border to transport once certain international agreements on security, trade and energy have been concluded, said the Presidents.
Maduro ordered the border to be closed last August in response to an attack by Colombian militants on the Venezuelan border patrol.
Three Venezuelan soldiers were wounded in this attack.
In July this year, Venezuela unilaterally opened the border twice due to a sharp economic crisis - Venezuelans in poverty tried to break through the border to buy essential goods in border shops.
200,000 Venezuelan citizens took advantage of this opportunity.
This time, time for our one of the prides of Latvia, the sympathetic Madara Palameika.
Madara Palameika was born on June 18, 1987 in Talsi.
She is a Latvian athlete who competes in the javelin throw competition.
Her coach is Father Gint Palameik.
Latvian record holder in the javelin throw.
She participated in the 2012 Summer Olympics, participated several times in the World and European Championships (highest place 4th place captured at the 2014 European Championships), won 3rd place overall in the 2015 Diamond League.
"Facebook" applies to fight ad blockers.
The world's most used social network, Facebook, has broadcast a kind of warning shot, suggesting that blocking advertising banners using special tools is unacceptable and users will also have to watch ads.
The popularity of special advertisers is increasing, but this means that companies whose main source of income is advertising are declining.
Facebook has now revealed that it understands the annoying nature of advertising banners, but users will have to live with them in the same way.
It is true, however, that they will be provided with tools to be able to choose for themselves what type of material is being shown to them, reports the BBC.
"As we provide more and more control to people, we will also start showing ads to those who use ad blocking software", said Facebook ad business vice president Andrew Bosworth.
In other words, users will be able to choose the type of ads they see by selecting brands and industries that they find interesting.
"People don't like to see ads that don't apply to them or interfere with enjoying content", remarked Bosworth.
Ad blocking tools on mobile devices usually do not work, from which Facebook gets the biggest attendance, but their reduction in banner exposure is also worth billions in monetary terms.
According to the BBC, advertising blockers are used by around 200 million people.
It has already been reported that in the previous quarter of the business year, Facebook's revenue from advertising was US$6.2 billion, or €5.55 billion.
It should be said that this is not the first time Facebook has been actively involved in determining what network users see in their news streams.
As one of the last steps, Facebook has just begun to act to remove or at least limit "sound" headlines from news streams, behind which is actually hiding "empty" messages.
At night, asphalt works will be performed on Brivibas Street; traffic restrictions must be taken into account.
On Brīvības street from Bērzaunes Street to Gustavs Zemgals Gatve, asphalt laying works will be carried out tonight, therefore drivers have to take into account limited traffic on this street.
As the agency LETA learned in Riga City Council, traffic restrictions on this section will start from 21 o'clock tonight and asphalt works will last until 12 August at 7.
Traffic towards Juglu will be diverted along the tram tracks.
Drivers have to take into account limited traffic at this stage and additional time spent travelling.
The municipality calls for awareness of the restrictions introduced and compliance with the order of traffic organization.
Restoration of the cover has started on the main streets of the capital city - Brīvības Street from Raina Boulevard to Lāčplēša Street and from Air Bridge to Jugla Street, Lāčplēša Street from Salu Bridge to Avot Street, Juglas Street from Kvēle to Maliena Street and Lielvārdes Street from Dzelzavas Street to Secondary School No 84.
The construction works will last until the beginning of the new school year and are organized continuously, also during the night hours, when asphalt laying is mostly carried out.
Medvedev's deputy met secretly with several ZZS ministers in Riga.
Arkady Dvorkovic, Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev, met secretly with three ministers of the Union of Greens and Farmers (ZZS) at a fish processing plant during his visit to Riga last week.
The informal meeting took place at the fish processing factory "Kaija", and the Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola, the Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis and the Minister of Agriculture Jānis Dūklavs participated in the meeting, according to the Internet portal "skaties.lv".
The fact that such a meeting has taken place has been confirmed to the portal by Reizniece-Ozola.
She explained that during the meeting there was talk about lifting of sanctions for fish processors, as well as about Inčukalns gas storage.
The meeting, contrary to diplomatic practice, was held without the involvement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The organiser of the meeting was Alexander Vesnyakov, the Ambassador of Russia.
Suspects of more than €130,000 embezzlement detain the accountant.
The State Police (SP) Economic Crime Combating Administration (ENAP) this month has detained an accountant from one of the Riga commercial companies, who has worked in the company for 20 years, from embezzlement of 130 thousand, BNS representative Gita Gžibovska informed the agency.
Current information shows that the suspect woman has been committing illegal activities for several years and, together, has caused more than €130,000 in damages to the company.
Given that the company's officials had not carefully followed the cash flow and trusted their employee, they only learned about the ongoing machinations several years later.
VP ENAP police officers this month detained the suspect woman born in 1963 and conducted searches in the company.
Criminal proceedings for embezzlement, if committed on a large scale, have been initiated in relation to the incident.
The law provides for deprivation of liberty for up to ten years when confiscating property or without confiscation of property.
The detained person is currently subject to a non-custodial security measure.
In Estonia, Zika virus antibodies were detected in nine people.
In Estonia, nine people have been tested for Zika virus antibodies, which means that they may have come into contact with the infection, says Estonian public broadcaster ERR.
The information provided by the laboratory shows that this year Zika virus tests were carried out on 121 samples and nine of them were positive.
The first cases of Zika have been reported in Finland and Sweden in countries nearby from Estonia.
According to the Estonian Health Administration, no acute cases of Zika virus infection have been recorded in the country and in the case of flu-like symptoms, people do not have to take the Zika virus test, but they have to approach their family doctor.
We have found IgG (immunoglobulin G class) antibodies that show that the test person is infected with Zika or similar virus at some point.
"This does not mean that the patient has contracted Zika virus", explained Paul Naber, head of the infectious diseases department at the laboratory's Synlab.
The Zika virus is transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus "Aedes".
In Latvia there is a problem with the development of high-quality car procurement, said Ingus Rūtins, Vice President of the Auto Association, in an interview with the BNS agency.
Asked whether problems with dumped prices were apparent in the car sector, Rūtins replied in the affirmative.
Sure.
Car purchases, however, differ from service purchases where prices are easier to manipulate.
In any event, the car has to pay a certain amount in the end, as it has to be purchased from the manufacturer.
However, the problem is and can be classified into two groups.
Either the procurer is incompetent and unable to establish a high-quality procurement, resulting in "buying" without real awareness of it.
"Or very conscious procurement is being built to get something concrete, and there are all sorts of miracles there," said the Vice President of the Auto Association.
He pointed out that at the moment it is popular to talk about moving away from the lowest price offer to the most economically advantageous offer as a criterion for determining the winner of the procurement, but in some society there is still a misconception about these things.
Now it is very popular - let's go from the lowest price to the most economically advantageous offer!
However, the criteria must be established in both cases and, once taken into account and assessed, the decision is nevertheless taken on the basis of the lowest price principle.
In qualitative procurement, the technical criteria should be very precise and market-conform.
Points should not be used to assess anything that can be expressed in monetary terms.
Points should not assess fuel consumption, emissions, service services and similar things.
You have to know the life cycle of the car, the mileage, etc., then you can simply count everything together.
"The question then is only about which of the scenarios the customer himself is interested in?" Rūtins explained.
In turn, the project manager of the Auto Association Pēteris Rubulis noted that problems are related to the fact that often the same person creates purchases for cars, work gloves and food, and these purchases are derived from the same model.
We have also been brought to the consultation for spare parts for procurement samples, which, other than a detailed absurdity, was difficult to call.
"The problem is that the compiler of the procurement very often lacks any understanding of the subject matter of the procurement and demands are simply being copied from somewhere", Rubulis admitted.
Rutins, on the other hand, added that the smaller the structure that announces the procurement, the greater the problems.
"Obviously, this is precisely because of a lack of human resources and expertise", said the Association's vice president.
Latvian volleyball players do not get to fight for medals.

Die Antwoord accuses the "Self-Death Unit" of stealing the style.
South African band Die Antwoord has accused the director of the film Suicide Sqaud ("The Suicide Unit") on Thursday of using the band's unique look without permission, calling the respected director "a tiny frightened bitch".
The band's lead singer, Jolandi, has approached the film studio Warner Bros director on the mobile app Instagram, stating, "That's right, David Ajer, you're stealing our style".
As she claims, the film stars Kara Delavinja and Jared Leto reportedly told that Ayer had awe of "Die Antwoord" in the filming field.
"But you didn't ask permission to cheat us", the singer indicated.
The 31-year-old musician claims that her bandmate, Ninja, has texted Ayer on the issue, but he "didn't answer anything, like such a tiny frightened bitch".
Yolandi insists that Ayer recovered the scenes from the introductory cadres of the 2011 short film Umshini Wam, which shows a South African hip hop duo.
She also published a video which allegedly proves that Ayer got the characters of Joker and Harley Quine out of the appearance of both singers.
Leto himself insists that the image of the inspiration Joker is based on the image of rock musician David Bowie.
Yolandi has, at the end of her claim, sided with the harsh criticism the film earned after its premiere.
Yolandi and Ninja, in the real names Henri du Tuata and Watkin Tudor Jones, gained fame with three rap studio recordings promoting the African "Zef" counterculture.
For the first time in Latvia there will be an opportunity to hear the gypsy celebration and jazz guitarist ensemble "The Rosenberg Trio" (Dutch) tonight, on August 12, at the festival "Summertime" - invites Inese Galante.
The virtuoso ensemble will play the world's best known guitarist piece, in which the music of different nations and countries is intertwined.
The trio on the stage of Dzintari Concert Hall will be joined by Johnny Rosenberg - a unique performer of Frank Sinatra's repertoire and at the same time a masterful jazz guitarist.
Inspired by the legendary guitarist Django Reinhardt and steadily developing his nature-given musicality, it is Rosenbergs today who embodies the very essence of gypsy lead and jazz.
All members of the ensemble are cousins whose names decorate the affishes of leading jazz festivals, and many of the albums recorded by the Trio have earned Platinum and Golden Disc status.
The melody aches, the special guitar sound, the inimitable string vibrato, the years-milled interplay and the sense of ensemble are the characteristics why Rozenbergs have been invited to join Randy Crawforde, Lučano Pavarotti, Shirley Bacey and other world celebrities in their concerts.
The trio are also welcome guests at Carnegie Hall in New York City, the large concert halls of Los Angeles, Vienna, Montreal, and other cities.
"Summertime" festival will feature a chanting voice owner, songwriter and guitarist Johnny Rosenberg (Netherlands) with the ensemble.
Johnny gained widespread recognition as a singer in 2010 thanks to his sensational participation in the television show Voice of Holland, where he instantly became a favorite of the public.

Turkey seeks out missing diplomats after coup attempt
Turkey is seeking at least 32 diplomats, who did not return with the staff withdrawn after the 15 July coup attempt.
Foreign Minister Mevits Chavušogls said on Friday that 208 Turkish ministry workers were withdrawn from jobs around the world for the duration of the coup attempt investigation to Ankara, and 32 have disappeared "without permission".
About 18,000 civilians, military leaders and academics have been arrested or withdrawn from their positions in Turkey, with the government considering them loyal to U.S. incumbent official Fetulla Gulen, whom it accuses of drafting a government overthrow plan.
Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania, is on Turkey's list of the most wanted people.
Kavosoglu said that a team from the U.S. Department of Justice would come to Turkey later this month to discuss his possible extradition.
This issue has become a problem in US relations with Turkey, a member of NATO.
The U.S. opposed Turkish President Recep Tajjip Erdogan's strong-arms tactics after the coup, and Turkey responded by trying to establish closer ties with Russia.
Kavosoglu said that the Turkish military attachés in Greece had fled to Italy, the attaché in Kuwait attempted to escape to Saudi Arabia, but were sent back, and two generals from Afghanistan were caught in Dubai and sent to Turkey.
He also said that two officials in Bangladesh fled to New York, and one of Russia went to Japan.
The Ankara newspaper Daily Hurryiet, citing military sources, informed that the Turkish military attaché in Jordan was also missing.
The Wall Street Journal, citing a U.S. official who is aware of the situation, reported that a Turkish military officer based at the NATO command center in Virginia had requested asylum in the United States.
There are those who have managed to escape.
There have also been refugees among our diplomats," said NTV, a broadcaster, in an interview with Kavosoglu.
Since yesterday, time has run out for those who were originally withdrawn.
We will take legal action against those who did not return.
Olympic organizers are trying to clean the greenish hues of the diving pool
Olympic divers scheduled for training on Friday arrived at a closed pool as organizers needed more time to clear the water of greenish hues before the first individual competition at the Rio Olympics.
The water suddenly changed color on Tuesday, in the midst of synchronized diving competitions.
Organizers claimed that the water race was safe even after a larger adjacent pool for water polo and synchronized swimming, also stained lightly greenish.
Diving was not yet possible when athletes arrived for the morning warm-up, although finally the pool was opened at 13.00 local time - just 2 1/2 hours before the women's 3 metre race.
The color of the water looked closer to its usual color, yet still with a greenish hue.
American diver Abby Johnston, who competes on a tramp, told her that she came on a warm-up only to learn that the pool had been closed without any warning.
She wrote on Twitter that "#FixTheSwamp (correct the swamp) should be in fashion.
British diver Tom Daley, who won bronze in synchronized platform diving, also commented on the condition of the pool on Twitter.
Hopefully that means we haven't dived in as very bad in the last few days!
Mario Andrada, the chief spokesman of the local committee of organizers, stressed that the pool was safe for the race, giving the green light to the 3 metre preliminary races.
He agreed that water interfered with some athletes, however, he said that it was the result of the cleaning efforts of the pool.
"We repeat repeatedly what we have been saying all the time - water in no way endangers the health of athletes," he said.
On the first day of such a water situation, one or two athletes complained that they had itchy eyes.
It was the result that the first reaction, when we saw water turn green, was to use one of the chemicals - chlorine - it is used very often in swimming pools.
We reduced the amount immediately.
We checked the water again, and that was completely in line with the parameters.
Simon Langford, chief spokesman for the Mary Lenck Water Sports Center, said that the pool was closed for additional cleaning work.
He said that the decision was supported by the world's leading organization, FINA (International Swimming Federation).
"The reason is that the water must be calm so that the pool can get its blue paint again as soon as possible," Langford said in his statement.
Andrada said that the deterioration of the pool situation surprised the organizers unprepared.
"Chemistry is not an exact science," he said.
Some things, as you can see, lasted.
During the last few days, getting rainwater paint in normal condition made it even more difficult.
"Things don't work," Andrada said.
He added that athletes had access to dry workouts in the morning, however, he admitted that it "wasn't ideal."
He explained that the colour change in the basin was elevated due to alkalin levels, much like the water of the aquarium can become green if not properly monitored.
When we started doing something about green paint, there were discussions about the best chemicals.
We can't use too many chemicals in the water because athletes are training in it," Andrada said.
We could certainly have done better at the beginning to prevent the water from becoming green.
When it turned green, we made a mistake again.
AP sports reviewers Jay Cohen and Steve Wade took part in the making of this plot in Rio.
Shanghai, Taipei, despite stopping cross-border communication, however, will hold a forum
Shanghai and Taipei, however, will host the annual urban forum from August 22 to 23 in Taipei, announced by Shanghai Municipality on Friday, despite the suspension of cross-border communication mechanisms.
High-level municipal official Sha Hailin, on behalf of Shanghai Mayor Yang Xiong, will lead the delegation represented in the forum, announced by the Shanghai government on its official microblog account Sina Weibo.
Both cities have been holding the forum on a rotational basis since 2010.
The 2016 forum will focus on sharing experiences in areas such as health care, electronic administrative services, culture and transport, seeking to "in depth exchange of experiences and cooperation in different aspects" between the two cities, as reported by the Shanghai government.
The Taiwanese side has not recognised the agreement reached in 1992, which strengthened the one-China principle since the new leader Tsai Ing-ven took office in May, resulting in suspension of communication and consultation mechanisms.
Ma Ksiaoguangs , a state council spokesman for the Taiwan Office of Affairs on land, said Friday that peaceful cross-border relations may exist while the Taiwanese side adheres to the political foundations of the 1992 agreement.
"We have an active and open attitude towards the exchange of experiences between cities on both sides," said the MA stressing that the nature of cross-border relations and exchange of experiences between cities should be interpreted correctly.
Ugandan President meets China's foreign minister, hopes for closer cooperation
On Thursday, during a meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Ji, Ugandan President Joveri Museveni thanked China for its continued Ugandan development support and expressed his hope for closer cooperation.
Museveni said China was an old friend of Uganda and Africa who supported the African continent's liberation from colonialism and later supported Africa's economic and social development.
The President mentioned the construction of the Tanzania - Zambian railway in the 1970s as evidence of China's generous support, which was provided even when China itself was not very prosperous.
Museveni said that China had implemented multilateral cooperation with Uganda through both investment in infrastructure and business and cultural exchanges, and added that this kind of cooperation contributed to Uganda's long-term development more than just financial assistance.
He hopes that China will be able to engage in the development of Uganda's infrastructure and the construction of industrial parks in various ways.
He also invites the Chinese to invest more in and touring Uganda.
Wang Ji commended Uganda's work in the areas of industrialization and agricultural modernization and added that China would continue to be the most reliable and ideal cooperation partner of Uganda.
Wang stated that China was prepared to do everything possible to help implement Uganda's economic and social development, and added that China-Uganda cooperation was genuine and without any political considerations, as it was based on a high level of political credibility and time-tested friendship.
He said China could strengthen cooperation with Uganda in the construction of infrastructure and industrial parks, as well as supporting the development of the energy and agricultural industries of this East African nation.
