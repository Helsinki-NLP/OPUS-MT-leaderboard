In the PALM study, ZMapp was a control, namely, it was used by scientists as a baseline measure and compared three other treatments with this agent.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, this theory was already widespread, but also provides information that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional placement.
Scientists say that this animal's plumage was chestnut-brown at the top and carotenoid at the bottom.
This find also provides insight into the development of bird feathers.
Since dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed shank called a barrel, but have the other characteristics inherent in the feathers, namely rays and rays, the researchers concluded that the barrel was likely born in a later phase of evolution than these characteristics.
Feathers structure suggests that they were not used in flight, but rather to regulate or show temperature. Researchers pointed out that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the plumage of adult birds rather than the fluffs of a baby.
The researchers suggested that although this is a new dinosaur tail, the sample shows adult plumage rather than baby fluffs.

The work done was mainly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made by Sagittarius' galaxy.
The effect sought by the team could be caused by the tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon acts on the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way acts on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists could conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
This theory says that most dark matter around the galaxy lies around the galaxy in a kind of halo, and is made of many small particles.

Their thermal operational properties are not as persistent as the large caves on Earth, which often maintain fairly constant temperatures, but it is appropriate that they are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Service (USGS) astrology task force and Northern Arizona University, located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, many technologies have never been used in the election: voters enter the booth, place the printed page with the desired candidate in the envelope.
After officials have verified the identity of the voter, the voter throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs into the voting register.
The French electoral law sets a fairly strict order of precedence with regard to the electoral process.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have to be transparent so that voters and observers can testify that they do not have any envelopes at the start of the election and that no envelopes other than duly registered and mandated voter envelopes are added.
Candidates can send representatives to observe every part of the process. In the evening, volunteers count votes under tight supervision, following certain procedures.

UN peacekeepers who arrived in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake are being blamed for the spread of the disease that began near the troop settlement.
According to the information available at the trial, the waste was not properly disinfected in the UN camp, thereby causing the bacteria to enter one of Haiti's largest river, the Artibonite tributary.

The victims were Nicholas Alden, 25, and Zachary Kudebak, 21. The driver was Kudebak.
Edgar Vegilla suffered hand and jaw injuries, while Christopher Schneider needed facial reconstructive surgery.
Uka's gun fired inaccurately when he aimed at the head of the fifth man. Schnaider has permanent pain, blindness of one eye, missing part of the skull, and the face restored from titanium.
Schneider passed the testimony via a video link from the USAF base in his home country.
Apart from Wednesday's event, Carpanedo competed in two individual championship runs.
In her first slalom race, she did not finish the first race. 36 of 116 rivals scored the same result in this race.
In other races, namely the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women's rides sitting with a total ride time of 4:41.30, which is 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-placed Austrian Claudia Loesch and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-placed Giongi Dani from Hungary.
Four skiers in women's rides sat did not finish their rides, and 45 of all 117 skiers did not rank in the rating table.
Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and cell phone.
Deputy Inspector General D. C. Aria said, "We have arrested five persons raped by a Swiss woman as well as having her cell phone and laptop recovered".
The accused are called Baba Kanjar, Bhuta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the defendants came to court with undercover faces.
Although there were three people in the house when a car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the crash occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services pulled the driver out of the red Audi TT.
He was hospitalized from the beginning at James Paget Hospital in Greitjarmouth.
He was then transferred to Adebruck Hospital, Cambridge.
Adekoja has since been in custody of the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court on charges of murdering his son.
She is in custody pending the filing of the indictment and the trial, but the testimony given by eyewitnesses will probably be invalid as her picture has been widely published.
It is a common practice elsewhere in Britain, but the Scottish justice system operates differently, and the courts have seen the publication of photos as potentially biased.
University professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee notes, "It seems that journalists are going through thin ice publishing photos of suspects and other information."
The Crown Prosecution Office, which is generally responsible for the charges, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made at least until the indictment.
According to the leak, the document will refer to a dispute over the borders that Palestine wants, based on the border situation prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Reportedly, topics such as the condition of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley, were also discussed.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the treaty was signed, but PI agrees to such presence for only five years.
Foresters had to carefully conduct gunmen who participated in an additional pest management trial, as this trial was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of the partnership between the NPWS and the Australian Association of Sports Shooters (NSW), and the Sports Shooters Association's hunting program, qualified volunteers were attracted.
According to the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), Acting Director of Parks Conservation and Heritage, Mick O'Flinn, a comprehensive safety briefing and training was conducted for the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation.
Martelli yesterday took the oath from the new Provisional Board of Elections (CEP), which consists of nine members.
It is Marteli's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Commission prompted an earlier CEP resignation as part of a package of measures designed to bring the country closer to new elections.
The Commission was Martelli's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Sometimes the violent protests were caused by the inability to hold elections, some since 2011.
About 60 cases of iPod malfunctions have been recorded due to overheating of the device, resulting in a total of six fires in which four people have suffered minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) says it has 27 accidents known to be related to these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating cases, which the company called "non-essential".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "extremely regrettable."
The earthquake struck Marian at 7:19 a.m. local time (Friday, 21:19 GMT).
The Northern Mariana Island Emergency Management Office stated that no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said that there was no evidence of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired on tourists with her M16 gun.
Several hostages have been released so far, but at least six have confirmed their deaths.
Six hostages were quickly released, including children and people in the years, as well as Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an older lady because she needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Ligin followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an axester and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
When he worked at the hospital, during his spare time, Ligin began to study premature childbirth.
His studies indicate that after administration of the hormone, it accelerates the maturation of the fetal lung.
Xinhua Agency reported that on Wednesday, government investigators had recovered two "black boxes" — flight data recorders.
Luna was also paid tribute by other wrestlers who were her associates.
Tommy Dreymer said, "Luna was the first queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night when two months were seen. Quite unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin Rannell, known as "Goldust", commented that "Luna was as strange as I...maybe even more strange...loves her and I'll miss her...hope she's come to a better place now."
Of the 1,400 residents polled before the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposed to the transformation of Australia as a republic had increased by 8 percent compared to 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic after the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
This view is 34% of the poll respondents who want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
Controversial results of the poll show that 29% of those polled believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist had to swim in the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his training is questioned due to his complaints.
He was not allowed to take medication to relieve pain because they are painkillers banned in these games.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
By early February, this discovery was verified by several people using various hardware and software, and announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets have brought water to Earth directly along with organic substances that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially when comet collisions with Earth occurred a long time ago.
Kuomo, 53, began his activities as governor earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the rumors "political chatter and nonsense."
Assumptions are made that he will claim in the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would allow the aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology rather than older ground radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate pilots with greater accuracy and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No addition of additional vehicles is planned, surface trains at Wembley Stadium will not stop, but parking and "parking and driving" facilities at this location will not be available.
Fear of lack of transport increased the chance that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published on Thursday in Science magazine reported the formation of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University, U.S.A., and Uppsala University, Sweden, reported that the new species originated within only two generations, although such a process was thought to be going on well longer given the breeding among the endemic Darwin finches (Geospiza fortes) and the immigrant cactus finches (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be spilled in all forms. It can be rolled out even in very small forms.
It can be stretched like a small wire that can be bent and twisted. It can be forged or formed by sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to another metal. It may be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn images in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of the chemical. You can create an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes colour depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The PH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen (H-letter in the compound pH) ions in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have separated electrons (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then squeeze them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The humidity of the hands will react with the outer layers, which will create a strange feeling and form a kind of sheath.
In the towns of Harap and Mohenjodaro, almost every house had a water lavatory toilet attached to a complex sewer system.
Waste water system remains have been found in the homes of the towns of Minoi, Crete, and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets were also in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women went together in mixed society.
Calling someone who's several thousand miles away, you're using a satellite.
In space, the satellite receives a call and then almost immediately reflects it back.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere twists some of our light and view.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space requires a huge rocket over 100 feet in height.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us - it provides us with a much simpler and faster transport.
This has given us trains, cars and many other vehicles.
There are then several medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray domestic cats) who eat much more of a wide variety of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of a niche - a special task which every cat performs and which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats living in large groups called swarms.
The bar consists of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and juveniles.
Females are usually closely related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion hordes behave like wolf or dog hordes — the behavior of these two animals is surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not other large cats) — and are just as deadly to their victims.
The athletic tiger is able to climb (though not too well), swim, make long jumps and pull with five times as much force as a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (a genus of panthers) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the roar of the lion's full voice, but rather like the sentence of numbing, scattered words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If there is a chance, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all animals hunted by ocelots are much smaller than their own.
Scientists think that ocelots track and find animals for eating (hunting) by smell, smelling their traces left on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision ability and also very stealthy to move around. Oceloti hunts for his prey, merging with the surrounding area, then throwing on top of the prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they came (for example, if they move through a mountain range or river or move to a new island so that they cannot so easily move back), they will often end up in an environment other than that in which they were earlier.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be stronger competitors than they were supposed to have in the past.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adjustment as before.
As young people adapt to their new environment, they are becoming less and less like the rest of the population.
After thousands or millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they will not be able to be called a single species.
We call this process a speciation, which only means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, but absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants absorb their nutrients from the sun using photosynthesis. They also provide a shadow.
We build our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Mozazaur was the largest predator in his day, so he was not afraid of anything except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws contained more than 70 very sharp teeth, supplemented by extra teeth in the palate of the mouth, and so no one who got on its way had the chance to escape.
We don't know exactly, but it probably had a fork-like tongue. It had turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs on its diet, and it may even have been cannibal.
It also attacked everything that came into the water; a huge dinosaur like T. rex would not be dealt with.
Although we would be familiar with most Roman dishes, they also had some strange and unusual festive dishes, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and rodents, called sussurs.
Another difference was that the poor and women ate while sitting in chairs, while the rich men enjoyed hosting joint banquets in which they slept sideways during meals.
The ancient Roman diets certainly did not use products imported into Europe from America or Asia until later centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey meat.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be the home of the god.
People made donations to the gods, but the priests tried to indulge in the needs of the gods by organising ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open inner courtyard of the temple and beyond the inner sanctuary, to which only priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes special pyramidal towers called zicurates were built as part of the temple.
The upper part of the tower was a special shrine for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was less important.
The Jewish family lived out for the most part.
The women made food in the yard; the shops were simple open counters facing the street. The houses were built of stone.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so the wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. Ancient Scandinavian sagas say that Eric Rudais was exiled from Iceland for the murder, and as he went further west, discovered a land named Greenland.
Despite his discovery, however, the Eskimo tribes already lived there at that point.
Although each was a "scandinavian" state, there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have watched the film “National Treasures”, you can believe that the treasure map was drawn on the other side of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although something is written at the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The following words are written at the back of the Declaration of Independence: "Original Declaration of Independence, dated 4 July 1776." The text is seen at the bottom of the document inverted upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that this large parchment document (293⁄4 x 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up and buried shortly after its creation.
So that the note is likely to have been added simply as a label.
The origins of the D-day and subsequent struggles had liberated northern France, but the south was still not freed.
It was ruled by "Vichy France". These were the French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders rather than wage war with them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France; this invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces had liberated southern France and marched towards Germany.
Civilisation is a special culture made up of an extremely large group of people who live and work in collaboration with one another, namely society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin "civilis", meaning civil, associated with the Latin "civis", meaning citizen, and "civitas", meaning city or city state, and it also somehow defines the size of society.
Cities are the forerunners of nations.A culture of civilisation means the transfer of knowledge to several generations, a lasting influence of culture and its smooth spread.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving behind essential historical evidence, and are not recognized as complete civilizations.
During the War of the Revolution, thirteen states, based on the Constitution of the Confederation, first formed a weak central government, the only component of which was Congress.
Congress had no power to tax, and because there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state institutions, which were often unwilling to cooperate, in the hope that they would enact all the laws it passed.
It also did not have the power to repeal tax laws and tariffs between countries.
In order for the articles to be amended, unanimous consent from all states was required, but the states treated the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian football team, as well as the German football team, are the second most successful team worldwide, who has also won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
The most popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, voicing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, and the Italians compete in both the international and Olympic Games.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), placing Japan 7th among the world's largest islands.
Due to the fact that Japanese territory includes several islands, it is often called an "archipelago" from a geographical point of view.
Taiwan began in the 15th century, where passing European sailors write down the name of the island as "Ilha Formosa" or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in south-west Taiwan, beginning a transformation of the cereal cultivation practices of the local population and employing Chinese workers on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and announced the inclusion of Taiwan as a province in the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeating the first China-Japan War (1894-1895), the Qing dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it transferred sovereign power over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
The Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, namely the Intiuathana, the Sun Temple and the Three Window Temple.
Most of the buildings built on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better understanding of how they originally originated.
By 1976, thirty percent of the Machu Pikchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this point.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35 mm, which was the most common photo film size in the era of analog photofilms.
It is still being produced, but more importantly that its image proportions are now used in digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat confusing, 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to produce the simplest integer ratio) is 3:2.
Many generally accepted formats (such as the set of APS formats) match or are very similar to these image aspect relationships.
The much distorted and often mocked third-part law is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while preserving the order of the image.
It indicates that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three parts, both vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and influential, came under a magnificence.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion has united European countries, despite differing languages and traditions.
Its all-encompassing power affected absolutely everyone, from the king to the ordinary population.
One of the main Christian doctrines is that wealth must be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's money is intended specifically for this purpose.
The central power of the church has existed in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was being observed.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain launched a blockade of the German navy.
The strategy proved effective in stopping vital military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in several international treaties of the last two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters so that ships could not enter all parts of the ocean, which threatened even neutral ships.
As the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited submarine warfare.
In the 1920s—the majority of the population and peoples considered pacifism and isolation to be the most important.
After the horrors and atrocities of the war experienced in World War I, countries wanted to avoid a repeat of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to start the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Bachelor (his manager at the previous workplace) addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China there was a unique way of depicting different periods of time; every stage of China's development or every family in power was a different dynasty.
In addition, there was an unstable period of divided provinces between each dynasty. The most famous of these periods was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Yin dynasties.
During these periods, a fierce battle for the throne took place among many nobles.
The three-state stage was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of Ancient China, with thousands dying fighting for the most important place in the great palace of Sian.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of a metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the conviction that the state belongs to the people, not to one ruler.
In addition, after the Revolution posts, all male applicants could apply, which allowed the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applies to the military, as now the ranks of army were given on the basis of human characteristics rather than belonging to a certain order.
The French Revolution also inspired many other people of the oppressed working class of other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in transcendent issues. He often went to a cave that became known as Hira Cave on Nora (light) Hill to indulge in contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the spins of the ages, vividly demonstrates Muhammad's desire for spirituality.
The cave is located at one of the mountain peaks in the north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find it, even if someone knew it existed. When you get to the cave, you get completely isolated.
There is nothing more than a clear, beautiful sky above the head and many mountains all around you. From the inside of the cave, nothing much of the outside world can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid in Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exist today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century B.C.E., is one of the many huge pyramid structures built in honor of the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or "Necropolis of Giza" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead consists of several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Haops, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor the wives and family members of Haops.
bow up the sign looks like a V and a "lock down" looks like a clamp or square, which lacks the lower edge.
Up means that you have to start from the spire and the bow has to be pressed, down means that you should start at the handle (the place where your arm holds the bow) and the bow has to be pulled.
The upward movement of the bow usually produces a milder sound, while the downward movement is stronger and more convincing.
You can mark your grades, but remember that the printed grades are for good music, so you usually have to follow them.
Terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Mary Antoinette, their two little children (11-year-old Mary Teresa and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and King's sister Mrs. Elizabeth were forced back to Paris on 6 October 1789 due to a crowd of market wives from Versailles.
In a war surrounded by crowds, they went back to Paris, with people shouting threats to the king and queen.
A crowd of people forced the king and queen to open the carriage windows extensively.
At one point, a gang member waving the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The U.S. imperialist war expenses in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover most of the expenses, and interest on bonds on behalf of the Philippine government flowed through Wall Street bank houses.
Of course, the excess profit from the long exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the basic income of imperialism in the United States.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the environment that prompted the creation of the Order.
The era when events occurred is commonly called the Middle Ages - the period of European history in the 11, 12th and 13th centuries (1000 – 1300 C.E.).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the early Middle Ages, and the Middle Ages were followed by the late Middle Ages, ending around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice covers a wide range of ideas, from the advancement of technology or the technological imperative to the firm understanding that man's destiny is driven by the underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their expression in technology.
The majority of interpretations of technological determinism are divided into two main ideas: the development of technology itself goes largely beyond cultural or political influence and technology itself produces an "impact" on societies, and this effect is consequential rather than socially conditional.
For example, a car certainly contributes to the development of roads.
However, the national road network is not economically viable for only a small number of cars, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of using the car.
Large numbers of private cars also mean more accidents, resulting in the invention of new methods of repairing body damage in health care.
Romanticism largely possessed cultural determinism, stemming from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography affected people, and over time, culture and customs associated with the geographical region in question emerged, which were better than the laws arbitrarily imposed because they were in harmony with the place of society.
Just as Paris today is considered the world's fashion capital, Constantinople was also considered the capital of feudal European fashion.
It is known as a luxury goods center, from about 400 C.E. to about 1100 C.E.
Its status became less significant in the 12th century as the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices valued higher than those available in Byzantine markets.
It was during this time that Constantinople lost the name of the fashion capital, but Paris got it.
The Goth style gained popularity in the 10th–11th centuries and later in the 14th century.
At first, the Byzantine culture in the East was a major influence on clothing.
However, due to slow communication channels, fashion in the west may fall behind by 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its style. One of the greatest development achievements of the time was that as a result of the crusades, people began to use buttons to strengthen clothing.
Self-sufficiency farming is an agriculture carried out to produce enough food and to meet the needs of a farmer and his/her family only.
Self-sufficiency agriculture is a simple, often organic system in which seeds harvested in the ecoregion are used, along with crop rotation or other relatively simple methods to maximise yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in self-consumption farming, as is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel neglected in terms of societal standards, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can vary in age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of participants.
Properties that define a subculture as distinct may be a combination of linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or factors.
Subculture representatives often emphasize their belongings using a different and symbolic style, including fashion, manners, and jargon.
One of the most common techniques used to illustrate the importance of socialization is examples of unfortunate cases of children whose parents failed to provide socialization during their growing up due to neglect, hardship, or intentional malice.
Such children are called "wild" or wild. Some wild children have been restricted by people (usually their parents); in some cases, the abandonment of this child occurred because the parents rejected the child's severe intellectual or physical impairment.
Wild children may have experienced serious violence or injuries before they were abandoned or fled.
Others are believed to have been raised by animals; some say they have lived in the wild alone.
When fully reared with animals, the wild child is characterised by almost the same behavior (with physical limitations) as the animal concerned, who cares for him, such as fear or indifference to humans.
Project-based learning should make the training process easier and more interesting, but building is a step forward.
Supporting approaches are not a learning method, but rather a means of supporting people who are learning something new, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Supporting can take place both virtually and in reality, in other words, as a pillar can be a teacher, but just as well as the little clip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized in software, and is meant to ask, say in front, and explain procedures that a student might find difficult to solve alone.
Children are handed over to foster families for a variety of reasons, including neglect, violence, and even extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not educational, loving, and educational, yet it does.
We believe that the foster system is a safety zone for these children.
Our system of raising foreign children in the family must provide safe housing, loving carers, stable education and reliable health care.
The foster families must provide everything they needed that was lacking at the home from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The different features of the Internet create additional dimensions for the use-and-satisfaction approach.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are indicated as important motivating factors for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Studying the audience's response to the sites, Emy and McCord (1998) also identified "personal engagement" and "permanent relationships" as new motivational aspects.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions - facial movement lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is argued that a person can determine if someone is lying in a proper understanding of facial microexpressions.
In his essay “The President’s Speech”, Oliver Sachs showed how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are able to determine exactly how true it is.
He even speculates that animals, such as domestic dogs, may also have such powers to interpret human behavior.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two sets of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, but the selection removes it from the set of the expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination in each generation shift variations back and forth between these two sets.
Primates with digestive systems such as humans find it difficult to provide the necessary amino acids with plant resources available in savannah.
In addition, this can have serious consequences: growth failure, malnutrition and even death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been proteins available in leaves and legumes, but it is difficult for primates like us to digest them unless they are made.
On the other hand, food of animal origin (cradle, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, ber also provides a lot of protein that contains essential amino acids.
In view of all this, it would be no wonder that our ancestors also solved their "protein problem" similar to the chimpanzees currently living in savannah.
Stopping sleep is a process when a targeted awakening is performed during normal sleep, falling asleep again (10–60 minutes) after a short while.
It can be easily done using a relatively quiet alarm to keep you conscious, but completely unwoke.
If you switch the clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, causing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based option is to drink plenty of fluid (especially water or tea, which is known by its diuretic action) before going to bed to get up and go to urinate.
The amount of inner peace of man is mutually opposite to the amount of tension in the human body and spirit.
The less stress, the more positive the existing life force is. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that interferes with this goal is our own tension and negativeism.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it was expanded by the path of Mahāyan love and many methods of Indian yoga.
In principle Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes kundalini yoga, meditation and the way to comprehensive love.
During the practice of Kundalini yoga, Kundalini (clarity) energy is awakened using yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of God. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleaned, chakras are activated and enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, with the result that cooperation between the USSR and the United States developed. As the war ended, these countries became hostile again due to different systems, processes and culture.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
This was destined to last for the next 40 years and, through intermediary armies, real warfare was carried out in battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, Polish guards had already been defeated, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian placdarm.
However, these plans became morally obsolete almost during the day when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union arrived and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after occupying the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact and other international bilateral and multilateral treaties.
The use of ships for the transport of goods remains the most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The Navy's mission has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move its people and goods while disrupting the enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
One of the most noteworthy recent examples of this was the North Atlantic Campaign of World War II. Americans attempted to transport men and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet, using mainly submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany would have likely conquered Britain like all the other European countries.
Goats were most likely tamed for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
The ancient nations and tribes began to grow them because they could easily obtain milk, wool, meat, and leather.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that wandered through mounds and other grazing areas and were looked after by goat shepherds, who were often children or adults, similar to the more well-known shepherds. These grazing methods have been used until now.
Wagons were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the horse railway consisted only of parallel-placed wooden boards, they allowed the towhorses to reach higher speeds and to haul larger loads than on the wrinkled roads of the time.
The sleepers began to be used from the very beginning to keep the rails moving, but gradually they realized that the rails would be even more efficient if they had a metal strip at the top.
It became common practice, but iron caused greater wear of the wooden wheels of wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first rail made entirely of iron was introduced.
The first known mode of movement was walking, people began walking upright two million years ago, appearing in Homo Erectus (meaning standing man).
Their ancestors the australopiteki did not go upright as usual.
Two-legged specimens were already found in fossils of the australopite supergenus that have lived 4.2–3.9 million years ago, although members of the genus Sakhelanthropist may have been walking on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living in an environmentally friendly way, join the environmental movement and even be activists in order to reduce the suffering in the future to a certain extent.
In many cases it is like symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not want only a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and deactivate them.
Clearly, the world has changed significantly because of human scientific and technological advances, and the problems have become more serious because of overpopulation and humanity's extravagant way of life.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, the handwritten draft document by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing house, located a couple of blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made during the night, now known as "Dunlap broadsides" (Declaration of Independence).
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon at the Courtyard of Independence Palace on July 8.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6 and read it to his army in New York City on July 9. One copy reached London on August 10.
25 "Dunlap broadsides", known to still exist, are the oldest preserved copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and are still living now. We call them birds.
Many people do not see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, birds still have many characteristics resembling a dinosaur.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs and walk on both of their rear legs like a tyrannosaurus.
Almost all computers used today are based on manipulation of information that is encoded in binary number form.
The binar number can only have two counts, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits, or in computer language, bits.
Symptoms such as vomiting are general enough not to make a diagnosis immediately.
The most prominent sign of internal poisoning may be the presence of open medicines or toxic domestic chemistry tanks.
Read the first-aid instructions on the label for the specific poison.
The term "vabole" for this group of insects is used by entomologists in a formal sense.
This term derives from the ancient association with bed-strikes, who have been very adapted to parasitising on humans.
Both the robber bug and the blood bug are parasitic pests adapted to life in the broods or soaked in other bodies.
Some 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis have been reported in the United States, making it the most common neurological disease in young adults and middle-aged people.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS than men.
The couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their own interests or in the interests of their child.
These couples can choose to create an adoption plan for their baby.
In the case of adoption, biological parents are suspended from their parental rights so that another couple can become parents of a child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works by using the scientific method. In fact, this method is the driving force behind most scientific research.
There is also experimentation, and the experiment is a test that is used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses. Questioning and observations can also direct scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's opinion was recognized in all matters of science, including psychology.
As fewer and fewer people knew Greek, Western countries were separated from their Greek philosophy and scientific roots.
The presence of endogenous cycles and the process of their formation, taking into account the biological clock, often have a decisive influence on many observed rhythms in psychology and behavior.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply a response to external periodic signals, have been confirmed for most living creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators which continue to function freely even without external triggers.
Hershie and Chase's experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA is genetic material.
Hershy and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their DNA into the bacterium.
They conducted two experiments, marking either phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the unit of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are stem cell-line cells.
Children can only receive mutations in stem cell cells, while mutations in other cells can lead to cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy landscapes, including plants and wildlife.
These areas may include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, or visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is a visit to the island of Borneo to take photographs and get to know the Orangutans.
Every morning, people from small rural towns go by car to their workplaces, and they are replaced by others who are in the place from which they have just left.
In this dynamic transport bus, everyone is somehow connected and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Scientists now point to the fact that an economy with such massive carbon emissions has disrupted one of the stable states of the biosphere that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone is a part of society and participates in transport systems; almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear of similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do such complaints arise about transport systems, why do problems arise in them every day? Are transport engineers incompetent? Or are the root of the problem deeper?
Traffic flow is a study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their possible interaction.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the flow of traffic, as it is not possible to predict driver behaviour with one hundred percent confidence.
Fortunately, drivers' behaviour most often has a fairly consistent range, so traffic flows can be determined for some consistency and can be roughly calculated mathematically.
To better reflect traffic flow, three main characteristics have been established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This relationship helps in the planning, design and processes of the carriageway infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to take off in the air. Their ability to fly helped to avoid enemies more easily, as well as to find food and partner more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings to the rear, attaching them to the whole body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot unfold their wings are different wing rafters and single-days.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system was moving around the sun.
Some thought that he was right, but many thought that the solar system revolved around the earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
It seems reasonable because there's no feeling the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It contains more than 8 times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the broadest river on Earth, in some places six miles wide.
The Amazon flows 20% of the water that flows into the oceans from all the rivers of the world.
The motorway Amazon is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) and it produces water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of the pyramids continued from the stones until the end of the Old Kingdom's existence, the pyramids of Giza remained unsurpassed by their size and excellent technical performance of construction.
Ancient Egyptians of the New State admired the monuments of their ancestors, who were over a thousand years old at the time.
The Vatican has a population of around 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous country.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also a daily language used by most of the workers in this country, but Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the inhabitants of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper from ancient times, since they are all found in nature in a free way and are relatively easy to dig with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle expressed the theory that everything consists of a mixture of one or more certain elements. These elements were earth, water, air and fire.
It resembled more of four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also expressed the theory that they are changing into new substances to create what we see.
Alloys are in principle a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that the periodic table contains many chemical elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also such metals as silver and gold.
Alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon may also be present.
In the universe, everything consists of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly tiny that one single point at the end of this sentence would consist of trillions of atoms.
Thus, when the pencil arose, it was a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, as new types of writing appeared, the status of the pencil declined, and it began to be used less frequently.
Now people write messages on the computer screen, and there is no need for a sharpener.
We can only imagine how the keyboard will change when a newer invention emerges.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
In a way, by rolling heavy carts like a mountain. By splitting the nucleus again, some of this energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to share a little incentive or just the same.
The surface of the moon consists of stones and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
Long on the near side is about 70 km thick, and on the far side - 100 km thick.
It is thinner under the basalt plain and thicker under the highlands.
There could be more lunar seas on the near side because the crust is thinner. Lava was easier to rise to the surface.
The theory of content basically seeks to find out what inspires or attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized upon reaching adulthood.
These theories look at what makes certain people want to do the things they do, and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's needs hierarchy theory and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Usually, managers who start running their former colleagues may show two types of behavior. At one end of the spectrum there is an effort to maintain the status of "theirs".
This type of driver has difficulty making unpopular decisions, conducting disciplinary actions, performance assessments, granting responsibility and bringing people to justice.
At the other end of the scale, the manager becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she has to change everything the team has done up to these and turn it into his or her achievement.
Ultimately, the leader is fully responsible for the team's success and failures.
Such behavior often leads to disagreements between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are minor differences.
Members of the virtual team often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than normal team members, as their teams can meet according to the different time zones that their local management might not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (page 109, Larson's and LaFasto's book, published 1989) is also a unique part of the virtual team.
The "Invisible Team" is a management team that is reported by each of the members. The Invisible Team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organisation want to invest time in such a time-consuming process of creating a learning organisation? One of the goals of putting concepts into practice in an organisation is innovation.
If all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of the organization, creativity and ingenuity can be revealed.
As a result, a process in which an organisation works together to overcome a barrier can contribute to the creation of a new, innovative process to meet the customer's needs.
Before an organisation focuses on innovation, managers need to develop a culture of innovation, as well as a knowledge-sharing and continuous learning organisation.
Angel (2006) explains the continuity approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher-level results.
Neurobiological data provides a theoretical approach to the study of physical evidence cognisance. Therefore, it narrows the scope of the study and makes it more accurate.
Scientists in their research are supported by a correlation between brain pathology and behavior.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, injuries, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The growth of new technologies allows us to see and explore previously unseen brain structures and processes.
It gives us a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence is largely associated with science fiction, it is an extremely important direction in computer science that explores the behavior of technology, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
In AI studies, machines are required to automate tasks that require programmable action.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer questions and diagnoses, as well as the recognition of handwriting, voice and face.
Such cases have become separate sectors that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military, and is built into several home computer and video game software applications.
The study tour makes up a large part of the study process. Often, the teacher would be happy to take students to places where he cannot get by bus.
Technology offers a solution with virtual study tours. Students, sitting with classmates, can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art.
Virtual sharing of study tours is a great way to discuss the trip and share experience with the next classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their tour to the state capital and every year this website is transformed, but previous versions are kept online as a history album.
Blogs can also help improve students’ writing skills. Although often at the beginning, when students start writing blogs, they do not pay attention to grammar and spelling, but the presence of readers usually changes it.
As students are often the most critical target audience, the blog's author begins to make efforts to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Moreover, writing blogs "makes students learn more about the world around them." The need to keep readers interested motivates students to be ingenious and interesting (Toto, 2004);
Blog writing is a technique that encourages collaboration and encourages students to study outside school hours.
The appropriate use of blogs "can stimulate students to become more analytical and think critically. By actively using the material available on the Internet, students can define their position in the context of other written content, as well as express their views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital with numerous art galleries and museums showing Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, while in the north you can enjoy the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and much more.
All this, and much more, forgives Ontario what others consider to be the real Canada.
Wide areas further north are fairly sparsely populated, and in some areas there are almost uninhabited wild areas.
For a population comparison that surprises many: The number of African Americans living in the United States is much higher than the population of Canada.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is undoubtedly the largest and, when it comes to wildlife, it is like a separate continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or are affiliated with France, as well as known as luxury-class beach resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam to the countries of the Comoros and Mayotte on a large scale.
European influence and colonization dates back to the 15th century, when Portuguese researcher Vasco de Gama opened a route from Europe to India along the Cape of Good Hope.
The region borders the Sahel region to the north, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: All traveling women are advised to say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also useful to pull out a ring (but not one that looks too expensive.
Women need to understand that cultural differences can lead to situations that they can see as harassment, and it is not unusual for a woman to be followed, grabbed by her hand, etc.
Do not be afraid to refuse men and reject their attention (it does not matter whether they are cultural differences or not, it is not acceptable anyway).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BCE by Berber fishermen, and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casabranka to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the town into Dara l-Badia, and the Spanish merchants who established trading bases there gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most uninteresting shopping places in all of Morocco.
In Medina’s Old Town, you can easily find places to sell Moroccan traditional products, such as tajinas, ceramic dishes, leather products, water pipes, and girls of all kinds, but all of this is for tourists only.
Goma is a tourist-favourite city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located on the very eastern border with Rwanda.
In 2002, Gomu was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially in its center.
Although Goma is safe enough, all visits outside Goma should be reviewed to understand the state of the existing battles in North Kivu Province.
The city is also a starting place to climb the Niragongo volcano along some of the cheapest mountain gorillas tracking sites in Africa.
You can use a “boda-boda” (motorcycle taxi) to move around Goma. The usual (local) price for a short trip is approximately 500 Congo francs.
Due to its relatively difficult access, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor used to describe exotic, remote lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and has an airport.
In 1990, due to the threat of desert sand, it was included in the list of endangered world heritage monuments.
This was one of the main stops where Henry Louis Gates broadcast station's PBS documentary, Wonders of the African World, was shot.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, as it has more Arabic rather than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and extends along the Mozambique border to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park has an area of 19,500 km2, and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which maintains different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main sights and is considered the most important of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).
Like all national parks in South Africa, this park has daily maintenance and entrance fees.
It might also be advantageous to buy the Wild Card, which provides entrance to certain South African parks or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong is named after Hong Kong, and is a place that many tourists consider to be key.
The set of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong has been equated with a glittering chart of lanes, clearly shown by the presence of Victorian harbour waters.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island for the opposite shore of Cowlun.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely compressed on regenerated land along the north coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers took over as their own, and so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbani is the largest coastal mangrove band in the world stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast in Bangladesh and India inland.
Sundarbani has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Part of the forest in Indian territory is called Sundarbani National Park.
Forests, however, are not just mangrove swamps - they include some of the last remaining herds of powerful jungles that once decked the Gangetics Plains.
Sundarbani has an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is covered by water/spur area.
Sanderban has been a wildlife reserve since 1966, and is now estimated to have 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in its territory.
Buses depart from an intercity bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, but most, especially on the eastward and Jakara/Bumtang routes, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since interdistrict buses are often crowded, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese coastal buses that are comfortable and durable.
Co-driving taxis offer a quick and convenient way to go to nearby places such as Paro (150 Bhutan ngultrumi) and Punakhu (200 Bhutan ngultrumi).
The Oyapoka River Bridge is a vantage bridge that extends over the Oyapoka River to connect the city of Oyapoka in Brazil and the St. Jorge de Loyapok in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 metres, have a length of 378 metres, and have two bands 3.50 m wide.
The vertical distance below the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was only opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian Customs Control Points are scheduled to be completed.
Guarani was the most important group of indigenous peoples who inhabited the present eastern part of Paraguay, living as half nomadic hunters who also engaged in natural agriculture.
There were other indigenous tribal groups in the Chaco region, such as the Guaikuru and the pajaga, which food from hunting, foraging and fishing.
Paraguay, once called the "Merry Province of India", was the result of the interaction between Spanish conquerors and local indigenous groups of the 16th century.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to retain much of its local character and identity.
Argentina is known for one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December in the Las Kanjita polo squares.
Smaller tournaments and matches are also held here several other times a year.
For information on tournaments and places where you can buy tickets for polo games, see the Association's "Asociacion Argentina de Polo" site.
The official Falkland currency is the Falkland pound (FKP), whose value is set at equivalent to the value of one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanleigh opposite the shop “FIC West Store”.
Usually the islands accept the British pound anywhere, while Stanley also often accept credit cards and US dollars.
Credit cards may not be accepted in the ORs, although the British and US currency may be accepted; ask the owners in advance to find out the acceptable way of payment.
It is almost impossible to spot the Falkland Islands' currency outside the island territory, so change the money before leaving.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, there summer is when winter is in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical band; during the summer months, temperatures usually exceed the +30 °C mark.
Winter can be insidious: temperatures rarely fall below the freezing limit, but when there is wind and humidity at the same time, it seems colder than the thermometer shows.
There are no special "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain all year round is roughly the same.
Although many of the park's animals are accustomed to seeing humans, wild animals are nonetheless wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the instructions of the park management authorities, a distance of at least 100 yards/metres from bears and wolves, as well as a distance of 25 yards/metres from all other wildlife should be respected!
No matter how submissive they may look, bison, elk, North American elk, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Each year dozens of visitors are injured because they do not follow a proper distance. These animals are large, wild and can also be dangerous, so it is better to stay away from them.
In addition, remember that perfume attracts bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking aromatic food and keep the camp clean.
Appia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Appiah was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the infamous sea deadlock of 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All but a British cruise ship sank. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans died.
In the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rallies in the center of the city turned out to be the killing of the supreme king, Tupua Tamasses Lealofi III.
Thanks to Auckland's two ports, there are many beaches. The most popular are located in three areas.
The beaches of the north coast (in Harbor's northern province) are washed by the Pacific Ocean, and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches where to swim safely, and most of the shadows are provided by pohutukawa trees.
Tamakidraiva beaches are located in Whitehamat Harbour, the exclusive suburbs of Mishon Bay and St. Helliers in Central Auckland.
They are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good range of stores located on the coast. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is 'Number One', it is not a distinctly tasted beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called 'Manta'.
There are many French wines, but New Zealand and Australia wines are more popular.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you are fearful, bottled water is easy to find.
For Australians, the concept of 'coffee with milk' is foreign. Black coffee is called 'espresso', cappuccino is made with a huge pile of whipped cream (rather than milk foam) and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Trips to the reef are held throughout the year, but injuries due to these reasons rarely occur in the reef.
However, listen to the recommendations of the authorities, take note of all signs and follow the safety warnings carefully.
Kubomedūs appears at the beaches and estuaries of rivers from October to April 1770 in the northern part of the city. Sometimes they can also be found at other times.
Sharks are common, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks fear humans and usually swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles are not common in the ocean; their main distribution site is river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Pre-booking gives travellers peace of mind that when they arrive at their destination, they will have a place to sleep.
Travel agents often have arrangements with specific hotels, although through a travel agent you have the possibility to book other types of accommodation, such as camping sites.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They may also save you a reservation if you need time to consider the offer, or provide other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests should first be sent to the travel agent rather than directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, most visitors choose to live in tents, and most of them consider it to be an essential part of the festival's experience.
If you want to be close to the epicenter of events, you need to come early to find a tent site that is close to music.
Do not forget: even if the music on the main stages has already finished, there may be places at the festival where the music will continue to be played until late night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern part of the Baltic in winter, check the location of the hut, because crossing the ice creates quite terrible noise for those most affected by this action.
The cruise ships of St. Petersburg provide time to see the city. Passengers of cruise ships are exempt from the visa requirement (find the rules).
Casinos usually do their best to keep their visitors as long as possible and to spend more money. Normally, there are no windows and watches in the casino rooms, and it is sometimes difficult to find a way out.
They usually have special meals, drinks, and entertainment offers to keep guests in good mood and to keep them indoors.
In some places alcoholic beverages are offered at the expense of the institution. However, alcohol consumption weakens judgment, and every good gambler knows the importance of keeping a clear mind.
Anyone intending to drive in polar areas or over mountain passes must take into account the possibility of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
There's little friction on iced and snowed carriageways, so you can't drive the same way on clean asphalt.
In snowstorms, a very short period of time, you can see so much snow that can cause congestion.
Visibility may also be limited by falling snow, breeze, condensate or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, so traffic is mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari trips are probably the largest tourist attraction in Africa and the most vivid adventure of many visitors.
The popularly used term "safari" refers to land travel to look at the stunning wildlife of Africa, especially savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to come close to the cars, so standard equipment will allow them to be viewed well.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes timid and can be seen better with binoculars.
Safari's march (also called "crowd march", "safari hike" or walking "by foot") is a hike that can last from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will take place in other venues throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, with Olympics also held there in 1964.
If you ordered flights and a hotel for 2020 before the postponement, you can be in a difficult situation.
The withdrawal rules differ, but at the end of March most of the coronavirus pandemic-related withdrawal rules are not extended until July 2020 when the Olympic Games are planned.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between ¥2500 and ¥130,000, with normal tickets costing about ¥7000.
Ironing wet clothes can help them dry. In many hotels you can ask for ironing board and iron if they are not available in the room.
If iron is not available or you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try to use a hairdryer if it's available.
Make sure that the fabric does not get too hot (as a result, it may shrink or even fuse in extreme situations).
There are different types of water treatment, some are more effective against specific threats.
In some places it is enough to boil water for one minute, while in others it takes several minutes.
Filters differ in their efficiency, so if you are unsure, consider buying closed bottle water from a reliable company.
Travellers may be exposed to animal parasites unknown to them in their home regions.
Pests can damage food, cause inflammation or, at worst, cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
