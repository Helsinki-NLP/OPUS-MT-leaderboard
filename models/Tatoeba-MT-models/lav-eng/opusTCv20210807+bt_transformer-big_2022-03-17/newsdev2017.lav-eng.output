New questions about the California water supply project
Critics and the state legislature say they want to know more about who pays for the $16 billion project supported by Governor Jerry Brown, according to a spokesman for the leading California water supply authority, about the Brown administration offering government funding to complete the construction of two huge water tunnels.
Critics argue that government funding described by the Los Angeles metropolitan water supply authority may contradict the state's long-standing claims that various local water supply authorities, not California itself, would pay for Brown's vision to dig two equal 35-mile tunnels to drain water south of the Sacramento River, primarily for Central and Southern California.
Initial expenses for the construction of tunnels of $248 million, which though still have to get permission from the supervising authority, have already been the subject of a federal audit study.
On Wednesday, state legislators also ordered an audit of the state for tunnel construction expenses.
On Thursday, State Speaker Nancy Vogel said that despite the account of the Los Angeles metropolitan water supply authority, no money will be used from the state's general budget to complete the current planning phase of the twin tunnels.
However, opponents of the tunnels and a group of taxpayers were critical on Thursday, and Assembly Representative Susan Egg, one of the state legislators behind the audit ordered this week, asked the state for clarification on Thursday.
"It's a game with thimbles," said David Wolf, legal director of the Howard Jervis Taxpayers Association.
In my opinion, this is in line with yesterday's audit (request): there are many more questions than answers.
The tunnel project has been approved by Brown and some politically influential water supply administrations and water consumers in Central and Southern California.
Supporters say the tunnels will benefit the environment and provide Californians with a safer water supply.
Opponents say they are worried the state will use tunnels to divert too much water from the Sacramento River and San Francisco Bay, causing damage to Northern California and further endangering native species.
Metropolitan and other water bodies that are to receive water from the tunnels have yet to make a commitment to pay for it because of the uncertainty of whether investing huge sums of money will really bring enough water to pay off.
The same water authorities announced this year that they would not pay for the completion of the ongoing preparations unless the project first obtained the permission of the supervising authority.
Thursday, Los Angeles water supply authority's published monthly report on the tunnel project mentions that "the state has indicated that additional funding to complete the planning phase will be provided from state or federal budget funds."
After all that local water authorities have spent on the project, including $63 million from his water supply authority, "it is expected that the state will use public money to complete the planning," said Bob Muir, a spokesman for the Los Angeles water supply authority.
He went on to direct questions for Vogel, the state speaker.
Vogel said the state plans to allocate money to complete tunnel planning from fees for the existing half-century-old water network, the State Water Project.
Opponents of tunnel construction, however, point to a regulatory framework issued in 2009, which, they say, prevents the state from spending money on tunnel construction, while the water supply authorities, who will benefit from it, will not accept payment obligations for them.
"The project contractors have vowed to pay for this project, and they have used financial stunts to circumvent these commitments," said Patricia Schifferle, an environmental consultant and an old opponent of planned tunnels.
This raises questions about where this money was suddenly found.
Business Groups Appealing to China for Cyber Security Act
A coalition of international business groups has asked China to change the proposed cybersecurity rules, warning that they will damage trade and isolate the country.
The letter to Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang has been signed by 46 groups from the US, Europe, Asia and Latin America, showing global concern that the rules could restrict or suspend access to China's information security product market.
Signatories include the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the European Services Forum, and groups from Japan, Korea, and Mexico.
The proposed rules require suppliers to show the Chinese authorities how security products work and how information about Chinese citizens will be stored in the country.
The latest letter, dated Wednesday, says it could make data theft easier and less accessible to Chinese customers.
Chemical explosion in Tianjin: a year has passed since the tragedy
Zhang Mengfan claims that society deserves to know what happened in Tianjin.
Chinese leaders plan quiet commemorations to commemorate the first anniversary of a large-scale chemical explosion that killed 173 people, yet not everyone agrees.
John Sadworth reports from Tianjin.
Almost anywhere else in the world, the anniversary of a disaster of this magnitude would be a moment that the nation remembers and commemorates.
But not in China.
Although a memorial service is held in the city of Taijin to commemorate some of the dead firefighters, elsewhere such memorials have been excluded.
The Communist Party-controlled media have been told what they can and cannot say, and some survivors, as well as family members of the victims, have been warned not to speak to the foreign press.
However, Zhang Mengfan, aged 23, does not want to remain silent.
"On this anniversary, the public should somehow find out what happened," he says to me.
I don't want silence.
On August 12 last year, Zhang was a radio operator in the military fire brigade, which was only a kilometre from the epicenter of the explosions.
"The call was received at 22:53 that night, and we started sending my teammates," he says.
They could arrive within 10 minutes at the scene.
It’s not just a matter of how much money you’ll have.
None of them paid attention to the fact that large quantities of volatile and toxic substances were illegally stored, well in excess of the permitted quantities and also without proper monitoring.
The fire started when a batch of nitrocellulose - a chemical used in nail polish - was allowed to dry out and then ignited in the summer heat.
Then it spread over a huge area - to 800 tons of ammonium nitrate fertilizer.
Windows were knocked out in the explosions and a roof was invaded by a fire station where Zhang Mengfan was waiting at the radio remote's news from the scene.
This information was never received.
"When I saw the mushroom cloud, I fell into despair," he tells me.
I knew what that would mean for my friends.
Of the 26 firefighters of his unit who were sent to the blast site that night, eight never returned.
Many others suffered serious burns and other injuries.
The largest of the two large explosions was equated to an earthquake, and the wave of explosion was felt many miles away.
The total damage is estimated at over US$1 billion, including more than 300 destroyed buildings.
A total of 173 people lost their lives, of which 104 were firefighters.
The remains of eight people have never been found.
Official government investigation bodies are clearly blaming corruption, political connections and official collusion, which allowed circumvention of the rules and disregarding security systems.
First of all, such a warehouse should never have been brought close to a residential home.
More than 100 officials and representatives of the company’s management have been subject to some type of disciplinary or criminal investigation.
Thus, while the government can point to the progress made - thousands of houses in order and compensation for the population, these sensitive issues are still relevant.
Tragedy has revealed gaps in a system where rapid economic growth is a priority and lack of independent oversight is a fact.
It’s a great way to get to know people and make them feel special.
It contains a firefighter as a victim who has been sent without background knowledge to fight a man-made disaster that could have been prevented.
Zhang Mengfan is no longer working in the fire service, but will attend a memorial service in Tianjin.
He will carry the message of his dying companions in his heart.
I want to say to them the most: I have visited your parents and they are doing well.
Leave your parents to me.
I am now a member of your family.
I will do your duty as sons.
Cold spring could affect Scottish grouse shooting season
The Scottish grouse shooting season will start later as the number of birds has decreased this year due to cold weather.
In several properties, the shooting has been postponed because many of the new rubble has not survived the cold spring conditions.
To mark the start of the season, the Scottish Association of Gamekeepers (SGA) states that the shooting of the grouses provides more work than Edinburgh festivals.
However, the animal protection charity OneKind calls for an end to "brutal bird killing".
The organization's director, Harry Hughton, said, "The work that is being put into providing a large number of game birds for shooting is huge and undeniably involves some rather contentious activities."
It is no surprise that the public is turning away from this so-called sport and is calling on the government to ban the cruel, unnecessary activity enjoyed by only a very small proportion of the Scottish population.
It’s important to remember that the most important thing in life is not to lose sight of what you are capable of.
SGA chairman Alex Hogg said that the industry provides 8,800 full-time jobs a year in more remote regions and that it has been a "rich patch of work" in precarious times.
He said, "Compared to many European countries, Scotland does not have such a entrenched "hunting" culture, and some of the population does not know at all how the shooting season affects the country in economic terms."
Hogg said the number of jobs provided during the shooting surpassed the number created at the Edinburgh International Festival, the Fringe Festival, the Tattoo Festival, and the New Year's Eve celebration together.
He added: "The employment situation in Scotland is rather worrying at the moment, especially in the oil and gas sector, so the game organizers and their families want to see the industry boom.
We want to work with the Scottish Government to ensure that hard-working people can still count on these jobs in the future.
RSPB Scotland believes that at least eight golden eagles have been killed near the habitat of the rubble.
Many game organizers admit that shooting grouses is not universally popular, but the SGA claims that the industry "has taken significant steps forward in terms of best practice."
The opening day of the Ruben shooting season is traditionally known as the "Holy Twelve."
There is still much discussion about this sport, however, and the management of rubble shooting sites is linked to the persecution of some offenders by conservation authorities.
On Thursday, RSPB Scotland said that eight ringed golden eagles had disappeared in less than five years in the Monadliat Mountains, southeast of Inverness.
The Nature Conservation Charitable Foundation believes that they have been illegally killed in the vicinity of the rubble shooting sites and their satellite bracelets have been destroyed.
Rossanna Cunningham, Scottish Environment Minister, said these reports were "very disturbing and disappointing."
Ms. Cunningham instructed officials to analyze evidence of about 90 surviving and missing eagles with transmitters to determine if there was a trend towards criminal activity.
A group of Scottish moorlanders blame the RSPB for trying to stir up feelings of counter-shooting before the rubble season began, and also mentioned that there was no clear evidence that birds even had died in the Monadlit mountain neighborhood.
Rio Olympics 2016: Brionis Paige wins silver in ski jumping for Great Britain
It’s not just a matter of how much you drink.
If you want to know more about how to get rid of hemorrhoids, you can read in the article “How to treat hemorrhoids?”.
Paige (25) missed 0.425 points to the gold, as Canadian representative Rosanna McLennan won the already second Olympic title in a row with a score of 56.465.
World champion, Chinese representative Lee Dana was brought to the bronze, while second British finalist Katherine Driscoll finished sixth.
I can't believe I've won an Olympic medal.
I'm so happy," the emotional Paige clearly said.
I had no idea it was a medal, but I was able to show the best performance, so I was so happy that all the training and hard work had paid off.
I am so happy that I was able to take part in the final with Keta, that the participation of one of the representatives in the final would be historical, but we were there for two.
Before winning Olympic silver, Paige's highest achievement in international competition was fifth at the 2015 World Championships in Denmark.
Ski Jumping at the Olympics was included in the year 2000, and this is the first time that British women have managed to get to the final.
Reaction to the medal.
Britain's team representative Nathan Bailey, the only representative in the men's competition in the ski jumping on Saturday, was in ecstatic.
Hannah Velan, who participates in the Olympics for the second time, quickly began to praise Paige's achievement.
Paige holds a Bachelor of Biology with distinction from the University of Sheffield.
Rio 2016: Fiji fans celebrate gold medal in rugby-7
A 12-year-old boy to see the game, half a mile from both cane fields to the nearest TV
Fiji begins its first ever Olympic gold medal race with an unprecedented scale
The banks closed, the shops closed and the celebrants took over the streets of Suva, dancing, singing and rejoicing
Fiji won the gold medal, at Deodoro Stadium in the Rugby-7 final with 43-7 smashing Britain.
Thousands of people across the island country stopped their usual jobs to watch the historic game.
Fiji celebrates the first Olympic medal in its history
Many fans were dressed in Fiji colours and rugby shirts, carrying a national flag and cheering the team.
When the final whistle of the game was heard, the excited celebrants took to the streets, rejoicing and dancing.
"Some people even in the crowded streets of Suva stopped their vehicles and joined the celebrations with Fijian flags, will not address the small congestion they cause," the Fiji Times reports.
The celebrations will certainly continue over the weekend and next week.
Irish Premier League: Finn Harps 0-5 Derry City
Aaron McEneff hit two first halftime penalty kicks for the visiting team at Finnpark.
Derry City have picked up to second one in the Premier League, scoring a convincing victory with a score of 5-0 in a fight with Finn Harps.
Aaron McEnef put "confection stripes" in the lead, successfully realizing two first halftime penalty kicks awarded for offenses against Lucas Schubert.
Nathan Boyle kicked a goal at the beginning of the second half, and Schubert beat the opponent in the fourth quarter before a late pass by Keith Ward, sealing the opponent's defeat at Finnpark.
Derry is one point ahead of Cork City, and the two teams will meet in the deciding game on Monday night at Brandivelle.
It was Derry's first win over their north-west rivals this season, and they were upset for me by the HARPS side.
McKenef saved the opening kick of the game in the 17th minute after Cyrus Cole went out against Schubert, although the offense proved to be out of the penalty area.
There was no doubt about the second penalty kick, with former "Caramel Stripes" midfielder Barrie Molloy causing Schubert to fall to the ground and McKeneff achieving the score 2-0 in the third minute after the break.
Boyle put an exact end to Dean Jervis's pass with an inside foot in the eighth minute after resuming the game.
Derry City goalkeeper Gerard Doherty had a calm evening, but managed to perfectly guard the goal, beating David Scully at the best opening of the game for the guests.
Schubert kicked the ball past Cole before taking a breakthrough in the 83rd minute, and this was soon followed by Ward's clever rebound over Harps centre guard Richard Brash.
It was Derry's biggest win in the race series and a great preparation for the final game with Cork.
Test of mass outstanding tests in the University of Highlands and Islands (UHI) course at Inverness College
The entire course of 20 students could have failed the Inverness College UHI's highest media course test.
Most of these were students aged 17 and 18, who hoped to use the mark received in their studies to enter the university.
Inverness College UHI claims that quality assurance processes are being applied, adding that the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) is investigating the matter.
The SQA Press Secretary said that the highest media ratings available across the country for 2016 had "been taken as expected".
Twenty students signed up for the course offered and assessed by Inverness College UHI.
Many of the students were young people living in rural areas who took classes online, however, often had to travel to Inverness College from their residences, such as from Locheiber.
One student's father said that after his daughter's publications on social media that she did not receive any evaluation for her work, at least 10 more also made a statement that she did not receive any evaluation for her coursework.
He told BBC News Scotland directly that about five more people who took this course at Inverness College last year, and who managed to get in touch with them, said the same thing happened to them.
The situation means that his daughter cannot secure a place at Glasgow University, but she will be able to accept another university's offer thanks to her school qualifications.
However, her father said that there were others who were attending the college-organised media course who were unlucky and who were now in "forgetfulness" and uncertainty about whether their coursework would be reviewed and graded so that they could enroll at universities.
Inverness College UHI is part of the University of Highlands and Islands.
Diane Rowlinson, UHI head and executive director at Inverness College said, "For us, exam results and student success are very important."
This is also evidenced by the excellent Her Majesty's Education Inspectorate (HMIE) review this year, as well as the improved levels of achievement in both continuing education and higher education compared to last year.
As every year, we conduct a review of all published results, comparing them to what each student has predicted.
In the case of this particular course, standard quality assurance measures were taken and the assessment body recently reported "substantial improvements in the provision and management of this assessment" and confirmed that "the assessments were in line with national standards."
SQA is currently investigating the matter at our request.
The SQA press secretary said, "We are pleased that the evaluation of the highest media of 2016 has gone as planned and that the candidates had the opportunity to demonstrate their understanding of the subject."
Many candidates have shown good performance and there was a slight increase in the A-C achievement rate compared to the same qualification last year.
It was developed according to previous and model documents, and according to our course and assessment specifications.
The brothers put in prison for the samurai sword "blood alcohol" in Kilmarnock
Jason Braden was attacked with a samurai sword, a knife and nunchaks
Two brothers jailed for killing a man with a samurai sword after a drug-related burglary in Ayrshire that turned out to "bloodbath".
Sacrifice Jason Braiden (38) was stabbed several times at his home in Kilmarnock on 5 July 2015.
In the High Court in Glasgow, James Clark (36) will be sentenced to at least 22 years in prison after being convicted of murder.
His brother John (38) was sentenced to 10 years in prison after being convicted on a less severe charge of unpremeditated murder.
In sentencing the two men to prison, Judge Bill Dunlop said to the brothers that they had committed "a cruel, cruel and savage attack."
He rejected any assumption that Mr. Brayden was lying down and waiting for them, armed with a samurai sword.
Judge Dunlop added, "You're planning illegal entry together with at least one knife and nunchaks."
Jason Brayden may have been a drug dealer, but he was a son, a father, and a friend.
You killed him.
After the two men were jailed, the criminal police inspector who led the investigation said, "John and James Clark's violent and outrageous act has caused the death of Jason Brayden."
Go back in the sun at the age of 38, in such terrible circumstances, is a heartbreaking situation that a family has to survive.
The court previously heard that the brothers from Kilmarnock decided to kidnap Mr. Brayden the gold bracelet they had given him in exchange for drugs.
Both two under the influence of alcohol and drugs went to his house, disguised faces with scarves and armed with a knife and eastern fight nunchaks.
The sword used in the murder is believed to have belonged to the deceased.
The neighbors said they saw the Clarks attacking Braden when he was sitting on the couch by the window, and heard him screaming.
Prosecutor Richard Godard said at the hearing, "The attack on this man was enduring, chaotic."
The murder scene was then described as "blood alcohol".
In addition to injuries from knife stitches, Brayden suffered a strong injury with a blunt object during the attack.
Three days later he died at Kilmarnock Crosshouse Hospital.
The two brothers did not confess to the murder.
Giving evidence, James Clark, who has previously been tried 38 times, including for attempted murder, said, "I didn't want that. It was an accident."
John Clarke, who has previously been tried 23 times, said he was just getting involved to help a brother who he said was attacked by Braiden."
The man was sentenced to prison for shaking and killing his infant son.
David Sinclair admitted his guilt in murdering a child at his home in East Kilbride in 2012.
A man who shook and killed his infant child in an outburst of anger because he didn't want to eat has been sentenced to seven years and three months in prison.
David Sinkler shook up four-month-old Joshua when he "for a moment lost control" at their home in East Kilbride, South Lancashire, on 6 December 2012.
The cause of death was only determined after forensic medical examination.
Sinkler (34) was initially charged with murder, but was found guilty of murder with no prior intent.
In Glasgow High Court, sentencing him to prison, Judge Lord Breiseidl told Sinclair, "You assaulted your infant son by shaking him, causing injuries from which he died."
When you searched for him, you had to know it, but you didn't discover it.
Only after a thorough medical examination did you confess what you had done.
Your wife believed you.
Now she feels betrayed and can no longer support you.
Lord Breiseidl described the aftermath of Joshua's death as "catastrophic" to everyone and added, "Nothing will ever bring Joshua back again."
Previously, the court had found that on the day the child died, Sinkler and his wife Cursty had gone swimming with Joshua and shopping at East Kilbride.
At 5:30 p.m., Cursty Sinclair went to meet her mother and sister.
Just 11 minutes later, she was called by Sinkler, who sounded "shocked".
He said to her, "Joshua doesn't breathe properly, come home now."
Then he ended the conversation and called 999.
The infant was immediately taken to Heermair Hospital, where he died.
Joshua’s cause of death was initially unclear, but he was looked at by a team of forensic experts who found the consequences of injuries to the eyes and brain shortly before his death, and such injuries could not be sustained by chance.
One of the experts, Dr Peter Richard, a consulting child neurosurgeon at John Redcliffe Hospital in Oxford, said, "This has happened because the child has been shaken and thus suffered injuries as well as being touched with greater force than in everyday life."
The defense spokesman Jan Djugid said to the court that Sinkler "extremely regrets" what he had done.
Rio Olympics 2016: Chloe Tatone threatens Julia Yefimova's position
It’s a good idea to talk to your doctor about all the possible side effects.
British representative Chloe Tatone criticizes controversial swimmer Julia Yefimov's participation in the Rio Games after a Russian representative overtakes her in a 200 m swim.
Yefimova, who was allowed to participate in the games after a complaint lodged about the ban on participation due to doping, wins silver, leaving Tatoni in fourth place.
"I would have liked it to be completely clean games," then said a 20-year-old Welsh swimmer.
I didn’t know who was there.
I'm not happy with that, but that's how it is.
It’s not just a matter of how much money you’ll have.
I don't want to see people being told to quit sports, but I don't think that's really right.
She was not supposed to take part in the competition, and the 20-year-old British representative had to win a medal.
Rie Kaneto won the seventh gold medal for Japan at the 2016 Games in Rio, beating Yefimov, who won the silver medal.
This is the first time I’ve ever seen it, and it’s not the first time I’ve seen it.
Her British teammate, 20-year-old Molly Renshaw, finished sixth.
"Staying in fourth place is a bit of a disappointment, no matter what you have ahead of you," added Tatone.
It's a great experience, and I'm a little disappointed by the fourth place.
I'm so close to the medal, and it would have been a dream.
However, meeting the finale itself is a great experience that I will take with me in the coming years.
It was a bit of a disappointment, but in the long run, it's going to make me strong, and it makes me want more and more medals, so hopefully I'll get closer to it next time.
Tatone fell just 0.01 seconds behind the British record in the women's 200 m swimming final.
"Every man must be given a second chance," - Yefimova.

In 2013, she was banned for 16 months after traces of anabolic steroids were found in her body.
The sports arbitration court (CAS) ruled that athletes cannot be denied participation in the Rio Games because they have been subject to sanctions in advance.
The CAS dealt with my complaint, and I won.
If someone doesn't like it and someone has a different opinion, they can turn to the CAS," she explained.
I don't support doping, and I've never used it.
In the second case, it was definitely not my fault.
Every man must be given a second chance.
When you drive and you get a penalty receipt, no one puts you in jail.
It’s not just a matter of how much money you have.
Previously set a British record to win a place in the men's 50 m freestyle swimming final.
The Union Champion, Praud (21), swung the distance in 21.54 seconds to qualify as the fifth fastest for Friday's final (02:44 BST Saturday).
Your delegation is shameless and rude
India's sports minister, Vijay Goel, has been a rather striking figure at the Rio Olympics, often seen in the stands, cheering Indian athletes and taking selfies after their starts.
However, he and his wide-ranging company have apparently aroused the anger of Olympic organizers due to their unbridled behaviour in repeatedly attempting to break out to the competition areas without proper accreditation and in flagrant response to being tested, according to the Indian news agency Press Trust of India.
Vijay Goel, photographed in July, justifies his behavior.
On Wednesday, Olympic organizers threatened to revoke Goel's accreditation if his behavior did not improve, sending a warning letter after he and his company tried to enter restricted areas at the venue and arena of the gymnastics competition, where fencing and taekwondo are taking place.
"We have received several reports that your sports minister has attempted to enter the accredited competition areas with individuals without accreditation," writes Sarah Peterson, continental manager of the Rio 2016 Organizing Committee.
When the staff tried to explain that this was not allowed, the people with the minister became aggressive and rude, and sometimes broke past our staff.
"If our protocol team becomes aware of any further instances of such behaviour, your accreditation as Minister of Sports will be revoked and his privileges at the Olympic Games will be revoked," the letter continued.
The leader of the Indian delegation called the case "an elephant blown out of a fly", and Goel himself said he did nothing wrong, writing it all off as a "misunderstanding".
On Twitter, he wrote, "As far as I know, we have complied with all the rules.
We maintain the spirit of the Olympic Games and support our Indian athletes.
It’s a great way to get to know each other.
Hope's losing fans indicated on social media that Michael Phelps had won as many medals - 26 - as India in its history.
Several prominent candidates have already been excluded, including shooter Abhinav Bindra, who won the gold medal in Beijing in 2008.
This time he was fourth.
In the wind, money and opportunity are run," sardonic tweet author and columnist Shoba De.
However, a few bright hopes remain, as there will still be competitions in boxing, golf, tennis, athletics and, yes, badminton.
The only Indian gymnast, Dipa Karmakar, will compete in the jump finals on Sunday, showing his creepy double-return "Death Jump", a Produnova jump that only a few other gymnasts have tried.
For a country of 1.25 billion people, India's low number of medals won has always been the cause of indignation.
Analysts say there are countless reasons for this.
The national passion is cricket, which is not an Olympic sport.
India has not invested heavily in infrastructure and training Olympians - Karmakar's first gymnastic tool was made from spare parts of an old scooter.
Parents have always emphasized the superiority of academic knowledge about sports.
And the authorities responsible for sport are embroiled in corruption.
The International Olympic Committee has suspended the Indian Olympic Association for violating its statutes in 2012 due to the election of leaders against whom criminal cases have been initiated.
In Sochi, three members of the Indian Winter Olympics were even prevented from representing their country, carrying a flag, or wearing anything with national symbolism.
They competed as independent athletes.
As humans suffered injuries, the turbulence-crazed JetBlue aircraft on the route Boston-Sacramento is forced to land in South Dakota.
The JetBlue plane was forced to make an emergency landing Thursday night after 22 passengers and two crew members were injured during a turbulence, CBS Sacramento reports.
Flight 429 from Boston to Sacramento landed in Rapid City, South Dakota, shortly before 19:30 pm local time.
The airline says the injured have been taken to hospital for checks.
JetBlue claims it has sent personnel to help the injured, a replacement plane has flown to Rapid City to transport the other passengers to Sacramento.
Drug Control Agency (DEA) misses out on medical marijuana
Unfortunately, the answer is: unlikely.
This is a missed opportunity, which could further hinder the provision of treatment to countless people.
To this day, there is only one federally approved source of medical marijuana use for scientific purposes at the University of Mississippi.
In apparently a slightly more positive news today, the DEA also announced that it would now allow other sites to apply for permission to do the same.
It is hoped that the amount and diversity of marijuana available for scientific purposes could expand.
Although it will attract attention as an emphasis in favor of the study, it will largely be symbolic because no matter how much marijuana is available, if access to it is still difficult, it has no great significance.
Imagine a product that is in great demand, but is stored behind closed doors.
In response to the demand for a product, someone makes a hard-to-understand decision to produce it more, but get and it never unlocks the door.
This product is marijuana, and its location in list 1 is this locked door.
In such an unpleasant situation, medical marijuana is located.
Since marijuana is a Schedule 1 substance (by definition it "has no currently approved medical use and has a high potential for unintended use"), there are significant obstacles to unlocking the door.
Potential researchers usually turn to the DEA first because it grants permission to undertake scientific research.
Even if a permit is issued for the exploration of substances on list 1, the authorities must comply with very strict safety regulations and install high-level safety systems, which can be expensive.
There is also an even more subjective consideration for obtaining permission from one's academic institution to conduct research on substances included in List 1, in the first instance.
Even if some faculty members want to do this research, university leadership may not want problems or any potential side results due to negative press reports.
This was the case at the University of Arizona when Dr. Sue Sisley was discharged after trying to push medical marijuana trials forward.
Sisley eventually had to seek private funding for her project, and it was not until April, seven years after the initial project initiation, that her project became the first medical marijuana trial approved by the DEA to eliminate post-traumatic stress for veterans.
Then, after years of struggle with bureaucratic obstacles, the National Institute of Drug Addiction has been at the heart of the final lock.
It is currently the largest federal state funder of marijuana research, and is the only supplier of marijuana itself.
Even if more medical supplies go into free circulation for research, the institute will still have to approve all of its funded research.
However, the problem lies in the word "abuse" in its title.
Dr. Donald Abrams, a spokesman for the University of San Francisco I interviewed for my documentary, Marijuana, says the institute's primary mission is to study substances in the context of their potential addictions, not as medicines.
Abrams draws attention to an important fact.
Even if the study overcomes all the obstacles listed above, the door may still be closed if the intention is to study the benefits of medical marijuana rather than the harm it causes.
Note: A quick (and, I admit, unscientific) search in the U.S. National Library of Medicine found 1,434 works on medical marijuana in the past five years.
In this same search, only 57 works were about the benefits of medical marijuana.
Most of the research was on the harm caused by marijuana, such as "Bad trip due to anticholinergic effects of marijuana", "Marijuana-induced pancreatitis" and "The use of marijuana and the risk of lung cancer."
Such disproportion creates a rather distorted picture.
The road to the use of medical marijuana is paved with surprises and hypocrisy wherever the view opens.
While the DEA is taking up List 1 status without seeing a medical effect, the U.S. Department of Health and Social Affairs at the same time retains a cannabinoid patent for large-scale medical purposes.
The DEA continues to place marijuana alongside heroin and LSD as drugs with high potential for addiction, although DEA's own chief administrative law judge, Francis Young, opposed it.
Strictly medically, marijuana is safer than many widely consumed foods.
For example, ingesting 10 fresh potatoes can cause toxic reactions.
By comparison, it is physically impossible to eat so much marijuana that death occurs.
Marijuana in its natural form is one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to mankind.
It’s not that I don’t want to live in a world where everything I do is illegal.
Again, it was proposed by the DEA's own judge.
However, almost 30 years later, little has changed.
Whether we are aware of it or not, we all accept a certain dose of hypocrisy in our daily lives.
Maybe we don't always have the energy to express it out loud, or we're so dumb or stunned that no one seems to notice it.
As for hypocrisy in the context of federal medical marijuana policy, there must be resilience to present the facts relentlessly.
The lives of patients, such as Charlotte's Fiji whose seizures are mitigated by the use of medical marijuana, and the lives of many others depend on it.
About the fact that the plant can bring so many benefits and still lie behind closed doors, it is worth talking at a higher level.
Bloody Beetroots: Donald Trump "blondeis Berlusconi"
Bloody Beetroots is known in the context of electronic dance music
Musicians say Trump dominates media similar to Berlusconi's
You know, we're used to Berlusconi in Italy, and for me, Trump looks like a blond Berlusconi," the founder of the electronic music punk band, The Bloody Beetroots, told CNN.
The Republican presidential candidate and the Italian media magnate who has become a politician are both known for his exaggerated personality, ability to attract the attention of the press and his transformed story in the media.
In "Bloody Beetroots", Rifo is known for his electronic dance music and has collaborated with various artists, ranging from the legendary Sir Paul McCartney to electropop singer Greta Swabo Bech in 2013 in the song "Chronicles of a Fallen Love."
Rifo was born in the Italian city of Bassano del Grappa, near Venice, in 1977, which roughly coincides with the time of the emergence of punk rock, and the numbers "1977" have been tattooed to the musician on his chest.
"English is not my native language, so I don't understand everything about your world," Rifo said, hiding behind the black charge he is familiar with.
I'm trying to explore, and I've tried to improve my understanding of your culture.
Rifo invited Americans to watch "Videocrat", a documentary exploring Berlusconi's monopoly over Italian media.
The documentary is about how "Berlusconi made Italy crazy," said Rifo, adding that Trump had had a similar effect on America.
"You see how a man can completely reverse the system and fold everything... in his own way," he said.
In my opinion, Trump is not good for this country.
Two Turkish sailors jailed in over GBP 500 million drug case
Two Turkish men have been convicted of smuggling more than 500 million pounds of cocaine aboard a ship in the North Sea, each sentenced to at least 20 years in prison.
Mamin Sahin and Emin Ozman were found guilty after a trial at the High Court in Glasgow after three tons of Class A drugs were found on board the "MV Hamal" about 100 miles off the coast of Aberdeen.
Detention in 2015 is the largest one-on-one cocaine load ever seized at sea in Europe.
Mamin Sahin and Emin Ozman sentenced to prison for his role in large-scale drug deal
The large-scale shipment of drugs found on board is one of the largest in British history
The drugs were found hidden in a specially set ambush on a tugboat registered in Tanzania that sailed from Istanbul to Tenerife and then to the North Sea.
It was stopped by the British navy frigate "HMS Somerset" and the border force cutter "HMC Valiant".
Sahin (47) was sentenced to 22 years, while Ozman (51) is sentenced to 20 years in Glasgow High Court.
Justice Lord Kinkleiven told the men that the amount of the drug was "not only substantial but ambitious", and drug smuggling has a "destructive effect" on people and the surrounding community.
He said, "You were involved in the most commercially ambitious operation, including transporting cocaine by ship, an operation that crossed international and truly intercontinental borders."
He said that the ship's captain, Sahin, was not "at the end of the drug tree", but he had played an essential role in the crime, while the other role of Captain Ozman was "somewhat less".
Inspectors climbed aboard "Hamal" after prompting information from the French customs authority, DNRED, and when it docked in Aberdeen, they drilled through a steel plate accessing a secret compartment where 128 bundles of cocaine weighing 3.2 tons were found, with an estimated value on the black market of 512 million slash pounds.
MV Hamal was inspected by the Royal Navy last year.
Three tons of cocaine were on board.
It was found during an inspection of the ship that tons of Class A drugs had been accumulated in its ballast tanks
The ship was en route from the Bosporus Strait to South America before it was stopped in the North Sea.
Access to this site was opened under the cabinet in one of the crew's crew rooms, and the gap was cemented.
Sahin and Ozman were found guilty of transporting and hiding cocaine on board between 20 February and 23 April last year, and of supplying cocaine between 21 April and 23 April.
The two previously unpunished men who worked in the shipping industry since leaving school continue to plead not guilty, however, passing the jury verdict.
The charges against four other men lack evidence.
Sahin's lawyer, Jonathan Crow, said that a married father of two was a "glorified mule".
He said, "Someone who was involved in the transportation of drugs."
Someone who was able to control the ship.
Looking at the drug hierarchy, Sahin is certainly not at the top of the drug tree, but somewhere below.
The huge amount of cocaine on board meant that it had to be lifted by crane
Police went through the entire ship for days before the drugs were distributed through these boxes
Sahina approached questions about his master's work on"Hamal" in February 2015, the court heard.
It’s important to remember that the best way to get rid of a cold is to avoid the flu.
Both men have not seen their families since their arrest in April 2015, as families are still struggling to get visa approval.
Ozman's lawyer, Di Moore, said that he "desperately" wants to see his family, but knows that in the foreseeable future it will "not be possible".
Speaking after today's verdicts, Scottish prosecutor David Harvey said, "The international drug trade knows no borders, and we, whose job it is to destroy it, are working ever closer together to get us one step ahead.
"Scotland's success in persecuting criminals is indeed at a global level, and in this case we have inflicted significant economic losses on the representatives of organised crime."
The drugs were stuffed into all the gaps on the board, including under the floors.
Inspectors of these contraband packages found hidden in the ship's laundry room
Mr. Harvey added: "Hamal" was identified by intelligence indications from French authorities, and after a quick cooperation with the Tanzanian where the ship was registered, the Attorney General, who also allowed to board the ship.
"Our investigation then came from Guiana, which gave us access to essential data on shipments, to Spain, which gave us very valuable information about the stops on the Canary Islands.
We also worked with colleagues in Denmark, Norway and the US to bring together specific evidence elements.
Despite extensive intelligence about large quantities of drugs being carried by Hamal, representatives of the British authorities in international waters could not climb aboard it without permission from the Tanzanian government - something they had never awarded before.
Sue Payten, Head of the Royal Criminal Prosecution Office (CPS) for International Justice and Organised Crime said, "By acting quickly and accurately, the CPS criminal justice advisor managed to obtain permission from the Tanzanian authorities to board the ship within 24 hours of receiving the intelligence.
Under international maritime law, British officials do not have the right to board a ship flying the flag of another country in international waters unless that country issues a special legal permit to do so.
Without the swift action of our criminal justice adviser, there would be a great risk that the ship could escape and that we could never bring these people to justice.
Photographer Brian Romeijn captures the stunted "East Express" train
Photographer Brian Romeijn from Rotterdam took a photo of this abandoned train in Belgium
The pictures show the rusty inside of the train, the broken seats, the dust-covered windows and the narrow driving cab
It has already been named an Eastern Express Car, but it belonged to the Belgian national railway company.
The urban explorer has taken these remarkable photographs showing the decline of the remains of a passenger train that was once one of the best ways to travel.
Its flower times have long passed,and the train wagon and locomotive have been left to rot in the train depot in Belgium, where they have become a popular sight for photographers and adventurers.
Photographer Brian Romeijn, 40, has taken these scary photos showing the rusty inside of a train, the torn seats, the dust-covered windows, and the compressed driver's cab
The train car and locomotive have been left to rot the train depot in Belgium, where they have become a popular sight for photographers and adventurers.
These trains were a symbol of luxury when they operated under the legendary name between 1883 and 2009.
The locomotive was used by the Belgian national railway company about 50 years ago.
After 126 years on the tracks, the last train operating under the name of the Eastern Express went from Strasbourg to Vienna in December 2009, concluding the famous period of history.
The Eastern Express was famous on the route Paris - Istanbul.
When it was launched in 1883 (operator - La Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits) it was known as the French "Express d'Orient".
It became the Eastern Express in 1891, and by the 1930s it already had regular routes throughout Europe.
It should not be confused with the private "Venice Simplon-Orient-Express".
There are very few "Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits" luxury carriages left.
The narrow driver’s cab in this photo where the equipment rusts is still fitted with gauges and exposed wires
Romeijn said the driver's cab was "in a sense claustrophobic, and the noise of the locomotive must have been unbearable."
The abandoned locomotive and wagon have become a popular sight for photographers and adventurers.
After visiting the forgotten train in Belgium, Romeinge at MailOnlineTravel said, "I was really able to feel how it had been used in its flower times."
This is the first time I’ve heard of this book.
I’m not sure if I’ll ever be able to do it again.
Thanks to her impressive sinking skills, reviews and transformations, the Texan woman and YouTube censor Kathleen Geloway have reached an army of fans.
However, her last transformation into Baster Bluth from Arrested Development is quite incredible by any standards.
In the three-minute-long video uploaded to her Kiki G YouTube channel, Geloway slowly and continuously turns herself into a failed image with a hook in place of a hand.
She even uses some audio recording from the show at the end of the clip in a terrible, but at the same time great performance.
The talented make-up artist begins her video in her own image of a blonde woman.
Then, with the help of the slowed photographs, she slowly turns into the spectacled "memmester" who is already receding her hair, and who is Tony Hale Baster Bluth.
Geloway does this with colored contact lenses, shading and pulling contours around the nose and eyes, and drawing the Baster's face on his head.
Wise techniques: using the slowed-down photo wisely, she slowly turns into Tony Hale's Baster Bluth.
Over the course of her video, she also takes over the personality and manners of a cult TV image, accordingly also retracting her chin.
The clip, which has been posted on YouTube, has been watched over 45,000 times, and glorifying comments from the makeup artist appeared rather quickly:
"You're extremely talented," a person wrote in a video posted under Holloway.
In the course of her video, she also takes over the personality and manners of a cult TV image
"I like the way you stay in the image doing all this," added someone else.
Videoblogger Kathleen Gelovey had previously successfully turned into the "Parks and Recreation" character Ron Swenson.
She told her YouTube followers that she hopes to make make makeovers every week in the future.

In Lancashire, a father is expelled from a children's school for wearing a T-shirt with swear words
The father of two children expelled from the children's school for coming to their sports day in a T-shirt with an offensive inscription.
Craig Macbeth (36) from the town of Burnley, Lancashire, says that he "accidentally"had put on a shirt with the inscription "To the time and dr.am!"
However, despite the fact that when he noticed his miseed and put on a T-shirt the other way around, the next day he found that he was forbidden from entering the school grounds.
A lone father, who has been working for four years as the head of Park Primary School in Colne, Burnle, was unable to come after the children due to a ban, and the staff even called social services and police.
Craig Macbeth (36) from Children says he was not allowed into the school grounds after arriving for a children's sports day in an abusive T-shirt.
Mr. Burnley accuses school principal Sarah Midgley of reacting too harshly.
He says that he has been unjustly punished for the fact that, before going to watch his two children's races, mistakes after hastily wearing a T-shirt.
A father who no longer works as a schoolmaster said, "It was a mistake and carelessness on my part."
I don't think about sports day and hurry when I put it on.
Closer to the end of the event we had a father race, and the director noticed my T-shirt and told me it wasn't suitable.
I apologized and cut it out to the other side, and that's what ended the case.
However, the 36-year-old said that he received a letter from the chairman of the school leaders that invited him to a meeting with the principal the next day, but he did not see the need to do so because he had already apologized.
"Then the school principal called me and told me that I was forbidden from entering the school grounds," Mr. Burnley added.
I learned that after a day of sports, some parents had sounded that alarm on Facebook and that many people were interested in it.
Any reasonable person would say that this is exaggerated.
Mr. Macbeth, who is the editor of the online magazine Love Mini, said that, in his opinion, he could not even come after the children on the last day of the semester because of the ban.
However, this was the reason for the call from the school and social services.
On the T-shirt was Craig Charles' character Lister from the BBC cult comedy Red Dwarf with one of his iconic expressions for "Laižam un dr.am."
He commented, "I told them I wasn't there because I'm forbidden from entering school.
Then I got a phone call from the social services and asked why I wasn't chasing my daughter.
The school also called the police because I had not come to pick up my daughter for about 40 minutes."
Mr. Macbeth claims that he was told that he could no longer come to the school premises and that the ban would remain until further statements were made.
He also mentioned that he had been warned that he could be fined GBP 500 if caught breaking this rule.
Sarah Midgley, headmaster of Park Primary School, said that the case has now been dismissed.
Sarah Midgley, headmaster of Park Primary School, said, "I can confirm that Mr. Macbeth has resigned and is no longer the head of our school."
This case has now been dismissed, and I hope to return to the usual school life in September."
Childly City Councillor Joe Cooney said the school had clear policies and guidelines.
"We must all bear in mind that assuming positions such as counsellor or manager, you are subject to higher standards, and unfortunately this time he did not meet these standards," he said.
Councillor Jonathan Nixon added that he did not think the school should have imposed a ban on him and that an elephant was said to have been blown out of the fly.
Mr. Nixon added, "Such wearing of a T-shirt was silly, and he apologized for that as well."
Lancashire police confirmed they were called from school, but they did not show up.
Recently, the premises of the former factory VEF have been renovated, which is located in Brīvības gatve, where there are several IT companies, the industry has already begun to call this area the local Silicon Valley.
The rest of the VEF territory, including Bērzaunes, is also developing.
The development and construction of the 2nd stage project of the UL Academic Centre in Tornakalns will cost EUR 21 million.
The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 210 concerning detailed rules for the application of this paragraph.
The procurement took the form of a negotiated procedure without prior publication of a contract notice.
The contract will be concluded with the general partnership LNK Industries group, which has committed to carry out these works for 21,186,560 euros.
As explained by the UL, the University, starting the planning and implementation of the European Union funds planning period 2014-2021, continues the design, author supervision and construction of the next stage of the Academic Complex - the building of the Science Centre, in accordance with the sketch project and the detailed construction plan.
The building of the Science Centre according to the type of basic activity to be performed in it is similar to the building of the Academic Centre of Natural Sciences designed and built in the 1st stage and the activity to be performed therein, which according to the most important technical and technological parameters, as well as the number of scientific and academic staff and students in the building are similar.
The competition was accompanied by a sketch design developed by SIA Sixth Style, which provided all possible suppliers with information on the development vision of the University of Latvia Academic Centre in Torņkalns, including a list of objects planned by the University of Latvia Academic Centre, where the name of each specific object, the estimated area of the object, the planned year of commissioning of the object and other information is indicated.
At the end of 2015, SIA Sixth Style performed a meta-correction of the territory of the complex of buildings of the Academic Centre of the University of Latvia in Tornakalns, as a result of which the layout of the buildings of the Academic Centre and their interconnection were clarified, as well as the organization of transport in the meta area and its surroundings.

Jansons met today with the Minister of Health Anda Čakša to discuss the situation in the health sector.
After the meeting, Jansons told journalists that the industry financing model offered by the Minister of Health is sustainable and would develop the health care system, make it more accessible to patients.
It’s important to remember that you don’t have to be perfect to be perfect, but you can be perfect to be perfect.
Jansons also stressed that any demagoguery about mandatory health insurance, which would impose a direct and increased payment burden on the population, does not stand up to any criticism, especially if the Dutch model is invoked.

In the evening of 12 August, the audience will be shown the human drama "The Elephant", which was produced by director Laura Groza-Ķibere.
It is the story of a real historical person - John Merrick - who lived in Victorian London and had been nicknamed the Elephant because of the deformed body of his hereditary disease.
It’s also important to keep in mind that there are a number of factors that can affect the quality of sleep.
As his work has been described by critic Normunds Akots, Meriks is a ""passed through-the-heart" role in which the born image is not repeatable".
This is the first time I've heard of this book.
The show has received six "Players' Night" nominations, including "The Big Form Show of the Year".
The director has created the production as a unique portrait gallery, giving equal importance to every image of the play, so each of them is both a centre and a background.
The show consists of several mini-shows, which finally form a single whole.
It is an observation of human nature, where the main conflict is between true emotions and cold-blooded calculation, brightly revealing how a person changes in different situations - each of the heroes is sometimes a wolf who, for the sake of greed and his own good, tears others apart, sometimes a sheep that is torn apart by someone else.
In addition, it is important to note that the use of this product is not recommended for pregnant women, as it is not recommended to use it in the first trimester.
It's not a sad but humorous story about how someone's only friend gets an elevator.
Despite the style of the cemetery, which dominates the visual image of the performance, the dominant intonation of the production is nevertheless bright and even optimistic.
"The man who shuns the elevator" is not about the doom of loneliness and old age, but about the fact that life is worth loving.
It’s also important to note that there’s no such thing as a good credit score.
It’s a great way to get to know each other better.
Detective Olga: My job is not a TV series, but a real life.
I’m not sure if I’ll ever be able to do it again.
She laughs loudly and leaves a very positive impression on the person.
Dressed in white trousers and white jackets - a very elegant woman who overturns all my ideas about what a woman-detector should look like.
She greets me with champagne, which I kindly refuse.
I'm telling you that I'm addressing her because I found it interesting that a woman deals with such an unusual thing.
It's always been men's work.
Olga has a higher legal education - a master's degree.
She used to work for the criminal police.
He said he wanted something of his own and started his own company.
That was enough knowledge.
"The police come back I really didn't want", Olga tells.
It's a routine.
There, in the criminal police, we investigated the cases, gathered information.
We work with suspects.
"This year's 10th anniversary for Riga Detective Agency".
She calls for an anniversary celebration: "There will be no drinking."
Everyone is a pledging person.
When asked about her business, Olga says, "The business is very specific."
For the first five years, I had a team.
After that, I realized that working in a team is sometimes dangerous.
It is such a business when, if someone unprofessionally works, they may end up in a very bad situation.
If journalists are the fifth power, then we are the second.
Of course, the sphere is not simple.
Many people try to frame us because they are cheating on us.
Let the people think so!
Many come and ask if they can install eavesdropping equipment, attract dogs.
Many have seen the movies.
Detective business is serious.
"It's a gathering of information", Olga tells.
If by law there is a crime, I have to warn you about it.
We boil the green tea and laugh - to at least have a mug to hold on to and talk.
I've had a client I've been constantly beaten by my husband.
She sought protection, of course.
We also have security.
Her husband was a maniac.
At first, everything is always beautiful and good, but then it begins.
"It's the most terrible thing", Olga tells.
Psyche is broken and it happens that you can be treated like a cattle.
It can end badly.
God forbid, by suicide.
It's very dangerous.
People become victims at some point in time.
"Many women try to walk away from families and then come back again", she says.
From the last order I refused.
"It happened for the first time in my life", says Olga.
There was such a strange situation.
The woman was married and had a son.
"Her husband beat her and made her disabled", Olga recalls.
I believe that a woman has a maternal instinct and, above all, must protect her children.
When it all happened, she came to me asking me to get rid of that man.
There are people who are obsessed with revenge.
The most terrible thing is that my mother turned her eyes on it.
I can't understand it.
Her child is now disabled.
We couldn't find a body once, and the dog helped a lot.
In the department of drugs at all can not do without dogs.
"I understand there are adequate people and there are those who don't have a whole psyche", she says.
Of course, the facts of fraud are up to date.
Or there is a divorce in the family, and it is necessary to collect information.
It's finding out who the guilty party is.
The last thing I've been up to is when my girlfriends have cheated on other girlfriends.
It's interesting, because men used to cheat, now women.
Even the best friends fight!
Women "throw" girlfriends for 100 and more thousands of euros.
Women need to be careful when going abroad because they can be sold into slavery.
"Latvian women are intelligent and trust too much", Olga believes.
There have been cases of couples going abroad to get married a second time.
It's not legal.
Olga says that she had a husband who was like Jesus Christ.
For tall, long hair.
When I was 22 years old, there was a tragedy.
He had a severe head injury.
He returned as a completely different person.
"I pulled him out", Olga remembers.
It can be compared to hell, it was terrible.
When asked what is the most unusual thing you have ever faced, Olga says: "All are special, but the craziest thing is a thing that uses trust."
When a girlfriend "throws" a girlfriend.
Borrow and return the money.
If you have a lawyer's education and experience in the police, you can work as a detective.
"One thing is to feel like a detective, the other - to have it", Olga tells.
The situation when we solve cases of infidelity is quite crazy, because women are often not ready for the solution of the situation.
They are not ready to accept the result.
This is an unpredictable situation, because a person is not ready to lose a family.
Not every woman is ready to accept reality.
Often young girls who feel the taste of money use rich married men.
One man who tracked down his wife said it couldn't be that she didn't have a lover because all the wives had cheated on her.
"He was married three times", Olga remembers.
I guess that's a man's problem if all his wives cheat on him.
Olga tells about the case when a woman with all the children left the man, and she asked him if he ever raised a hand against her.
In general, I beat him constantly, he answered.
In such cases, I refuse to work.
I find it interesting how things are solved - whether photographs are taken and shown to a spouse if there is evidence of fraud.
How does this work?
"In parallel to the detective's work, there is the protection of personal data", Olga tells.
This is a provocative issue.
One law allows you to do everything, the other - does not allow anything.
For personal interests, we may take such photos and videos, but not for public viewing.
If you submit material that does not comply with the law to the court, then there may be major problems.
In order to become a detective, education and experience are not enough, one must also be mentally healthy and meet the criteria.
We don't take fingerprints, that's what the police do.
I'm telling customers, get off the series, here's real life!
In fact, when I was working in the (police) system, I also had to use dogs, they helped a lot.
"In the department of drugs can not do without dogs at all", Olga tells.
Some clients turn to me in relation to the murder investigation, but I don't like to take on such cases.
These are very heavy things.
Now there are more and more male clients, because women tend to make fun of men.
It used to be different.
Now women have fun, but men sit at home with children.
"Of course, decent people suffer the most," says Olga.
I like Dale Carnegie.
He says stop worrying and start living.
We all know the saying that if you're hit by one cheek, you must turn the other, but you shouldn't!
It's got to be said that you're uncomfortable with this.
That must not be the case.
Don’t be afraid to lose what hinders you from living life.
You can't become a masochist, and we're getting what we're allowed to do with ourselves.
Yes, my first case was directly related to her husband's infidelity when a woman was not ready to accept the fact that her husband was cheating on her.
She called all the time and asked what to do.
"I now ask all clients if they are ready to accept the situation when they find out that the husband is really cheating on her", Olga says.
It's not entertainment, it's life.
If you come and hire a detective, you have to take responsibility.
It's not theater, it's show, it's real life.
I am also a reiki specialist.
It is a heart affair and related to Japanese medicine - treatment by hand.
It's a very interesting thing.
Why did I start doing this?
This is due to a large amount of adrenaline, and yourself need to somehow calm down.
Reiki not only soothes, but restores energy, illuminates.
"People are getting out of my office positively and satisfied", Olga tells.
She has reiki signs placed on her wall in the office, and Olga says that she writes them not with a brush but with her fingers.
I didn't just get to it, the book about reiki literally fell into my hands.
I felt it as a sign.
However, it is very personal.
Find out more about Reiki here.
Olga sings too.
That's her hobby.
All of us are creative.
I have been playing guitar for 11 years.
I've recorded songs and clips.
I'm positive and smiling, but I have to rest to recover.
Others are saved by alcohol, I'm told.
Alcohol's sinking.
It is used a lot in the police because the work is stressful.
"It causes aggression, and moves can be unpredictable", she tells.
I'm interested in sports and reiki.
I've been doing tennis for 15 years.
I also liked horseback riding.
I shut down in nature, I write articles, I'd like to write a book.
There's a fine line in detective work when a job comes into your life.
"It's a job you shouldn't let into life", she tells.
When asked how one can combine work with private life, Olga says, "My beloved man is in Italy."
We have very strong feelings.
That must be the truest love in my life.
I've had enough to think about her, and I'm feeling better already.
Detectives don't usually trust, but they've accepted my job.
In fact, I separate work from private life.
I haven't gotten into this business in the same way.
Reiki has guided me.
Already when I was a kid, I saw more than others.
Thanks to rakes, intuition opens.
There are a lot of detectives, but there are few real ones.
In any case, it's work with the brain, and it's hard to switch off.
You also need a rest.
"Otherwise you can't recover", Olga admits.
The hardest thing I've ever worked with is the story of Constance.
I've been working on that thing for a year.
The man literally made fun of that woman.
I did so, however, that the child and his mother left for England - further from the danger.

How to better prepare for a family photo session.
The summer is still in full swing, as is the school year that families tend to capture in their photos.
To make the pictures look happy and beautiful, it is worth thinking about how to prepare for the photo session in advance.
Tips "Ihappymama" are provided by a large mom Aleksandra Nesterenko and a professional photographer Marina Levickaja.
You have to take pictures in nature, because it is much more natural and harmonious.
It is much more difficult for children to get used to and relax in the studio.
It is recommended to choose a uniform style for the whole family, preferably in the same color range.
Alexandra, for example, says that she chooses clothes for all six members of the family so that the clothes have no more than three shades of color and as few inscriptions on the clothes as possible.
Don't forget about the good mood.
Have fun, make fun, play, but in no case shout or scold if the children are not immediately as obedient as they would like.
And here's the advice from a professional photographer's dowry!
You have to understand exactly what you want to capture during the photo session and tell the photographer about it.
For some, they will be beautiful, neat children and a perfectly designed family picture; for others, "life is as it is", that is, the desire to see real, true emotions in pictures, or, as the photographer herself loves to say, "fleeing backs", "turned eyes", "turned nose".
Of course, it happens that someone also wants "two in one", but this happens rarely.
In any case, when you go to a photo shoot, you have to understand that these are just a couple of hours from your life, and the less you get stuck, the better.
You are yourself - there is not a strict mom who works, cooks, is raised and so on, and not the ever-busy dad who is constantly talking on the phone.
And neither is the man who lives in you behind some unknown shell.
Be a family, remember how great it is to hug each other, smile at yours and make fun of each other.
And then the photographer's task will be just to capture the real moments of emotions that prevail between you.
If you have chosen a photographer, trust him.
Stop asking 250 times to show what's going on, listen to his advice on choosing clothes for better shots.
This is the first time I’ve ever seen it in my own life.
Plan the route and think about how much time you will need to get to the place of the photo session (especially if the shooting takes place in the studio and the time is limited).
If you have small children, choose the time for the photo session, which corresponds to the regime of the shoot day, so that it does not happen at a time when the baby usually sleeps in the afternoon.
And, of course, do not forget to take food, cookies, water and your favorite toy with you (to use toys and sweets only in extreme situations).
“Prepare for Dad that he may have to take off his socks, but this is not usually the case with such advice, and only photographers know what the problem is,” says Marina.
Do not drink a lot of water before the photo session and get a good night’s sleep before.
It would also be advisable to have some fun together after the photo session.
Go to the amusement park, eat some ice cream, ride roller skates - which family likes more.
This way you will have great pictures and pleasant memories of the day spent together.
Krasnopyorov and Fadejeva: Raising the minimum wage - a wonderstick or a brake for the economy?
The question of raising the minimum wage in public discussions is almost the status of a sacred cow: either support for the raising, or mention any non-expressive, general phrases.
Taking into account the significant increase in the risk of economic stagnation (we barely avoided a technical recession), we think it is important to stress that raising the minimum wage is not a miracle that will reduce income inequality with one hint, will bring Latvian wages closer to the Western European level and will fill the state budget.
On the contrary, raising the minimum wage too much does more harm than good, because raising it reduces the competitiveness and employment of businesses, especially in sectors and regions with low incomes.
At first glance, it seems that despite several increases in the minimum wage in the post-crisis period, the minimum wage in Latvia is not so high that raising tens of euros a year would significantly weaken the competitiveness of companies - only 370 euros, while in some European Union (EU) countries the minimum wage is about one and a half thousand.
However, a different picture can be seen if we compare it with the average wage in the country (%): the minimum wage in Latvia (44%) exceeds the EU average.
Since the share of minimum wage recipients in Latvia is significantly higher than in neighbouring countries (in Latvia - 17%, Lithuania - 11%, Estonia - 6%[1]), a similar increase in minimum wage is binding for most companies.
According to the results of the survey of the companies of Latvijas Banka, one in five Latvian companies replied that as the minimum wage increased at the beginning of 2014, it was important or very important to increase the prices of products.
This means that, firstly, the rise in the minimum wage was partly financed by consumers (i.e., Latvian residents); secondly, raising prices meant loss of competitiveness for several companies both in the domestic market and abroad (i.e., increased imports and limited exports were promoted).
Due to the weaker competitiveness and shrinking production volumes, it was important for almost one in fifteen Latvian companies to lay off employees (which means more unemployment and emigration).
In addition, almost every eleventh company responded that it was important for him to limit recruitment of new employees due to raising the minimum wage.
It is worth remembering that in 2011-2013 the minimum wage in Latvia did not change.
Therefore, even if one in five companies noted productivity improvement as important when assessing the 2014 minimum wage increase, it does not mean that a similar result could be expected in 2017 (fourth increase of the minimum wage in a row could exhaust the possibilities of raising productivity).
Another important result is that, due to the rise in the minimum wage, it was important for several companies to increase the remuneration of employees who earn more than the minimum wage.
Thus, the impact of the minimum wage was significant even for those companies where the minimum wage was not received by any of the employees.
In recent years, the rise in minimum wages in all three Baltic countries exceeded that in nominal productivity (real productivity + inflation).
Thus, further increases in the minimum wage that are not justified by productivity growth (even despite the overall rather low level in euro terms) will have a negative impact on the competitiveness and employment of enterprises.
When assessing the justification for raising the minimum wage, it is not enough to analyse the average indicators of the economy.
It should also be examined whether raising the minimum wage is "tolerable" in sectors and regions where the minimum wage is most frequently used.
The results of Latvijas Banka's survey show that the concentration of employees with minimum wages is highest in small enterprises (the number of employees is from 10 to 19; 25%).
At the end of 2013, the share of employees with minimum wages was higher (16% and 19%, respectively) than in trade (15%), construction (11%) and financial and insurance sectors (2%).
On the other hand, for Latgale, where the minimum wage is 64% of the average wage (and more than two thirds of the average wage in the private sector), its further rise may be more damaging by reducing labour demand (i.e., maintaining already high unemployment) and promoting the sustainability of the shadow economy.
Some signs show that the large minimum wage rises (up 27%) implemented in 2014-2015 have slowed down the development of Latgale.
For example, Latgale is the only region in Latvia where unemployment in 2015 was higher than in 2013.
It should be noted that Estonia and Lithuania do not have any regions that would lag so much behind in terms of average wages from the rest of the country.
In Estonia, for example, the average wage in all regions is at least twice the national minimum wage.
In Lithuania, the lowest wages are in the Taurage region, but also there the minimum wage was 54% of the average wage in 2015 (after two sharp increases in the minimum wage in 2016, this indicator could reach 58%).
The call for raising the minimum wage up to 68% of the average wage in the country (see, for example, here) from time to time is lacking in economic justification and cannot be implemented in the short or long term.
First, such a high number of the average salary or even standing so close to it does not exist in any EU country.
Secondly, it would mean raising the minimum wage above the average wage in several sectors of the economy (which would mean bankruptcy and mass redundancies of companies in these sectors), for example, in the production of clothing, leather goods, fish processing, catering services, as well as in veterinary services; moreover, it is more than the current average wage in the private sector of Latgale.
Raising the minimum wage from January 2017 to 400-410 euros per month, as currently offered by the Ministry of Welfare, would make the minimum wage in Latvia (% of the average wage) one of the highest in the EU.
If nominal productivity increases by 4% and the minimum wage at least twice as fast, this has clear negative consequences for business competitiveness and employment.
This will be most common in those sectors and regions where the current minimum wage is often used, for example, in Latgale.
The fact that we cannot afford a significant increase in the minimum wage at the moment means that other mechanisms should be used to support low wage earners.
Immediate effect can be achieved by travelling with a personal income tax-free minimum (within the limits of budget possibilities).
Inadequate levels of education, inadequate education and poor quality of the education received, as well as poor health (which often occurs without going to the doctor because of the cost of medical services and long queues) are among the real causes of income inequality.
During the survey, 521 responses were received from the Latvian company regarding the response to the increase in the minimum wage that occurred in January 2014.
The survey was conducted within the framework of the Wage Dynamics Network (WDN) project of the European System of Central Banks.
These figures represent companies with a number of employees of not less than 10.
This also explains the low proportion of employees with minimum wages in construction.

65% of Venezuelans want to leave Maduro, the question is whether they are prepared to fight for it.
Two out of three Venezuelans want to suspend President Nicolas Maduro, but the question is whether they are prepared to fight for it.
The day after the National Electoral Board announced that there was "no time" to recall the vote this year, with which Chavismo would be in power for the reins until 2019, people on the streets of Caracas continued their usual day walk as if nothing had happened.
"I didn't hear the news because I was watching the Olympics and how Michael Phelps won two more medals," said Rafael Deian, a 36-year-old office worker who rested in Altamira Square on Wednesday.
Altamira Square, located in eastern Caracas, was the epicentre of sharp unrest in early 2014 protesting against Maduro's regime.
However, now that the opposition needs to exert more pressure than ever to get a referendum this year, people across the country are no longer showing that kind of energy.
"I want a referendum, but for security reasons I will not participate in the protests," Deian said.
Others, more informed, want to mobilize in the future, but admit that Venezuelans are less motivated.
The chairman of the election board, Tibisei Lusena, comments on the claim that the government is delaying the recall process.
I will protest whenever the opposition calls for a protest, yet know that some of my friends are scared," Roberto Reyes, (60), told Fox News Latino.
So, in addition to all the barriers the government has built to delay the referendum, the opposition is now facing a new challenge: to motivate people to take to the streets and protest.
Until recently, there was widespread support for the referendum initiative: people came in unprecedented numbers during the signature collection phase.
However, when it comes to protesting against the government's moves to block efforts, the number of people arriving at the rallies is noticeably lower.
"Some people focus on creating food queues, while others are afraid of post-2014 arrests and deaths for many," said Cipriano Eredia, the lawmaker representing the opposition.
After Lussen announced that by the next step of the referendum process - the collection of an even greater number of signatures across the country - it would have to wait until October, those who are against the socialist government say that President Maduro and his followers are simply trying to take away Venezuelans' courage by making them believe that the vote this year is practically impossible.
Under the Constitution, if a referendum were held in 2017, Maduro could be suspended, but he would be allowed to name the next president.
If he were to be suspended today, he is obliged to announce a general election.
The U.S. Department of State addressed the issue in a Thursday afternoon statement calling on Venezuelan authorities to guarantee respect for Venezuelan constitutional rights.
"The other steps in implementing the presidential repeal referendum must be taken clearly, concretely and immediately, thereby contributing to a quick and effective resolution of the current political, economic and social difficulties of the country," it stated.
Luis Salamanca, a political analyst who was a member of the Electoral Board between 2006 and 2009, that changes are not expected so soon.
"I think there won't be a referendum this year unless social unrest and protests get even stronger," he told the FNL.
He said that Lusen and the government were breaking the law, but they would achieve their goal as a result if people did not protest loudly.
The opposition called for a broad-based demonstration in September. First in Caracas to demand a speeding up of the process so that the recall could take place this year.
We want people from all over the country to mobilize in the capital on this day.
The government will feel the pressure," said Eredia.
This is the first time I've heard of this book.
"They should respond to Lusen's statement faster and stronger because it practically kills the referendum," said an expert in the FNL.
Congressman Eredia admitted that some opposition parties wanted the demonstration to take place faster, while others wanted more time to organize the group.
The opposition must now be cautious.
If people feel insecure in this situation, there is a risk that the activity will be low in the second signature collection campaign," Salamanca said.
The referendum process, for it to be activated, must receive support from twenty percent of the country's electorate, which is nearly 4 million people.
Salamanca and other analysts are confident that even if the recall takes place in 2017, Chavismo will be upset.
However, some people are less optimistic.
Our party wants political change today.
"If the government ends the way for an election, we will have to explore other legal options," Eredia told the FNL.

Pensioners in Ogre are active.
This is the first time in my life that I’ve ever seen a movie like this.
"Twice a week we meet in the premises of the Family Support Centre, where we can play novus, table tennis, use exercise equipment," says the chairman of the Ogre Pensioners' Society Jānis Staužs.
In the end of the sports festival all participants received the Ogre region Sports Centre thanks for their participation, but the greatest benefit is fresh air, good mood and time spent together.
2016/2017 Premier League No.19 West Bromwich Albion
Guardian journalists predict position 14 (Attention: it's not just Alan Smith's prediction, but our journalist board in general)
Last season's 14th position
Chances of winning the league (with Oddschecker) 1000-1
Until last week, it looked like a new season case, like the old Bromwich Albion: The 2016/2017 season will once again be a struggle for satisfaction or stagnation, depending on how "empty is the glass" under the guidance of the even more pragmatic Tony Pulis.
However, then Jeremy Pease sold 88% of his club stock to Guochuan Lai and Pulis, archetypically in safe hands, which the bookmakers immediately made a favourite in the unpleasant role of the first dismissed manager.
The situation has undeniably changed in Balack Country - and not only in Hawthorns, but also a few miles northwest of Wolverhampton, where the new Chinese owners abandoned Kenny Jaquet's services, without wasting time.
For Pulis, however, Lai confirmed that his work was not immediately threatened, and the businessman has also expressed his desire not to change the club's culture.
"I don't want to change the virtues of the club or start unsustainable fun," he said, taking over duties.
I want to be a good owner and invest in this club in the long run.
Our first goal is to stay in the Premier League and then get further, I would like to see the club firmly at the top of the division.
I think it's the best league in the world and I want to take this club as far as I can.
These are the achievements of Pulis, the first aspect should not be difficult.
The next goal is to break out to the top of the table, but it will be important for the new owner and the increasingly divided fan base to hope for a quick breakthrough in the table up to realize that this is an extremely difficult task given the thorough work that other teams in the middle of the table have been putting in lately.
In order to get past last season's 14th place, you will definitely have to work harder to get up.
Only Aston Villa, located at the bottom end of the table, hit fewer goals, and it is worth recalling that on Christmas, Albion averaged less than one kick by a goal in 90 minutes, almost or the division's worst score.
They failed to score a goal in 13 of 38 games, and hit more than one goal in just nine games.
Of their 10 wins, no game managed to score more than one goal, and seven games ended at 1-0.
As expected, a dozen out of a total of 34 goals were scored from standard positions.
It is not surprising that the Hawthorns team was in discontent, perhaps most evident after a shocking 0-0 draw with Villa in late January when the guest team looked better.
On the other hand, only the top six teams had better defensive scores - although no club has managed to list four centre midfielders.
These guards are often underrated, especially Johnny Evans, who is wanted by Arsenal in view of their recent crisis in terms of injured players.
The Northern Ireland international team had a great start to the European Championship, and Albion will have to spend heavily to sell.
Ben Foster at the gate is reliable, and they are well-compiled in the middle line.
Darren Fletcher, largely similar to Evans, showed in large part that he was still able to play at a high level at the age of 32, and Claudio Jacob is underrated.
It is disturbing to all sides that the long and twisty future story of Saido Berahino is still unclear.
Pyes is said to be the owner of the stakes from Stoke and Crystal Palace were refused, but they still keep calm and Mark Hughge is ready to wait.
After the last season of being close to liquidation, it is worthwhile for all parties involved to take action.
The attacker is, of course, talented, but as Pulis has mentioned several times, pulling him here to one side, here for a long time, you can see that such a relationship does not work.
Albion insists on the need to sign documents for the change before allowing a former England U-21 team member to go, but their 15 million-pound move with Diafr Saho broke down a few days before the takeover, with the club claiming he passed a medical examination and had everything agreed, but had a back injury, which would mean he would have to skip the start of the season.
This puts a lot of pressure on Venezuelan Salomon Rondon, who looked very hopeful for a while last season, but he has to improve his nine-goal performance, especially if Ricky Lambert continues to be so ineffective.
The decision to release Viktor Anichebe and Stefan Sesegnon in retrospect also looks strange.
Pulis is notorious throughout his career for his slow promotion of young players to the top and appearances of three teens - Jonathan Leko, Sam Field and Tyler Roberts in the last game of the previous season with a 1-1 draw with Liverpool, will hardly become the norm.
He will return to the tried and tested, however, it is worth keeping Leko in sight.
If you’re looking for a new job, you’ve come to the right place.
Matt Phillips, with a 5.5 million contract with Queens Park Rangers, will be quick, but he is the only young player to participate in the first race over the weekend.
It would not have been bold if the end could have been rather rushed.
"Everything," Pulis told Express and Star last month about what should be improved.
Every position you see.
We need to strengthen the back players, the midfield players and the front players.
The goals are, we know what we want.
It turns out to be much more difficult to get them than expected, mainly because of the uncertainty about the takeover process.
The season could be determined by how they have started, with seven largely winable matches before the difficult race with Tottenham, Liverpool, Manchester City and Leicester from mid-October.
At that time, the pressure on the Pulis will have become less or unbearable.
And who knows, maybe even Berahino will have found a new club.
Tata Steel UK closer to bailout deal after trustees back changes to pensions
Pension trustees behind Tata Steel UK said the scheme could be restructured without entering into a pension protection fund (PPF), increasing the company's chances of a bailout deal.
The British steel sector pension scheme has a liability of GBP 15 billion and is estimated to have a deficit of at least GBP 700 million, creating serious obstacles to the conclusion of a rescue deal between Tata Steel UK and Port Talbot Steelworks in Wales.
Tata Steel is increasingly convinced of securing the future of its UK business, which employs 11,000 people, after talks with the Minister of Economy and the Pensions Regulator.
The company plans to combine its European activities, including the UK business with ThyssenKrupp, a German conglomerate.
However, closing the deal depends on the British steel pension scheme being restructured and the government providing financial support.
Alan Johnson, the pension trustee chairman, said that this scheme could avoid the PPF if the benefits received by employees were modified.
Although this is well-funded compared to other schemes, with a deficit narrowed to GBP 300 million for individual measures, Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp want to control their commitments.
Johnston said that the trustees said it was "not realistic" for the joint venture or any buyer of Tata Steel Uk to take responsibility for financing the current and future deficits.
Modifying the benefits of the scheme was a much more binding option than joining the PPF, he added, where employees should accept less favourable conditions.
Tata Steel sources warn that it could still sell Port Talbot.
The company has consistently refused to guarantee the future of steelworks since negotiations on its UK business were launched in March, and has been put to use as a trump card in negotiations with the British government.
Cushik Chatterier, CEO of Tata Steel Europe, said that the Indian conglomerate wants to make its steel business more "sustainable".
Speaking in couloirs at Tata Steel's annual meeting in India, Chatterier said that negotiations on the restructuring of pension schemes were moving forward, however he insisted that the scheme was well funded.
"We are talking to a variety of stakeholders, including the British government and other stakeholders such as the Welsh government etc," said Chatterier, reports the Times of India.
There is an opinion that pensions have a certain impact on the business of goods such as steel, so we need to find a structural solution that does not hinder the business from moving forward.
The willingness of pension trustees to cooperate in negotiations on the restructuring of the scheme will be supported by Tata Steel.
Potential changes in the scheme include redirecting how the annual inflation-based benefit growth is measured from the retail price index to the lowest consumer price index, as well as limiting future pension payments to the statutory minimum.
Johnston added, "The trustee and its advisers have provided Tata Steel, the government and the pension regulator with evidence of the scheme's ability to pay the modified benefits indefinitely and with a low degree of risk outside the Pension Protection Fund.
Our investment strategy has meant that the funding position of the scheme has not been affected by the recent fall in the securities market in the same way as in other UK pension schemes. We remain confident of the scheme's ability to provide benefits at a self-sufficient level.
CBS commentator confuses Michael Phelps and Ryan Lochte throughout the race
It’s important to note that this is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur.
Elliott Friedman mixed the two throughout the 200 m individual swim, which Phelps won, winning his 22nd Olympic gold medal.
When Phelps crossed the line, Friedman held him to the top of the list of Lochte, Phelps' compatriots and long-standing rival world swimmers.
Friedman exclaimed, "At last he'll do it!"
Ryan Lochte will beat Michael Phelps in this race!
Phelps might not even get on the podium.
However, Phelps won, but Lohte finished fourth.
Immediately after Phelps got to the gold, there was silence in the CBS broadcast.
Friedman miraculously recognized his mistake right away.
I'm sorry, I mixed the tracks.
Phelps with gold," he said.
The Canadian commentator, whose professionalism on a large scale was appreciated by mistake, once again admitted his mistake within the next hours after the event and apologized to viewers on Twitter.
I'm sorry.
I was surprised.
"No excuses," he wrote.
In the meantime, Phelps surpassed the record of 2 168-year-olds as the winner of the largest ever number of Olympic wins.
The previous record belonged to Leonidas of Rhodes, who is said to have won more Olympic titles at the ancient Olympics than anyone else.
Russian hackers attacked the computer of the former commander of NATO forces.
The hackers have made public General Philipp Brylow's lists and data of the work of one of Soros' foundations.
The same hackers who some time ago may have carried out an attack on the emails of the US Democrat Party and made public its listings could also have been blamed for a new series of attacks, reports the agent "Bloomberg".
According to this information, these cyber attackers have attacked the correspondence of the former NATO European Force Commander General Philip Brawl and the Open Society Institute, which is part of the projects supported by the millionaire George Soros.
The attackers have published the information at DCLeaks.com.
This is the first time in my life that I’ve ever seen a movie like this.
Hackers are reported to have had access to the foundation's computers for about a year.
The news agency claims that it is the same hackers who carried out the attack on the computers of the US Democrat Party and who are led by the Russian Special Service.
U.S. intelligence officials warned Congress of a potential hacker attack on the Democrat party a year ago.
In addition to the above, you also have the right to object to the processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes (e.g. profiling based on profiling based on these provisions).
But congressmen have not been able to pass this information on to the victims of cyber attacks because it was secret.
The scandal over the attacks on Democrat Party computers began after about 20,000 emails written by party representatives during the United States presidential election campaign were published on the Internet.
The party's candidate, Hillary Clinton, stated that the leaking of these letters was organized by the Russian special services.
Russian President Dmitry Peskov stated that Russia has nothing to do with cyber-terrorists.

Parking in the happiest place on Earth will be even easier in the future.
Disneyland has come up with information about its long-planned parking structure, which consists of a transport hub and a new pedestrian bridge on the east side of the theme park.
Located east of the amusement park 5 Freeway nearby, the project includes a 6,800-seat parking structure and a transportation hub where buses, shuttle buses, taxis and other vehicles can skip visitors to the park.
A pedestrian bridge over the harbour boulevard connects the recreation park with the parking structure and transport hub.
The structure, along with the planned Star Wars land of 14 acres of expansion project, is part of a US$1 billion investment promised to the city of Anaheim in exchange for a 30-year exemption from the entertainment object tax.
The construction of the project, which synchronises with the East Gate, will be started next year.
The parking structure will be created above Disney's character Publa's parking lot, which has approximately 1,300 seats.
The transport hub will replace the commercial property acquired by the amusement park in 2014.
The project is scheduled to open in 2018.
"The east gate is part of our substantial investment in the city of Anaheim, which will provide extra space for parking visitors and help ease congestion near the recreation park, we are continuing to expand Disneyland's recreation park," Disney spokeswoman Susie Brown said.
The waterfront will be closed on Saturday and Sunday, it has to be reckoned with.
"This has been the case every year, and people already know that these days they have to expect a different traffic flow," says Deputy Head of the Municipality Andris Ameriks.
The cost of the Riga City Festival, in turn, will reach about 500 000 euros.
"Including port events, which are supported by advertising - both round-the-clock basketball and channel regattas and the big evening event - the cost is about half a million euros," says Ameriks.
This year, Riga celebrates its 815th anniversary, and cinema has been chosen as the main theme of the festival, as the first film screening took place in Riga 120 years ago.
It’s a good idea to have a plan in place for the next few weeks.
The film will be shown in the Riga Central Market, Grizinkalns and the cinema "Splendid Palace".

In Liepaja, two thirds of its residents will have to agree to the insulation of the house.
If the owners of apartments are very harsh and talk about the technical condition of the building, if there is such an opportunity to receive support and arrange the building in all possible ways, then it is rather easy not to use it.
One of the most significant changes is that EU co-financing from this year will be available for any apartment building, only the condition is that it is mandatory to heat the facade of the building.
Previously, it was only allowed to be used in serial apartment blocks.
This is the first time I've heard of this book.
A significant problem, where this process is currently lingering, is that 67% of apartment owners’ consent is required.
“The previous program required 51%,” says SIA “Liepaja House Manager” (LNA) project manager Toms Cīrulis.
"Of course, it is very difficult to ensure this because a large number of general meetings do not have such a number of apartment owners," says Gints Ločmelis, Project Manager of the company "Namu serviss APSE".
The largest building managers in Liepaja - "Namu serviss APSE" and the LNA, which serve around 900 buildings, are planning to renovate at least 50 apartment buildings in the new planning period by 2020.
This does not preclude the possibility that at the beginning of the work it will be difficult to convince people to vote for the renovation works, but with each completed project the attitude of the residents should improve.
I also needed a bank loan, and 76% of the people in the house needed it.
“Speaking, explaining what will be - I still got those signatures,” says Vita Iesalniece, the oldest building in Latvia.
This is the first time I've heard of this book.
Well, you can't have a party come up with that, and the other party plus one person then disagrees.
"No, of course it's important that everyone agrees with the whole event", says John.
This is the first time I've heard of this book.
They explain that with 51% of the votes in the banks it is not possible to attract the necessary financing, which has also been experienced in the last planning period.
In most commercial banks, two thirds of apartment owners’ certificates are required.
As one of the recommendations for house managers, Anda Lagzdiņa, Head of the European Union Funds Division at the Ministry of Economics, mentions an opportunity to introduce the residents to the existing examples and various benefits that would result from the renovation of the building, for example, energy savings.
As a young man, Aaron was longtime enraged at the world for the death of his mother.
The suspected suicide bomber's detention operation in Canada was worthy of a spy film.
It all started when Canadian police received a video footage intercepted by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Very early in the morning, the Royal Canadian Police has received reliable information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Among other things, it contained a so-called "torment" video recording recorded by an unknown man who was clearly in the stage of preparing the last attack.
"And he was going to do it with a homemade explosive device," said Canadian Deputy Police Chief Mike Cabana.
In the video recording, a black masked man in English and Arabic made threats to Canadians and vowed revenge for everything they have done to Muslims.
In about three hours, with the help of computer programs of facial and voice recognition, the Canadian police have managed to recognize the man.
It was a 24-year-old Aaron Driver.
He was already in the custody of the probation service for glorifying the ideas of terrorism and radical Islam on the Internet.
By judgment, the Driver was forbidden to do so in future and also to become involved in any radical organizations.
However, until then, authorities did not believe that the Driver could pose any physical danger to those around him.
When the police arrived at his home on the town of Stratroy in the province of Ontario, the young man had come out and sat in a taxi.
At that point, the guards of order attempted to arrest him, however, the Driver, sitting on the back seat, had triggered an explosive device.
In order to prevent the detonation of the second bomb, police officers shot the young man.
He is dead from his injuries.
The taxi driver didn't hurt.
Wayne Driver, the father of the Neutralized Terrorist, said in an interview with Canadian television that his son had turned to Islam during his teenage years.
This had originally helped him deal with drugs and alcohol.
However, Aaron was a troubled teenager who had been long-time furious at the world for the death of his mother, added his father.
Only when I saw that video on the news today did I realize how far he had gone.
I had no idea he was so radicalized.
"And I also didn't know he could speak Arabic so well," Aaron's father said.
The Canadian police admit that if they had arrived a few hours later, the developments might have been much different.
This is the first time in my life that I’ve ever seen it.
In addition to the above, we may also collect information about you from other sources, such as social media platforms, social media platforms, and other third parties.
In the high jump, Laura took the kickoff with her right foot, not as usual with her left.
It’s also important to keep in mind that there’s no guarantee that you’ll be able to get the results you want.
It is not a bad result, considering the injury.
It’s a great way to get to know people in your new town.
Ineta learned about Laura’s trauma recently and expressed her support for the athlete, pointing out that the athlete did not start creating airbags for herself, but showed character and fighting spirit.
It’s also important to remember that you don’t have to spend a lot of money to get the results you want.
She recalled that she herself was called a tourist when she went to the first Olympics, where she won the 13th place, and this creates negative emotions.
Ineta sometimes remembers her starts, not just the Olympics.
It’s a great way to get to know people and make them feel special.
She told me that it was always important to have someone in the stands who would give you the energy to blend in.
This is the first time I’ve ever seen it, but it’s not the first time.
She indicates that she will definitely go to athletics competitions.
Ineta Radēviča won the title of European Champion in 2010.
In 2004, at the Olympic Games in Athens, she took the 13th place in the long jump and the 20th position in the triple jump, but at the Olympics in 2008, the athlete did not start because she was in the expectation of her son.
In London, as already mentioned, Radevica had 4th place in the long jump.
In the Murjāņi will show the film "Quantum Code" with physicist Kashcheyev in the lead role.
The film's annotation states that, in parallel with fissioning electrons in the laboratory, Kashcheev is a dreamer, teacher, socially active and civic-minded husband and father who is looking for a connection to the Almighty.
It’s also important to note that there’s no such thing as a “no-deal” scenario.
I learned about how cinema is made, how it is filmed, how sound is recorded.
"And actually a fantastic job", said the physicist.
He admitted that the film was made in two years.
The biggest controversy with the directors has been over the title of the film.
I am categorically opposed to this name.
There is no quantum code.
“There is no secret that you can learn from watching a film and it’s all clear,” said an associate professor at the University of Latvia.
It’s also important to note that this is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur.
They are organized by friends from the foundation "Easy", and these film screenings will take place every evening until September 9.
It’s not just a matter of how much money you’ll have.
After the people of Thailand voted to pass a military-backed Constitution, a series of bomb blasts took place on Thursday and Friday in five provinces of southern Thailand - popular tourist destinations - killing four and injuring many people.
The first two explosions swept off the seaside resort of Hua Hin on Thursday evening, the next one on Friday morning.
The city is located about 200 kilometers south of Bangkok.
Police said that one Thai woman was killed and 20 people were injured in the first explosion, 10 of them were foreigners.
Authorities confirmed that other explosions devastate the southern cities of Phuket, Tran and Surat Thani.
Two bombs exploded in the suburbs of Phuket in Patong and two more in Phanna province - a tourist region north of Phuket.
In the last 24 hours 11 bomb explosions have taken place in Thailand.
On Friday, Colonel Chrisana Patanacharoen, an official of the Royal Thai Police, stated that the blasts were not related to Islamic extremists and should be considered local acts of sabotage.
"It's too early to draw conclusions," he said.
"However, we know for sure that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, in fact they are local sabotage, and we are trying to find the perpetrators."
After a small power bomb explosion in Hua Hin on August 12, 2016, investigators collected evidence from the crime scene.
On 12 August, officials announced that four people had been killed in a series of bomb blasts in Thailand's important tourist areas. The competent authorities are trying to determine the motive and find the perpetrators.
There are no conflicts in the country that could cause terrorists to be present in the country.
"So we can say that these incidents are not terrorist attacks," he continued.
No group has yet taken responsibility for the attack, and no special group has been charged by the competent authorities, but the blasts occurred in the same week that Thai voters approved the new Constitution.
All three southern provinces - Hua Hin, Phuket and Phanna - rejected the military-backed referendum, and more than 6,500 people have died in the riots since 2004 in the southeastern provinces of Thailand, where the majority of the population is Muslim.
The explosions took place on the birthday of Queen Sirikit of Thailand, which is a public holiday in Thailand.

This is what we have long deserved, Porgy and Bess.
There are a lot of operas that have never been performed in Latvia.
There are things that are very rare.
However, it seems strange if, since the 1970s, George Gershwin's opus Porgy and Bess have not been staged or played, apart from the chrestomatic solo numbers such as Summertime's periodic wave on the stages (including as a title piece at the summer festival organized by Inese Galante), individual student projects, guest performances and the like.
There are reasons for this – since Latvia is a country of the civilized Western world, it is bound by the rules of the Goerswin family heirlooms and copyright licenses, which are in force for Porgia and Bess until 2030.
Harmonisation procedures are not straightforward.
In addition, while making the full production, the author has wanted all fourteen soloists to be black.
In Latvia, of course, the discussions and contexts existing around this opera in the USA are little known racially and the composer’s wish to perform would be difficult.
A compromise concert with the help of four artistic black American soloists and their Latvian brothers and sisters was performed at the 10th anniversary of the Cēsis Art Festival, reminding of Gershwin’s charming soundwriting, where European classical music traditions intertwine with American jazz rhythms, gospels, early 20th century fashion dances and memorable hits, telling the glamorous Ketfisrovs krēms.
First of all, because of the LNSO and the conductor Andris Poga.
Despite the complicated spatial arrangement of the concert performance in the open air in the Cēsis Castle Park, the orchestra was on the stage next to the stage, on which the soloists and the choir sang (and danced perfectly!) While, the overall sound was stylistically nuanced, rich in contrast and accurate in both string and metal wind instruments, as well as in the piano party (Mārtiņš Zilberts).
Second, because of the outstanding team of soloists.
The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 210 concerning detailed rules on the application of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article.
Porgius has sung the role countless times, also Krauna - he felt like a fish in the water in this opera and also inspired the stage partners even in concert performance to conjure up the emotional atmosphere of solidarity of the poor of the fishing village.
Letony Moore, in her second concert performance of Porgy and Bess (the first one took place in 2012 neither more nor less than with the Berlin Philharmonic and Sir Simon Retl), revealed herself as a vitally plastic combinationist of different vocal styles with a dramatically tinted timbre and fantastic piano on the top register.
It is not for nothing that she is one of the brightest Aidas of our time.
The charming Jamaican-born tenor Jermaine Smith, who was once seen by Andris Poga in a Boston production, is the image of the drug dealer Sportinlaif on four continents.
In it, he demonstrates his synchronic dancing and singing skills as a well-trained musical actor.
Smith is one of the rare nuggets whose voice seems to still hide undiscovered vocal possibilities like 15 years ago, when the voice of the opera accidentally found itself carving it to smile at peers.
It is incredible that even from the 24th row and the relative darkness, Jarmein Smith’s expressive language of gestures allows him to see the dust bag of happiness in his hands, even if it’s not there.
How can poor Bess not follow such a mephistophelic tempter who, empty-handed, believes the illusion of a wonderful life in New York?
The role of the Raven was played by the timbre generously endowed Rodney Clark.
The biggest vocal surprise for the Latvian soloists in the Cēsis production was Sonora Vaice’s lavish upper register, skilful balancing between spoken and sung texts, appropriately changing the voice position, vocal acrobatics and dramatism-filled performance in both Sirina’s lamentation My Man is Gone Now and the stylized pre-singer’s amplitude in prayer Oh, Doctor Jesus.
In the early days of the iconic Summertime, the voice of Margarita Wilson sounded a bit loud and nervous, getting her real character in the reprise.
The Parties entrusted to Mikhail Čuļpaev, Rihards Mačanovskis, Andris Lapiņš (especially the Crab seller placed on the castle walls in response to Irma's Chef's resounding Strawberry seller in the soprano circuit).
Bright characters in the works of Ilona Bagele, Rihards Millers, Emīls Kivlenieks, as well as in the spoken roles where the investigator Ivo Martinsons and Juris Žagars, director and actor of Cēsis Festival, unexpectedly presented to the audience in the image of the white lawyer Archdale, stood out.
In the concert performance spatial concept created by Viesturs Kairišs, the choir acted on the steps, soloists - mainly in proscenium, rarely entering or leaving the stairs.
In the dynamic activity, a bit of a comical situation was done by sheet music folders in the hands of Latvian soloists.
The presence of them, however, has a rather prosaic explanation.
First, some soloists sang several episodic catchphrases (which sometimes made it difficult to trace their stage identity).
Secondly, there is a lot of dialogue in Porgia and Bess, phrases in the conversation, replicas that are more easily traced with notes in front.
It’s been a while since we’ve talked.
The weather did not pamper and the first part of the concert performance rained long enough.
However, this did not stop most listeners from staying until the end to cheer up the artists.
In the nine-hour evening, however, it is rather late for a full-length opera, especially if a longer home trip from Cēsis is expected, however, the opera Porgy and Bess are worthy of a return to the Latvian musical scene and are likely to become one of the brightest musical adventures of this summer.

It was found out that the man, born in 1962, had previously frightened children not to make noise.
But this time, to intimidate the children, the aggressive man used an axe to hit the children's farm equipment.
The man was arrested.
In connection with the incident, criminal proceedings have been initiated for grossly disturbing public order, which manifests itself in obvious contempt for society or impudence, ignoring the generally accepted norms of behavior and disturbing the peace of people.
In the case of such crime the applicable punishment is deprivation of liberty for a period of up to two years or temporary deprivation of liberty, or community service, or a fine and with probationary supervision for a period of up to three years.

"The rest of the presidents of the federations come as guests, and they have their credentials changeable - they come for a couple of days and then use it by someone else", Vilciņa said, explaining that the presidents of these federations also do not live in the Olympic village.
Pone arrived in Rio de Janeiro in late July and will leave Brazil on August 13, so he is likely to be there for the longest period of presidents of all national federations.

What is the difference between a good and a bad credit score?
The world-famous Russian fashion historian, interior decorator, set designer, author of books, lecturer and collector Alexandre Vassiliev visits Latvia very often in recent years.
More recently, in the finals of "Miss and Mister Latvia 2016", he judged the contestants and admitted that Latvian beauties, unlike Russian women, can boast of natural breasts and lips that are not enhanced by silicone and botulinum injections.
In a conversation with "Evening News", Alexandre Vassiliev told that for many years he has been the president of the jury in the popular "Miss Russia" beauty contest.
That is why he was also involved with the evaluation of the participants of "Mis and Mister Latvia 2016".
When asked how the standards of Latvia’s beauty contest differ from similar competitions in Russia, Vasilyev emphasized that Latvians and Russians have completely different figures: “Russia’s beauty contest participants have bigger breasts, unlike Latvian contestants.”
However, Latvian girls are beautifully dressed and dressed, as well as they can be proud of their natural beauty and not the wonderful works of plastic surgery.
Therefore, I especially congratulate the participants of the Latvian beauty contest for their natural beauty.
In connection with his professional activities in Latvia, Vasiljevs has big plans.
Currently, the fashion historian's collection exhibition "Tamed Nature" is on view at the Museum of Decorative Arts and Design.
In Ventspils, the Livonian Order Palace, Vasiljevs' exhibition "Wedding Costumes 1860-2010" is on view.
Vasiļjevs loved Ventspils so much that for a couple of days he also enjoyed the hospitality of the city and went for a walk along the sea.
I like Latvia very much.
Especially now, when there is a threat of terrorism throughout Europe, there is a real corner of paradise.
“To spend time and rest in Latvia is pure pleasure,” admitted the fashion guru.
In addition, on November 23 Aleksandrs Vasiļjevs will open a private fashion museum in Old Riga.
Ask for help!
Please donate for the treatment of our son, brother, grandson.
We, Rinald's family, are grateful to fantastic people around us and to God for the opportunity to save Rinalds, but unfortunately, at the moment there is no opportunity to fully cover the cost of medicine on our own.
Rinalds Grinbergs is an 11-year-old who was diagnosed with a brain tumour at the end of July.
This year he graduated from the 4th grade Milzkalne primary school with excellence, a strong athlete and a very talented artist.
I think he gave up everything.
A healthy, cheerful, persistent, diligent and active boy.
Always smiling and kind.
July 26 will be remembered for a lifetime.
The last couple of weeks were plagued with nausea, headaches, but doctors put it on the stomach virus.
At first, it seemed so.
For who could have imagined that such "innocent" symptoms were to blame for something far more serious than the mind can comprehend.
On July 26th, Rinalds has a brain tumor.
The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 210 concerning detailed rules on the application of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article.
It is also impossible to determine whether the tumor is benign or malignant.
The next state-funded plan: to start beaming and watch what happens.
It seemed like such an evil nightmare - we'll be expermenting here, look at the results.
“I’m not going to tell you how much I miss you.”
He is the Vice President of the World Association of Neurosurgery, one of the leading neurosurgeons in the world.
He took up the operation, and it turned out that he had to be operated on immediately.
The tumor exerts a huge pressure on the brain, and the risk of complications is too great.
As well, it is urgent to understand whether the tumor is benign or malignant, to develop a plan for further treatment.
Without thinking for a moment, the parents chose to go to Spain to save their son.
It’s a great way to get a sense of what’s going on in your home.
A very complicated operation, more than 6 hours long, was performed.
The operation took place at the "Santa Elena" clinic.
It was possible to remove most of the tumour, reduce the pressure, take samples for analysis.
This is the first time I’ve ever seen it, and it’s been a long time since I’ve been to the dentist.
Now we have to wait for the results of the oncological analysis.
Thanks to Dr. Araez and the management of the clinic, who understood the situation and operated urgently, without receiving full payment for the treatment before the operation.
They trusted that the remaining amount would be paid, only asked for a €10,000 down payment to operate and save Rinalds' life.
In addition to the above, we may also collect information about you from other sources, such as social networking sites, such as social networking sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, or other social networking sites.
But at least another €24,000 is needed to pay for the first stage of treatment in Spain and to return the money we have borrowed for the first instalment.
Please help us pay back this surgery so important for Rinalds' health.
Every euro is important to help cover the costs of an operation already performed and to be able to continue Rinalds' treatment successfully.
The signs of unrest in Ukraine prompt the question: What does Vladimir Putin think?
The truth of these claims has been established.
Ukraine denies them, while the US and the European Union claim that Russia has not provided any evidence.
An open analysis group, the Digital Forensic Research Lab, has identified some signs of Saturday's shooting, but quite a few to be able to thwart Moscow's big plans.
Russia is known for distorting events or misinterpreting events for political purposes, especially in the context of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.
This does not mean, however, that all Russian claims are unfounded.
The members of the Ukrainian resistance last year damaged the electricity pylons that supplied power to the Crimea, and some of them are also involved in criminal activities and human rights violations.
The attempted attack in Crimea is still a matter of concern, although there is little reason to suspect that the Ukrainian government would sponsor a scenario of such events.
Whatever has happened, the images found by open source analysts show that Russia has been increasing its military presence since at least last Saturday - before the expected attack occurred.
They show heavy weapon convoys moving through the peninsula, including shore defence missile systems.
Disruptively familiar Russian escalation
Separately, reports indicate that Russian forces in Crimea had already planned a rotation around this time, which could help explain the activity, although it would be a very big coincidence that it simply happened in one of the most tense times since the annexation in 2014.
Whatever has become known over the weekend, Mr Putin has undoubtedly turned even more to Ukraine in his statements, choosing to use this episode, however real, for whatever greater purpose.
Analysts point to worrying parallels with the way Russia dealt with Ukraine just before previous military actions.
In February 2014, with similar speeches and military manoeuvres, a cover was provided for Crimean volunteer members of the resistance forces to take up the peninsula, still controlled by Ukraine at the time, only to discover that, in fact, they were Russian special units that started the military occupation.
That August, when Russian-backed separatists failed in Eastern Ukraine, Putin deployed forces along the border, warning that they might be needed for the "protection" of those ethnic Russian civilians in Ukraine that he said were being attacked.
He arranged for a convoy of aid to the region, which, according to NATO, was only a cover for Russian invasion forces.
What does Mr. Putin plan to do in Crimea?
Some have speculated whether Moscow alone is planning another military intervention.
The fighting in Eastern Ukraine has escalated, as it did before the invasion in August 2014.
But this apparent parallel could be the point at which the fear of military action is supposed to be introduced, and not of actual action, which will give Putin a trump card, both in his relations with Ukraine and with the Western countries.
Mark Galeoti, a professor at the University of Nuyorka who studies Russia, pointed out that Crimea would have little importance as a point from which to start military actions against Eastern Ukraine, which borders on the land part of Russia, rather than Crimea, and that the rest of the country is better protected.
"There is quite a small chance if the Russians are really planning some large-scale offensive," Mr Galeoti said.
Rather, "we can observe a classic Russian strategy of creating a squeeze."
International peace talks on Ukraine, once a mechanism with which Putin imposed contacts with Western leaders who ignored him because of the annexation of Crimea, are increasingly seen as unsuccessful and irrelevant.
By promising that there is a danger that the conflict may erupt again, Putin gives the conversation a new meaning: to get him off the edge of the abyss.
"It's a standard Putin tactic - he wants to try and start from a position of strength," Galeoti said of the next peace talks scheduled for early September.
"And the only strength is to say, 'If I wanted to, I could make everything much, much worse.'"
Reach an agreement with the West
Putin also said this week that during the Crimean tensions it was of little importance to continue negotiations, forcing other parties to convince him to return to the negotiating table and get to the centre of the process.
What does it actually give him?
First, it allows Russia to further establish itself as a world power, even though its economy is smaller than that of Australia.
Secondly, it positions Moscow as the one who holds the right of veto over Ukraine's sovereignty, keeping the country under Russian control to some extent.
This may also benefit Putin's long-held hopes of a large-scale agreement with the United States that would resolve their disputes on the Ukraine-Syria issue, with Moscow favourable terms, naturally - also ending Western sanctions against Russia.
Putin hints at this goal since the country's economic situation deteriorated in 2014, has made numerous statements, mainly due to the country's declining export value of oil and gas.
Since the invasion of Syria last autumn, he has repeatedly called on Western powers to join him in the great coalition to fight extremists.
However, Russian leaders may feel they would need to secure such an agreement before January, when President Obama's term expires.
Russian officials basically believe that Hillary Clinton, who is more hostile to Moscow, will be the next president.
Donald J. Trump, though noticeably friendly to Russia, is still considered unpredictable.
Obama, on the other hand, is seen as one who "seeks solutions rather than conflicts," Galeoti said.
So it makes sense to close the option window to get something done quickly.
Meanwhile, if a large-scale agreement cannot be reached, Putin seems satisfied with the preservation of Russia's weak neighbour, mentioning what will happen next.
An earlier version of this article incorrectly indicated the year when Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine.
This happened in 2014, not in 2013.
As Congress comes to an impasse, the White House diverts funds to fight the Zika virus
The Obama administration said on Thursday it will divert US$81 million from biomedical research and anti-poverty and health care programs to pay for developing a vaccine against the Zika virus, resorting to emergency measures because Congress did not approve new funding to fight the virus.
Sylvia Matthews Barwell , Health and Human Services Secretary, indicated in a letter to members of Congress that without the funds diverted, the National Institutes of Health and the Biomedical In-Depth Research and Development Authority will remain without money to fight mosquito-borne disease until the end of the month.
So we would have to stop developing the vaccine at an important moment, with Miami increasing the number of cases of Zika acquired in the country.
Last week, there were 7,350 cases of the Zika virus in the United States, mostly in Puerto Rico (according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).
Mrs. Barwell said that 15 infants were born with Zika-related birth defects.
The virus can cause abnormalities in brain development and other severe defects in the babies born to infected mothers.
The prevalence of the disease in the mainland part of the United States, when the first cases were recorded at the end of last month, has raised political rates on the federal government's response.
Hillary Clinton stopped in the Wainwood, Miami neighborhood on Tuesday as part of the campaign, which saw an outbreak of locally transferred Zika virus cases, and put pressure on Congress to return from that five-week break to approve emergency funding to fight the virus.
President Obama and Congressional Republicans have been in conflict over Zika virus issues for most of the year.
In February, Obama claimed $1.9 billion for emergency funding.
Republicans suspended this, demanding a more detailed account of who the money would be spent on.
Legislators have been arguing for months about how much money should be given and how it should be spent.
Last month, Democrats blocked consideration of the measure proposed by Republicans, which would allocate $1.1 billion to fight the Zika virus , but include conditions that would prohibit the allocation of funds to family planning for the provision of contraceptives in connection with the virus that may be transmitted sexually.
Because of this impasse, the White House was forced to allocate US$589 million in April to fight the Ebola virus, a fight against the Zika virus. About two-thirds of the funding is intended to be used inside the country.
On Thursday, Ms. Barwell said that her department had spent most of the money and that it would be spent in full by the end of August.
"The failure to make a decision on emergency funding to fight the Zika virus has led the administration to choose between postponing the work on developing the important vaccine and taking up other valuable state programs to temporarily avoid this postponement," wrote Barwell.
Democrats clung to this announcement to reproach Republicans for not giving extra money to fight the Zika virus.
At a news conference, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, a minority leader, called on Representative Paul D. Ryan, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, to remind Congress of the forwarding of this event.
"All options have been exhausted and we are now turning to the National Institute of Health," Ms. Pelosi said.
Mr. Ryan's advisers say that the diversion of funds is a step that should have been taken a long time ago and has been delayed by the Obama administration to extort maximum political benefit from the Zika virus problem.
Last week, the National Institutes of Health announced that they have started clinical trials of the vaccine against the Zika virus with 80 people, and are hoping to begin a second phase in the "Zika virus epidemic countries" in early 2017.
However, as officials said on Thursday, without immediate additional funding, the study will stall.
Barwell said she would direct US$34 million from the National Health Service to search for cures for other diseases, including cancer and diabetes.
A further 47 million will be transferred to the Biomedical In-Depth Research and Development Authority, which supports the development of drugs and vaccines in response to public health emergencies.
This money will come from several accounts, including US$19 million from a program that awards heating fuel oil subsidies to low-income families, and US$4 million from substance addiction programs such as opioid addiction.
Even then, as Barwell said, extra money will only be enough for the coming month, when agencies will have to "substantially narrow their operations" in the fight against the Zika virus if Congress fails to act.
Over the past four months, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has spent $60 million to help states protect pregnant women, $25 million to strengthen their preparedness for and plans to fight the Zika virus, and $16 million to help it set up data acquisition systems to quickly detect microcephaly and other symptoms associated with the Zika virus.
Thai leader links attacks on tourist attractions to constitutional changes
The head of the Thai junta on Friday called for the country's residents to be patient until investigators find out who is behind the string of the deadly bomb blasts that took place this week in Thailand.
General Prajut Chang-ocha, the leader of the junta and prime minister, said that the criminals had been "bad people" protesting the new Constitution, which was approved by voters in a referendum held on Sunday.
"There are still bad people, and they were already working before the referendum," he said in a speech to the people.
Bomb explosions in five provinces on Thursday and Friday, including Phuket and Hua Hin, among tourists in popular places, killed four and injured dozens.
Authorities say the arsonists' attacks elsewhere in the country are linked.
Analysts say that the target of the bomb blasts was not to kill many people, but to harm the tourism industry, one of the bright points of the Thai economy.
At least nine foreign tourists were injured in Juanhina.
"Whatever the motives, explosions and attacks by arsonists overturn the junta's claim that the post-referendum situation will be stable," said Sunay Fassuk, a senior researcher for Human Rights Watch.
These attacks have discredited the authorities, terrorise society and damage the tourism-based economy.
Photo Thai rescue workers take care of injured in a bomb blast in Hua Hin on Friday.
Police say that in their view these blasts are unrelated to international terrorism or the protracted Islamic riots in southern Thailand.
They see the attacks as "sabotage of a local character" rather than terrorism.
The timing and disposition of the attacks chosen has a strong political symbolism.
The explosions occurred on Friday, when people were prepared to celebrate the birthday of Queen Sirikit, which is considered Mother's Day in Thailand.
Four explosions ravaged the royal residence in the city of Hua Hin, about 125 miles from Bangkok, where most of the injured were also.
The Constitution prepared by the military will diminish the influence of political parties and give the military more power, even if the government is again under civilian control.
The junta helped secure its victory by preventing opponents from campaigning against it.
Murray Hibert, an expert on Southeast Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., has pointed to military suspicions that the attacks were carried out by people disgruntled by the vote.
The explosions were "precisely coordinated but obviously targeted at creating fear and excitement rather than massive damage and fatalities and injuries," he said.
Last year, an explosion at the popular shrine of Yerevan in Bangkok killed 20 people, mostly tourists from China.
Thai officials linked the blasts to Uighur militants who were dissatisfied with the return of more than 100 Uighurs to China.
General Preiyut, who has led the junta since 2014 when the civilian government was deftly suspended, said that this week's blasts "are hurting Thai hearts."
“Why is it now that the country is doing better, the economy is doing better, and the tourism industry is doing better?”
We have to ask why and who did it.
The Golden Reaction: What Simone Manuela's Historic Moment Looked Like
When I started the fight tonight, I sort of tried to take the weight of the black community off my shoulders, which is something I carry with me just by being in that position.
However, I hope it will all be gone.
I am more than happy to be able to serve others as inspiration and hopefully diversify this sport.
At the same time, however, I would like to have a day when we have more, and it's not Simone, a black swimmer, because the designation black swimmer makes it look like I don't have to be able to win a gold medal or that I shouldn't be able to beat records.
That's not the case, because I work as hard as everyone else, and I love sports and want to win like everyone else.
Fight for the defense of students - lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons (L.G.B.T.) in Colombia
Two years ago, 16-year-old Sergio Urrego slumped from a shopping mall in Bogota, before leaving a message about his suicide on a Facebook record quoting Pink Floyd's song "Goodbye Cruel World" ("Goodbye Evil World").
His death was the origin of the controversy that erupted in Colombia this week, where efforts to expand the rights of the L.G.B.T. were viewed in the wider political struggles that have divided the country into two camps.
After his death, Urrego's mother, Alba Reyes , filed a complaint with the court against school officials, blaming them for the exclusion of her only son when it was discovered that he and his classmate had had an intimate relationship.
A year later, the Supreme Court of Colombia handed her a favorable verdict calling on schools across the country to develop clearer policies to prevent discrimination.
The decision was part of a series of legal victories by the Colombian gay rights movement. Some time ago, the said movement celebrated the decision to legalize same-sex marriage.
This week, however, they faced an obstacle in their fight for equality, as Gina Perody, the Minister for Education, who is openly gay, got into a scandal over the application of this rule in a scandal.
The scandal began when sexually exposed content from a pornography magazine began circulating in social media, with people spreading the talk that it was part of a manual issued by the Ministry of Education.
Perodie deftly exposed it.
Although the ministry offered schools assistance on issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity with the idea of helping them pay attention to the rule, it has not attempted to impose standardized rules.
"What we want for schools are tools for resolving conflicts," Ms. Perdody said in an interview on Thursday.
Discussions began ahead of the national debate on the future of the country, where peace talks are being held between the government and the revolutionary Colombian Armed Forces, or FARC, a guerrilla group.
A coalition of politicians in opposition to the government and leaders of the Catholic Church have mobilized extremely quickly, accusing the government of the Presidency of Juan Manuel Santos of promoting same-sex union and gender change.
To make it even more difficult for everyone, a government delegation negotiating with the FARC in Havana recently reached an agreement on gender and equality for the L.G.B.T., which calls on the government to adopt a more inclusive policy.
Criticism of the government and peace talks laid on 42-year-old Perodia, the rising star of Colombian politics.
They featured paralytic posters at the rallies and some have also threatened to turn violence against her and her partner, Cecilia Alvarez-Correa Glen, former trade ministers.
Perody kept an admirable peace of mind for a week full of excitement, trying to correct the mistake and reopen the debate on constructive terms.
"Partially what makes me stand and keep my head clear is the realization that there are children who are yet to be revealed," she said.
This is a very tight field of work and a very lonely time.
She also pointed to the connection between the peace process and the debate on L.G.B.T. students.
While the Colombians continue to assess the benefits of the deal with the FARC, which would be a turning point for the country, they need to think about the origin of the conflict, she said.
"Is a peaceful country one that promotes inclusion or exclusion; is it one in which everyone has equal opportunities?" she asked.
Although it has not been pleasant for her to be the target of insults and reproaches this week, she is glad that in today's Colombia, gay students can take an example from her and think that they too can try to become ministers one day.
"It is very important to me that they are calm and aware that they can reach their full potential," said Mrs. Perodie.
We can't wait for a new suicide to begin to make a difference.
Keep the vote cyber-secure - The New York Times
"U.S. looking for ways to keep hackers off the ballot boxes" (news article, August 4)
Internal Security Minister Jeh Johnson says the Obama administration is thinking about additional security protection for the country's election system.
These changes may be necessary and should be considered immediately.
Cyber threats in various forms, and the recent discovery that external forces, perhaps national states, are increasingly interested in influencing our elections, demand that the federal government pay extra attention to providing our electoral system and perhaps consider it to be part of the infrastructure essential to our country.
Johnson should immediately contact thousands of state jurisdictions that assist with elections and offer the Department of Homeland Security assistance, advice, and leadership.
While our voting infrastructure's diverse and diverse nature is hampering efforts to achieve this, it tells us that the process must start as soon as possible.
Writer, a Democrat from Mississippi, is a high-ranking member of the national security committee.
It’s not just a matter of how much money you’ll have.
On Thursday, after falling from a carousel, a boy was injured and taken to a Pittsburgh hospital. The ambulance service and park officials say this week this is already the third accident in U.S. amusement parks that has suffered children.
The child, whose name is not revealed, was only taken to a children's hospital in Pittsburgh about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of the Aidvaleild and Soukzon amusement park in Laijonier, Pennsylvania, an ambulance service spokeswoman for Westmoreland County said.
The three-year-old boy, who was taking a ride with his brother while he was being given help on the spot, was conscious, Jeff Crushor, the park's spokesman, informed in an email.
It’s also important to remember that there’s no such thing as a “good” or “bad” credit score.
Children in the Aidailda must be at least 3 feet (91 cm) long to ride the carousel, and those who are shorter than 4 feet (122 cm) must be accompanied by an adult.
The attraction, according to information published on its website, was built in 1938, and the state's agriculture department indicated that it had been inspected in August.
A representative of the hospital refused to comment on the boy's health condition.
It’s a great way to get to know each other better and get to know each other better.
Three girls, aged 6, 10 and 16, who fell from a height of more than 30 feet (9 meters), were taken to the hospital on Monday overturning a cart of a panorama wheel during a fair in Greenville, Tennessee, local media reported.
Japanese Prime Minister Abe will not visit the shrine honoring the memory of those who died in the war on the anniversary of World War II: Jiji
News agency Jiji reports that Japanese Prime Minister Sindzo Abe will not visit the controversial Tokyo shrine on the anniversary of Japan's defeat in World War II, which honors the memory of those killed in the war.
On Thursday, Jiji reported that Abe was nevertheless planning to send Yasukuni to the shrine on Monday a ritual gift in honor of the anniversary.
The sanctuary also honours the memory of 14 Japanese warlords who have only been convicted as war criminals, and China and South Korea consider it to be a symbol of Japan's wartime militarism.
Abe has not visited the shrine since December 2013 when he stated that he visited it to pay tribute to those who died for his homeland.
The new Japanese defense minister, Tomomi Inada, has not answered the question of whether she will visit the shrine, explaining that this is a matter of conscience.
Inada - a close ally of Abe and a supporter of amendments to the pacifist constitution of Japan - has regularly visited Yasukuni in the past.
Kyodo news agency reports that Masahiro Imamura, the minister for reconstruction of the areas affected by the Japanese disaster, visited the shrine on Thursday and said he was praying for the peace and prosperity of Japan.
Relations between China and Japan, Asia's two largest economies, have become strained after the growing presence of the Chinese Coast Guard and other state ships near disputed islets in the South China Sea, which is called Senkaku in Japan, and Diaouge in China.
Two suspects arrested in Rio Olympics terror plots: police
It’s a good idea to check your credit report before you make any changes to your credit report.
Before Thursday's operation, police had already detained 12 persons, all suspected of collaborating with Islamic State militants.
Brazilian federal police report that three more individuals were interrogated and later released.
Both of those arrested on Thursday are Brazilian, but police do not reveal their names and other information.
Although there have been no conflicts with known militia groups in Brazil's history, the government reports that the Olympics have made the country a more pressing target, especially as the Games are attended by countries fighting against the Islamic State.
Its fighters control certain areas of Iraq and Syria, and the US-led coalition has carried out air attacks against them.
The group has supporters around the world who have carried out civilian gunfire and bombings.
This is the first time I've heard of this book.
As part of an investigation into the murder of a French priest last month, a man arrested on Monday has been formally charged, Reuters reported a source of information to police on Friday.
The 21-year-old suspect is under investigation for collaborating with terrorists, and he is said to have planned attacks on people, the source said.
The man is said to have contacted Adel Kermich and Abdea Malik Petitjan by telephone, who interrupted a church service in Saint-Etienne du Ruet, West France, on July 26, and cut his throat for the 85-year-old Roman Catholic pastor, Father Jacques Amel.
Both were shot by police.
The suspect had come from his home near Toulouse, to Saint-Etienne du Rue and spent the night there in the days before the attack, the source mentioned.
The young man, who had no criminal record before, admitted that he had spent the night there, however, told investigators that he had left the next day because he had not had good relations with Kermich and Petitjan, the source said.
Investigators are trying to find out whether Kermich and Petitjan had accomplices in France and whether they were affiliated with the Islamic State, which has taken responsibility for the attack.
Petitjan's cousin was placed under pre-trial detention at the end of last month.
Dorus de Vries passes medical examination before moving to Celtic
Nottingham Forest club goalkeeper Dorus de Vries has arrived in Glasgow as he hopes to conclude an agreement to move to Celtic.
De Vries was photographed entering Roshol Hospital before medical examination after Hoop agreed terms with the Sky Bet Champions Club.
Parkhead club manager Brendan Rogers is looking for an experienced center guard to make the current first number Craig Gordon have competition.
Roger, however, trusts 35-year-old de Vries, as he has worked together with the Dutchman at the Swansea club.
He played 51 games for Swansea which they won the right to move to the Premier League under Rogers in 2011.
He replaced the Welsh form that summer to join the Wolves, and has been at the City Ground since 2013.
He has also played for Scotland during his career after a season spent at Diunfermline, after moving back in 2006.
His stay at East End Park ended with an upset, however, with Pars experiencing a double agony, being "sent into exile" from the top level, before losing to Celtic in the Scottish Cup.
The goalkeeper still had a year left in Forest under the contract, and it was reported that Celtic would only have to pay a nominal fee to get his signature.
Macy's is closing 100 stores.
Supermarket giant Macy's has announced on Thursday its plans to close 100 stores, a dramatic move to help the chain get ahead of a potentially huge problem: In America, it claims, there are too many stores for the online shopping era.
Macy's regularly reduces its store portfolio, often closing several dozen under-profit stores immediately after the annual holiday fever.
However, with its summer announcement that it would close 15 percent of its 728 outlets, store chains appear to have taken a much more aggressive stance than many similar retail industry representatives in terms of reducing its number of stores by adapting to the highly changing shopping environment.
Pedestrians and buyers walk past Macy's store in New York City.
The retail giant announces that it plans to close 100 stores.
Macy's has many reasons to try to make a difference: many of its stores are located in small regional shopping malls, as the number of buyers has been particularly affected by the boom in e-commerce.
In general, more difficult times have come for the supermarket category, as buyers are increasingly choosing lower-priced retailers such as T.J.Maxx and fast fashion designers such as H&M.
These factors, along with short-term difficulties such as declining international tourist spending and seasonally ineligible weather conditions, have put Macy's in an unstable situation that has been stretching for over a year.
On Thursday, the company announced that its comparable sales had dropped 2.6 percent in the last quarter, a rather weak indicator, which, however, was an improvement, given the very bad 6.1 percent drop in the year-on-year rate observed in the previous quarter.
The retailer had revenue of $5.87 billion ($7.64 billion Canadian dollars), 3.9 percent less than the same period last year.
Macy's said that closing stores would cost it about $1 billion in annual turnover.
And the closure of such a large number of shops could at the same time be seen as a recognition of the retailer's defeat.
However, the value of the company's shares fell by 17 percent on Thursday, indicating that investors see the move as a proactive measure that heralds Macy's stronger future.
In a way, the fact that Macy's is cutting the number of stores shouldn't be a surprise.
Terry Lundgren, Director-General of Retailers, said earlier that there are simply too many stores in the chain.
Top executives said for some time that they had adopted a new strategy where a special emphasis is placed on 150 of its most profitable stores in an effort to bring more sales to the already profitable outlets.
Jeff Jennette, Macy's director who has been appointed to replace Lundgren as of 2017, said in a statement almost all the stores the company intends to close are those in which sales and profitability slide down.
"We are aware that these outlets do not yet have an adequate return on investment and often do not have the level of shoppers' shopping experience that reflects our efforts in relation to the Macy's brand," said Janet.
The company announced it would come up with a list of stores to close later.
Macy's said that it was still being decided on the shops to be closed and that therefore it is not yet known exactly how many employees will be laid off.
The retailer will not completely move away from the main markets where it currently has stores, but it will think about closing stores that are in less active locations.
This move is likely to be disliked by shopping mall managers who count on large tenants such as Macy's to attract and keep other smaller stores in their shopping malls.
Do you have dangerous bacteria in your bottle?
According to a new study, drinking from a refilled bottle can be "much worse than licking your dog's toy", given how much bacteria you will have to face.
The Treadmill Reviews website commissioned EmLab P&K to test 12 bottles of four different types of water - with a screw cap, with a snap cap, with a snap cap, and with a straw.
Every bottle of athlete had taken a week without washing.
Your refillable water bottle can be as dirty as a dog toy.
“Based on the 12 water bottles we tested, we found that reusable drinking water can contain an alarmingly large number of viable bacterial cells: over 300,000 colony-forming units per square centimeter (cfu/sq.cm),” says Treadmill Reviews.
The largest amount of microbes were found in bottles with push-off caps, more than 900,000 colony-forming units per square centimeter (cfu/sq.cm).
The bottles contained microbes that can cause skin infections, pneumonia, or blood poisoning.
Bottles with flip caps were next worst with 162,000 CFU/sq.cm., while containers with screw caps contained just under 160,000 CFU/sq.cm.
"Drinking water from such bottles can be worse than eating from your pet's bowl", the website says.
A significantly better picture can be seen for straw bottles where only a fraction of the other bacteria contained in the bottles were found - only 25 CFU/sq.cm.
This could be because the water drops down to the bottom of the straw rather than sticking to its edges and thus attracting moisture-loving microbes.
The microbes in the straw bottles are described as "largely harmless."
"Based on our test results, we recommend choosing a bottle with a straw, both due to the small number of bacteria and the absence of harmful microbes," said the website.
We also know that when it comes to bottles and bacteria, stainless steel is a better choice than plastic.
In addition, there will be fewer microbes in bottled water without cracks and difficult to clean areas.
On the website, readers are advised to wash the bottles after each use, ideally with a weak bleaching solution.
Religion must become fashionable or go into oblivion
In the United States, Hillary Clinton has recently been nominated as her presidential candidate by the Democrat Party.
If the results of the latest polls also prove true in the election itself, America will inaugurate its first president, a woman, in January.
Last week, across the ocean, British Prime Minister Theresa May discussed Britain's withdrawal from Europe with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Women brought up in Western society are brought up in such a way as to realize that through education, ambition, and hard work, they can be competent and successful in any field of professional activity.
And nowadays, young girls can target a number of existing role models by acting in the top leadership field.
So, is the long and hard fight for women's equality finally over?
Hillary Clinton is ready to become President of the United States at any moment, yet in the field of religion, women's leadership is still a contentious issue.
Okay, not completely.
In the religious field, women's leadership is still a controversial issue.
Last week, Pope Francis announced the creation of a new commission to assess whether women should be consecrated in deacons in the Catholic Church.
The Anglican Church consecrated Libya Lane as the first woman-bishop in January 2015, but it was only after a failed attempt in 2012.
While in the Reform Judaism movement women have been ordained in the rabbinical order since the early 1970s and in the conservative movement since the early 1980s, in Orthodox Judaism the concept of female rabbi still has a very fierce resistance.
In November 2015, the American Council of Orthodox Rabbis, in its third attempt to stem the growing wave of support for the rabbinic appointment of Orthodox women, published a rather harsh message that the concept of a female rabbi was contrary to the law.
Not without irony, when Hillary Clinton was nominated as Democrat presidential nominee, a group of America's leading Orthodox rabbis, who oppose the ordination of women, launched a series of "discussions" on this controversial issue.
Why is there such a difference between secular and sacred?
Orthodox Judaism, like most other religions, seeks stability in what it considers to be enduring traditional values.
It manifests itself in the ability to resist pressure to adapt to a changing society.
Those who are against ordination of women do so on the grounds that it is not "traditional."
However, being overtaken by the preservation of traditions in this way has its price.
And the price of such one-sided thinking can paradoxically undermine the tradition in itself by depriving the traditional community of the oxygen it needs to sustain life.
In the book "The Firearms of August", in the military history of World War I, Barbara Tachman emphasizes the danger of prioritising tradition in what has come to be known as "the tragedy of red trousers."
By the start of World War I, when warring shifted from warring at close distances to heavier artillery being fired from further distance, it became advantageous to hide soldiers for as long as possible.
The British and German armies responded to these changes by changing their bright uniforms to boring greys and browns.
French soldiers, however, still wore the same red hats and pants, which made them easy targets.
The proposal by the French Minister of War Adolphe Mesimeu that the armies under his command might act in a similar manner was met with ridicule and resistance.
The red pants reflected the pride and prestige of the army, and the military traditionalists were not prepared to give it up.
Speaking in parliament, former Minister of War Affairs Eugene Etienne spoke on behalf of France.
"Can you give up the red pants?" he exclaimed.
Never!
"That inexpressive and idiotic appendix to the most obvious of all colors," Messimy later wrote, "there had to be evil consequences."
Faith leaders who fight for the inclusion of women in leading religious roles could fall into the same trap.
Focusing solely on the "traditional" in religion rather than asking the important question, "What changes are needed for religion to flourish?" they risk losing about 50 percent of their followers.
They also deprive the whole community of the talent, skills and enthusiasm that women would otherwise bring.
To insist that men continue to wear trousers when it comes to religion may be traditional, but as the destruction of red trousers shows, it may not be worth it.

The children of Roja county learned new skills in the camp.
From August 1 to 6 at the Rojupe Children and Youth Initiative Center was held the camp "Rainbow Bridges", during which participants creatively manifested, sported, as well as learned new skills.
We arrived at the camp on the final day, when the children painted glass jars with great passion.
It’s a great way to get to know people in your new town.
It’s also a great pleasure to visit Einārs Kalniņš carpentry “Mazbebriņi”.
The most children liked a laser engraver, because it was possible to see how the drawing, which is in the computer, is gradually applied to the board.
E. Kalniņš told what subjects to learn in school if he wanted to work in carpentry, namely, the main thing is mathematics, especially geometry, computer science, as well as technical drawing and drawing.
He also emphasized that this profession should work more with the brain than with muscles.
There are individual orders in a small workshop, and it is important to plan everything first.
In order to get to know each other better at the beginning of the camp, participants participated in various games, as well as jointly formed the camp "the coat of arms".
On Wednesday there was a hike along the sea from Roja to Jocene, along the way were collected natural materials, which later were used for making cards.
Sports games were also played, which is especially important for participants.
We went to the apartment buildings, where we have a sports and recreation area, played football and netball.
Children love sports, we have a lot of boys playing football, basketball, and every time they demand something athletic.
Girls like quieter activities.
On another day we decorated the jars with the help of a self-hardening mass, which can later be used as pencil holders.
There was also a talent evening, the children chose who they would perform with, and one evening was dedicated to the performances.
In addition to the above, we may also share your personal data with third parties for the following purposes:
The task was to make each picture different.
We also paint mandalas - some like it more, some less.
It’s a great way to get to know each other better.
It’s a great way to get to know people.
In the end of the camp, diplomas were issued for creativity, sportiness, as well as helpfulness - several children helped in economic work.
The name of the camp "Rainbow Bridges" was created due to the participation of children from three associations - Rojupe and Melnsils Children and Youth Initiative Centre, as well as Roja County Multifunctional Centre "Strops".
These are unifying bridges.
If they come up with something faster, we borrow ideas; if vice versa, they borrow from us.
We share experiences.
This year, the camp involved 30 participants - children who were active during the year.
It’s a great way to get to know each other better.
The camp was held for the fifth year.
It started in 2010, when Roja County Social Service decided that large families and children of poor families needed to organize camps in summer.
In the meantime, however, the situation in Roja has improved, and currently the camp is intended for residents of the region who come and work in youth centers.
The goal is to spend your free time meaningfully and comprehensively.
Two camps were held in the past, each with 20 children, but currently only one camp is organized due to the decrease in the number of children in the country.
Similar activities take place during the rest of the year.

It’s a great way to get to know each other better.
We make paintings from natural materials, interesting mandalas from beans, peas, linseeds, we collect leaves in autumn.
We try to use what we have around us.
Youth Centre works from 15.00 to 20.00 in winter, and from 14.00 to 20.00 in summer.

A fan of Charlton Athletic "can only get a season ticket if they sign a behavioral contract" and agree not to criticize the club on social media.
Although we admit that everyone has the right to their own personal opinion, publishing confusing comments on such websites is not good.
A fan working in the administration was then told that he would have to get a ticket in person from former police senior inspector Cliff Eger, who joined the club last month after a 35-year career in the police force.
As a follow-up to the letter, "I must inform you that the awarding of a season ticket will be renewed for you on the condition that you sign an 'ABC' which will state that you will henceforth refrain from posting derogatory or embarrassing comments about people representing the club on all kinds of social media websites, or any other form of behavior that might be considered antisocial."
Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, a fan described how he called the club after paying a season ticket, which was never received, and two days later a letter was received by mail.
Yesterday he went to a meeting at the club and said, "They told me I was said to have tweeted too much, making others tweet as well, which is ridiculous."
Cycling holidays on the shores of Dalmatia
What do you mean by luxury?
I'm driving here with all my might," said Colin, a former U.S. naval commando who has just traveled 25 miles along the central part of an uneven Croatian island, leaving nothing there except a bucket of sweat and grassy sailors' expression brushed away in the hostile mountains.
Some cyclists sing hymns or count nursery poems to make it easier to get up the hill.
Colin's girlfriend, Patty, suggests "The Little Engineer That Could."
Others number the rhymes or simply suffer in silence, wondering what it takes to end up in a trance-like state that hardened cyclists speak of.
Colin's ladles rather poisonous than diverse.
To drive a few yards ahead of her is as if chased by Hugh Grant as at the beginning of the film Four Weddings and One Funeral.
Her and my mission is a week-long "luxury" yachting and biking along the coast and islands of northern Croatia, organized by Freedom Treks.
Cycling in the summer heat through a steep hilly place like Croatia may not match everyone's understanding of luxury, yet it is said that Northern Dalmatian is easier to ride than Southern Dalmatian, our saddles are soft, and when we filled in the booking forms freely and confidently all those months ago, there was a box we didn't mark that could have provided us with the help of a battery-charged e-bike.
The luxury part of the deal is our floating house for a week, the brand new "Melody".
At the end of the ride, we can throw our bikes in a pile at our guides Ivan and Ivan and jump the hearing in the blue water at the stern of the ship without having to deal with sea urchins, sharp stones and other people on the narrow bars of stones that the Croatians call a beach.
In June, the water temperature in the sea is perfect, everyone agrees: cool enough to cool, but not cold.
On the "Melody" there are masks and breathing tubes and some kayaks, if anyone feels energetic after a hard morning on the saddle.
Instead, most of us are returning to our air-conditioned cabins, where Helen, the ship's masseuse - I'm not joking - will have already laid our beds, replenished our minibar supplies, and left a new box of chocolates on the table.
Ivan says that stretching out after cycling is very important, and we learn to stretch out on our beds in the afternoon or with pillow-covered armchairs on the upper deck with bartender Antonio, who is always ready to make some of his cocktails.
"Melody", 42 m long with 15 cabins and half a dozen crew, is not a famous superyacht, but a stylish small cruise ship.
It turns to a small island port between fishing boats and flotilla holiday yachts, and we are proud to belong to it.
Colin and Patty belong to a group of meetup.com friends from Washington, D.C. (in Columbia County): with sports and community activists after 45, as they call themselves.
Last year's barge and bike holidays in the Netherlands were so successful that they decided to try something even more adventurous, and so they are in Croatia.
The competing chapel from their church is on boating and cycle holidays in Provence, and every afternoon air is thickened by a ping-pong rally of competing Facebook publications.
The element of holiday adventures can be exaggerated, because our schedule is nothing if no specific regime is established.
"Breakfast and dinner are at eight," Ivan announced to the new participants at the opening meeting when we started our way from the beautiful old Trogir port, located near Split.
One of the ship’s bells indicates that the buffet is open, while the other calls for silence and careful listening to further information at the end of the meal.
"Good morning!" is a cultural context that is probably lost everywhere, but not in the British contingent.
What's the difference - the fun has already gained momentum, the jokes are falling out of the horn of abundance, while Ivana gives out the day's sightseeing maps, but we all pretend to be frightened by swaying, contour blurring and profiles with highs and lows, although anything else would be a surprise on the Croatian cycle race, which starts and ends at sea level.
"It's like a heart monitor," says Ivan.
Completely flat is not recommended.
Ivan runs the informative meeting in parallel, freely switching from English to German.
There are weeks when he has to deal with a dozen different nationalities, yet we are a simple group - Swiss, German, American and British - who easily sit at tables during meals, where two speak English and one German.
We're all friends on the road.
This is the first time in my life that I’ve been able to do that.
I don't remember when the dynamics of the group would have been more harmonious and relaxed.
Soon we will be on the edge of Ivan's wave.
A small rise is a slope that should not be confused with a roughness, which is a good thing.
Matadatas are serpentines and straight forward means straight: simple, but not always easy.
Cycling instructions are always the same: "Come one by one, keep your distance, and it's not a race.
See you at the waterfront at nine.
Okay, five couples, I forgot you're on holiday.
Take a lot of water with you.
From Trogir we will go on a two-day cruise north through the Kornati Archipelago, where we will go almost all the way to Dugi Otok - the Croatian language "long island" - and after a little nap we will go for a walk through Telašcica Nature Park to admire its steep cliffs and salt lake, where sea water flows through the underground canal.
It is said that those who swim in it are getting younger because of its power.
If we stare at it, will our feet feel younger and stronger?
On the small island of Molat, we turn south again, jumping from continent to nearby islands seemingly by chance.
Most of our trips are on empty small roads along the country's outcrops with extensive sea views and diverse vegetation: olive groves, vineyards, sharp plant brigs, Mediterranean scents in the air and countless butterflies in flight.
As we move forward, there is always a breeze, but when Ivan tells us to stop, there is always a big shadow, and small puddles are like a prize for those who have come faster.
Sports and community activists ride a lot on weekends, and they know the norms of behavior, sending alerts on the line and leaving free spaces so motorcyclists can perform overtaking maneuvers much more safely.
"You're almost hit," one cyclist says to the other after the truck driver decided to do overtaking on a non-transparent curve and brake rapidly.
Fortunately the brakes worked.
Ivan divides us into three groups, each with a short section for driving on the main roads, with Ivan at the back to encourage and "give the pace", as Ivan says.
If you have to cross the main road, we all gather together, get off the bikes and safety after moving our bikes on the other side as we are instructed, not before.
"Do you think Ivan is aware that he is not talking to a group of children?" asks the Swiss cyclist when we are standing by the side of the road and waiting for a signal when we can cross it.
We can’t spend the whole afternoon resting.
A city visit in Zadar reveals a Roman forum and sea organ playing music that sounds like the groan of a imprisoned sea monster, through pipes embedded in stone in the promenade and open in the water.
Zadar's famous sunset falls perfectly between the main course and the pudding, and after dark we return to the sea organ and observe wave-operated lamp games in a glass sidewalk, which is actually a dance floor.
When "Melody" starts its way to the bustling Biograd resort early in the morning, the organ song is no more than a whisper.
On the fifth day we are completely free from cycling.
A trip up the Krka River estuary to see its waterfalls; then an afternoon sightseeing tour of Sibenika, where we see the Cathedral of Thought, a masterpiece of the Dalmatian Renaissance, as well as a twilight stroll through the peaceful island of Zlarin in search of its local treasure coral, makes this day interesting.
Lourdes prepares to welcome pilgrims into the shadow of attacks
People gather at the Shrine of Our Lady of Lourdes during the annual Catholic pilgrimage.
French security forces are on high alert as thousands of Catholics gather at the Lourdes shrine on an annual pilgrimage in the shadow of several terrorist attacks.
Every year on August 15, tens of thousands of people gather at the sanctuary at the foot of the Pyrenees Mountains for the Ascension Festival to mark the welcome of the Virgin Mary into heaven.
This year's pilgrimage comes at a time when Catholics have been shocked by the killing of an elderly French priest on July 26 by two Islamic extremists who raided a church in northern France during Mass and slit his throat.
Jacques Amel's assassination came two weeks after a Tunisian -- investigators say he was radicalized by jihadist online footage,-- crashed into a truck in a Bastille Day-celebrator crowd in the Riviera city of Nice, killing 85 people.
After three large-scale attacks in 18 months, many French citizens are cautious about attending public events.
The number of tourists declined dramatically, and the authorities feared that this year's pilgrims could plummet.
However, the fear of massive withdrawals did not materialize -- and some organizers say there has even been an influx of visitors' applications at the last minute.
The arrival of about 25,000 believers is expected, including large groups from Italy and Belgium and a delegation of about 200 representatives of the Eastern branch of Christianity - Orthodox.
Many pilgrims have stated that they will not allow themselves to be intimidated.
"We don't intend to stop living," 66-year-old visitor Christian told AFP agency, describing prayer as the "only weapon" in the fight against violence.
"It's important to show that life goes on," said Mathieu Guinar - one of the coordinators.
We will not give up our faith, our beliefs, and our way of life just because some fanatics try to sow fear.
Due to concerns about safety in France, several large-scale events have been cancelled since the attack in Nice, including the huge flea market in the northern city of Lille and the European Road Cycling Championships due to take place in Nice in September.
"Last week I was living in fear that my phone would ring in one call to withdraw applications," said Fabien Ležesne, the priest in charge of the official pilgrimage process, last weekend.
"On the contrary - it seems that the attacks mobilized the believers," he said and announced an influx of last-minute applications.
The head of the local hotel workers' trade union, Christian Geel, confirmed an "elevated interest" in the pilgrimages following the attacks.
There were extremely strict security measures around the place where the virgin Mary appeared at the grotto to poor shepherd Bernadette Subirou in 1858.
About 250 police officers and two dozen soldiers have been deployed to protect the site, including bomb neutralization experts and experts with explosive search dogs.
As the pilgrims thronged through security barriers, bags were checked at the entrance, with the number of access points reduced from twelve to three.
Catherine Symcox, whose pilgrimage went from north-eastern England to Lourdes earlier this month, described the increased security measures.
"Until Thursday morning, there were armed guards in the shrines, and then through the gates (with metal barriers) only one by one, as well as bags were searched," she said in The Local.
"This whole thing frightened my three children who are used to Lourdes, and it was hard not to frighten them when they asked why this was happening," she said.
It has not spoiled my impressions, but I became sad about the fact that it was necessary, and I realized that many people were calmed by these measures.
The route of Friday's opening procession has also been shortened - instead of starting in the city of Lourdes and moving on to the sanctuary, it will begin and end in the sanctuary.
Other measures include closing airspace for flights over Lourdes, closing streets near a traffic shrine, and replacing waste bins with transparent plastic bags.
The French interior minister, Bernard Kazenev, will test the security measures on Saturday.
About six million people travel to Lourdes annually, making it one of the largest Catholic pilgrimage destinations in the world.
Many visitors bring relatives who are sick or disabled and who come to swim at a source in a cave where Bernadette is said to have seen Mary, believing in the healing properties of the water.
Thierry Castiyo, one of the organizers, described this year's gathering as "a little unusual" given the "threat, as the roots seem to lie in France."
However, he claimed that this would not affect the quality and depth of their experiences.
Francoise, a 58-year-old volunteer who helped sick pilgrims, admitted that, in her opinion, the presence of soldiers dressed in civil clothing was "a little depressing."
However, if it calms everyone down, that's good.
Two injured in Zaragoza mall shooting
Two people were seriously injured after a man opened fire at a shopping mall in Zaragoza in northeastern Spain.
The incident occurred at 11 a.m. on Friday morning at the people's full Aragonia shopping center in Zaragoza.
Initial reports suggest that the gunman may have shot a woman who may have been his former partner.
After the shooting, the armed criminal fled, and is currently being sought out by police.
Yesterday, 12 drunk drivers and four aggressive drivers were caught.

Opening of waterfowl hunting season is approaching.
Every year on the second Saturday of August, the hunting season of waterfowl is opened.
This year it will start at 16:00 on 13 August, therefore the State Police invites both hunters and residents to be especially careful and to observe safety rules.
Waterfowl hunting takes place not only in hunting areas, but also in public bodies of water, and although weather conditions do not promise heat like other years, it is permissible that these bodies of water will also be used by vacationers together with hunters.
We encourage both hunters and holidaymakers and those living near water bodies to be especially cautious in the vicinity of lakes and rivers and to observe safety rules, thus not endangering themselves or others.
As in previous years it has been observed that in the first days of the season the hunting of waterfowl involves a large number of hunters, also this year the State Police, in cooperation with the State Forest Service, will carry out enhanced hunting control.

Police recall that it is prohibited to use semi-automatic firearms for hunting waterfowl, the total capacity of which exceeds three cartridges, including to draw attention to the amendments to the Law on the Handling of Weapons and Special Means, especially the part of Article 22 (91) which states that persons who do not hold long firearms or other high-energy pneumatic weapons in their hands are not allowed to place them in a place of hunting or sports.

The New Caledonian coast is rocked by a 7.2-magnitude earthquake
It’s important to remember that the best way to do this is to be open and honest with yourself.
The epicenter of the earthquake was located at a depth of nine kilometers, 109 kilometers east of New Caledonia, at 1:26 GMT (at 4:26 PM, Latvian time), the US Geological Survey said.
The Pacific Tsunami Alert Center indicated that there are currently no warnings or recommendations regarding the potential threat of a tsunami to the region.
"Earthquakes in the region are not, as we know, unusual, and the activities in recent times are not unusual either," said Phil Cummins, senior seismologist at the Geoscience Australia Research Centre.
Potentially, it could be felt in Vanuatu or the New Caledonia Islands, yet I doubt that it is strong enough to do damage.
New Caledonia is located in the "Arctic of Fire" - a zone of Pacific tectonic activity, where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur frequently.
Colombia and Venezuela agree to open the border.
Colombia and Venezuela have agreed to open checkpoints on the border between the two countries, which were closed on Venezuela's initiative a year ago, said Colombian and Venezuelan presidents Juan Manuel Santos and Nicholas Maduro on Thursday.
Initially, the border posts will be open only to pedestrians.
Starting on Saturday, five border posts will be open every day from 8 a.m. to 20 p.m.
It’s important to note that this is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur.

Three Venezuelan soldiers were wounded in this attack.
In July of this year, Venezuela unilaterally opened the border twice due to the sharp economic crisis - Venezuelans in need tried to break through the border to buy essential goods in the border shops.
200,000 Venezuelan citizens took advantage of this opportunity.

Facebook announces fight against ad blockers.
Facebook, the world's most used social network, has sent out a kind of warning shot, suggesting that blocking advertising banners using special tools is unacceptable and users will also have to watch advertising.
The popularity of special ad blockers is growing, but this means that companies whose main source of income is advertising are decreasing.
Facebook has now made it clear that it understands the annoying nature of advertising banners, but users will still have to live with them.
It is true that they will be provided with tools to make their own choices about the type of material they are presented with, reports the BBC.
“As we give people more and more control, we will also start showing ads to those who use ad blocking software,” said Andrew Bosworth, Business Vice President of Facebook Ads.
In other words, users will be able to choose what type of ads they see by selecting brands and industries that they find interesting.
"People don't like to see ads that don't apply to them or interfere with the enjoyment of content", Bosworth added.
Ad blocking tools on mobile devices do not usually work, from which Facebook receives the largest number of visits, but their resulting decrease in banner exposures is similarly monetized in billions.
According to the BBC, about 200 million people use ad blockers.
In the last quarter of the previous business year, Facebook’s advertising revenue was $6.2 billion, or €5.55 billion.
This is not the first time that Facebook is actively involved in determining what network users see in their news feeds.
As one of the last steps, Facebook has just started to take action to remove or at least limit news feeds with "loud" headlines behind which "empty" news is actually hiding.

In Estonia, nine people have been tested for Zika virus antibodies, which means they may have come into contact with the infection, according to the Estonian public broadcaster ERR.
It’s a great way to get to know each other.
The first cases of Zika have been recorded in Finland and Sweden from countries near Estonia.
According to the data of the Estonian Health Administration, no acute cases of Zika virus infection have been recorded in the country and people do not have to take Zika virus test in case of flu-like symptoms, but they should contact their family doctor.
We have found IgG antibodies (immunoglobulin class G) that show that the person being tested is infected with Zika or similar virus at some point.
"This does not mean that the patient has contracted the Zika virus", Paul Naber, head of the infectious diseases department at the Synlab laboratory, explained.
Zika virus is transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus Aedes.
In Latvia, there is a problem with the development of high-quality car procurements, said Auto Association Vice President Ingus Rūtiņš in an interview with BNS.
It’s a great way to get to know each other.
Of course.
It’s also important to remember that you don’t have to be perfect to be perfect, but you can be perfect to be perfect.
In the end, the car must in any case pay a certain amount, as it must be purchased from the manufacturer.
However, the problem is and can be classified into two groups.
“I’m not going to tell you how many times I have to say that.
“Either very conscious procurement is being built to get something concrete, and that is where all sorts of miracles can be seen,” said the Vice President of Auto Association.
He pointed out that at the moment it is popular to talk about moving away from the lowest price offer to the most economically advantageous offer as the criterion for determining the winner of the procurement, but the majority of the society still has a misconception about these things.
Now it is very popular - let's go from the lowest price to the most economical offer!
However, the criteria must be established in both cases and, where they have been taken into account and assessed, the decision is still taken on the principle of the lowest price.
In qualitative procurement, the technical criteria should be very precise and market-conform.
It is not necessary to judge with points anything that can be expressed in monetary terms.
You don’t need to evaluate fuel consumption, emissions, service and similar things with points.

In turn, Pēteris Rubulis, Project Manager of the Auto Association, noted that the problems are related to the fact that often the same person makes purchases for cars, work gloves and food, and these purchases are derived from the same sample.
We have also received a sample of the procurement for spare parts, which was otherwise difficult to name as detailed absurd.
“The problem is that the contractor very often lacks any understanding of the subject matter of the procurement and the requirements are simply copied from somewhere,” said Rubulis.
It’s a great way to get to know each other better.
"It is obviously precisely because of a lack of human resources and competence", said the vice president of the associationus.

Die Antwoord accuses the Suicide Squad of stealing the style.
South African band Die Antwoord have accused the director of the film Suicide Sqaud ("The Suicide Unit") on Thursday of using the band's unique look without permission, calling the respected director a "tiny frightened bitch".
The band's lead singer, Yolandi, has turned to the director of Warner Bros. film studio on the Instagram app, stating, "That's right, David Ajer, you're stealing our style".
As she claims, the film stars Kara Delavinya and Jared Leto are said to have told that Ayer is said to be revelling in "Die Antwoord" on the filming ground.
"But you didn't ask permission to cheat us," the singer said.
A 31-year-old musician claims that her bandmate Ninja turned to Ayer with a text message on the matter, but he "did not answer anything, as such a petty frightened bitch".
Yolandi insists that Ayer borrowed scenes from the introductory shots of the short film Umshini Wam, made in 2011, which features a South African hip-hop duo.
She has also published a video that allegedly proves that Ayer borrowed the characters of Joker and Harley Quinn from the looks of the two singers.
Leto himself insists that the inspiration for Joker's image is based on the image of rock musician David Bowie.
In the end, Yolandi echoed the harsh critics' assessment of the film after its premiere.
Yolandi and Ninja, real names Henri du Tuata and Watkins Tudor Jones, gained fame with three rap studio recordings promoting African "Zef" counterculture.

The first broadcast will include musician Ralfs Eilands, Ghetto Games initiator, basketball player Raimonds Elbjakans, TV diva Jana Duļevska and basketball player Gunta Baško-Melbārde.
Without being able to answer the question accurately on their own, participants will also be able to choose additional options - during the minute break to call Anatolijs Kreipāns and get his advice, but by choosing a red card without losing points, unknown questions can be thrown as a challenge for the opposing team.

Turkey seeks missing diplomats after coup attempt
Turkey is looking for at least 32 diplomats who did not return with the withdrawn staff after an attempted coup on 15 July.
Foreign Minister Mevit Čavušugl said on Friday that 208 Turkish Ministry employees were recalled from jobs around the world for the duration of the coup attempt investigation to Ankara, and 32 have disappeared "without a permit".
About 18,000 civilians, military leaders, and academics have been arrested or recalled from their posts in Turkey, with the government considering them loyal to the U.S.-based official Fetullus Gulen, whom it accuses of developing a plan to overthrow the government.
Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania, is on the list of Turkey's most wanted people.
Kavosoglu said the US Justice Department team would visit Turkey later this month to discuss his possible extradition.
This issue has become a problem in US relations with Turkey, a member of NATO.
The U.S. opposed the strong arms tactics of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup, and Turkey responded by trying to establish closer ties with Russia.
Kavosoglu said that Turkish military attachés in Greece had fled to Italy, an attaché in Kuwait tried to escape to Saudi Arabia, but was sent back, and two generals from Afghanistan were caught in Dubai and sent to Turkey.
He further said that two officials in Bangladesh fled to New York, and one of Russia's went to Japan.
Ankara newspaper Daily Hurryiet, citing military sources, informed that the Turkish military attaché in Jordan was also missing.
The Wall Street Journal, citing a U.S. official who is aware of the situation, reported that a Turkish military officer based in NATO's command center in Virginia had requested asylum in the United States.
There are those who have managed to escape.
There have also been refugees among our diplomats," Kavosoglu told broadcaster NTV in an interview.
Since yesterday, for those who were originally withdrawn, the time has expired.
We will take legal action against those who did not return.
It’s not just a matter of how much money you’ll have.
Olympic divers, who were scheduled for training on Friday, arrived by a closed pool as the organizers needed more time to clear the water of a green hue before the first individual competition at the Rio Olympics.
Water suddenly changed color on Tuesday, in the midst of synchronized diving competitions.
The organizers claimed that the water for the race was safe even after the larger adjacent pool for water polo and synchronized swimming also colored light green.
Diving was not yet possible when athletes arrived for the morning warm-up, although finally the pool was opened at 13.00 local time - just 2 1/2 hours before the women's 3 metre race.
The color of the water looked closer to its usual color, yet still with a greenish tint.
American diver Abby Johnston, who competes on the trampoline, told that she came to the warm-up only to learn that the pool was closed without any warning.
She wrote on Twitter that "#FixTheSwamp (fix the swamp) should be fashionable.
British diver Tom Daley, who won bronze in synchronous platform diving, also commented on the state of the pool on Twitter.
Hopefully that means we haven't dived in the last few days like very bad!
Mario Andrada, the chief spokesman for the local organizing committee, stressed that the pool was safe for the race, giving the green light for the 3 metre preliminary race.
He agreed that some athletes were disturbed by the water, however, he said that it was the result of pool cleaning efforts.
"We repeat repeatedly what we have said all the time - water does not in any way threaten the health of athletes," he said.
On the first day of such a water situation, one or two athletes complained that they were itchy eyes.
It was the result that the first reaction when we saw how water turns green was to use one of the chemicals - chlorine - this is used very often in swimming pools.
We immediately reduced the quantity.
We checked the water again, and it completely met the parameters.
Simon Langford, chief spokesman for the Mary Lenka Watersports Centre, said that the pool was closed for additional cleaning work.
He said the decision was supported by the world's leading organization FINA (International Swimming Federation).
"The reason is that the water needs to be calm so that the pool can get to its blue color again as soon as possible," Langford said in his statement.
Andrada said that the deterioration of the pool's condition surprised the organizers unprepared.
"Chemistry is not an exact science," he said.
A few things, as you can see, lasted a long time.
Over the past few days, getting the color of rainwater to normal was made even more difficult.
"Things don't help," Andrada said.
He added that athletes had access to dry workouts in the morning, however, he admitted that it "wasn't perfect."
He explained that the color change of the pool was due to elevated levels of alkaline, much like aquarium water can turn green if not properly monitored.
When we started doing something about green, there was discussion about the best chemicals.
We can't use too many chemicals in the water because the athletes are training in it," Andrada said.
We could certainly have acted better at first to prevent the water from turning green.
When it turned green, we made a mistake again.
AP sports reviewers Jay Cohen and Steve Wade took part in the creation of this storyline in Rio de Janeiro.
Shanghai, Taipei, despite the suspension of cross-border communication, will nevertheless hold a forum
Shanghai and Taipei, however, will host the annual city forum from 22 to 23 August in Taipei, the Shanghai local government announced on Friday, despite the suspension of cross-border communication mechanisms.
If you’re not sure whether you’re a good candidate for Botox, here’s what you need to know to make sure you’re getting the best results.
Both cities have been holding the forum on a rotational basis since 2010.
The 2016 forum will focus on sharing experiences in areas such as healthcare, electronic administrative services, culture and transport, seeking to "deepen the exchange of experiences and cooperation in various aspects" between the two cities, as reported by the Shanghai government.
The Taiwanese side has not acknowledged the agreement reached in 1992, which strengthened the one-China principle since the new leader Tsai Ing-wen took office in May, which has resulted in the suspension of communication and consultation mechanisms.
Ma Xiaoguang, a spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Bureau's dry state council, said Friday that peaceful cross-border relations may exist while the Taiwanese side is sticking to the political foundations of the 1992 accord.
"We have an active and open attitude towards the exchange of experiences between the cities of both parties," the MA said, stressing that the nature of cross-border relations and the exchange of experiences between cities should be interpreted correctly.
Ugandan President Meets China's Foreign Minister, Hopes for Closer Cooperation
On Thursday, during a meeting with China's foreign minister Wang Yi, Ugandan President Yoveri Museveni thanked China for its long-standing Ugandan development support and expressed hope for closer cooperation.
Museveni said that China was an old friend of Uganda and Africa who supported the liberation of the African continent from colonialism and later supported the economic and social development of Africa.
The President mentioned the construction of the Tanzanian-Zambia Railway in the 1970s as evidence of China's generous support, which was given even when China itself was not particularly prosperous.
Museveni said that China has pursued multilateral cooperation with Uganda, both through investment in infrastructure and business and cultural exchanges, and added that this type of cooperation contributes to Uganda's long-term development more than simply financial assistance provided.
He hopes that China will be able to engage in various ways in the development of Uganda's infrastructure and the construction of industrial parks.
He also calls on the Chinese to invest more in Uganda and travel around it.
Wang Yi commended Uganda's performance in the areas of industrialization and agricultural modernization and added that China would continue to be the most trusted and ideal partner for Uganda.
Wang stated that China was willing to do whatever it could to help implement Uganda's economic and social development, and added that China-Uganda cooperation was genuine and free of any political considerations, as it was based on a high level of political credibility and time-tested friendship.
He said that China could strengthen cooperation with Uganda in the construction of infrastructure and industrial parks, as well as supporting the development of the energy and agricultural industries of this East African nation.
