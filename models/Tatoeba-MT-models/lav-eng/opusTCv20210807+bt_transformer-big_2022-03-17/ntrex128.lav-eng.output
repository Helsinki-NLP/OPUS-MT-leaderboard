Members of the Welsh Assembly (AM) are troubled by the possibility of "being perceived as a ticker"
Some members of the Assembly are concerned about the suggestion that their title be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The cause of this are plans to change the name of the assembly to "Welsh Parliament"(Welsh Parliament).
AM is worried across the political spectrum that this may make them an object of ridicule.
One of the Labour Party's AMs explained that their group was doing a concern "in rhyme with the words Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, "twp" means "one-handed", while "pwp" means "kaka".
Batch Plaid AM indicated that none of the group "was satisfied" and had recommended alternatives.
A spokesman for the Conservative Party of Wales admitted that their group was willing to consider changing the name, but added that "MWP" was very similar to "Muppet", meaning "comfort".
In this context, it should be noted that the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly in the English dialect "u" of Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a bill to change the name, informed, "The final decision on what terms will be used to designate the members of the Assembly must of course be made by the members of the Assembly themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which gained broad support for changing the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Speaking of the AM name, the commission preferred the "Welsh Parliament Member" (WMP), but the MWP received the most support in the public consultation.
In addition to the above, we may also collect information about you from other sources, such as social networking sites, such as social networking sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, or other social networking sites.
Other changes to the assembly's work, including laws on AM disqualifications and the structure of the committee system, will also be included in the bill on changes.
The AM's final vote on what they will have to call will be taken once they have discussed the laws and regulations.
It’s not just a matter of how much you drink, but how much you drink.
Voters will vote on Sunday whether their country's name will be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was organized to resolve decades of disagreement with neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour gives the impression of claims on its territory, and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's request to be admitted to the EU and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, one of the plebiscite on the name change opponents, stated that he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is simply a thing to be done in order to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's church bells shut as Harlem churches fight for existence.
"As the old people I've talked to have told me, there was a bar and a church on every corner before," says Mr. Adams.
"Now there is neither one nor the other."
He admits that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People are socializing in other ways these days," he said.
"Bars are no longer neighborhood living rooms that people visit regularly."
Speaking even to the churches, he worries that the money received by selling the properties will end sooner than the leaders hope, "and sooner or later they will have returned to their starting point".
Churches, he added, will probably be replaced by apartment buildings with apartment properties housing people who will not help the shrines remaining in the area.
"Most of the people who will buy apartment properties in these buildings will be white," he explained, "and thus the day will come closer when these churches will close permanently because it is unlikely that most of the people who will move into these apartment properties will become members of these congregations."
Both churches were built by the white congregation, even before Harlem became a black metropolis, by the Metropolitan community in 1870, and by St. Martin 10 years later.
The original white Methodist congregation abandoned the building in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by a black congregation who had worshipped God nearby.
The black congregation of St. Martin's Church took over his blessings during John Howard Johnson. He led a boycott of working retailers on 125th Street, in the main shopping street in Harlem, who had refused to hire blacks or give them a promotion.
The fire seriously damaged the building in 1939, but as members of Father Johnson's congregation planned to rebuild the building, they ordered a bell game.
His blessing, David Johnson, the son and successor of Father Johnson in the Congregation of St. Martin, proudly called the call game "for the bells of the poor".
The expert who played this call game in July used other words: "cultural treasure" and "an indispensable historical tool".
Expert Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan added that it was the first call game in the world played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger call game at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather told him that St. Martin's congregation did not replace him.
The events of the last few months around the church of St. Martin reflected a mingled relationship between architects and contractors, some of whom had been attracted to secular power in the work, and others to the Episcopal Diocese of the Church.
The congregation's council, made up of secular leaders, approached the diocese in July in writing with concern that the diocese would "try to pass the costs" on to the council, although the council had not been involved in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency in the functioning of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old teenager in lobster fishery
The shark attacked a 13-year-old boy in California on Saturday who was diving for lobsters and wounding him. It was the first day of the lobster season, the services say.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m., near Beacon's Beach in the town of Encinitas.
Chad Hammel informed KSWB-TV in San Diego that he and his friends had been diving for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard that the boy was crying for help, and then swung up to him with the group to help the boy pull out of the water.
Hammel explained that at first he had thought it was simply an exhilaration for the lobster caught, but then he "saw that the boy was shouting "My bite!
I was bitten!"
The whole bone of his key had been torn apart," told Hammel, who immediately noticed it when he got to the boy.
"I'm screaming for everyone to leave the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The boy was airlifted to the Reidy Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition was found critical.
The species of shark attacked is unknown.
Rescue captain Larry Giles informed the media in a briefing that a shark had been observed in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was recognized that it was not a species dangerous to humans.
Jails added that the upper part of the torso was traumatized to the victim.
Officials closed access to beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablad, to Swami's in the city of Encinitas for 48 hours for investigation time and safety.
Jails pointed out that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the zone, but most are not considered dangerous to humans.
Sainsbury's plans to penetrate the UK beauty industry market
Sainsbury's goes on attack on Boots, Superdrug, and Debenhams, with shelving lines of department store-style beauty products and trained salesmen.
As part of the significant investment in the UK’s 2.8 billion pound beauty market, which continues to grow, although sales of fashion and home items are decreasing, 11 stores in the country will be testing larger shelves of beauty products, and if everything goes well, there will be more of such stores next year.
In the beauty industry, funds are invested when supermarkets look for opportunities to use the shelves previously allocated to televisions, microwave ovens and home goods.
Sainsbury's informed that it would double its offer in the beauty industry for up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and, for the first time, Dr. PawPaw.
Existing lines from "L'Oreal", "Maybelline" and "Burt's Bees" will also receive more space with branded areas similar to those in "Boots" stores.
The supermarket also re-launches its own boutique line of make-up, where most products will be vegan – increasingly demanded by younger buyers.
In addition to this, Fragrance Shop, a perfume wholesaler, will test the concession at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened the previous week at Croydon in south London, and the second will open at Selly Oak in Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the shift to small grocery shopping every day in local shops mean that supermarkets need to invest more to persuade people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that outlets will become increasingly similar to department stores as the chain tries to fight discount stores at Aldi and Lidl, offering a larger range of services, but without food.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos outlets at several hundred stores and has opened several Habitats since it bought the two chains two years ago, which is said to have improved merchandise outlets and made the purchased more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to improve its beauty and pharmaceutical departments ended in defeat.
The Sainsbury's joint venture with the Boots was trialled in the early 2000s, but the union broke up after a dispute over how to distribute income from pharmacy goods stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy develops after Sainsbury's sold its 281 store-size pharmaceutical business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds 3 years ago.
Under this plan, the task of "Lloyds" will be to supplement the assortment with a wide range of exclusive skin care products, including "Roche-Posay"and "Vichy", in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director for Sainsbury's, said, "To improve the environment for shoppers, we redesigned the look of our shelves of beauty products and what impression they make.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will always be ready to make a recommendation.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all needs, but an attractive environment with a convenient location means that we are now a delightful target on the road to beauty, a target that challenges current shopping habits."
Peter Jones "outraged" after Holly Willoughby quits 11 million pounds deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones was "overwhelmed by the fury" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby gave up an 11 million pound deal with his lifestyle brand to focus all his attention on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time to devote to their brand of homewear and accessories "Truly".
The pair's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's "Goop" branding.
This Morning was used by the 37-year-old programmer on Instagram to announce that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby has left the Dragons Den star Peter Jones boiling in anger as they withdrew from their lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute – to focus all their attention on their new huge contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Information sources claim Jones was "ridden" when a TV gold girl during a tense meeting on Tuesday at his business empire residence in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, stated that her new contracts, valued at up to 1.5 million pounds, meant that she no longer had time to devote to their homewear and accessories brand "Truly".
The company was compared to Gwyneth Platrow's "Goop" brand, and, according to a hint, it will double the wealth of Willoughby, which is estimated to reach 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby (37) used Instagram to announce that she was leaving "Truly", Jones carried away from Britain to one of her holiday homes.
According to the source, ""Truly" was at the top of Holly's priorities.
It should have become her long-term future, which would be dedicated to the next decades.
Her decision to withdraw surprised everyone involved unprepared.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday: everything was so close to the start.
In the center of Marlowe is a warehouse full of ready-to-sell goods."
Experts believe that the departure of this morning's CEO, one of the most financially profitable stars, could cost the company millions, as a huge amount of money has been invested in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and goods for the home, and will be further delayed in placing them on the market.
And that can mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children, Willoughby, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have maintained a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for 10 years.
Willoughby's Truly and Kep formed in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman in March.
The two couples spend their holidays together, and Jones holds a 40% stake in Baldwin TV's production firm.
Willoughby must become the brand's M&S ambassador, and she will replace Ann McPartlin as the head of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones stated yesterday, "We don't want to comment on his business dealings!"
Serious conversation "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would receive from news companies about a comment that some may find "indecent to the president," and about his so positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why has the President given up so much?
Trump said in his featured "news announcer" voice.
"I gave up nothing!"
He pointed out that Kim had shown interest in meeting one more time after Trump recognized their initial meeting in June in Singapore as a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
But negotiations on denuclearization have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, one of North Korea's key diplomats, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a "response" from the United States to North Korea's initial steps towards disarmament.
Instead, he pointed out, the U.S. continues sanctions aimed at maintaining tensions.
Trump was much more optimistic in his rally speech.
"We have a great relationship with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results: stopping tests on missile tests, assisting in the release of prisoners, and returning the remaining American soldiers home.
And he defended his unusual approach when talking about relationships with Kim.
"It's easy to make the President's impression, but instead of 10,000 people standing out there trying to get into this closely populated area, we've got 200 here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroys island, killing hundreds of people
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-governmental organizations, for example, were told that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population was displaced, the state of national disaster was not declared, but it is necessary to initiate foreign aid.
"Unfortunately, on many occasions they made it very clear that they were not asking for international aid, so that is a certain problem" admitted Ms. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children collects a group to travel to Palau, it is still unclear whether foreign workers will be allowed to work there.
A spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, Mr Sutopo, explained that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid.
In view of the regular occurrence of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is still extremely unprepared for the fury of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been set up in Aceh (Aceh), such shelters are rare along other shores.
It is also likely that the death toll was affected by Palu's failure to sound the tsunami warning sirens, even though the warning was valid.
Even in the most favorable times, the movement between Indonesia's many islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The ship-hospital, which had anchored in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake, is now heading to Pala, but it will take at least three days to reach the victims of the new destruction.
President Joko Widodo had made improving Indonesia's ruined infrastructure the central point of his election campaign, and he has given large sums to roads and railways.
But a lack of funds has plagued Mr. Joko's administration and he is expected to be re-elected next year.
In addition, Mr. Joko has to contend with the protracted problem of tension between sects in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority has adopted one of the conservative forms of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands kicked out of their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other primitive weapons.
Watch: Liverpool player Daniel Sturgeon brings back balance with ambition in match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a loss against Chelsea in the premier league, scoring a goal in the 89th minute of Saturday's game at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Staridge received a pass from Gerdan Shaqiri, being about 25 metres (30 yards) from the Chelsea goal when his team lost by 1:0.
He moved the ball a little to the left of himself and then kicked the ball towards the farther goalpost.
In this attempt, the ball flew high across the field, reaching the top right corner of the net.
The ball eventually flew over the head of the jumped Kepa Arrizabalaga (Kepa Arrizabalaga) and fell into the net.
"I just tried to get that position to get off the ball and players like Shaka (Shaq) always play as far ahead as possible, so I just tried to get myself as much time as possible," Staridge explained to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Cante (Cante) approaching, touching the ball, and without much thought, kicking."
It’s important to note that this is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur.
The Blues striker passed the ball back to Mateo Kovačic before cutting off midfield and throwing himself into the Liverpool side of the field as fast as possible.
Kovačič rapidly passed and received the ball back into the middle of the field.
Then he did a beautiful kick between the players, allowing Azard to get into the zone.
Azard outscored the defense at speed and finished the combination, taking a hit on a further pole net with his left foot, past Liverpool's Alison Becker.
Liverpool in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday, at 3 p.m. Stadio San Paolo in Naples (Italy) will fight Napoli.
Chelsea and Videoton will meet in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Indonesian tsunami death toll reaches 832 people
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has reached 832 people, the national disaster agency said early on Sunday.
Many people were reported to be trapped in the rubble of buildings after the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that struck the country on Friday and caused waves up to 20 feet (-6.0 m) high, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, told a news conference.
Over 380,000 people lived in the Palu town, covered by the rubble of collapsed buildings.
It’s a great way to get to know people and make them feel special.
The murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old victim was found stabbed for wounds at 7:55 p.m., in Grayson Mews on John Street, and suspected of murder arrested a 32-year-old man.
Police have called on people in the area who have seen or heard something.
Detective inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation has just begun, but I would like to invite everyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead to contact us and see or hear something suspicious.
I also call on everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have fixed something on the footage of their cars, to contact us because they may have important information for our investigation."
A police spokeswoman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead, and she was found on her property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have come to the scene of the crime to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and, as police informed, they are engaged in informing the victim's immediate relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Muse tried to return to his apartment, but police responded to him that no one should enter or leave the building.
He couldn't say a word when he found out what had happened.
The population is informed that it will take hours before they are allowed to return.
It was heard as a police officer tells a man that the whole neighborhood is perceived as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears at the scene of the crime.
She goes on to say, "It's so awful!".
At two in the afternoon, there were two police vans inside the cordon, and another was parked right next to the outside.
Several police officers were stationed inside the cordon and controlled the apartment house.
Everyone who has any information is asked to use DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact "Crimestoppers anonymously" by phone 0800 555 111 calling 247.
Cromwell's statue in parliament becomes latest "history rewrite" scandal
Abandoning it would be ethically justified, given the Taliban-like activities that resulted in the destruction of so many monuments of English culture and religion by his fanatic Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "foolishness" and an "attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said, "Given the existing debate over the removal of the statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside Westminster Palace would also become a target.
Cromwell himself neither ordered nor carried out the destruction of icons during the English Civil Wars.
It is possible that the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed because of the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, who lived a century earlier.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent portrayal of Cromwell testifies to an opinion in the 19th century and is part of historiography of a person who is still worth honoring, as many believe.
Mr. Goldsmith informed the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was regarded by many, perhaps more than it was today, at the end of the 19th century, as a defender of parliament against outside pressure, which, in his case, was, of course, a monarchy.
There is ongoing historical discussion as to whether this is really a completely accurate depiction of the topic.
It is clear that the conflict in the mid-17th century determined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell as such is a recognisable personality representing one of the sides of the divide of the time.
His achievement of being a Lord Protector is worth praising and mentioning."
Pig-killer to death smashes peasant in China
According to local media, a pig in a market in southwest China attacked a farmer and killed him.
The man, only his surname, Yuan, was found dead with a torn artery, all in the same blood at a pig barn on the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, on Sunday reported the "South China Morning Post".
The pig farmer is about to inject the vaccines into a pig barn in Xining, Qinghai province, China, on 30 May 2005.
It is reported that he and his cousin had arrived from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found the man dead and discovered that the doors of the nearby pig house stood open.
He reported that a large male pig was in the pig house with blood on his mouth.
According to the information, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 550-pound (-249 kg) heavy hog had torn the farmer apart.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and mutilated," the cousin told the story – only his surname Wu is mentioned, writes the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market on Thursday at about 4.40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan did not belong to him or his cousin.
The market manager informed the Evening News that the hog was turned on to prevent it from attacking others while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
According to information, Yuan's family and market management are discussing compensation for his death.
Although such cases are rare, other attacks of pigs in humans are known.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and a man at their farm in Massachusetts, resulting in critical injuries to the man.
Another 10 years ago, a 650-pound (-295 kg) heavy pig in Wales held the farmer pressed onto the tractor until the animal was frightened by his wife.
After his pigs were eaten by farmers in Oregon in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba, CBC News, explained that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "gun shot".
"They're just playful.
They like to tweak, they're very inquisitive ... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to show them enough respect," he said.
The end of the hurricane Rose brings a large and powerful rain to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, the hurricane Rose will weaken as it moves across the coldest waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rose will bring flooding rains in the next few days in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
At five in the afternoon (North American Eastern time), Rose's wind gusts reached 143 km/h (85 miles per hour), corresponding to a Category 1 hurricane, and its point was located 620 km (385 miles) southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low pressure depression forms over the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward towards the east coast of the United States. Rose, with a tropical storm force approaching the Lower California Peninsula, will begin pushing moisture masses deep from the tropical strip northward toward the southwest United States on Monday.
Rose will bring up to 10 inches (-25.4 cm) of rain to Mexico on Monday in part.
Then tropical humidity, interacting with the approaching low pressure depression, will create a wide area of heavy rain in the Southwest over the next few days.
1-3 inches (-2.6-3.2 cm) of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, mud currents, and possibly landslides in the desert.
Humidity deep out of the tropical strip will cause torrential rains that will reach 2 to 3 inches (-5.1 to 7.6 cm) per hour in certain areas, especially parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In parts of the southwest, especially most of Arizona, up to 24 inches (-5.2-3.1 cm) of rain is expected.
Sudden flooding is possible, with rapid deterioration due to the dispersion of tropical rains.
It is very undesirable to go into the desert on foot due to the threat of a tropical rainstorm.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into rapid rivers, but thunderstorms will bring local gusty winds and sandstorms.
The low pressure depression will bring local heavy rain to parts of the Southern California coastline as it approaches.
Rainfall is possible, which together will exceed half an inch (-1.3 cm), and this can cause minor mudflows and slippery paths.
It will be the region's first rainfall in the wet season.
Separate dispersed tropical rains for Arizona will begin to approach late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rains take over the wider area late on Monday and early on Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread into the Four Corners region (DR Colorado, DA Utah, NA Arizona, and DR New Mexico) on Tuesday and last throughout Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the United States, as temperatures drop in the Arctic, but the tropics are still quite warm.
Sometimes this causes a dramatic change in temperature over a short distance.
It is an example of dramatic temperature differences on Sunday in the central United States.
The difference between temperatures in Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Demoin (Des Moines, Iowa, varies by nearly 20 degrees.
In the next few days, a long summer heat will try to form and expand.
For much of the central and eastern United States, the beginning of October is expected to be warm, with temperatures reaching 80 degrees Fahrenheit or above (-27 degrees Celsius) in wide areas from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
Temperatures in the city of New York on Tuesday could reach 80 degrees (by Fahrenheit; .27 degrees Celsius), which would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecasts suggest that temperatures in the eastern United States are likely to exceed average temperatures in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the hearing in the Brett Kaveno case
Over 20 million people watched with excitement on six television channels on Thursday, according to Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Kaveno of sexual harassment, which the woman claims happened in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political draw continued, with broadcasters ceasing regular transmissions to report the latest milestone in Friday's run: an agreement organized by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI would investigate the allegations for a week.
Ford informed the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely convinced that Kaveno was burying her drunk and was trying to take off her clothes during a high school party.
Caveno testified dispassionately that he was absolutely certain that this did not happen.
According to Nielsen, 20.4 million people watched it all Friday.
Companies CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, "Fox News Channel" and MSNBC recorded average viewer interest.
Data for other broadcasters, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network, who demonstrated it, were not immediately available.
And "Nielsen" usually encounters problems when counting people who are watching what's happening in the offices.
In order to get a better idea, this amount of spectators corresponds to the number of play-offs or Oscar ceremony spectators.
The Fox News Channel, whose commentators have resolutely supported Kaveno's appointment, had the highest viewership, an average of 5.69 million throughout the day-long hearings, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS raised 3.1 million, NBC raised 2.94 million, MSNBC raised 2.89 million, and CNN raised 2.52 million, Nielsen reported.
Interest remained high even after the hearing.
Fleick was the central figure of the Friday drama.
After a moderate Republican team had released a statement that he would vote for Kaveno's appointment, the senator was spotted by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning when he, accompanied by protesters' indignation calls, tried to get to the Justice Committee hearings with an elevator.
In a live CNN broadcast, he stood stabbed his eyes for several minutes, as a barber.
"I stand here, right in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told that "you own power while so many women are powerless.""
Fleick explained that his team had made a statement, and informed him before the elevator doors closed that he still had something to say during the committee hearing.
Cable networks and broadcasters were reflecting on what was going on live several hours later as the Judiciary Committee was about to vote on Kaveno's nomination to vote in the Senate.
Fleick, however, claimed that he would only do so if he knew the FBI would look into the charges against the candidate next week, which a minority of Democrats has demanded.
Fleck was persuaded in part by talks with his friend, Democrat Senator Chris Coons.
After talking with Coons and several more senators, Fleick made his decision.
Fleick's choice was significant, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have votes to confirm Kaveno without an investigation.
President Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of political games Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, people who criticize her plan to leave the European Union were accused of "political gambles" with Britain's future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, 29 September 2018.
In another interview, right next to an interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, May's former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continues to attack her Brexit plan for Britain's future relationship with the European Union, the so-called "Chequers plan", stressing that the suggestion that Britain and the EU should use each other's tariffs is "totally absurd".
Shooting Type Sims: Police have arrested Diteon Simpson suspected of murdering LSU player
Police have arrested the suspect for shooting Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and arrested as an accused of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge police station informed.
Officials released a video showing Sims colliding with Simpson, and police mentioned Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
CBS subsidiary WAFB reports that police found the glasses at the crime scene and Simpson's blood has been found on them.
After Simpson was questioned, police informed him that he had confessed to shooting Wade.
He was reportedly charged with $350,000 bail by a lawyer.
A forensic expert team from East Baton Rouge Parish released a provisional conclusion on Friday that the death was caused by a shot in the head that struck the neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police's operational group for refugee search, the State Police Forensic Laboratory, Southern University Police, and the area's residents for helping with the investigation, which resulted in the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the area's lawmen for their "toughness and work in the name of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
A 6 feet 6 inches (-1.98 m) tall forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball at LSU.
In the last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade announced that the team was "run down" and "shocked" about Wade's death.
"That's what a man's always worried about," Wade said.
The volcano spits ash across Mexico City
The ash that rises from the Pokatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of the Mexican capital.
After activity was observed in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours the National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday that they should not approach the volcano.
The center observed multiple choking and shivering.
Images on social networks showed that car windshields in the vicinity of Mexico City, such as Hochimilco (Xochimilco), were covered with a thin layer of ash.
Geophysicists have spotted the activation of a volcano 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake rocked central Mexico in 2017.
The volcano, also known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police conflict with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the pro-independence protesters clashed with public order police and when thousands joined the opposing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote for secession.
A group of masked secession supporters, hampered by the public order police, pelted them with eggs and spewed powdered paint, forming dark clouds of dust in the streets that would normally be full of tourists.
It’s also important to note that this is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur.
For several hours, groups of independence supporters, chanting, "Don't forget and don't forgive!", were involved in a confrontation with unity-supporting protesters who chanted, "A long life for Spain!"
According to local newspapers, fourteen people were given medical attention during the protests due to minor injuries.
One year after the referendum of 1 October, which was declared illegal by Madrid, but which was praised by the Catalans, the idea of independence remains in great tension in the region.
Voters spoke emphatically for independence, although voter turnout was low, and those who were against secession were mostly boycotted by the vote.
According to Catalan officials, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to stop voting at polling points across the region, and fierce clashes broke out.
Independence support groups had been on duty Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the state police.
The demonstration took place, but the demonstrators were forced to choose a different path.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, admitted that he no longer hoped Catalonia would gain independence.
"Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents' eyes filled with tears of joy at being allowed to vote, but now things have stopped," he said.
Although parties supporting Catalan independence won last year's regional elections with a small but significant lead, these parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, as several of the best-known leaders have either emigrated or are under arrest and are awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
The 42-year-old mechanic, Joan Puig, who filmed a telephone protest in support of the police, said the conflict had been fuelled by politicians on both sides.
"The tension is getting bigger," he said.
On Saturday, one of the nine Catalan leaders, Oriol Junqueras, who has been in custody until trial since the previous year, announced that he would stand for election to the European Parliament next year.
"Candidacy in the European elections is the best way to expose the regression and repression of democratic values that the Spanish government has directed against us," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after crashing into a car in a building
Three men (33, 34 and 39 years old) were arrested after the car was repeatedly struck against a building in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Balinagard Crescent at about 7.30 BST on Thursday.
Detective inspector Bob Blemmings informed that the gate and also the building itself were damaged.
It is possible that a crossbow was fired at the car at the same time.
Menga's blow allows "Livingston" with 1-0 to win "Rangers"
The first goal of Dolly Menga secured the victory of "Livingston"
The supporter, Livingston, stunned the Rangers by providing Steven Gerrard with his second loss in 18 games played in the role of Ibrox's club manager.
Dolly Meng's blow proved to be decisive, as Gary Holt's team levelled the situation with Hibernian.
The Commission shall be assisted by the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed established by Regulation (EC) No 178/2002.
Before that, the European League hosted the Vienna Rapid on Thursday.

"Livingston" does not use the opportunity against dull guests
Holt's team, with their direct play, which made it difficult for the Rangers in all sorts of ways, needed to be in the lead long before they got the names.
Scott Robinson broke out, but delayed his attempt in front of the goal, then Alan Lithgow's attempt after slipping into his feet to obstruct Craig Halkett's head-to-head kick across the goal line, was unsuccessful.
The hosts allowed the Rangers to play in front of them, knowing they would be able to stop the guests at the planned locations.
And that is how the crucial gate came to be.
The Rangers allowed a free kick, and Livingston used the corridor, Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to make room for Meng, who kicked and scored goals from the middle of the zone.
It’s a great way to get to know people and make them feel good about themselves.
This continued into the second half, though Alfredo Morelos (Alfredo Morelos) ordered Kelly to save the goal.
Scott Pitman's attempt was stopped by the Rangers' goalkeeper Alan McGregor's dexterity, and Litgow threw a passing goal in the "Livingston" combination.
Centered balls continued to appear in the "Livingston" area, but two calls for a penalty – after Halkett fought for the ball with substitute Glenn Middleton – and for playing by hand – were rejected.
"Phenomenal" performance of "Livingston" – analysis
Scottish BBC Alsdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and result of "Livingston".
Each of them was excellent, continuing to exceed expectations, constantly improving performance.
Their style of play and personalities have practically not changed since returning to the top echelon, but much praise has been deserved by Holt for how he has teamed up with the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great at maintaining first-class organized defenses, while Menga made sure that Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall were always on the alert.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
No matter how good they were at times under Gerard's command, they were far from those standards.
Their last ball was boring – only once they broke into part of the hosts' field – and it's basically an invitation to wake up "Rangers who are in the middle of the table.
This is the first time I've heard of this book.
On Saturday (29 September), when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin, there were many smiles and a blue sky.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aimed to re-establish relations between NATO allies.
They have disagreements on various issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new gigantic mosque.
The town is home to the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
Police citing security as a reason blocked a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but many of the supporters came nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, much of them Kurdish, also made their attitude known, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the decision of the German government to take him to himself.
Protests between the two sides reflect the contradictions that have been created by a guest who is seen by some German Turks as a hero, while others despise as an autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
It’s time to start thinking about the future.
The collision occurred at the intersection of Bestwood Street with Evelyn Street, a section of road with heavy traffic in Deptford, southeast of the city, at about 10.15 a.m. BST.
The car driver stopped, and medical assistance was provided, but the man died at the scene.
The collision occurred several months after another cyclist died on Childers Street, about a mile from Sunday's crash site. The driver then left the crash site.
The capital police service stated that the police officers were engaged in identifying the man and informing their loved ones.
Roads have been closed and buses have been diverted at the scene, but car drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six employees injured during riots
The Prison Office reports that six prison staff were injured in riots in a men's strict regime prison.
The riot broke out at HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire at about 9.30 a.m. BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
In order to prevent disorder in which eight prisoners participate and who are enclosed in one wing, employees of the special service "Tornado" were involved
The employees were treated for mild facial injuries at the scene.
A prison service spokesman stated, "To resolve the incident at HMP Long Lartin Prison, specially trained prison personnel were involved.
Six staff members were given medical attention due to injuries.
We will not put up with violence in our prisons and say clearly that those responsible will be handed over to the police and will probably spend more time behind bars".
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates in prison, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison chief was being treated in a hospital following an attack by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the riot control officers were sent to prison to resolve serious riots in which staff had been attacked by billiard bombs.
Orcan Rosa Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City are threatened with sudden flooding (probably to the benefit of drought-affected areas)
Arizona rarely suffers from tropical depression, but this is likely to happen early in the next week, when Hurricane Rose will move with the remaining force across the desert southwest, posing a sudden risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning of sudden flooding Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rose is expected to move right across the Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving with the rain late on Monday.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix indicated on a Twitter entry that since 1950, only "ten tropical cyclones maintained tropical storm or depression status within a 200-mile (320 km) radius of Phoenix!
Catherine (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles (65 km) from the boundaries of AZ."
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 2 to 3 inches (-5.08 to 1.2 cm) of rainfall, reaching as much as 6 inches (15.24 cm) in some places.
Other areas of the desert south-west, including central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, will probably receive 1–2 inches (-2.54-5.08 cm), reaching as much as 4 inches (-10.2 cm) in some places.
For those who are not at risk of a sudden flood, Rose’s rain can be a blessing because of the drought in the region.
Although the possibility of flooding is a very serious concern, some of the rains are likely to be good, as the south-west is currently suffering from drought.
Under U.S. drought control (Drought Monitor), just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, reported weather.com.
First, the route of the hurricane Rose leads to the Baja California peninsula in Mexico, where it will reach the coast.
Rose is still with a hurricane force on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 85 miles (137 km) per hour, located about 385 miles (-620 km) south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and heading north at a speed of 12 miles (19 km) per hour.
The storm encounters cooler Pacific waters and therefore subsides.
The hurricane, therefore, is expected to reach the coast in Mexico on Monday afternoon or in the morning with the force of a tropical storm.
Rainfall in parts of Mexico can be strong, creating a significant risk of flooding.
"It is expected that rainfall will reach 3 to 6 inches (7.62 to 7.24 cm) from Lower California into the southwestern part of Sonora, with precipitation possibly reaching 10 inches (25.4 cm)," reported weather.com.
Rose will move north, across Mexico as a tropical storm and then reach the Arizona border early on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression that will then move across Arizona and end up in southern Utah on Tuesday late in the evening.
"The major threat expected from Rose or its remains is very heavy rainfall in Lower California, the northwest part of Sonora, and the desert southwest of the United States," the National Center for Hurricanes said.
This rain is expected to cause life-threatening flash floods and mudflows in deserts, and landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack on Midsommer Norton: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
The injured teenager was found in Excelsior Terrace in an area of Midsomer Norton town on Saturday at about 4 p.m. BST.
He was taken to a hospital where his condition remains "stable".
Police informed that 17-year-old and two 18-year-old teenagers, as well as a 20-year-old man, were arrested overnight, in the Redstock area, in Eivon and Somerset.
Police have called on anyone who might have mobile phone footage of what happened to them.
Trump claims Kaveno suffered "evil and anger" from the Democrat Party
"The vote for Judge Kaveno is a vote to reject the Democrats' party's ruthless and violent tactics," Trump stated at a meeting in Wheeling, Western Virginia.
Trump emphasized that Caveno had suffered "evil and anger" from the Democrat Party throughout his nomination process.
Caveno testified before Congress, where he vigorously and emotionally denied any accusations of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford decades ago when the two were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the hearing on her charges.
The president stated on Saturday that that day "the American people saw" Caveno "excellence, ability, and courage."
"The vote to endorse Judge Caveno is a vote to endorse one of the most educated lawyers of our time with a brilliant history in relation to serving the nation," he stated to a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
President Caveno mentioned the nomination in a roundabout way, speaking about the importance of Republican turnout in the interim election.
"Five weeks to one of the most important elections in our time.
I was not a candidate, but actually I was a candidate," he said.
"That's why I go everywhere, fighting for great candidates."
Trump countered that Democrats had undertaken the mission of "protect and resist".
The first of the important procedural votes in the Senate for the nomination of Kaveno is expected to take place no later than Friday, CNN informed the Republican Party's senior leadership assistant.
Hundreds killed in earthquake in Indonesia, and clear death toll rises
Officials informed Saturday that at least 384 people were killed, many simply washed away when gigantic waves hit the coasts after a severe earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
On Friday, hundreds gathered for a festival in Palu City for a festival on the beach, when waves up to six metres (18 ft) high hit the coast in a chair, washing many away in death and ruining everything in their path.
The tsunami erupted after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still operating on the beach and didn't run immediately, and they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indian disaster-mitigation agency BNPB, told a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't arrive alone, it brought cars, logs and buildings, it dredged everything on the ground," Nugoro related, adding that the tsunami, before striking the coast, had crossed the sea at 800 km/h (497 mph).
"Many people climbed trees to escape, and survived," he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Photographs taken by the disaster agency in flight show many destroyed houses and shops, deformed and collapsed bridges, and a water-encircled mosque.
The aftershocks continued to fuse the coastal town on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area inhabited by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Evaluation and Application Agency stressed in a statement that Friday's massive earthquake released energy about 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The location of the town at the end of a long, narrow bay probably boosted the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "widespread", and informed that thousands of homes, hospitals, shops and hotels had collapsed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho acknowledged that the number of casualties and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Dongala (Donggala), which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
"Communications "were completely ruined, no information from Dongala was received," Nugroho informed.
More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross informed in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers are heading to the affected regions.
"This is a tragedy, but it could have been worse," the organisation said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for failing to inform that a tsunami had struck Palu, although officials claimed that waves arrived during the announcement of the warning.
In the video posted on social media, a man on the top floor of a building is desperately calling people on the bottom of the street that a tsunami is coming.
Within minutes, the water wall hits the coast, washing away buildings and cars.
The Reuters news agency was unable to immediately confirm whether the material was real.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a serious loss of power, which cut off communications Pala, making it difficult for officials to attempt to coordinate the rescue.
Officials stated that the army had begun to send cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, but that the evacuees were still in great need of food and other essentials.
The city's airport is only open for relief events and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia tsunami death toll exceeds 800.
That's very bad.
Mr. Doseba told us that the employees of World Vision, who from Dongal (Donggala) successfully reached the town of Palu, now live in tarpaulin sheds in the office yard, passed the damage scenes on the way.
"They told us they saw a lot of buildings that had been destroyed," he explained.
That's very bad.
Even when relief groups have determined to organize relief aid for disaster victims, some complained that foreign aid workers with much experience were not allowed to travel to Pala.
According to Indonesian law, the funding, resources and personnel of overseas organizations will only be allowed to arrive if the area of misery is declared as a national disaster zone.
This has not happened yet.
"It's still a province-level disaster," said Indonesian Red Cross spokeswoman Aulia Arriani.
"When the government states, 'Okay, it's a national disaster,' we will be able to accept international aid, but that status has not yet been determined."
When Palu arrived the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the still undiscovered people continued to hope that their loved ones would become miracles that brighten the gloomy life in times of natural disasters.
A small boy was pulled from the gutter on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been penetrated under the rubble for two days, next to the corpse of her mother.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia's national paraglider team, had prepared two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games held this month previously in Indonesia.
Others of the trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were their students.
"As an experienced paraglider," he said, "I am taught the burden of emotion.".
Mr. Gendon recalled that after news of the Roa Roa hotel collapsing spread among the paraglider team, he sent "WhatsApp" messages for desperately hours to members of the Palu competition who participated in the beach festival.
However, the result of his reports was only one grey mark, not two blue marks.
"Think, it means that the messages did not reach the addressee," he said.
It’s a great way to get to know each other better.
According to a Newport Police Department statement, thieves stole $26,750 from a "Brink's" employee who refilled an ATM at the "Newport on the Levee" complex on Friday morning.
"The driver of the car emptied the entertainment complex's ATM and was prepared to refill it with more money," Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While the manager was busy, another man "stripped the Brink's employee from behind" and stole the bag with cash for the ATM.
According to the press release, witnesses noticed several suspicious persons leaving the crime scene, but police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
All who have information about their identities should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Je
rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye (Je).
Announcing the replacement on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, "The one who was previously known as Kanji West."
The 41-year-old West had been called Je for some time, and used the nickname as the name of his eighth album, which was published in June ("Ye").
This change comes before his appearance on the show "Saturday Night Live," in which, as expected, he will release his new album "Yandhi".
The show's creators tell him that he is replacing singer Ariana Grande in the show, who stopped her work for "emotional causes".
West has narrated that it is not only an abbreviation of his current professional name, but it also has a religious meaning.
"I believe "Ye" is the word most commonly used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "You,"" West explained earlier this year when discussing the name of his album with radio host Big Boy (Big Boi).
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
At first there was Kanye, which means "only one, it was followed by 'Ye', which is a reflection of the good and bad in us, of our confusion, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection on who we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs, previously known as both Puff Daddy and P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love (Love) and Brother Love (Love Brother).
JAY-Z, who had worked with Vesta in the past, also has and has not used a dash and capital letters.
President-elect of Mexico promises not to use army against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use military force against civilians at a time when the 50th anniversary of the bloody repayment of students is approaching.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at the Tlatelolco Plaza "never use an army to oppress the Mexican people."
Army units fired a peaceful demonstration on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when leftist student movements spread throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has sworn to support young Mexicans, giving out subsidies to students each month and opening more public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drag young people into gangs of criminals.
US should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more and more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in this field, explains investor and artificial intelligence practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments were made after various U.S. government bodies have made statements about artificial intelligence, although the U.S. as a whole lacks a strategy in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China launched its plan last year: its goal is to become a key country in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"A two-fold budget for artificial intelligence research will be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the U.S., and the next cardinal turn in the field of artificial intelligence is expected," said Lee.
In an interview with CNBC earlier this week, Lee said that doubling funding could double the chance that the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence would take place in the United States.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Innovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent artificial intelligence companies in China "Face++".
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon (Karnegi-Melon) University, he worked to create an artificial intelligence system that would beat America's best "Othello" (Reversi ) player, and later he was a leading figure in Microsoft Research and president of the China branch of Google.
Lee acknowledged previous technology competitions organized by the U.S. government, such as the "Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge" and asked when the next one would be prepared to be able to identify people with ideas for the future".
"Scientists in the U.S. often have to work very hard to get government grants", said Lee.
"It's not China that lures leading scientists, but big companies," he explained.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university luminaries to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee added that changes to immigration policy could also help the U.S. improve its advances in artificial intelligence.
"I believe green cards should be automatically awarded to people with a PhD in philosophy in the field of artificial intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China published its next generation artificial intelligence development plan.
Lee explained that China's National Science Foundation provides funding to people for academic institutions, similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations allocate money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint artificial intelligence center that is expected to bring together partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA (the U.S. Ministry of Defense's Central Research and Development Organization) announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called "AI Next".
The National Science Foundation, on the other hand, currently invests over $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation aimed at establishing a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not been in operation for several months.
What is the difference between a good and a bad credit score?
The Macedonian people voted in a referendum on Sunday whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", taking a step that will prevent decades-long disagreements with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's requests to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, underscores that the name of its northern neighbour shows claims to its territory, and has vetoed Macedonia's admission to NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but the nationalist opposition insists that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of the Macedonian Slavic majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the referendum, and a campaign calling for a boycott has raised concerns whether the turnout will reach at least the 50% required for the referendum to be declared valid.
The referendum bulletin asks the question: "Are you in favour of membership of NATO and the EU in an agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying on the way to becoming an organisation for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia, one of the members of the EU and NATO.
"I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live free, under the guise of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska in Skopje.
While not legally binding, enough MPs have stated that they will take into account the outcome of the vote, which will become decisive.
A 2/3 majority will be needed in parliament to change the name.
The National Electoral Commission informed that no irregularities were reported until 1:00 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the previous parliamentary election, in which 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for the sake of my children, our place is in Europe", said 62-year-old Josie Tanevski, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, his wife Zorica, and their son Dushko cast their votes in a referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name, which will open the way to NATO and the European Union, handed over in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov, prepared a small stage and arranged chairs at tents laid by those who boycotted the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to stand with our heads raised, not through the doors of our servants," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a small country, but we have self-respect.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China or Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will trigger the necessary investment in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20 percent.
"I believe most will cast a vote for because more than 80" percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," said Zayev after casting a vote.
He said that the result "yes" would "confirm our future".
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research shows that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum – less than the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, found that 57 percent of voters are expected to participate in Sunday's vote.
70 percent of them said they would vote in favour.
For a referendum to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent and another vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the West-oriented government that came to power last May.
See: The City of Manchester's Sergio Aguero sneaks through all of Brighton's defense to score a goal
Serhio Agvero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton's defence allowing Manchester City to win the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England at 2:0 on Saturday.
Agvero gave the impression that his goal in the 65th minute was ridiculously easy.
This is the first time I’ve heard of this book.
He ran out between the three Brighton guards, and threw himself inside the free field.
Agvero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He bypassed the ball one guard, then outscored several more Brighton on the side of the field in the run.
He then made a pass to the left, reaching Sterling.
The English centre striker used his first touch to pass back Agvero, who used the right football boot to defeat Brigton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan, hitting the ball on the right side of the net.
"Agvero struggles with foot problems," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We discussed playing 55, 60 minutes with him.
That's exactly what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the time.
However, it was Sterling who secured Sky Blues' initial advantage in Premier League wrestling.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Alvero got deep into Brighton's territory in that play out ball.
He sent the ball with a beautiful kick along Leroy Sane's left leg caviar.
Sané made several hits until he entrusted Sterling with bringing the ball to the farthest goalpost.
The center striker of the Sky Blues easily kicked the ball into the net just before crossing the border.
The City fight with Hoffenheim in the Champions League group matches on Tuesday at 12.55 on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Zinsheim, Germany.
Shertz wants to get problems for the Rockies.
As the Nationals do not participate in the playoffs, there was no reason yet for a resume.
However, Scherzer, who is always ready to compete, hopes to take the chance against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the Rockies have actual playoffs. And the Rockies are in the lead with one game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West Group.
The Rockies have forced out at least a white card with a 5:2 win for the Nationals on Friday night, but have still not won their first title in the division.
"Although we're playing the same game, we'll at least be able to have fun knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver, with the crowd and the other team, will probably be the most annoying thing I'll face this year.
And why wouldn't I want to compete?"
It’s also important to remember that you don’t have to be perfect to be perfect.
Shertzer, who will be the 34th start, made a pitching session in the outfield part of the bullpen on Thursday, and will pitch the ball during his normal resting hours on Sunday.
Washington's righthanded is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds rallies in West Virginia
The President mentioned the situation, which his chosen Supreme Court candidate Brett Kaveno has entered, while at the same time talking about the importance of the turnout of Republican voters in the interim elections.
"Everything we've done is at risk in November.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
It's really very, very serious -- I didn't stand, but actually I ran, and that's exactly why I'm everywhere and fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this awful, awful group of Democrat radicals who are acting right now.
And they're committed to regaining power, using every possible means to achieve the goal. You see evil, disgusting actions.
They don't care what they're going to hurt, who they have to break in order to gain power and control, that's why they want to gain power and control and we won't give them that."
Democrats, he said, have undertaken the mission of "protect and resist".
"And you've seen it yourself in the last four days," he stressed, calling the Democrats "ridiculous, evil, nasty and false."
He named the Senators of the Democrat Party of the Senate Judiciary Committee Diana Feinstein, to which the audience responded with loud outcry.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Hmm, what's this about?
No, hmm, wait -- it was really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer prepared for diversity.
It is intolerant of open
It was no wonder that Momentum activists in my local party wanted to expose me to censorship.
After all, I am the last member of the Labour Party to date in the line of MPs to be told that he is not desirable - all because we do not hide our point of view.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was similarly bullied because she was determined against antisemitism.
In my case, the movement for censorship criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
For the importance of economically responsible policy, for national security, for Europe, ironically, but these were issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
A statement on the Labour meeting in eastern Nottingham on Friday states that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Most of the meetings that took place during my eight career as a local Labour MP were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, in many meetings today the atmosphere is different and promises of a "kinder, more lenient" policy have long been forgotten, if ever.
It has become increasingly clear that the Labour Party does not want to tolerate differing views, and any view is judged according to whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
It started soon after Jeremy became a leader: colleagues who I thought were similar in their political views began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and accept views that I would never have otherwise agreed to – whether it be national security or a single EU market.
When I speak in public – and basically no matter what I say – follows a tirade about using social networks, calling for a ban on standing in the next election, exposing the Centre's policies, claiming that I have no place in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments against me are usually political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a daily stream of sexist and racist insults, but never try to avoid silently.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how normal use has become.
Jeremy Corbin stated last week that the Labour Party must cultivate a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer an organisation that is ready for a diversity of views, and with every expression of distrust or a change in selection rules, the party narrows down.
In the last two years, I have often been given advice not to jump into harrows, to think what I am talking about, and then with me "everything will be alright".
But that's not why I decided to get involved in politics.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a student in response to the negligence of the Thatcher government, which had literally brought my integrated school class to ruin, I set the task of fighting for better public services for those who need them most, both as a member of the local council and as a government minister.
I have never concealed my political views, nor have I in the previous elections.
No one in Nottingham East had reason to doubt my position on political issues, and in areas where I disagreed with the existing government.
To those who moved the proposal on Friday, I can only say that at a moment when the country is resolutely moving towards Brexit, which will hurt households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand such a desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But basically, the only thing I want to declare is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they're Labour members: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of disqualification or reminders that no one is indispensable in politics will stop me from doing what I think is best for all of you.

"Ayr" 38 - 17 "Melrose": Undefeated "Ayr" reaches the highest line in the table
The two final attempts probably skewed the final result to some extent, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves to triumph in this amazingly exciting Scottish Championship match today.
They are now at the top of the table, the only unbeaten team out of ten.
After all, it was both their excellent defense and also their much better use of the opportunities that drove the hosts, and coach Peter Murchie has every reason to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in all our games and we're still not defeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
"Melrose" Robin Christie: "With all due respect to Ayr, they used their opportunities better than we did."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, realised by Freizier Climo, put Ayr up, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, where he had awarded the Warriors to the game, changed Melrose's numbers, and Jason Baggot grabbed an unrealized ball.
Climo increased Ayr's lead by a penalty, just at the end of half time, he scored, then realised a solo try, so Ayr went 17-5 in the break.
But Melrose started the half with a good game, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, realized by Begot, reduced the lag to 5 points.
Then there was a long break as Ruaridh Knott suffered a severe injury and was carried away from the field on the stretcher, but when the game resumed Ayr rapidly advanced when Stafford McDowall made a try, which was realized by Klimo.
Ayr's existing captain, Blair Macpherson, then received a yellow card, and again, after intense pressure, Melrose used an redundant player – with an attempt by Bruce Colvine, which was not realized.
However, the hosts spawned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for intercepting Klimo without a ball, from the penalty corridor, McPherson made a tatchdown at the back of the "Ayr" jetty.
Klimo realized the ball, as before, almost from the reopening itself after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong's kick in the field and sent flanking player Gregor Henry to the host on the fifth attempt.
The Star of the "Still Game" seems to be planning a new career in the restaurant business
The star of the comedy series "Still Game" Ford Kieran seems to be planning to enter the hospitality business as it was revealed that he was named as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show he makes and participates with his ancient partner in the comedies Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the next ninth season will be the show's last, and Kiernan apparently plans his life after Craiglang.
According to official information, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source for the "Scottish Sun" indicated that Kiernan planned to get involved in Glasgow's "blooming restaurant business".
"The sea belongs to us!": Bolivia trapped on land hopes the court will open its way to the Pacific
The sailors patrol the area around the Fleet Headquarters in La Paz, dressed in ropes.
Public buildings have raised ocean blue flags.
The fleet's base ships, from Lake Titicaca, to the Amazon, are decorated with the motto, "We have a right to the sea.
The recovery of it is our duty."
In Bolivia, trapped on land, the memory of Chile’s 19th-century bloody conflict over resources is still alive, as is the longing to sail again in the Pacific.
These expectations have probably been highest for decades, as Bolivia awaits the judgment of the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of consideration.
"Bolivia is evolving, it is united and peaceful in its spirit, and, of course, with positive thoughts awaits the outcome," stated Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice ruling on large screens across the country in the hope that the tribunal in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia's demand that, after decades of intermittent negotiations, Chile's responsibility be to discuss granting sovereign exits to the seas to Bolivia.
Bolivia's charismatic president of local descent, Evo Morales, who is awaiting a controversial fight for re-election next year, is also very interested in Monday's verdict.
"We're close to regaining the Pacific," he excited at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that a court ruling in favor of Bolivia is unlikely, and if passed, no major change is expected.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no authority to grant Chilean territory, and its representatives have expressed that they will not determine the possible outcome of the negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice is delivered just six months after the final hearing shows that the case "was not complicated", explained international normative expert Paz Z-rate from Chile.
And the last four years have not pushed the Bolivian case forward, but, on the contrary, hindered it.
"The issue of access to the sea has been embezzled by the existing Bolivian administration," Zarate stated.
Morales' militant rhetoric has stifled the remaining goodwill in Chile, she said.
Bolivia and Chile are once continuing negotiations, but after this it will be very difficult to keep up the discussion.
The two countries have not exchanged envoys since 1962.
Bolivia's representative in The Hague, former president Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, disagreed that the court's decision was made unusually quickly.
Monday will bring an "extraordinary opportunity for Bolivia to begin a new era in relations with Chile" and an opportunity "to put an end to the 139-year-long conflicts that will benefit both sides," he said.
Calzadilla also denied using Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, as a political cop.
"Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"This decision is an opportunity to realize what needs to be done to overcome the past."
North Korea will only give up nuclear weapons when it can trust the US.
North Korea's foreign minister Ri Yong Ho, said his people would never be the first to remove their nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made during the meeting of the leaders of both countries in Singapore.
His comments came at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems ready to resume stale diplomatic efforts to prevent nuclear war, more than three months after Singapore's meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri claims that it is "fantasy" to hope that the U.S. still does not lift sanctions and unwillingness to declare the end of the Korean War will ever make North Korea kneel.
Washington is wary of agreeing to a declaration before Pyongyang takes significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But many are skeptical about whether Pyongyang really wants to give up arms, which the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its own security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for Kim's next meeting with Trump.
Paris Fashion Show Introduces The Latest Massive Headgear Line On The Way To You Near High Street
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely block the sun, then you are in the right place.
Designers Valentino and Tom Browne introduced the audience to a line of absurd, huge headwear in the 2019 spring/summer season collection that dazzled against the backdrop of the established style of Paris Fashion Week.
The Commission shall be assisted by the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed established by Regulation (EC) No 852/2004.
Valentino’s greatest creation was a magnificent beige hat decorated with a feather-like wide edge that swallowed up his heads.
Massive accessories included jeweled watermelons, a magic hat, and even pineapples – but they’re not designed to keep your heads warm.
Tom Brown also showed a strange selection of masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had closed lips, and they suited Hannibal Lecter rather than high fashion.
One formation resembled a breathing apparatus for diving, with a tube and glasses, while another resembled a cone of melted ice cream.
And if you want to continue with massive fashion, then the right time has come.
Stylists believe that huge aubes are probably on their way to High Street, closest to you.
Large-scale hats immediately became popular after the appearance of "La Bomba" – straw hats with two feet (-60 cm) wide appear to have worn all, from Rianna, to Emily Ratajkowski.
The status of a very impractical hat as a cult item on all social networks led to another big deal on the tongue, a straw beach bag, almost as big as the swimsuit model who carried it.
Red-yellow raffia bag, dressed with raffia fringe and fitted with a white leather handle took a special place in the "Jacquemus' La Riviera" Spring/Summer 2019 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage explained to FEMAIL, "I expect big hats and beach bags to appear in the central business street stores next summer, because the designer has left so much impression that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for sheer size accessories."
John Edwards: Language skills are vital for global citizens
Scotland’s independent schools have a reputation for excellence and have maintained this reputation in 2018, when once again outstanding exam results were obtained, further enhanced by individual and collective achievements in sports, the arts in music and other social events.
These schools, with a total of 30,000 students in Scotland and represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best level for their students and their parents.
Independent schools have set the goal of preparing their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers, and their lives as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement specific school programs, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable subject in our schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it persists in his consciousness.
If you speak his native language, it remains in his heart."
It is a reassuring reminder that we cannot simply rely on English when we want to build relationships and win the trust of people from other countries.
Taking into account the recent results of this year's exams, we can see that the languages are at the top of the league tables with the largest number of exams passed in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who taught foreign languages reached the highest mark of A.
Data from the Board of Independent Schools of Scotland for 74 schools show that 72 percent of students got the highest mark in A Chinese, and 72 percent who learned German also got the same mark, 69 percent who learned French and 63 percent who learned Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages, as a subject of choice, are now valued as highly in independent school programs as in science-technology-engineering and mathematics group subjects.
A 2014 survey by the British Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 percent of employers cited lack of language skills as a reason to be unable to fill vacancies.
As a result, language skills are becoming increasingly mandatory in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
These skills are essential in a globalised world, with increasing job opportunities requiring language skills.
Regardless of their chosen career, learning a foreign language will give them the real advantage of such a long-term skill in the future.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically improve the competitiveness of a multi-language speaker.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent did not speak a foreign language well enough to sustain the conversation, while French was the only one spoken by a double-digit number of people, 15 percent.
That is why contributing to language learning is important for today's children.
Multi-language skills, especially in developing countries, will give children a better chance for meaningful work.
Schools in Scotland differ in terms of the languages taught.
Some schools will focus more on the more common modern languages, while others will teach languages such as Chinese and Japanese, which are considered the most important for Britain's future, according to plans for 2020.
Whatever your child’s interests are, independent schools will always be able to choose from a range of languages and teachers will be experts in the field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a language environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
At the moment, in the global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still vital for the future of the country, so this fact must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be seen as "knowledges of international communication".
Independent schools will continue to offer Scottish youth this choice, diversity and excellence.
Il faut bien le faire (It must be done).
John Edwards is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
It’s not just a matter of how many times you’ve been there.
“I’m not going to tell you how much I miss you.”
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play on Sunday in a preseason opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it remains to decide exactly how many minutes he will play.
"It will be more than one, but less than 48," Walton informed the Lakers on the official website.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trudell (Mike Trudell) recorded on Twitter that James was likely to play a limited number of minutes.
As he continued his practice this week, James was asked about his plans for a series of six preseason games for the Lakers.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season games to prepare", he said.
Trump's Summit in West Virginia, YouTube
President Donald Trump is launching a series of rallies in Wheeling, West Virginia today.
This is the first of five scheduled rallies by Trumpla next week, including stops in friendly locations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the vote for his choice to fill the vacant seat in the Supreme Court has been suspended, Trump's goal is to gain support in the upcoming interim election, as there is a risk that Republicans will lose control in Congress after passing votes in November.
What time will Trump meet in West Virginia today and how will he watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled to take place at seven o'clock in the evening, after ET today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump's rally in West Virginia can be watched online on YouTube.
It is likely that Trump will be talking about this week's hearing of Supreme Court candidate Brett Caveno in a case that has been made too tense by sex charges, and a Senate vote is expected to postpone approval for a week while the FBI conducts an investigation.
But the main goal of this rally is to help improve the situation for Republicans expected by the election in November.
As a result, President Trump's campaign shows that the task of these next week's five rallies is to "activate volunteers and supporters while Republicans try to protect and increase the majority they own in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congressary control of his agenda is so important that the president will visit as much of the state as possible because we are launching an active campaign season," Trump campaign spokesman, who did not want to reveal his name, told Reuters.
This evening's rally, which is planned for the "Westbanco Arena" in Wheeling, will likely attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and will be featured in the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump will visit West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 with over 40 percent.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Senator candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind according to polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morissey that the president needs to come in to help improve his results in the polls," Simon Haeder, a professor of political science at the University of West Virginia, stated according to Reuters.
Raiders Cup 2018: US has demonstrated determination to fight to keep high expectations for Sunday singles
After three sessions, the "one-word" format of the Wednesday afternoon game probably was exactly what this Raider Cup needed.
Athletes love to talk about fluctuations in success, and they really believe in it, especially in competitions such as these.
So, which side do they think is luck now?
"They were in the lead with six points, but now with four, so I think it kind of means that luck has turned to us," said Jordan Spieth going his ways.
Europe, of course, takes the lead with 4 points and 12 more to be played.
Spite explained that Americans believe the wind is blowing in their sails and they have reason for optimism, of course, also in the person of Spite and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each of them can boast three points out of four.
Spite has been destructive from the site of the first hit, to the lawn, and is an example of a winner.
Those guttular victory calls became more and more loud as his round continued, the decisive punch in the hole was made to reach the same number of hits four times when he and Thomas were two punches behind after two.
His beat in the pit, which achieved him a victory of 15 , was perceived by a similar cry, from them, of his belief that the American team had not yet been pushed out.
"You really have to dig deep, and worry about your match," Spite said.
That's all these players have left.
18 holes for good luck.
The only players to score more points in the last two days than Spite and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who will undoubtedly get into the history of this Raider Cup.
Europe's strange but attractive couple are four points behind and will not be able to harm.
It was the only couple to live without bogies on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogies on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the nine final pits on Friday morning.
This course and the way in which their energy flows to this raging crowd and back convinces them that they are the players to win on Sunday, and Fleetwood with Molinari will be the most popular players who can secure a potential European victory when the sun sets across the "Le Golf National".
It is desirable for both at the same time in different holes.
However, the talk of European triumph was premature.
Babba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly coped with this morning's character in the "fourballs" format of Sergio Garcia, who played with Alex Noren.
Bogie and the two double front nines led the Spaniards and the Swedes into a mess, and they weren't even close to making it out of it.
On Sunday, however, there is no one to help.
The fourball and foursome formats of the game are so exciting to observe in the vicinity due to the interaction of the couples, to watch what advice they give, and what not, and how the strategy can instantly change the situation.
Europe has played better as a team so far, and is far ahead of its last day, but this race in the Foursome format showed that the U.S. team is determined to fight for which many, especially Stateside, have doubted.
This is the first time I've heard of this book.
The European team will start the final day of the Raider Cup with a pleasant lead after Saturday's fourball and foursome race ended with a lead of 10-6 against the United States.
The inspired pair, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, were in the lead with two wins over hard-working Tyger Woods, who increased the score at Le Golf National to four.
Thomas Bjorn's European team to retain the trophy, lost by Hazeltine two years ago, dominated over the inaccurate American team in the morning race in the "fourballs" format, and the series score became 3-1.
The United States were more vigorously opposed to the Foursomes format, winning two matches, but were unable to eliminate the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needs 8 points in Sunday's 12 singles to retain the trophy.
Flethwood is the first European first-year-old to score four points in a row with Molinari, nicknamed Molliwood ("Molliwood") after a sensational weekend is only the second pair in Raiders Cup history to score four points in the first four matches.
Having defeated Woods and Patrick Reed in a "fourballs" format, they then defeated tired Wood and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau without difficulty in a brilliant game with an even more sympathetic score of 5&4.
Woods, who won two games on Saturday, showed a great game at times, but he has lost 19 of 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes formats, in addition, seven in a row.
Justin Rose rested before the morning games at fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson's foursomes to defeat Dustin Johnson (Dustin Johnson) and Brooks Kepka, who ranks first and second in the world rankings, with 2&1.
Europe failed to achieve its full potential, although the day in the southwest of Paris was pleasant and a light breeze blew.
The three-time winner of the most prestigious golf competition, Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas, set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They forced out 2&1 against Spain's John Rahm and Ian Poulter in a fourballs format and returned later to defeat Polter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 "foursomes" after having lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Raiders' Cup the team has played in 4 point deficit singles, but as the owners, for the Faryk team only a draw result is enough to keep the trophy.
After being in second place for two days, what it looks like, Sunday's counterattack will be problematic.
North Korea said it would not unilaterally disarm, without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions deepened its distrust of the United States, and North Korea would not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho informed the world organization's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant good-will steps" last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, dismantling the nuclear weapons test site, and promising never to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we don't see an adequate U.S. response," he said.
"If there is no trust in the U.S., there will be no faith in our national security, and under such circumstances we will in no way unilaterally disarm the first."
Although Ri repeated the well-known North Korean accusations of Washington's resistance to a "gradual" approach to denuclearization, according to which Korea would be rewarded for steps taken gradually, his statement left an impression because it did not automatically reject unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang had done before.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting of U.S. President and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work towards "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has attempted to officially end the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has stated that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also has not conceded the call to ease the serious international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The U.S. insists that "denuclearization should be first", and raises the level of pressure from sanctions to reach the goal by force, even opposing the "declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions could bring us to our knees is an empty fantasy cherished by people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions only deepens our distrust."
Ri did not talk about intentions for a second Kim meeting with Trump, whom the U.S. leader had specifically mentioned while speaking at the United Nations this week.
In his speech, the minister specifically singled out three meetings of Kim with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added, "If the other side on this denuclearization issue were South Korea, not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to such a dead end."
However, Ri's tone of speech differed dramatically from that of last year when he stated in the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korea's missiles on the U.S. mainland was inevitable after "Evil Mr. President" Trump had called Kim a "missile" on a suicide mission.
This year, at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, lauded Kim for his courage in taking steps towards disarmament, but stressed that there was still a lot to do, and that sanctions should be maintained until North Korea's nuclear program was denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump stated that he had not scheduled a specific time, stressing that "it doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia stress that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for what it has done.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that, "The implementation of Security Council sanctions must be vigorously pursued without making mistakes until definitive and conclusive denuclearization is achieved."
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions since 2006 in an attempt to make Pyongyang's nuclear- and ballistic-weapon-related programmes unfettered.
Pompeo met Ri outside the UN General Assembly meetings, and then informed that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the latter was not successful.
He departed Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made, but after just a few hours North Korea accused him of "gangster worthy demands".
North Korea, in a meeting with Muna this month, pledged to dismantle the weapons landfill and also the nuclear complex if the U.S. takes "appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim had informed him that "appropriate measures" that North Korea wants to see are the security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and the steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard University students will learn how to relax enough
A new subject at Harvard University this year has made students sleep more, and it is an attempt to counter the increasingly popular culture of brutalism, which involves a caffeine-filled study through the night.
One teacher found that students at the world's best university often don't even have a basic knowledge of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a subject that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
The inspiration to create a new subject occurred to him after speaking about the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end, a girl came up to me and asked, 'Why are I only being told this now that I'm in my last year?'
She found that no one had ever explained to her how important sleep was to me -- which surprised me, he told Telegraph.
This year, for the first time, the first edition of the course provides students with basic information on how good sleep habits contribute to achievement in learning and sports, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services informed that the university decided to introduce the course after learning that the students were suffering from a serious lack of sleep during the school week.
The lesson-long training process includes series of interactive tasks.
One of the parts is a dormitory door image where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how performance in sports is affected by sleep deprivation and the importance of the bedtime routine.
In another part, students are informed about how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then a campus map with interactive icons invites participants to rethink their daily routine.
"We know that this will not immediately change student behavior.
But we believe they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know how smoking will affect your health," added Professor Chaisler.
He said that the culture of being proud of being able to learn all night long still exists, and added that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students meant that lack of sleep became an increasingly serious problem.
He explained that providing enough quality sleep should be the students' "secret weapon" to combat stress, burnout, and anxiety, and even to prevent weight gain, because the lack of sleep switches the brains into fasting mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaser develop the subject, after taking one of the professor's lectures last year, in Harvard's first course.
He said that the subject had opened his eyes and inspired him to make the course accessible to the entire campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask students who receive a postgraduate education to learn a similar program before going to enjoy the competition.
Professor Chaser advises students to install an alarm not only for the time they will rise, but also when they will go to bed, as well as keep in mind how people are harmed by the "blue lights" emitted by electronic device screens and LED lamps, as they can disrupt circadian rhythms, making it difficult to fall asleep.
It’s a great way to get to know each other better.
The Rangers hit another sad game in the guest when Dolly Meng's (Dolly Meng) hit Steven Gerrard's confused team decided 1 - 0 loss against Livingston.
The Ibrox team had hoped to win their first outing since February 4:1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team brought Gerard his second loss in 18 games since he became a club manager, and his team is 8 points away from Scottish Championship leader Hearts.
Menga kicked the ball into the goal seven minutes before the end of half time, and the Rangers' lack of inspiration didn't look any after trying to equalize the score.
The Rangers fall to sixth place, while Lyvingston climbs to third, and is only beaten by Hibernian in terms of goal difference.
And "Rangers" may have another problem, as Judge Assistant Calum Spence was in need of medical attention due to a head injury apparently caused by an object thrown from the farthest end.
Gerard made eight changes to his team, which quickly left behind Ayr, reaching the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same 11 players of "Livingston" who took away the Hearts one point the previous week, and he would be delighted as his well-dressed team suppressed opponents in each episode.
It is possible that the Rangers managed the ball more often, but Lyvingston made better use of what their actions were.
They needed to score just two minutes after the start, when Meng's first playoff sent Scott Pittman towards Alan McGregor's goal, but the centre player missed his big chance.
Then a long-distance free kick by Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett but his partner in defence, Alan Lithgow, was only able to fire the ball far past the rear pole.
It’s a great way to get to know people and get to know them.
Alfredo Morelos undoubtedly believed he should have made the penalty kick in the 15th minute, after he had clashed with Steven Lawless, but Judge Stevens Thomson rejected the Columbian call.
The Rangers only made two hits on goal in the first half time, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not particularly interfere, neither Lassana Coulibaly's head-to-head kick, nor the modest ending of the Ovi Ejaria attack.
If you’re not sure what to do with your money, you’re probably not going to be able to do it.
The Rangers didn't get back with Jacobs' long combination.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher broadcast the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept the balance and chose Meng for a simple ending.
Gerard replaced Kulibali with Raein Kent on the break, and this affected the game almost immediately as the midfielder sent the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly immediately threw a block from his line.
However, Lyvingston continued to have guests play as they like, with Litgow and Halket taking one long kick after another.
Holt's team could have continued the lead into the final stage, but McGregor played well, stopping Jacobs before Litgov made a head-to-head kick from the corner.
A substitute for the Rangers, Glenn Middleton, demanded another penalty kick late in the game, after colliding with Jacobs, but Thomson ignored the request again.
Almanah: Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today... one day Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, who grew up as a physicist, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, as the result, after all, was a device known as the Geiger counter.
In science, the Geiger meter, which took its place and remained, has also taken its place in pop culture, such as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, in which scientists of the cowboy type, Rogers and Dale Evans, played the main roles:
Man: "What the fuck is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear how the atoms that are released work because of the radioactivity generated by these minerals."
Evans: "Really, it's really popping up!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention named after him continues to live.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "see" evil cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "see" evil cells and kill them
Vaccine therapy teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells
This method produces immune cells from the patient, which are converted into a laboratory
Then they would be able to "see" the protein, which is characteristic of many malignant tumors, and will be injected back into the body
The trial vaccine has shown promising results in patients with various types of malignancy.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that taught her immune system to recognise malignant cells experienced her ovarian cancer disappearing for more than 18 months.
The method involves getting the cells from the patient’s immune system, converting them into a laboratory so that they can “see” the HER2 protein, which is characteristic of several tumours, and then injecting them back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, informed: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes the growth of several types of malignant tumors," including breast, ovarian, lung and colon and rectal cancer, Professor Berzovsky explained.
A similar approach, when the patient obtains immune cells, which are "learned" how to attack malignant cells, has been effective in one type of leukemia.
Kanye West, after visiting the SNL, dressed in a MAGA hat, attacked Trump's critics.
It didn't end well
Kanye West was kicked out of the studio during the "Saturday Night Live" show after an incoherent performance in which he lauded U.S. President Donald Trump and announced that he would stand for the 2020 presidential election.
After completing the third song that night, titled "Ghost Town", during which he wore the "Make America Great" cap, he began to bar loud phrases about Democrats and re-emphasised his support for Trump.
"So many times when I talk to white people, they ask, 'How can you like Trump? He's a racist!'"
Well, if I was worried about racism, then I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
"Saturday Night Live" began with a parody with Matt Damon in the lead role, in which a Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the charge of Christine Blasey Ford in a sexual assault.
Although it was not broadcast, the material was loaded with Vesta's laments on social networks by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear if Rock attempted to mock Vesta in this way.
And West also complained to the audience that he had been mistreated behind the scenes because of his headdress.
"They mocked me behind the scenes!
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat in your head!"
They made fun of me!
And yet they said I've lost touch with reality," West told The West, according to the "Washington Examiner".
West went on to say, "Gribat see what happens when you lose touch with reality?", and promised to put on "my Superman cape" because that means you can't tell me what to do. Want the world to move forward?
Try love!"
Variety reported that his comments caused audience whistles at least twice, but the show's team members looked embarrassed, and at least one person told the press release, "There was complete silence in the studio."
Vesta had been invited at the last minute to replace singer Arianna Grande, who had died a few days ago by friend rapper Mac Miller.
West muffled many with a song (I Love it) he performed in a champagne bottle costume.
Vestu was supported by the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who recorded on Twitter: "To one of the strongest people in the spirit: PATHEICOS THAT DOES NOT ACCESS POWLE!"
But talk show host Karen Hunter recorded on Twitter that West simply "was what he is and that's wonderful."
"But I choose not to reward a person (by buying his music or clothing, or by supporting his 'art') who I believe supports and barges with an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so do we," she added.
Prior to this show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he had now become "a creature previously known as Kanji West".
He is not the first artist to change his name, and acts like Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper Snoop Dogg used to be Snoop Lion, and of course the late music legend Prince, changed his name with a symbol, but then to "a stage artist formerly known as Prince".
Charged with attempted murder for stabbing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
Police informed that the incident occurred in Ballihackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be dealt with by the Public Prosecution Service.
"Game of Thrones" star Kit Herrington turns against toxic manhood
Kit Herrington is known as the sword-throwing John Snow in HBO's ruthless medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has turned against the stereotype of the brutal hero, expressing that such characters on the screen often make young boys think they need to be strong to be respected.
In a conversation with "The Sunday Times Culture", Kit explained that he thought there was "a problem" and asked the question of how to deal with toxic manhood in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his "Game of Thrones" partner, Rose Leslie, also aged 31, admitted that this problem was important to him.
“I can’t think about what mistakes we’ve made with men right now,” he said.
"What do we teach young men in the aspect of this problem when they grow up in light of the existing problem?"
Kit believes that television, with its very masculine characters, is probably partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity.
He went on to say, "What is hereditary, but what is taught?
What is being taught on TV and on the streets that makes young boys feel they need to be like men?
In my opinion, this is one of the most important questions of our time: how can we change it?
Because there are clearly problems with young men."
He also admitted in an interview that he would not be taking part in any "Game of Thrones" sequels or prykwells, after the series ended next summer, stressing that "there are fed up with battlefields and horses".
Starting in November, Kit will play a key role in the relaunched Sam Sheppard's "True West", which is the story of a film producer and his brother the robber.
The actor recently admitted that he considered his meeting with his wife Rose to be the best thing that happened to him as a result of the Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this show, because it kind of secured my present family and my life from then on," he said.
In the Rose Emmy-winning fantasy series, Kit character John Snow's beloved Igritte played.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China announced that the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS had risen sharply by 14%.
Health officials report that more than 820,000 people have been affected in the country.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were the result of a sexual relationship, indicative of a change.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly as a result of transfusions of infected blood in parts of China.
However, the number of people who became infected with HIV in this way has fallen to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased to 100,000 from year to year.
HIV transmission as a result of sexual relations is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be common.
In light of the state's conservative values, research estimates that 70-90% of men who have had sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of sexually transmitted diseases are the result of insufficiently protected sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs, as part of measures to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that the employee leaked data from Republican senators, is sharply targeting "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, Maxine Waters of the U.S. House of Representatives denied allegations that her staff member has published personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on Wikipedia's legislature pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat insisted that the allegations were distributed by "ultra-right-wing omnivores and Internet sites.
"A lie, a lie, and even more despicable lies," Waters insisted in her statement on Twitter.
The leaked information is reported to include residence addresses and phone numbers held by U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from Congress, during a hearing at a Senate group on the charges of sexually indecent conduct by the Supreme Court-nominated Brett Caveno.
The leak came some time after three senators had questioned Caveno.
The Conservatives, internet sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the origin of the records was linked to the Waters office, and revealed information about a Waters staff member, Hill informed.
"This unsubstantiated statement is absolutely false and a complete lie!" insisted Waters.
"My staff member, whose identity, personal information, and security have been compromised by this fraudulent and false allegation, is in no way responsible for the leaking of information.
This unsubstantiated statement is absolutely false and a complete lie!"
Waters' statement soon sparked criticism online, including that of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This is an angry denial," Fleischer wrote.
"This leads to the conclusion that her temperament does not match that of a member of Congress.
When a man is accused of what he has not done, that man must not be angry.
He must not be militant.
He may not speak for the motives of the accuser.
He must be calm and serene."
Fleischer's task was to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrat falling for Judge Caveno, who was accused of being too angry a reaction during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is standing to get Waters to lose a chair in an interim election, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if true," he recorded.
In her statement, Waters informed her cabinet that her cabinet had warned responsible officials and law enforcement bodies of these fraudulent allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," she continued, "and that they will be found legally liable for all their deeds that are destructive and dangerous to any of my staff."
“Johnny English 3” review, a parody of the spy films by Rowan Atkinson left in half-rat
It has become customary to seek associations with Brexit in every new film with a British flavor, and this also seems to apply to this one that has revived, Johnny English's parody adventure comedy franchise, which began in 2003 with "Johnny English" and was reborn with a bangout in 2011 with "Johnny English returns".
Is a toothy satire about ourselves, about how obviously hopeless we are, a new export opportunity for our nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his distal eyes and an unusually moving face, has the right to create a jumble after already a second resuscitating effect – his name more than anything else signals that he is a broad-spectrum comical character designed for areas where consumers do not speak English.
He's, of course, that silly secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to delightful sophistication, is a little Kluzo, a little Mister Bean, and a little bit of that guy who plays one note in the 'Chariots of Fire' theme music at London's 2012 Olympics opening ceremony.
He is also based on the traveler and the international, incomprehensible character that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials in which he left chaos in his way.
The latest Johnny English adventure has at least one or two nice moments.
I liked the place where Johnny English goes to the helicopter dressed in medieval armor, and the propeller blades flicker at his helmet for a moment.
Atkinson's ability to visually create a comical impression is well visible, but the humor is rather weak and strangely superficial, especially since "serious" film brands, like "007" and "Mission of the Impossible" themselves use comedy with confidence as one of the components.
Humor gives the impression that it is devoted rather to children than adults, and in my opinion Johnny English's absurd troubles are not as creative and purposeful as Atkinson's silent film tricks in Bean's skin.
As usual, everything is based on the fact that Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyberhacker has hacked into Britain's super-secret spy internet network, revealing the identities of all agents in the field in Britain, for displeasing an active agent -- a woefully small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for a prime minister, pompous and conflict-ridden person who has already lost all political popularity: Emma Thomson is doing her best, with Theresa May a semi-like character, but there isn't much in the scenario to work with.
Her intelligence advisers say that since all active spies have been exposed, she will have to enlist someone already retired.
And this person is the inept Johnny English, who now works as a teacher in some fine education institution, and quietly teaches how to work as a secret agent (a couple of fun jokes), because the Englishman offers to learn the profession of spy from the very foundation.
The Englishman is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and is teamed up with his former much-victimized assistant, Bo, also played this time by Ben Miller.
Bo is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, a fun character that only becomes important at the end of the film – a role in which Vicki Pepperdine is not fully exploited.
And so Batman and Robin have returned to the secret service of Her Majesty and meet the beautiful fateful woman of Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime ministers have been dangerously fooled by the charismatic tech billionaire, the evil Jason Volta, played by Jack Lacy, and he claims to be able to solve Britain's computer mess.
Englishman and Bo begin their odyssey of wild fun: disguised as occipitalists, they set fire to a fine French restaurant; they create an upset by sneaking into Volta's luxury yacht; and Englishman causes absolute chaos by attempting to use a display of virtual reality on the head to get acquainted with the interior of Volta's building.
Everything is done for the end, but no matter how attractive and crazy the film is, it contains many elements of children's television.
Lots of moderate elements.
As in the case of other Johnny English films, I can't help but wonder if the British film industry could give Rowan Atkinson a role that would take full advantage of his talent?
The Labour Party denies plans that the British will work four days a week, but will get their pay by five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is about to discuss a radical plan under which the British will work four days a week, but get paid for five.
It is reported that the party wants business leaders to give the saved to the working people through the artificial intelligence revolution, giving them another holiday.
In this case, employees will be able to enjoy a three-day weekend while receiving the same salary as before.
Sources say the idea will "respond" to the party's agenda in economics, and plans to change the economy for the good of the working people.
The transition to a four-day work week has been supported by the Trades Union Congress, which believes it is an opportunity for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
One of the top representatives of the Labour Party informed The Sunday Times: "It is expected that changes to the policy will be announced by the end of this year.
"It won't happen in one day, but a four-day working week is an idea that fits the party's goal of balancing the economy for the benefit of the working people, as well as the party's overall strategy for industry."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week in the 2017 general election campaign already.
However, the Labour Party as such is currently not in favour of this desire.
A Labour Party spokesman informed, "The four-day working week is not part of the party's politics and the party is not considering it."
Shadow Cabinet Minister John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to give shape to his vision of the socialist revolution in economics.
Mr. McDonnell explained that he was determined to take power away from the "mass of directors" and the "spectulants" of public service companies.
The shadow cabinet minister's plan also means that the existing average shareholders in water companies may not recover their entire package, because the Labour government could implement the "deductions" due to the injustices allowed.
He also approved plans to include employees on company boards and set up exclusive Ownership Funds to give 10% of the capital of private sector companies to employees who would receive up to 500 pounds in dividends each year.
Lindsey Grem and John Kennedy answer "60 Minutes" whether an FBI investigation into Kaveno's case could change their view
The FBI investigation of the charges brought against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least one week, and raises the question of whether the office's findings could cause any Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview on Sunday, Scott Pelley, a correspondent for 60 Minutes, interviewed Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about whether the FBI could reveal anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy left the impression of a more open person than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," replied Kennedy.
"I said addressing the hearing procedure, I said I had spoken to Judge Caveno.
I called him after it happened when the accusation became known, and I asked, "Did you do that?"
He was resolute, direct and unambiguous."
But Graham's vote, apparently, is carved in stone.
"I've made the decision for Brett Caveno, and a disruptive charge will be required," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know here's what: Brett resolutely denied it," added Grem, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of her names were able to confirm it.
The event is 36 years old.
I don't think any changes are expected."
What is the World Citizen's Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the World Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring an impressive number of stars and with an equally impressive mission: to reduce world poverty.
This is the seventh year of the festival, the World Citizen Festival will be attended by tens of thousands of people who will gather on the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, rappers Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's true purpose, which is ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an event created by the international advocacy group the Global Poverty Project, which hopes to end poverty by attracting more and more people who are actively fighting poverty.
In order to receive a free ticket to this event (unless there was a desire to pay for a VIP ticket), concert visitors had to complete a series of tasks or "acts", such as doing voluntary work, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or some other significant activity to raise awareness of ending poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen movement been, with 12 more years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of giving a free concert a good way to persuade people to take action, or is it just another case of so-called "clitivism" where people feel they are truly able to influence something by signing an online petition or sending a Twitter message?
The Global Citizen movement claims to have recorded over 19 million "activities" from its supporters since 2011 in an effort to achieve various goals.
It reports that these actions have helped world leaders announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than US$37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group referred to 390 commitments and statements stemming from its operations, for which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or funded.
The group estimates that nearly 649 million people worldwide have been directly affected by the funds allocated so far.
Some of the key commitments include "The Power of Nutrition" – a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "help children grow up fully", promising to provide Rwanda with US$35 million to help end the country's malnourishment after receiving more than 4,700 Twitter messages from global citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, other national governments and global citizens like you, we can leave the social injustice of malnutrition in history," said Tracey Ullman, spokeswoman for The Power of Nutrition, at an April 2018 concert in London.
The group also mentioned that after launching more than 5,000 events calling on the UK government to provide better nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will give nutrition to 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on their website, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
"Global Citizen" commented: "It will be a long and long journey, in which we will stumble at times and suffer setbacks.
But just as the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements have done before us, so we will be successful because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon-e are some of the artists to perform at this year's event in New York City, hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use Navy for 'blockade' to hinder Russia's energy exports – Interior Minister says
"In case of need" Washington may use its Navy to hinder Russia's energy from reaching the market, including in the Middle East, – voiced by U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, as quoted in "Washington Examiner".
Zinke argued that Russia's activity in Syria, especially in places where it operates as part of the legitimate government's call, was a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason it is in the Middle East is because it wants to supply energy, just as it does in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States, through its Navy, can take care of keeping the sea routes open, as well as blocking them if necessary, so that Russia cannot bring its energy to the market," he said.
Zinke approached a public who had come to attend an event hosted by the Energy Consumers Alliance, a non-profit organization calling itself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with the situation of Russia and Iran, stating that they were virtually the same.
"Iran's and Russia's economic opportunity is more or less fuel use and replacement," he mentioned, simultaneously referring to Russia as a country whose economy is mostly dependent on fossil fuels only.
It is said that the Trump administration is promoting exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the much cheaper option for consumers in Europe.
For this reason, Trump administration officials and US President Donald Trump himself are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unsuitable" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, would make Berlin "dependent" on Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which would double the capacity of the existing gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is simply based on economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"In my opinion, we are in agreement that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a September meeting in Moscow with US Energy Minister Rick Perry.
The US has spoken out against Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the German Industry Federation (BDI), has called on the US to refrain from engaging in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I feel a big problem if a third country interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider her candidacy for the 2020 presidential election
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced Saturday that she was seriously considering standing for president after the midterm elections.
During a council meeting in Holiok, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering standing for the presidential election.
"It's the right time for there to be women in Washington who will 'collabor' the imperfect government, which also means woman-presidents," that's how her words are reflected in The Hill newspaper.
"After November 6, I will give careful consideration to my candidacy for the U.S. presidential election."
During the council meeting, Warren referred to President Donald Trump, claiming that he was "leading this country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply disturbed by what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren has openly criticized Trump and his chosen Supreme Court candidate, Brett Caveno.
In Friday's Twitter report, Warren mentioned, "Of course, an FBI investigation is needed before the election."
However, a poll published on Thursday revealed that most of Warren's supporters do not believe she should stand for the 2020 election.
According to the results of the Suffolk University Center for Political Research/newspaper "Boston Globe" poll, fifty-eight percent of the "possible" Massachusetts voters argued that the Senator should not stand for election.
Thirty-two percent supported the decision.
The poll results revealed that former Governor Deval Patrick had gained more support, receiving 38 percent for standing in the election and 48 percent against.
Still related to the potential candidacy in the 2020 election, names of high-profile Democratic Party operatives such as former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders appear.
The Associated Press told the news agency that Biden was committed to giving a formal decision by January.
Sarah Peilin quotes Trek Peilin at PTSS Donald Trump's rally
Trek Peylin (26) spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in the military in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my own son goes through, what he goes through on his return, I can extend to other families facing the consequences of PTSD and a certain dose of vulnerability that our soldiers are returning with," she told the public at the Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Peylin called his arrest an "obvious problem that everyone pretends not to see" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they're returning a little differently, they're returning fortified, they're returning pondered whether what their fellow soldiers and pilots are respected, as well as all the other members of the military field have given to this country".
According to Representative Dan Bennett of the Vasile Police Department, he was arrested on Monday in Vasile, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence in relation to a woman and possession of a weapon while in a state of intoxication.
18 states, District of Columbia challenging new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to new U.S. policies that deny shelter to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of these 18 states and the District of Columbia presented a briefing to a court counsellor on Friday to support an asylum seeker facing the obstacles posed by the said policy, NBC News reports.
The plaintiff's full name, Grace v. Sessions, has not been revealed in the trial launched by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August.
She claimed her partner "and the sons of his violent gang member" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her request for asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The state attorneys supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, from which a large proportion of U.S. asylum seekers come, as countries where gangs and domestic violence are a common problem.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Immigrant Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
The District Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Carl Racine, announced on Friday that the new policy "ignores state, federal, and international laws enacted for decades."
"Federal law provides that all requests for asylum are to be dealt with on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the claim in question, and such an obstacle violates this principle," a brief presentation by the court counsel stated.
In addition, the lawyer mentioned in his outline that policies preventing immigrants from entering the country are detrimental to the U.S. economy, as these immigrants would likely become entrepreneurs and would "provide the necessary labor force."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions appealed to immigration judges in June with a request to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang abuse.
"The asylum is open to persons who leave their homeland due to persecution or fear related to their race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political views," Sixons said in his June 11 statement regarding politics.
Asylum has never been designed to solve all the problems, even all the serious ones, that people face around the world every day.
Desperate rescue efforts Palu, with the number of dead doubling in the survivors' search process
The situation became increasingly severe for the survivors.
"The situation is very tense," said 35-year-old Riza Kusuma, comforting her hectic baby at the evacuation center of the devastated Palu city.
"Every minute, the ambulance brings in new victims.
Clean water is a deficit."
The inhabitants were seen returning to their destroyed homes and surfacing the water-soaked belongings, trying to save everything that was to be found.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals that had suffered from the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were crowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had a fractured spine and shoulder, lay outside the Palu Army Hospital, where the patients were being cared for out due to the constant strong aftershocks.
Tears burst in his eyes, remembering how the powerful earthquake began to shake the hotel room on the fifth floor in which he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to escape.
I seem to have been penetrated into the ruins of the wall," Haris told the Associated Press news agency, adding that his family had arrived in the city for the purpose of the wedding.
"I heard my wife calling for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe."
US ambassador accuses China of intimidation attempts through propaganda ads
A week after an official Chinese newspaper released a four-page ad highlighting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade on a daily basis, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred to the supplement paid by the China Daily last Wednesday in Iowa's top-selling newspaper, the Des Moines Register, accusing China of trying to interfere with the November 6 U.S. Congressional elections, but China denies this.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was attempting to interfere with the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials said to the Reuters news agency, namely that it was a new stage in the growing Washington campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is perfectly normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently caught up in a growing trade war, resulting in them imposing a series of tariffs on each other's imports.
At the start of the trade war, China's repressive tariffs targeted exporters in states such as Iowa that supported the Trump Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Iowa, a large exporter of agricultural goods to China, said that Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers, and businesses.
Branstad wrote his opinion for Sunday's edition of the "Des Moines Register", claiming that China "now doubles this intimidation by placing propaganda advertisements in our own free press."
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using for its benefit the tradition of free speech and free press, which is so important to America, by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, here at a normal Beijing news kiosk you will find a limited number of different opinions, and you will not see the true reflection of such different opinions that the people of China may have in relation to China's alarming economic trajectory, given that the media here is under the strict supervision of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most influential newspapers in China avoided publishing" his article, however he did not mention which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn of Republicans alienating female voters from mid-term elections involving the Caveno scandal
As many leading Republicans support and defend Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, against whom several allegations of sexual abuse have been brought forward, analysts have warned that they will experience a negative reaction, especially from women, in the upcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions associated with this have been extremely high, and it can be seen that most Republicans have already been willing to give up their vote.
Such things cannot be undone," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, told Saturday's article in The Hill.
Rieher questions that Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) last-minute push to conduct an FBI investigation will be a good enough reason to appease angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday. They will not forget this either tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor to the progressive movement "MoveOn" and a national spokesperson, on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
Friday morning, protesters in the Senate hallway demonstratively sang "November is coming!" when the Republicans in charge of the Judiciary Committee chose to continue with the nomination of Caveno's candidacy despite the testimony given by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported "Mic".
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be at a very high level," independent political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the news portal.
"People say it's already at a high level, that's true.
But it could be even higher, especially among the fluctuating voters living in the suburbs and younger voters (aged 18-29), who often don't go to an election even if they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which she has laid out allegations of sexual abuse on the part of a Supreme Court nominee, analysts cite a possible setback if Republicans continue to make that candidacy.
"This has become a mess for the Republican Party," according to NBC News earlier last week, said Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote, or whether Kaveno will be convicted, it's also about how the Republicans have dealt with the situation and how they have treated him," Guy Cecil, director of Priority USA, who is running this group helping elect Democrats, told the news channel.
It seems, however, that the Americans are somewhat divided in terms of what to believe after the testimony of Ford and Kaveno, a little more inclined to believe the latter.
The new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents are definitely or mostly inclined to believe Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say they are definitely or mostly inclined to believe Caveno's testimony.
In addition, 38 percent claimed that Caveno may or may not have lied regarding his testimony, while only 30 percent have said the same about Ford.
The Guardian newspaper reported that, at Fleck's urging, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as that at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Caveno had sexually assaulted her while drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate for judgeship during his studies at Yale in the 1980s has shown her his genitalia at a party.
Global web inventor plans to launch new internet to take over Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a project that could compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Technology legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company based on the Burners-Lee open-source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people are allowed access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Burners-Lee joked that Inrupt's hidden intent was to "dominate over the world".
"We have to do it now," he said of the startup.
"It's an historic moment."
The app uses "Solid" technology so that people can build their own "personal online data storage" or PTD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available in the same browser at the same time.
Personal online data storage is unique in that only the user determines who and what kind of information can be accessed.
The company refers to this as "personal powers using data".
According to company manager John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to provide the company with resources, processes, and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently operates Burners-Lee, Bruce, an IBM-acquired security platform, some freelance developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could build their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Burners-Lee said he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce complete changes by completely reversing all of their business models overnight.
"We are not asking for their permission."
In an article published on the Media platform on Saturday, Burners-Lee mentioned that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid".
In 1994, Burners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Burners-Lee has had an influential opinion in discussions on net neutrality.
Even after the launch of Inrupt, Burners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the Global Web Consortium, the Global Web Foundation, and the Institute for Open Data.
"I'm truly optimistic about this new era of the web," Burners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebrating the Victoria Cross awarded to the clergyman during World War I
For 100 years, its hometown has been celebrating the occasion when the only clergyman of the Church of England has received the Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter.
The Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Wen received this award on 29 September 1918 in connection with the attack on Bellenglise and Lechaukort.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper, so he never learned of the highest British military award he had won.
At a Saturday parade in Rashden, Northamptonshire, his two grandsons discovered a memorial stone dedicated to him.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, mentioned that it was "outstandingly symbolic" that such a stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather had received the important award.
According to the London Gazette newspaper on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Wen led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through very thick fog and large fires created by cannons and machine guns."
He later rushed to the firing line and, with the utmost bravery, led that line forward before conceiving a gun zone where he defeated three groupings.
Lieutenant Colonel Wen was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Wen (72) said that his grandfather's actions were "something I would never be able to accomplish, and which at the same time are also very humble actions".
He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade accompanied by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band of the orchestra.
Michael Wen claimed that he felt "glorified by participating in this parade", and added that "the value of a true hero is evidenced by the support given by the many people".
MMA fans waited all night for "Bellator 206", but instead welcomed Piggy Pep
Imagine you've been up all night to see Bellator 206, but in the end you've been denied this main event.
The San Jose Affair included 13 fights, including six on the main map, broadcast live throughout the night on UK Channel 5.
At 6.00 a.m. when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were about to face each other, viewers in the UK were unpleasantly surprised by the change of transmission to Pig Pea.
Some were puzzled when they had stayed awake all night until early dawn while waiting for a fight.
A fan on Twitter described the change of transmission to a children's cartoon as a "failed joke".
"The government has determined that after 6 a.m. this kind of content is not acceptable, so there was a switch of transmission to the children's program," Dave Schwartz, Bellator Senior Vice President for Marketing and Communication, explained the change in transmission.
"Piggy Pep," "yes."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said he would work on scheduling so that viewers in the UK could see these broadcasts in the future.
"Thinking about re-broadcasting, I think we'll be able to sort it out somehow," Cocker said.
"But the clock is there at six in the morning on Sunday and we will not be able to solve this problem until Sunday after our time and Monday after their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, after switching the transmission, a lot of text appeared, and they were not positive.
We tried to fix it because we thought it was a technical glitch.
But it was not. It was controlled by the government.
I can promise you that there will be no such problems next time.
We will stick to five fights instead of six (as it has been until now). We tried to please fans, but overworked.
It's an unfortunate situation."
"Desert Island Discs": Tom Daley didn't feel good enough because of his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley claims that he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old man did not realize that "not everyone is like me" until he started attending high school.
While visiting the first Radio 4 program "Desert Island Discs" hosted by Lauren Laverne, he mentioned that he started talking about homosexual rights to give others "hope".
He also mentioned that becoming a parent caused him to worry less about winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the permanent manager of the long-term program, has gone to rest for several months due to illness.
Appearing as an outcast from society in Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less valuable" than others as he grew up, because "it is not accepted in society that both girls and boys can like him."
He said, "Until today, the feeling of not being as good as others, or being different, has been the main driving force that has given me strength and endurance to succeed."
He said he wanted to prove that there was "something" not to disappoint people when they finally learn about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile leader of the LGBT campaign and used his appearances at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia, calling for even more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he decided to address the public because he felt happy to be able to live openly and without complications, and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man, U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "surprised unprepared".
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar Award winner last year, and claimed that the age gap had never been an obstacle.
"When you've gone through so much at such a young age" (his first Olympics were at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone in your age who would have experienced similar peaks and downs.
The couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley claimed that his "all-expectation" had changed.
"A year ago, all that was important to me was getting the gold medal," he said.
"You know what? There are more important things in life than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son Robert has the same name as his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley mentioned that his father didn't want to accept that he was dying, and one of the last things he asked Daley was if they had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics in which he wanted to be in the first row.
"I could not tell him that she would no longer be to be in the first line," he said.
"I held his hand until he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and was dead, I finally admitted he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had been dreaming of my whole life -- diving in front of the homers at the Olympics. There was no better feeling than that," he said.
It also inspired the choice of his first song, "Proud" performed by Heather Small, which resonated with him on his way to achievement at the Olympics and still casts goosebumps.
The programme "Desert Island Discs" can be heard on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 a.m. British Summer Time.
It’s a great way to get to know people.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday by playing his 47th Raider Cup play match, but he will need to change his strategy to avoid a failed turn of events.
Mikelson, who is already participating in the championship every two years, was seated on the reserve bench for Saturday's four-ball games and two-pair games by captain Jim Furyk.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as has so often been the case with U.S. teams, the five-time winner split his day, acting both as a supporter and participating in his game with the hope of correcting what depresses him.
If you want to know more about how to make money online, here are a few tips on how to make money online.
And if the game itself is not scary enough, Mickelson will fight the exact winner of the British Open Championship, Francesco Molinari, who has joined forces with the young Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who are behind by four points starting 12 singles matches, successfully protrudes into the lead, the Mickelson match could prove to be crucial.
This is the first time I’ve heard of this book.
"He was fully aware of his role today, flipped my back, put his hand around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furick mentioned.
"He's very confident in himself.
He is an outstanding athlete who has given so many of these teams in the past and also this week.
I guess I didn't imagine him playing in two matches.
I imagined more, but it all went the way it did, and that's what we're going to count on.
He wants to be out there, like everyone else."
Mickelson will hand over Nick Faldo's record in relation to the most played matches in the Raider Cup on Sunday.
This could mark the end of Raider's Cup career, which has never really coincided with the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has scored 18 wins, suffered 20 losses and seven draw games, even though Furick claimed that his presence gave the team certain benefits of an intangible nature.
"He's cheerful, sarcastic and witty, he likes to have fun about people, and he's a great teammate," he explained.
"I think the younger players also liked to tease him this week, which was fun to watch.
He provides much more than just a game."
It’s a great way to get to know people and make them feel special.
The European team captain, Thomas Bjorn, knows from experience that an essential lead can easily turn into an unpleasant situation when going to fight for the Raiders Cup in the last day's singles.
Dane made his debut at the 1997 games in Valderrama, where the opposing team, captained by Seve Ballesteros, scored a five-point lead over the Americans, but only now came to the finish line with a very small point lead, namely winning by 141-2-131-2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had made a significant lead in Walderraam; we had made a lead in Brooklyn where we lost, and Walderraam where we won, but only with a slight lead," Bjorn (pictured) said, watching the 2018 graduation group win with 5-3 on both Friday and yesterday, taking the lead with 10-6 at the golf course "Le Golf National.
Thus history will show both me and every member of its team that nothing is over.
Tomorrow you will give yourself everything.
Go to the field and show your best performance!
It will not end until you see the points you get on the screen.
Our goal is to win this trophy and we will focus on that.
I've been saying all the time that I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're very aware of who's facing us on the other side -- the world's greatest players."
Facilitated by what performance his players showed on the golf course, Bjorn added, "I never got excited too early.
There will be new challenges tomorrow.
Tomorrow designed individual games, and it's quite a different thing.
It’s great to have a partner with you at times when things are going well, but in individual games, your golfer’s skills are fully tested.
This message should be conveyed to your players, that is, to have them give themselves everything in the next day's game.
Now you're leaving your partner, and he has to go show his best performance too."
Unlike Bjorn's opposing team, captain Jim Furick will make sure that his players show their best performance in individual rather than partner matches. The exception is only Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four.
Furick himself has been on both sides of these important tournaments of the past few days, both as part of the winning team in Brooklyn and later in a defeat when European teams achieved a sensational success, which is later also known in the golf world as the "Miracle at Medinah".
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to how Ben Crenshaw, captain of the 1999 team, combined his players for last-day combat.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you'd like to get into the quick boost you've had in Brooklyn, the one you've had in Medina.
When such momentum is sent in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
So we made our line up and we put the guys in the way we thought was right, let's try to do some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead a counterattack, and placed Rory McIlroy in the main game and Europeans Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter in the first part of the list.
"I rank the guys in that order because I think it fits best in the course of the tournament," Bjorn said in regards to the singles players chosen.
This is the first time I’ve heard of this book.
The German Navy's latest frigate was to be commissioned in 2014, thus replacing the aging Cold War-era warships, but this will not happen until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising costs, so reported local media.
The commissioning of the main ship "Rheinland-Pfalz" of the class of the Baden-Wurttemberg frigates is now postponed until the first half of 2019, so reported in the newspaper "Die Zeit", quoting a representative of the military field.
The ship was to join the Navy in 2014, but the unpleasant after-delivery problems affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wurttemberg-class ships, commissioned by the Navy as far back as 2007, will replace the obsolete Bremen-class frigates.
They are expected to be equipped with a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared, and acoustic signals reception.
Other essential features include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible to accommodate new frigates up to two years away from the ports where they are registered.
However, the continuing delay means that the latest technology warships that would allow Germany to demonstrate its power overseas will already be obsolete by the time it comes into service, in a note to Die Zeit.
The failed frigate F125 was noticeable in all titles last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and sent it back to the shipyard "Blohm & Voss" in Hamburg.
This was the first time a military fleet returned it back to the shipyard after delivery of the ship.
Little was known of the reasons for such a step, but German media cited a number of significant "software and equipment faults" that would render a warship useless if used on a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were a particularly significant factor, as the Baden-Wurttemberg-class ships will be powered by a crew of about 120 sailors, which is only half the senior Bremen-class frigate staff.
It also turned out that the ship was too heavy, which reduced its performance and limited the ability of the military fleet to make improvements to it in the future.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as similar-class ships used by Germany during World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the whole project (including crew training) also became a major problem.
It is said to have cost €3.1 billion instead of the original €2.2 billion.
The problems associated with the new frigates are becoming particularly significant in light of recent warnings that German naval forces will be reduced.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the Chief of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament admitted that the Navy was indeed "starting to run short of usable ships".
The official claimed that the problem had grown significantly over time, as the old ships were being taken out of service, but were not being delivered new ones at the site.
He expressed regret that none of the Baden-Wurttemberg-class frigates had joined the military fleet.
The National Trust is listening to the life of the secret batsmen
The new study, which is being conducted at a Scottish Highland estate, is aimed at discovering how bats use the landscape in the process of searching for food.
The findings are expected to bring new clarity to the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and to assist in their protection measures in the future.
Scientists from Scotland's National Trust will study dwarf bats, pygmy bats, as well as brown long-eared and water-dwelling night bats in Invereve Gardens in Westeros.
Special recorders will be placed in the main locations on the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Sound experts will analyze all records to determine the frequency of bat calls and which species perform the specific actions.
A habitat map and report will then be developed to create a detailed view of the landscape reflecting the behaviour of the bats.
NTS conservation advisor Rob Dewar hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management works such as the creation of meadows and how best to preserve forests for bats and other associated species.
The bat population in Scotland and the United Kingdom has shrunk significantly over the past century.
These lands are threatened by construction and development work affecting bat hideouts and loss of residence.
Wind generators and lighting can also pose risks, as can flypaper and chemical treatments for some building materials, as well as attacks by cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes during hunting.
They use a sophisticated echo-location method to find insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the problem of bats very seriously.
The organization has ten trained experts who regularly carry out surveys, bat hide checks and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organization has even established in Scotland the first and only "Threave" property of specially designed bats in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of the ten bat species found in Scotland.
Property manager David Thompson claims that this area is ideal for bats.
"Here's a great place for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of ancient trees and a generally suitable habitat.
But there's plenty more we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to survive."
He stressed the importance of checking for bats in the area before carrying out property maintenance work, as one female hiding place may result in the killing of up to 400 females and their young, potentially destroying the entire local population.
Bats are protected animals and should not be killed, tormented, disturbed or destroyed by their hiding places.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an employee of the Bat Conservation Trust in Scotland, has called on the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about bats, and for a number of their species we just don't know how they're doing."
Ronaldo rejects rape charges, instructing lawyers to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has condemned the rape allegations against him as "fake news", claiming that people "want to draw attention to themselves" using his name.
His lawyers have been assigned to sue the German news magazine "Der Spiegel", who published these allegations.
Portuguese-born and Turin's Juventus football star is accused of raping American Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He is alleged to have paid the woman US$375,000 to keep her quiet about the incident, it reported to "Der Spiegel" on Friday.
A few hours after making these allegations, Ronaldo, 33, turned to his 142 million followers via Instagram online videos, calling this information "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they claimed today is fake news," the five-time winner of the Ballon d'Or award said on camera.
"They want to become famous using my name.
This is normal.
They want to become famous at the expense of my name, that's part of my job.
I am a happy person and everything is fine," added the player with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronald's attorneys are about to sue Der Spiegel for making allegations they have called "an unacceptable reporting on suspicion of privacy".
Lawyer Christian Schertz mentioned that the player will claim compensation for "moral damage to an extent commensurate with the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of a person's rights in recent years".
The incident reportedly occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed in the Clark County Court of the state of Nevada, it is reported that after dating at a nightclub, Ronald and Majorga went back to the player's hotel room where he had anal raped a woman.
Majorga claims that after the incident, Ronalda was kneeled down and said that he was "99 percent 'good boy'" but fell in the temptation of this 'one percent'.
It’s a good idea to have your child’s eye doctor checked regularly for any signs of eye problems.
Majorga also claims she went to the police and had photos of her injuries taken in the hospital, but she later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "fear of revenge" and worried about "public humiliation".
It’s a good idea to have your child’s eye doctor checked regularly for any signs of eye problems.

"The United Kingdom will 'regret it forever' if it loses its position as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit," said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He is "concerned" by the fact that Toyota UK has told BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it will temporarily stop production at the Burnaston plant near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said that delays at borders in the case of Brexit could put jobs at stake without agreement.
The Burnaston factory, which produces Toyota models "Auris" and "Avensis", produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will be halted,” said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are worried about leaving the EU without a contract and how cross-border trade will work.
For example, "BMW" claims to close its mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
According to automakers, the main concern is the compromised supply chain if no agreement is reached after Brexit.
The Toyota production line operates on the principle of "scarp in time", where custom-made cars get parts from both UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be disruption at the border, which could lead to some delays and shortfalls.
According to the company, "Toyota" would not be able to detain more than one day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, so it would have to stop production.
Mr. Clark said that the withdrawal plan (Chequers) for future relations with the EU, drawn up by Theresa May, has been "accurately calculated to avoid such checks at the border".
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that would allow, as I would say, not only to benefit at the present moment, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he said on the BBC Radio 4 program "Today".
"Affirming this, not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, is that we need to be able to fully pursue our very successful supply chain strategy."
Toyota was unable to say how long production could be stopped, but warned that in the long run, rising costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and ultimately put jobs at risk.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and running a factory as the union's unification coordinator, said that his members were feeling more and more excitement: "From experience I can say that as soon as a position disappears, it does not return."
A government spokesperson said: "We have presented an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, White House reports
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "delayed for another week" as the fight over Supreme Court judge candidate Brett Caveno continues, the White House reported on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates interference in the Russian election, links between Trump's use of funds and Russia, and possible disregard for the rule of law by the president.
For months now, it has been gossiping in Washington about whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general and thus threaten Miller's independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had been discussing recording a conversation with Trump and the possibility of suspending the president with the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied this information.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House to talk about his resignation.
Instead, Thursday's meeting was announced with Trump, who was at the UN General Assembly in New York at the time.
Trump said he would "more willingly" not fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid a clash with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that testified both Caveno and one of the women who accused him of committing sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blazey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into allegations made by Kaveno, continuing to delay the Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, visited Fox News Sunday.
Asked about Rosenstein's meeting, she replied, "The date of the meeting has not yet been set, it could be this week or postponed for another week, given all the things happening around the Supreme Court.
But we'll see that, and besides, I always want to keep the press informed about the news."
Some reporters dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press briefing since September 10.
The manager, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of briefings was not due to an aversion to the "worship of praise" of television reporters, although she added, "I don't deny the fact that they're venerable."
She then proposed direct contact between Trump, which would result in increased press interest.
"The President engages in more question-and-answer sessions than any president before him," she argued and added, without giving further details, "We've inquired about the number of them."
Sanders argued that briefings would still take place, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States questions directly, it's undeniably better than talking to me.
We're trying to do a lot of it, and you see we've done a lot of it over the last few weeks, and it's going to happen instead of press briefings when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions by leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences attended by important individuals.
Individual press conferences are rare.
Perhaps the President demonstrated the reason for this this this week in New York, devoting to a crowd of reporters an unchecked and sometimes strange expression.
Health Minister writes to EU staff in Scottish NHS about fears related to Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working for the Scottish National Health Service (NHS) to express their gratitude and wish them well after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman's MSP sent a letter less than six months before the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of standing applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, talks continued between the UK and the EU about the withdrawal, which led to the decisions expected this autumn.
However, the UK Government is also preparing for a possible scenario if no agreement is reached.
I know this is a very turbulent time for you.
This is why I would like to emphasise once again how much I appreciate every employee's involvement, regardless of their citizenship.
Colleagues from inside and outside the EU provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and benefit our patients and communities.
Scotland is definitely your home and we very much want you to stay here."
After a head injury, Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery
Tennessee State Tigers guard Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after a head injury he got in Saturday's game, in which he trailed the Vanderbilt Commodores with a score of 31-27, the sports reporter for Tennessean, Mike Organ, reported.
The head coach of the Tennessee State team, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before half time.
"He came up to the sideline and so to say collapsed," said Reed.
While Abercrombie was on the sideline, the coaches and medical staff gave him oxygen, then put him on a stretcher and carried him for further investigation.
A Tennessee state official told Nashville, Tennessee's WSMV reporter Chris Harris that Abercrombie had been operated out at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that there is "no information on the type/heaviness of the injury" so far, and the Tennessee state team is trying to figure out at what point that injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt representative, is in his first season after replacing Ilionis for the Tennessee state team.
Prior to leaving Saturday's game, he had made a total of five blocks, making a total of 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher excise duty when buying property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher state duty when buying property in the UK and the additional funds obtained will be used to help the homeless under the new "Tory" plan.
Such a move will counteract Corbin's efforts to attract new voters.
The increased excise duty will be applied to persons who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The Treasury predicts that up to 120 million pounds may be collected per year to be diverted for assistance to the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher excise duty when buying property in the United Kingdom and diverting the additional funds they have obtained to help homeless people, it will today notify Theresa May.
Such a move is seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract new voters with promises of providing housing at more affordable prices and addressing the wealthiest part of society.
Increased excise duties will be imposed on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the money raised in addition to the government's efforts to combat the problem of homelessness.
The premium included in the current state fee, including the introduction two years ago of a higher level fee for the purchase and lease of a second home, could be as high as three percent.
The Treasury expects such a move to add up to GBP 120 million a year to its budget.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the newly built properties in London are purchased by non-residents, thereby striking prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to get their home.
Many areas of the wealthy country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy was introduced just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in state duty so that more young people could afford to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by grabbing land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to give up quotas on affordable housing to address Britain's housing problem.
Mr. Corbin has proposed a series of attractive housing reforms, including reforms on the control of rent and eviction from housing for no reason.
He also wants to give councils more power to build new housing.
Ms May said, "I mentioned last year that I would use my position as Prime Minister to renew Britain's dream of having a better quality of life for every young generation.
And that means getting our damaged housing market right.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and organise their lives.
It is not right, however, that housing can be bought with equal ease both by foreign companies and persons who do not live in the United Kingdom and by their hard-working British citizens.
For many, the dream of having their own home has become too distant, and the harsh problem of the homeless is still relevant."
Jack Ross: "My biggest goal is to run 'Scotland'
Jack Ross, the manager of Sunderland, claims that his biggest goal is to become the manager of Scotland at some point.
Scott, 42, has accepted the challenge to rebuild the Northeast Club, which currently ranks third in the first league with three points from the top.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after putting St Mirren back into the Scottish premier league last season.
"As a player I wanted to play for my country.
I won the B Cup and that was all," Ross told the Scottish BBC for Sportsound.
"But I grew up watching 'Scotland' games in Hampden Park with my father, and it's always called me back.
However, such an opportunity would only appear if I were successful in running the club."
Ross's predecessors in running the Sunderland club include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former chief of Alloa Athletic claims to have not felt troubled, following in the footsteps of such a large club's recognized managers, having previously rejected offers made by Barnsley and Ipswich.
“My success will be evaluated by whether I can return this club to the Premier League.
This is the first time in my life that I’ve seen it.
"Returning the club to the premier league will not be an easy task, but I will most likely believe that I have only succeeded here once this task has been accomplished."
Ross is only the third year in his managerial career, previously acting as deputy director at Dumbarton for a while and spending a 15-month period as a coach at Hearts.
He then helped the Alloa club recover from falling to the third level and helped St Mirren win the title in the same season.
Ross claims that he currently feels much more comfortable than during his player career at clubs Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It may have been a true crossroads," he recalls, taking responsibility for Alloa.
"I really believed that leadership was my real calling -- much more appropriate than playing.
It sounds strange, because I was successful, I could live from it and enjoy some heights.
Playing can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot of things every week.
I still feel it because of work-related stress and pressure, but management is my field.
I've always wanted to lead and now I'm doing it. I seem to be in the right place, I haven't felt so good all my life."

The survey found that the best time to enjoy a pint is at 5.30 p.m.
The heat wave of the summer has caused Britain's less popular pubs to strain, but it has increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The data gathered revealed that in July, pub and bar sales had increased by 2.7 percent, while in restaurants they had decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, who represents the business consulting agency CGA, which compiled the data, said, "Continuously sunny weather and England's protracted participation in the World Cup meant that there was a similar trend in July as in June, namely that pub profits had increased by 2.8 percent, while restaurants were experiencing a decline.
The restaurants, which fell 1.8 percent in June, experienced an even worse situation in July.
The situation in beverage pubs and bars was most grateful, as they experienced a much greater upturn than the restaurants experienced a downswing.
Food-based pubs also suffered from the sun, but not as dramatically as restaurant workers felt.
It seemed that people just wanted to go out for some drink.
In pubs and bars, the drink markup increased by 6.6 percent per month, while the food markup decreased by 3 percent."
RSM recreational and hospitality analyst Paul Newman said, "These results continue the trend observed at the end of April.
Weather conditions and the impact of large social or sporting events are the biggest factors determining sales outside the home market.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales compared to the same period of the previous year will be particularly painful in addition to the constant cost pressures.
For food providers, the long and hot summers could not come at an even more inopportune moment, and time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we usually experience in August will provide a much needed respite."
Total sales growth among pubs and restaurants, including start-ups, reached 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a decline in brand sales.
The 'Coffer Peach Tracker', which is the UK's sales supervisor for pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyses data from 47 business groups with a combined turnover of over GBP 9 billion, an industry benchmark.
Every fifth child has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents
The survey reveals that one in five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, have a secret social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in false Instagram pages.
This news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" account to show their parents.
Every fifth child, some of whom are only 11 years old, creates social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed that the number of fake profiles on Instagram is growing rapidly.
This news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "pure main" account to show their parents, and also private accounts.
A mother who stumbled upon the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenager who encouraged others to rape her.
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Leaders (HMC) revealed that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles, and only half of them admitted to maintaining private accounts.
HMC executive Mike Buchanan claimed, "It's scary that so many teenagers make online profiles where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilida Doyle will be the "lightweight voice" of the Scottish Athletics Board
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most awarded indoor and outdoor athlete, and President Ian Beattie described this step as a great opportunity for those driven by sport to take advantage of her vast international experience over the past decade.
"Eilida is given enormous respect throughout the Scottish, UK and worldwide athletic community and we are confident that Scottish athletics will gain an enormous amount by getting him on the board," Beatty said.
Doyle mentioned, "I want to act as a 'easy voice' and hope I can really get involved and help push this sport into Scotland."
An American who won the 200 metres and 400 metres event at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, thus winning a total of four Olympic gold medals, and is currently a regular BBC pandita, was unable to pass after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter, "On this day a month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors claimed that only time would tell if and to what extent I would recover.
It was a terrible job, but I completely recovered, repeatedly learned to walk and today I can already do agility training!
Thank you for inspiring words!”
It’s not just a matter of how much money you’ll have.
The breast pump company has taken a split view online in relation to advertising that compares nursing mothers to cow milking.
To mark the launch of the so-called "world's first silent wearable breast pump", consumer technology company Elvie released a sticky reed ad to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump gives breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a wall-stuffed cowshed at a song whose words sound like this, "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see any tail" and "if you hadn't noticed, these aren't udders, these are my breasts".
In the note continues, "Suck, suck, I feed the babies, suck, suck, I milk my ladies."
However, an advertisement posted on the company's Facebook page has caused widespread resonance online.
The video, watched 77,000 times and commented hundreds of times, has received divided reviews from viewers, with many claiming that it sheds light on the "horror" of the dairy industry.
"Very wrong decision to use cows for product advertising.
Just like us, they have to get tough and give birth to milk, but their babies are taken away from them a few days after they were born," one wrote.
"Elvie" breast pump inconspicuously fits breast-feeding women (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment states: "I understand it's traumatic for both mother and baby.
But why not use them to promote a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
There was also an opinion: "The creators of the advertisement did not know what they were doing."
Others defended the ad, and one woman admitted that she felt the song was "funny".
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would buy one if I were still breastfeeding.
Suctioning milk made me feel just like a cow.
The advertisement is a little crazy, but I understood its idea.
This is a great product," she wrote.
Another comment states: "It's a fun advertisement, meant for moms who milk (not at work places or toilets) and feel like a 'cow'.
It is not advertising that glorifies or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the ad, a group of women discover that they were all dancing with the inconspicuous pumps placed in their bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the observation that many women who shed milk claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires and tubes, and is inconspicuously included in the breastplate for breastfeeding women, allowing them to move freely, keep their babies and even participate in events outside the home.
Anna Balarin, Mother's partner and creative director, commented: "The Elvie Pump pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
Drawing off the parallel between the women who sweep away the milk and the dairy cows, we wanted to draw attention to the milk sweeping, while demonstrating in an entertaining and understandable way the stunning sense of freedom that the new pump will bring."
It is not the first time that the "Elvie pump" pump has come into the spotlight.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two appeared on the tongue at the show of Marta Jakubowski using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent town near the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has increased sharply, although the border is crossed by relatively as many people every month as before, and has been partly due to the harsh rhetoric and policies of the Trump administration that have made it difficult for children to be housed by sponsors.
Most of the sponsors have also been undocumented immigrants themselves, fearing that by openly applying to have a child, it would threaten their chance to stay in the country.
The risk increased in June, when federal officials announced that potential sponsors and other members of their household would be allowed to take fingerprints, and this data would also be passed on to other institutions concerned with immigration.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs law enforcement official, testified before the convention that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsors for unaccompanied minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested persons had not previously been punished.
"Nearly 80 percent of the individuals who are either sponsors or members of a sponsor household are staying here illegally, and a large proportion of these individuals are criminal aliens.
That is why we continue to persecute such individuals," Mr. Albens stated.
According to asylum officers, in an effort to speed up the handling of children's cases, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of being arrested rather than after 60 days, as the previous standard provided.
Many will use the option of a videoconferencing call instead of coming in person to defend their legal status before an immigration judge.
Persons deemed unfit for release will be quickly expelled.
The longer children are held in custody, the more likely they are to become restless or depressed, which can lead to violent attacks or attempted escapes, reported according to information and testimony from asylum workers retrieved from the system in recent months.
Advocates claimed that these concerns were exacerbated in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where signs that the child was suffering are more likely to be overlooked due to their breadth.
They added that moving children to a tent town without giving enough time for their emotional preparation or allowing them to say goodbye to friends could result in injuries that many are already struggling with.
Syria forces US, French and Turkish "armies of the occupiers" to withdraw their troops immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for Syrian refugees to return home, despite the country's ongoing war being the eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, claimed that foreign forces were in Syria illegally under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "it will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must resign immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been forced to leave their homes, "the war on terror is almost over".
He stated that Damascus would continue "to fight in the holy war until all Syrian territories are cleared", cleared of both terrorist groups and "any foreign military presences".
The United States has deployed about 2,000 troops in Syria, who primarily train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs, who are opponents of President Bashar Al-Assad.
France has sent over 1,000 men to this war-torn country.
Regarding the issue of refugees, Mualem stated that the conditions were excellent for them to return, and blamed "certain Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that caused the refugees not to want to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"These people politicize what should only be a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive aid to rebuild the country before an end to the war is agreed between Assad and the opposition.
UN diplomats explain that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone on the last rebel support in Idlib has created an opportunity to hasten political talks.
The Russia-Turkey agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, which is home to three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement "has set deadlines", and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including fighters from al-Qaeda-linked group "Jabhat al Nusrah" who "will be destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the new committees, which will include representatives of the government and the opposition, the first meetings to draft the Syrian constitution for the post-war period and pave the way for elections.
Moualem placed conditions on the Syrian state's participation in the committee, stressing that the group's work should be limited to "revision of articles of the existing constitution", and warned of interference.
Why Trump will be elected for a second term
From this point of view, Mr. Trump will be re-elected in the 2020 election unless, and probably hoped for by, many liberal onlookers, impeachment and scandal will not prematurely put an end to his presidency.
And in that case, "this will be the most dramatic Presidency final ever!"
At the moment, there is no indication of a slackening of the watcher.
As of 2014, ratings in the most favorable CNN broadcast have more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million viewers, while on MSNBC they have almost tripled, reaching 1.6 million viewers.
Fox News is watching 2.4 million viewers at the most favourable time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, while MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" (Reichel's Medow show) is at its highest place in the cable rating with 3.5 million key news viewers in the evening.
"It's a fire that attracts a lot of people because it's a thing we don't understand," explained Neal Baer, the backing of the ABC drama Designated Survivor. This drama tells the story of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.

She wanted to know why.
"He replied, 'Because he's making me laugh,'" Ms. Skowell told me.
Chaos is to some extent entertaining.
Of course, unlike anything else seen on TV, news from Washington could determine what will happen to the verdict in the Rou v. Wade case, whether immigrant families will be able to unite, and the state of the global economy.

When I got to Mr. Fleiss that week, the time for Kauai on the north coast (Kauai) was sunny, 80 degrees (-27 Celsius), but he was sitting in rooms where he watched the MSNBC broadcast without looking down, recording at the same time on CNN.
He was not able to break down, not when Brett Kavanaugh was due to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee and his future in the Supreme Court threatens to round up.
"I remember the times when we made all those crazy shows and when people claimed 'this is the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I think it's such a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional electoral district aspires to receive money through the transformation of Congressional districts, which will result in two incumbent members fighting for one seat.
This recently modified district of the outskirts of Pittsburgh is linked to Democrat Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in a special election last spring in another district.
Lamb will fight another incumbent MP, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th District of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps the new 17th District.
After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old counties had been unconstitutionally divided in favor of Republicans, the maps were revised.
Competition in the new 17th district has caused a battle between the main financial groups of the parties: the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee and the National Republican Campaign Committee.
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania when he won the widely watched March election at Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional Precinct with a small margin.
The seat had been held by Republicans for over 10 years, and President Donald Trump won by 20 points in that district.
Political experts are predicting a slight predominance for Democrats.
The U.S. considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but then changed its mind
Diplomats recognized that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing without much pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and stayed at the hotel in Panama until partners put out the door Trump organization's management team.
State Department officials decided to withdraw the heads of United States diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama, basing it on "the recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan", its department's spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
However, only El Salvador, which received about 140 million in 2017 from America, was considered for the penalties, including drug control, development, and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which would include a reduction in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for a Central American country where unemployment and homicide rates have reached their highest levels.
During the course of the internal meetings, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, which would have followed a similar meeting last year, which was recognized as a rapprochement effort to prevent migrants from moving to the US.
In mid-September, senior officials in the country made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, essentially ending their consideration of punishing El Salvador completely.
Diplomats informed that Vice President Mike Pence has now decided to attend a conference scheduled for mid-October to show how seriously the administration is emphasizing the meeting.
And three American ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic with no new and serious announcements or punishments on the part of Washington.
The White House spokesman, who spoke on Mr Bolton's behalf, did not want to give more details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to consult in internal negotiations if their anonymity was maintained.
Their story was confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on the condition that his anonymity would be maintained.
History research
A second stone in the garden could be a report by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller that Mr Trump may have obstructed justice, which has a great deal of evidence at the disposal of the public.
Mr. Miller is also said to be investigating whether the Trump campaign has secretly cooperated with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the other party prevails in Congress, Trump will have to respond to the body and possibly his fellow jury just as he is about to meet the voters again.
There is a lot of "but" and I'm not claiming that Trump's fall is inevitable or that it will happen to his fellow Europeans.
There are choices that we will all have to make on both sides of the Atlantic, and these choices will show the duration of the fight.
In 1938, German officers were ready to make a coup against Hitler, if only the West had opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and missed the chance to escape the years-long carnage.
History revolves around such turning points, and the unstoppable march of democracy is accelerated or inhibited.
Americans now have to face several such turning points.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Miller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been having a hard time since it was reported that last year he proposed secretly recording a conversation with the president and wondered about his unsuitability for the position.
Mr. Rosenstein states that the story of The Times is not accurate.
"How do we respond if the FBI investigation that has just been requested about Brett Caveno is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed as a Supreme Court judge despite his unfair testimony and credible allegations of sexual assault?
And most importantly, are we going to vote in the interim elections of Congress that will call Trump to account?
If we do not pass all these tests, democracy will have a long winter.
However, I believe that we will succeed in everything by referring to what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was sent to Auschwitz by the exact same Nazi regime that once lived in my embassy home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light Sabbath candles on the table with swastika.

"We can be happy about this because Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old footballer said.
"We went into the game believing we would be able to make good progress, and got that point.
Perhaps we could have defeated them in the end, but overall, the draw is an honest result.
They may have been better in the first half, but we loosed in the second half and were the better team.
And on Thursday there will be another important night for Europe.
I hope that we will get three points, but it will not be an easy game, because they got a good result in the previous game, but I am sure that with the help of our supporters we will be able to continue to fight and get good results.
The last year with all my injuries and changes in the club itself was clearly heavy, but now there are new breezes that I feel good about.
The team is great, and the guys enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope we can continue the fight, leave last season behind and succeed."
Women cannot sleep because they are worried about their pension savings
Although the survey participants clearly knew what care they wanted, few had discussed the matter with family members.
About half of the individuals indicated in a nationwide study that they did not talk to a spouse about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want to be cared for by family members, but do nothing to pronounce it," reveals Holly Snyder, vice president of the National Life Insurance Agency.
Here's where you should start.
Talk to your spouse and your children. You can not prepare your family for the fact that you will need care if you do not make your wishes known well in advance.
Collaborate with your counselor and family to talk about where and how to get care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial advisor. Your consultant can also help you figure out how to cover these costs.
Your options for long-term care funding may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid insurance policy with a sum of money to cover these costs, or insurance through your assets, the main thing being that you have money.
Develop your legal documents. Prevent legal battles before they even begin.
Talk to a health trustee so you can have a trustworthy person to monitor your health care and ensure that specialists act according to your wishes if you are unable to express them on your own.
Also consider the possibility of granting a power of attorney for finances.
Choose a trustworthy person for making financial decisions on your behalf who will take care of paying your bills if you are unable to do so on your own.
And do not forget the seemingly small details! Imagine that one of your elderly parents is taken to the hospital for emergency care.

A man shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
The man received several shots with an air rifle, going home at night.
The 40-year-old victim was in Ilfracombe's Oxford Grove, Devon when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and palm.
Police described the shooting at around 2:30 a.m. BST as "accidental".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries do not threaten his life, and police are calling for witnesses to be applied for.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to the government, a massive earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday has killed at least 384 people. The death toll is expected to increase.
Because of destroyed communications, rescuers have been unable to obtain any information from the Dongala (Donggala) area, which is north of Palu and is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
Over 16,000 people in Palu were evacuated after the devastating natural disaster.
Here are the basic information about Pala and Dongala, located on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island. It is estimated that in 2017 it had a population of 379,800 people.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami.
Dongala is an area extending for about 300 km (180 miles) along the northwestern coast of Sulawesi Island.
It is estimated that there were 299,200 people living in the area, which is an administrative region within the province, in 2017.
Fisheries and farming are a pillar of the economy of the Central Sulawesi Province, especially in the coastal area of Dongala.
Nickel mining also plays an important role in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite bank of Sulawesi.
According to the Disaster Prevention Agency of Indonesia, Palu and Dongala have suffered several tsunamis over the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongala.
The tsunami also hurled over western Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is in the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire, in which earthquakes regularly form.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A severe earthquake on the west coast of Aceh, northern Sumatra's Aceh province, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries on December 26, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of which were in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nia, Nia off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake erupted in the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake erupted near the city of Padang, the capital of the Western Sumatra province.
Over 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands off the coast of Sumatra, causing tsunami waves up to 10 meters high that devastated dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: An earthquake close to the earth's surface struck the Pidie Jaya area of Aceh, causing havoc and panic as it recalled the destruction brought with it by the devastating 2004 earthquakes and tsunamis.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapsing buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes struck the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing over 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and temporarily prevented hundreds of tourists from returning home.
Sarah Peillin's eldest son arrested after being accused of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Peillin, has been arrested as he is charged with assault.
According to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, 29-year-old Peylin, who lives in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and resisting arrest.
According to a police report, when an acquaintance-woman tried to call the police to report the crimes she claimed had occurred, he took her away from her phone.
Peylin has been detained at Mat-Su's pre-trial detention facility, and he has been charged with a US$500 bail, reports KTUU.
He stood before the court on Saturday, where, asked about whether he found himself guilty, he stated that he was "definitely not guilty".
Peylin has been charged with three Class A offences, for which he may face a year's imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with Class B misconduct, for which he can receive a day-long prison sentence and a US$2,000 fine.
It is not the first time that Peylin has been charged with criminal offences.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Peylin.
His mother, Sarah Peelin, called the police and reported that an attack had taken place.
This case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, delaying the report on domestic violence and carrying a weapon in a state of intoxication in connection with this incident.
His girlfriend claims he punched it with his fist on his face.
In 2016, veteran groups expressed criticism of Sarah Peilin for linking her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder while returning from service in Iraq.
Earthquake-induced tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and has devastated thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been damaged and the number of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake erupted near central Sulawesi, southeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
In social networks, videos are spread that show the moment of collision.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu when a tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors want to demand the rare use of the death penalty for a person suspected of a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors want to demand the execution of Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected of a terrorist attack in New York City when eight people were killed. This is a rare form of punishment that has not been carried out in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
As alleged, 30-year-old Saipov used a Home Depot rental car to make an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October, where he hit pedestrians and a cyclist on his way.
To justify the execution, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused a serious injury, as stated in the statement of intent to demand the death penalty filed in the Southern District Court of New York.
According to the court document, both of these charges may result in the death penalty.
Within weeks of the attack, a federal grand jury accepted an indictment of Saipov's prosecution on 22 charges, which included eight counts of manslaughter for extortion purposes, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as an indictment for cruelty and damage to motorized vehicles.
The attack required "considerable planning and prior intent", explained prosecutors, citing that the attack carried out by Saipov was "sharp, cruel and inhuman".
"Saifullo Habibullaevic Saipov injured, harmed, and caused damage to the families and friends of these people: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Erlejo Cleves, written for the people: Diego Enrique Angelini, Alejandro Menendez, and Alejandro Menendez.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since prosecutors at the Southern District Court in New York City have carried out an indictment in a case that can result in the death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was tried for the murder of two drug suppliers, but he was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in 2009.
The death penalty was last executed in New York City in a federal case in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were sentenced to death after being accused of participating in espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
A pair of Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, as the days and months went by, Uzbekistan-born Saipov showed no remorse for the attack.
It’s not just a matter of how much money you’ll have.
According to the indictment, Saipov told officials that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching a video of ISIS on his phone.
Police informed that he had also asked for permission to post the ISIS flag in his chamber.
He has rejected 22 charges of writ.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders who represents Saipov, said he was "quite naturally dissatisfied" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the intention to demand the death penalty instead of accepting the admission of guilt in exchange for life imprisonment without the right to release will only prolong the injury caused by what is happening to all parties involved," Patton explained.
Saipov's defense team has previously called on prosecutors not to demand the granting of the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Brexit talks should be led by NAIGEL PRAGUE
Nigel Farage promised at a protest today at a Conservative conference to "mobilize the people's army".
The former leader of the British Independent Party stated that politicians should feel the wrath of the Eurosceptics when one of Theresa May's MPs suggested that negotiations with the EU should be entrusted to him.
Conservative lineman Peter Bone told the march in Birmingham that Britain would have withdrawn long ago had Mr. Farage been Brexit minister.
However, the challenge that will have to be faced by Mrs May in trying to rally her party of contradictions was demonstrated by the Conservatives, who are in favour of staying in the EU and joining a separate city-based protest against Brexit.
The Prime Minister is fighting to maintain her compromise plan on future British-European Union relations (Chequers compromise), and is facing attacks from those who want to leave the EU, from those who want to stay in the EU and also from the EU itself.
The Allies insisted that she would make a determined effort to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and would force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her bid and the Chaos.
Mr. Bowne stated in a "Leave Means Leave" (Withdrawal means withdrawal) rally in Solihull that he wanted to throw out May's plan in the dungeon (to chuck Chequers).
He proposed making Mr. Farage an ally and entrusting him with negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been at the point, we would have already dropped out," Boun stated.
A Member of Parliament from Wellingborough added, "I will support Brexit, but we have to throw away the Mantle May's plan!"
In support of his opposition to the EU, he said, "We didn't fight to have the servants!
We want to pass our laws in our country!"
Mr. Bowne ignored the assumptions that public opinion may have changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is absolutely false."
Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the march, and told reporters, "I just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is not popular with the public, the opposition won't vote for it, it's not popular with our party and our supporters who actually do all the work and elect us.
Please give up the Chequers and start listening."
In a message directed to May, she added, "The prime ministers remain in place as they fulfill their promises."
Mr Farage said politicians at the rally should be under pressure if they are to override the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's a matter of trust between us -- people -- and our politicians," he said.
"They're trying to pass Brexit and we're here today to tell them we won't let them do it."
In his message to an enthusiastic crowd, he fulfils: 'I want you to allow our politicians who are planning to hand Brexit to feel the pressure.
"We will appeal to the people of this country, who allowed us to win the battle for Brexit, and never relax until we have an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the Stayers marched through Birmingham before a two-hour long rally took place in the city centre.
Ignoring activists greeted the Conservatives with anti-Brexit banners after the group met this weekend.
Workers' Party spokesman Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over the security issues they experienced with the party's app early in the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they are able to maintain the order of the IT system and all their technology for Canada and yet, and yet, for an undivided border, for free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
"It's an absolute farce.
There is no such thing as a successful Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to carefully consider running for U.S. president
Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "carefully ponder" her candidacy in the U.S. presidential election following the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at West Massachusett City Hall.
Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, participates in the re-election in November and stands against GOP state Republican Geoff Dial, who was Trump's vice chairman of the 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
It is speculated that it is she who will be the main one who will dare to stand against Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event at Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters using city hall since Trump took office.
One visitor asked her if she planned to stand for the presidential election.
To which Warren replied that it was the right time for there to be women in "Washington that will 'repair' the imperfect government, which also means woman-president."
It’s not just a matter of how much money you’ll have.
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that a person had been arrested on suspicion of the case of LSU basketball player Wade Sims, who was shot on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Station announced that Daiteon Simpson, 20 years old, was detained at 11 a.m. ET press conference.
On Friday, they broadcast a video of the shooting, calling for assistance in recognizing the man seen in the video.
Sim (20) shot and killed near a Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Type Sim was shot in the head, resulting in the immediate death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, per 247 Sports.
Wade pitched to defend his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to being at the scene of the accident, with a gun, and also admitted to having shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and is in the East Baton Rouge Village police station.
A 6 foot 6 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, scoring 5.6 points and winning 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after team allows him to beat Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Walter Bothas qualified on Saturday before Lewis Hamilton became clear that Mercedes' teamwork would play an important role in the race.
From the start, Botas started well and almost left Hamilton dry, defending his place in the first two runs and called for Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first entered the garage and left Hamilton in the engines to deal with the others, this was most likely the decisive one.
The Mercedes pilot refueled a lap later and fell behind Vettel, but Hamilton continued to advance in the lead after a force tally that saw the Ferrari driver persistently leave the inside free, risking to fall behind a double manoeuvring to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and was seventh on his 21st birthday at the end of the first lap.
He then led a large portion of the race as he focused the tyres to quickly reach the finish and overtake Kimi Raikonen in fourth.
He eventually came to the garage on lap 44, but was unable to increase the speed on the remaining eight laps, as Raikonen remained fourth.
This is a hard day because Valteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a true gentleman.
The team did an extremely important job to get one two," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diana Feinstein at Saturday's rally for her persistence in withholding a letter from Christine Bleisey Ford, in which she accuses Supreme Court candidate Brett Caveno of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the President did not directly talk about Ford's testimony it gave to the Senate legal commission, but made the comment that what happened in the Senate shows that people there are "evil, nasty and unreliable."
"One thing that can happen and something beautiful that is already happening in recent days in the Senate when there is anger when you see angry, evil, nasty and unreliable people," he said.
"When you read press releases and leaked information and then they say, 'Oh, no, I didn't.
I didn't."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak the information?
Remember her answer to the question...did you leak the document? – "Oh, what did I do?"
Oh, no.
I didn't."
Okay, wait a minute.
Did we do it...No, we didn't," he added, in Senator's intonation.
Feinstein was sent a letter in July explaining in detail what Forda was accusing Caveno of, and the contents of the letter were divulged in early September, but Feinstein denies that this had happened in her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I 'did not leak' her story," Feinstein told the commission, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I did."
But her denial displeased the President, who commented on the situation at Saturday evening's rally as follows: "I'll tell you that it was very bad body language.
She probably didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate, who is accused by three women of sexual harassment, the president suggested that Democrats use the accusations for their own benefit.
"They are determined to regain power by any means."
Do you see the evil, the insidiousness, they don't care what they hurt, what they have to destroy in order to gain power and control," says Mediate, according to the president.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5:3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer threw two goals for the Giants in a good game against Dundee
The Dundee Stars played off for the loss suffered in the Elite League on Friday against the Belfast Giants winning Saturday's answering game with 5:3 Dundee.
The Giants got an early lead when Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bovillier scored the goal.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowney led up the homers before Dwyer restored the Giants lead.
Francoise Buchard equalised the score for Dundee before two words scored by Lucas Lundwald Nealen secured the team's victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League this season for the Adam Keefes guys who won "Dundee" by 2 to 1 on Friday night.
It was the fourth team meeting this season in which the Giants had won the previous three games.
Dwyer opened the game's lead in the fourth minute, 3:35 receiving a pass from Kendall McFaul, with David Rutherford assisting Bovilier doubled the score four minutes later.
After a tense start to the game, Sullivan entered the homers in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt passed Cowney to score and level the score at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants regained the lead at the first opportunity when he scored his second goal of tonight's game at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Buhard again achieved a levelling score with a power-taking goal in the games at 27:37 a minute.
Cowney and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Neilsen put the Dundee in the lead for the first time during that game during the late part of the second period, and he also scored convincingly in the last period to take his team to victory.
It’s a great way to get to know people and make them feel good about themselves.
Air traffic controller dies allowing hundreds of people on board to be rescued during an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is lauded as a hero after he sacrificed himself for a plane with hundreds of passengers to take off safely from land.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a powerful earthquake rocked Sulawesi Island on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue in the area and many are trapped in mud in the town of Palu.
However, despite his colleagues saving their lives, 21-year-old Antonijus Ganavan Agung refused to leave his workplace at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport's Palu airport control tower, which rocked strongly.
He stayed at his post to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321 on board, which was on the runway at the time, would take off safely in the air.
He then jumped off the traffic control tower, thinking it might collapse.
He later died in hospital.
Indonesia's air navigation spokesman, Johannes Sirait, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC news reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Pala.
"We are very sad to hear that," he said.
Meanwhile, national authorities are concerned that the death toll could reach thousands, the national disaster prevention agency says access to Dongala, Sigi and Butangao (Boutong) is limited.
"It is believed that the beautiful will grow because many more people's bodies are under the rubble, as well as many are not able to access it," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves reaching 6 meters in height devastated Palu, at which time there will be a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft continue to deliver aid and necessary goods.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News, "Every minute, the ambulance brings in new victims.
Clean water is a deficit.
Small shops are crowded everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN, "Indonesia's Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don't know what we're going to find there.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can all get worse."
On Sunday, Indonesia's President Joko Widodo came to Palu and told the country's military bringt, "I ask you to work day and night to accomplish all tasks relating to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was rocked as early as this year by earthquakes in Lombok, in which over 550 people died.
The plane disaster in Micronesia: Now 'Air Niugini' says one of the people has disappeared after the plane disaster in the lagoon
The airline made a flight during which the plane fell into the Pacific lagoon of Micronesia and now claims that one of the people was missing, although previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were evacuated safely from the sinking plane.
The airline "Air Niugini" announced in a press release on Saturday afternoon that they could not answer for one of the passengers, a man.
The airline announced it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the missing man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further information on the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Locals with boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane fell into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said seven people were hospitalized on Friday.
The airline announced that six people remained in the hospital until Saturday, all of them in stable condition.
The causes of the accident and the sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. navy report that the plane fell into the lagoon shortly after takeoff from the runway.
Some eyewitnesses thought they overestimated the length of the runway on the plane.
Bill Janes, an American passenger, said the plane was very low.
"It was really very good," Janes said.
Janes says that he and other passengers were also able to get out of the sinking plane using emergency exits, as the water was just up to the waist.
He said the stewards panicked and screamed as well that he had a mild head injury.
U.S. naval sailors who worked nearby to improve the ship's berth also assisted in rescue efforts using an inflatable boat to bring people ashore before the plane sank about 30 metres (100 ft) underwater.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicate that 111 people have died in airlines registered by PNG over the past twenty years, none related to "Air Niugini".
A psychoanalytic commentator explains the course of events at night, in which a woman was burned alive
The indictment on Saturday provided evidence in a retrial where a man is accused of burning a living woman in 2014.
U.S. Department of Forensic Expertise psychoanalysis commentator Paul Rovlet testified for several hours as a witness expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He outlined to the jurors how he used the information obtained from the phone to put together how 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers acted the night she died.
Rovlet said he received location data from several phones, suggesting that Tellis was with Chambers on the evening of her death, challenging his previous testimony, reported "The Clarion Ledger".
When the data showed that his phone was at Chambers while he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford testified in a courtroom on Saturday that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecution asked if Tellis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my car was in Nashville."
Another mismatch was that Tellis said he knew Chambers only about two weeks ago when she died.
Phone records show that they only knew each other for a week.
Rovlet said that just after Chambers' death, Telis deleted text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone from Chambers.
"He erased her from his life," said Hale.
It is expected that the defenses will deliver their closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
Group "The High Breed": What is conscious hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative views of this genre of music by giving a positive message with their music.
"The High Breed", from Bristol, claims that hip-hop deviated from its beginnings about messages of a political nature and such when dealing with problems of a social nature.
The band wants to return to genre roots and make conscious hip-hop again popular.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have experienced a recent revival in the UK with artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Black again?!
In New York City, the nanny sued over the dismissal after receiving "racist" news
In New York City, the nanny has sued someone for discriminatory dismissal after she received a mistakenly sent text from her mother, who complained that the nanny "is black again."
The pair deny that they were racist, equating the lawsuit to "extortion."
Lindsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed her dismissive attitude on learning that the new caregiver, Giselle Mauris, was black when she arrived at work the first day in 2016.
"NOTHOUT BLACK,"Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, she sent a message not to her husband, but to Maurice, twice.
Realizing her awkwardness, the "stunned" Plasco-Flacsman discounted Maurise, stating that their previous nanny, who was African-American, did a bad job and that she was said to have been waiting for a Filipino, referring to the New York Post.
Mauris was paid for her one work day and sent home with Uber.
Now Maureen is suing for compensation and wants $350 a day for six months of secured living work she initially applied for, plus no contract of employment.
"I want to show them that such things don't," she said "Post" on Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The pair dismiss the accusations that they were racist, arguing that the cessation of Mauries' employment was a reasonable decision because they feared that they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
"My wife sent her what she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco, husband, said "Post."
"But, would you entrust your children to someone you treated rudely, even if it only happened by mistake?
Your newborn?
Think about it."
Aligning the hearing to "extortion", Plasco said that his wife had given birth to the baby only two months ago and was in a very "difficult situation".
"You're really targeting someone this way?
This is unacceptable," the investment banker added.
While litigation is still going on, public opinions quickly judge across social networks, derogating them for their behavior and logical thinking.
A new letter reveals that the publishers of Paddington's book were concerned that readers would be unable to associate with a talking bear
Bond's daughter Karen Jenkel, who was born shortly before the book was approved, said of the letter, "It's hard to 'put yourself in someone's shoes' who reads the book the first time before it's published.
It is very surprising to learn now what we know about Paddington's great success."
Telling her father, who worked as an operator for the BBC before feeling inspired to write a book for children about a small teddy bear, was optimistic that his work would be rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "sweetly bitter" after his father passed away last year.
Speaking of Paddington, who she calls a "very important member of the family", her father was quietly proud of her eventual success.
"He was a quiet, quiet man and was not boastful," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was like if you have a child who achieves something: you're proud even if you haven't done it yourself.
I think he viewed Paddington's success in a similar way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always gave all merit to Paddington himself."
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter by phone
After landing her daughter with the fasts was taken to the hospital in Nice Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors constantly fought for her life.
"Ned called regularly and said she was very bad and expected to survive," said Ednan-Laperousa.
"Then I got a call from Ned saying she would die in the next two minutes and I have to say goodbye to her.
And that's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors gave her to maintain her heart rate slowly ceased and left her body.
She would have died even sooner and it all ended now.
I had to sit and wait knowing this was all happening.
I could not howl or scream because I was in a situation where there are families and people around.
I needed a lot of strength to restrain myself."
After all, then, in the mourning of her daughter's loss, Ednan-Laperuz got on a plane with other passengers who had no idea what she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I stabbed my head down and tears ran all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt deep sympathy for Ned.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
I am not sure if I will be able to do this in the future.
Two women, whose loved ones have committed suicide, act to help others not to take their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey strengthen the cards at Welsh Bridge with an inspiring message and phone numbers for people to call and get support.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, but he committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to have to experience what I do every day," she said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with an addictive smile.
"Everyone recognized him by his smile.
Everyone always said that his smile "lit" always and everywhere."
However, he gave up his job before he died because he was "in a very, very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, was the one who found him after Tyler had committed suicide.
Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that it will have consequences."
Davis made cards "to let you know that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
You don't have to sit in silence -- you have to speak."
Humphrey, who has been Davis' friend for years, lost his spouse for 15 years, shortly after his mom's death.
"He didn't say he would feel sad or be depressed or anything quotes would feel," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that his attitude had changed.
He reached his lowest point on Christmas morning -- when the children opened the gifts he did not make eye contact with them or anything like that."
His death was a major trauma to the children, but they have to deal with it: "It disintegrates the whole family.
That's what distinguishes us.
But we must all continue and fight."

Brett Caveno's future hangs in the air as FBI launches investigation
"I think if we could really get what he's asking for -- in a time- and volume-limited investigation -- we could possibly reach a little consensus," Fleick said on Saturday, adding that he is concerned that the commission is "sharing" between the dug-up of fortified guerrillas.
Why don't Kaveno and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their abstention is just a coincidence.
Mid-elections are in five weeks, on November 6 – if Republicans are expected to go badly, then their attempts will be far weaker to elect a man from among themselves to the high court.
George W. Bush calls on the Senators, lobbying to support them Caveno, who worked at the White House during Bush and thanks to him met his wife Ashley, who was President Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where currently 51 seats belong to the Republicans, and 49 to Democrats.
It is still unclear if Caveno can get at least 50 votes in the Senate that would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to settle the vote and confirm him in the Supreme Court.
It’s time to get back to the basics.
The number of North Korean political asylum seekers in South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong came to power seven years ago, the South Korean legislature said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea's unification ministry, said there were 1,127 political asylum seekers last year, compared to 2011, when they numbered 2,706.
Park said tighter border controls star North Korea and China and high rates of people smugglers are key factors.
Pyongyang has made no public comments.
The vast majority of political asylum seekers from North Korea are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says over 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most go through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarization Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers political asylum seekers to be illegal immigrants and deports them forcibly.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders from both countries met in Pyongyang to discuss delayed denuclearization talks.
This was after a historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Yong-gun in Singapore, when, in large trains, they agreed to cooperate to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions since these talks were not progressing.
"If there is no confidence in the U.S., there will be no faith in our national security, and under such circumstances we will in no way unilaterally disarm the first ones," Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York."
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Caveno "hysterical" and claims he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Chamber minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Caveno "hysterical" and claimed that he was unfit to serve in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made comments in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas on Saturday.
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman behaved like this, they would call her "hysterical," said Pelosi about her reaction to the testimony given by Kaveno to the Senate Litigation Committee on Thursday.
Caveno emotionally denied accusations of sexual harassment to Dr. Christina Blazey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening argument, Caveno was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and laughing, talking about his family and his high school years.
He, in particular, denounced the Democrats in the commission, calling the accusations against him "grotesque and coherent destruction of character" being orchestrated by the Liberals, who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that she believed Kaveno's testimony was a justification that he could not work for the Supreme Court because it shows he had a bilateral attitude towards the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with such allegations and the attitude with which he is addressing Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi objected when asked if she would try to question Caveno if she was confirmed and if Democrats won a majority in the House of Commons.
"I'm going to say that if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not suitable for a position not only in the Supreme Court, but also to work in an existing workplace in the court," Pelosi said.
Caveno, at present, is a judge on the Washington County Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added saying that as a Democrat he was worried about the possibility of Caveno making decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation talks, Kaveno bypassed questions about whether he would reject the Supreme Court's decisions.
"It's not a good time to have a hysterical and double-faced person working in court, but we'd be happy to say, 'Isn't that wonderful?'," Pelosi said.
But women have to hold themselves in their hands.
It's denunciation, for months and years everything has accumulated "over the edges", but she's not allowed to get it all out of her crying.
"We cry when we are angry," Ms. Steinem told me after 45 years.
"I don't think it's something unusual, what do you think?"
She continued, "Once I was very helped by a woman who was herself a manager in a company, who said that she too cried when she was angry, but made up the technique -- when she got angry and started crying, she told the person she was talking to, "You can think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she kept going.
And I thought it was great."
Tears as a form of discharge of anger are only partially recognized because they are misunderstood fundamentally.
One of my most vivid memories is from the earliest work, which had a distinct proportion of men, when I once cried because of an undisclosed rage, when an older woman grabbed me behind the withers, a restrained leader (a woman) from whom I was always a little afraid, who dragged me to the stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry!" she told me.
"They don't know you're overcharged.
They think you're upset and they're just gonna be happy they managed to "throw you under the skin."
Patricia Schroeder, then a U.S. Democrat congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his pre-election campaign for president.
In 1987, when Hart, caught out of wedlock, left the ship, also called a "muddy making" and withdrew from the election, Schroeder, deeply disappointed, considered that there was no reason why she could not stand for president.
"It wasn't a well thought-out decision," she said with laughter to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the election and the last one they wanted another one to turn up.
There were those who called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Late in the campaign, she fell behind in fundraising and promised she would not participate in the election unless $2 million was raised.
It was a lost battle.
She revealed that many of her supporters, who donated $1,000 to male representatives, only donated $250 to her.
"Do they believe I get discounts?" she wondered.
When she stated in her speech that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was very emotional – grateful to those people who supported her, disappointed in the system, which made it very difficult to raise money and address voters instead of delegates, and angry at sexism – in which she was "suffered".
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalled how the press reacted to him.
"You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor."
I remember wondering what they would write on my tombstone.
"She was crying."
Why the US-China trade war can be beneficial to Beijing
The main pretexts of how the trade war between the US and China began are hidden and while the battle does not see the end, disagreements between countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, say experts.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year, taxing key Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel, and aluminum.
The most significant escalation began this week with new rates impacting units worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds) immediately taxing half of the goods exported to the United States from China.
Beijing also "kindly" answers every time, the latest being five to ten percent rates on $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has stated that it undertakes to respond to the US one-on-one and it is doubtful that in the near future, the world's second largest economy could be mined.
To Washington's resignation would have to agree to certain requirements, but to publicly bow out to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Xi Jinping.
But experts say if Beijing plays out its cards correctly, the pressure of the US trade war can have a positive effect on China in the long run, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a political decision taken quickly, either in Washington or Beijing, could create uncontrollable economic conditions in any of the countries that are really more dangerous than previously recognized by observers," said Abigail Grace, a New American Security researcher who focuses on Asia.
Syria is "ready" to receive refugees back, the foreign minister stated.
Syria claims to be ready for voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country, which has been at war for more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Almualem said that conditions in the country were improving.
"The situation on land is now much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists to their normal state.
There are all the conditions for refugees to voluntarily return to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and earning a living.
The UN assumes that 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the outbreak of the war in 2011.
Six million more people still live in the country and need humanitarian aid.
Almualem said the Syrian regime would accept aid to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that the state would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that helped sponsor the riots.
This is the first time I've heard of this book.
The European golf team won the 2018 Raider Cup, beating the United States team by a score of 16.5:10,5 at the "Le Golf National" outside of Paris, France.
The United States has lost in Europe six times in a row and has not won the Raiders Cup since 1993.
Europe regained the cup when the team led by random Danes, Thomas Bjorn, scored 14.5 points needed to beat the United States team.
US star Phil Mikelson, who was having a hard time going the entire tournament, hit his T-tree in the water at the PAR 3 16th hole, conceding a match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari played brilliantly in all of his stages, becoming one of the four players who ever managed to score a 5-0-0 score since 1979 when the tournament is played out according to the existing format.
The American Jordan Spite lost 5 to 4 sensationally to the European team, by rating, the lowest-grossing player Torbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's best player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 Ian Polter of England, for whom this was probably the last Raider Cup.
A veteran of the Eight Raiders Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the tournament's best ever player from Europe with 25.5 career points.
"Usually I don't cry, but today I can't bear tears."
This was a hard year.
I'm truly grateful to Thomas that he singled me out and believed me.
I'm very, very happy that we've regained the cup.
It's a team's merit and I'm glad I could help," Garcia commented emotionally after the victory of the European team.
He further gives the name to his compatriot John Ram, who won US golf legend Tyger Woods in a 2 to 1 singles game on Sunday.
"The pride I feel when I win Tyger Woods, I grew up following the course of this player," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all his four matches in France and currently has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Raiders Cup.
An unusual statistic for one of the best players ever to win 14 top-tier golf tournaments, being the second behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find their opportunities except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-profile golf the entire tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furick said after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of the guys, they fought.
There was a moment this morning when we were able to put a little pressure on the European team.
We fought.
With all due respect to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played a very good game.
We will restructure, I will work with the American PGA-US Raiders Cup Committee and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to tap your hats.
We were won."
The latest news about the red tide: Concentration decreases in Pinela (Pinella), Manatee (Manatee) and Sarasota (Sarasota)

The red tide has also been cleared in the Pasco area.
Medium concentrations in the Pinell area or its seacoast zone, low to high concentrations in the Hillsboro area seacoast zone, small to high concentrations in the Manatite area, small to high concentrations in the Sarasota area or its seacoast zone, small to medium concentrations in the Charlotte area, small to high concentrations in the Lee area or its seacoast zone, and low concentrations in the Collier area have been reported last week.
