28-year-old cook found dead in San Francisco supermarket
This week, a 28-year-old cook who has recently moved to San Francisco was found in the staircase of a supermarket.
But the victim's brother says he can't think of anyone who would want to hurt his brother by stating that, "His life finally began to improve."
The body, found at a Westfield supermarket on Wednesday, has been identified as 28-year-old Frank Galicia, a San Francisco resident, said a spokesman for the San Francisco Bureau of Forensic Medical Examination.
San Francisco police stated that his death was recognized as a murder and an investigation is currently underway.
The victim's brother Luis Galicia tells San Francisco station ABC KGO that Frank had previously worked as a cook in Boston, but six months ago he got his dream job at a restaurant called Sons & Daughters in San Francisco.
A spokesperson for the restaurant Sons & Daughters informs that the news of his death shocked and shocked them.
"We're a small team working as a cohesive family and we're going to miss him very much", a spokesman said.
At this difficult time, we're in thoughts with Frank's friends and family.
Luis Galicia tells us that Frank at first slept in hostels, but lately life has finally improved.
"He moved into a new apartment and met a girl", Louis tells the radio station KGO.
Luis Galicia claims he does not know who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He was a good man with a wide heart.
"He always pampered his family by preparing a delicious meal and preparing lunch", said Luis Galicia
He never wanted to get involved in disputes.
He was the brother who adapted to the others.
"Given everything that went wrong in the world, he was like a raw diamond that shone brightly every day", he says.
Anyone who has information about what happened is invited to call the SFPD Information Phone 415-575-4444.
It’s time to start thinking about the future.
Representatives of young doctors request their trade union to initiate protests in a dispute over the new contract.
The British Medical Association's (LMA) Young Physicians Committee (JAK) is preparing to request a council to support wider protests in early September.
It’s not just a matter of how much money you’re spending.
In July, young doctors and medical students rejected the contract offered by the AAL.
58% of all members who participated in the vote voted against the contract.
In a message posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, JAK council member Ellen McCourt states that the government continues to remain silent on the issue and therefore the contract offer has been rejected.
She said, "Considering this, as a result of the JAK vote, the contract offer has been rejected in its entirety and a decision has been made to request new formal negotiations to discuss the most important issues."
In response to the government's silence, JAK today formally requested a meeting with the MLA Council to authorize the development of new agreements, which would take effect in September.
As a result of the dispute, the young doctors participated in six strikes, including the first time in the history of the NHS that they stopped working.
Dr. Johan Malawana, the MLA's new doctors' representative, resigned following a vote rejecting the contract terms offered by the MLA, as recommended by the BMA.
Before meeting 54,000 new doctors and medical students, he had told BMA members that the offer was good and would be accepted.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt informed that the contract would be made with England's medics.
Russia and Turkey: An Alliance of Displaced?
A gesture that put an end to the crisis.
Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce the end of an eight-month-long war of names and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin greeted the leader of Turkey at the St. Petersburg Palace, he had the impression that this partnership was more necessary for Ankara.
However, the two shook hands.
Vladimir Putin's smile looked pretentious and did not cause warm emotions, even taking into account his habitual abstinence.
It’s also important to remember that you don’t have to be an expert in your field to make sure you’re getting the right amount of exercise.
I got a count.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only improve to the pre-crisis level, but would become even stronger.
The next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan was acting as if nothing had happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm evokes conflicting feelings.
But Putin's radiant coolness shows that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
The first thing he mentioned in his speech was the shooting down of a Russian plane on the Syrian border.
Back then, Moscow reacted harshly.
Putin accused Ankara of stabbing a dagger in Moscow's back.
The offense was even more painful, given that it came from a friend's side.
Restoring true trust will be very difficult, perhaps impossible.
Since November, however, Russia's public opinion has changed.
For several months, government-controlled television spread aggressive insults against Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks were to blame for everything.
The most serious were accusations that Erdogan's own family profited from the illegal oil trade with the Islamic State-controlled part of Syria.
He himself, of course, denied it.
But the main message of the St. Petersburg meeting is that the time has come to forget the past.
After all, this meeting was only held because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia could see this as a kind of victory.
Ankara's benefit from a peace settlement is obvious.
Firstly, Erdogan needs all possible friends after the failed coup last month in which he was tried to overthrow.
The countless terrorist attacks have also shaken his position.
There are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have caused heavy losses, especially the ban on charter flights, which usually provides an influx of several million Russian tourists to Turkish resorts every year.
The number of tourists decreased by almost 90%.
Russian tour operators and charter companies will also breathe a sigh of relief when scheduled flights are restored.
They hope for vacation fever in the Mediterranean at the end of the season.
This week, the country's TV expects the prices of fruit and vegetables to drop, as Turkish fruit and vegetables will be reintroduced.
As quoted by the local newspaper Vedemosti: "Tourists for them, tomatoes for us."
But the visit also had other political motives from the Moscow side.
Ankara is angry with the West for what they think is a weak reaction to the coup attempt.
We can also look at the frustration with prolonged EU accession negotiations and Putin's intervention, which is keen to take advantage of the situation that Turkey has become alienated from the West.
The Russian leader undoubtedly won additional points in Ankara's eyes, expressing support for its elected government after the coup attempt.
Note that Moscow understands this well, because the fear of regime change in the country itself is deeply entrenched.
The summit, which took place in this lavish seaside palace, gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present, as one analyst called it, the "excluded alliance", two countries that feel excluded from the West join forces.
However, despite the publicly demonstrated unity, there are still significant differences of opinion between the two countries.
The main disagreement concerns Syria, where Russia presents itself as a peacemaker, but in fact Russia and Turkey support the opposing parties.
After more than three hours of initial talks, not wanting to disclose, the two presidents stated in a press conference that they had not discussed the issue.
The President of Turkey purposefully avoided questions about the disagreements between the two countries, while President Putin wanted to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on how the two countries could find a common language on the Syrian issue.
However, after months of openly hostile relations and potential catastrophes, when a NATO member Turkey hit a Russian combat aircraft, the situation has improved, as both leaders have at least resumed negotiations.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland
What is the difference between a good and a bad credit score?
Outside Scotland, SKB will no longer be available.
Ross McEwan tells the BBC channel in Scotland that the SKB brand was associated with bank ambitions on a global scale.
It has given up these ambitions because eight years ago the bank almost went bankrupt and needed financial assistance.
Meanwhile, experts in branding strategy have used SKB brand to protect other consumer finance brands.
The bank received millions of pounds from international sports sponsors, ranging from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon Tennis Champion Andy Murray.
However, it has now been decided to bring other national brands to the fore.
Royal Banaka of Scotland will be available to Scottish customers, but will not be initialised.
In England and Wales, all SKB references, outside the head office and the official stock exchange listing, will be changed to the name NatWest.
The Ulster Bank is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Smaller private finance brands such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank will now also gain prominence.
McEwan was interviewed during a outing with customers and employees over Invernessshire.
He told the BBC Scotland channel, "The SKB will become a brand of our investors and with which our staff are working as we now become more of a brand bank."
In time, the bank itself became a global brand and SKB became a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have global ambitions, we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in their industry and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
SKB has already announced that it will not continue sponsorship of "Six Nations" and will involve various brands in sports sponsorship.
"It's time to become a brand bank, because we've been asking ourselves how to become a better bank for our customers for a long time," says the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had announced that we would become a great bank for our customers and develop these brands.
But with hard work and a focus on customer needs rather than our own, we have obviously made a big difference.
We can revive these brands again, so I think now is the time.
Frankie Detori wins 3000th in Newmarket with horse Predilection
The Detors uncorrode the champagne, winning their 3,000th win twice finishing first in the race at Newmarket.
On Friday, jockey Frankie Detori won his 3000th win in British history, winning first place in Newmarket.
He achieved this by winning a second victory in this race , held in his hometown, riding with Predilection, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey who has achieved such a result in horse sprint racing.
He has joined Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Pigott, Pete Edery, and Willie Carson.
The three-time champion jockey Detori, who previously won by horse Ghayyar, said, "It's something special."
I'm very moved because my family is here.
I'm very glad it happened in Newmarket, because I've been living here for 30 years.
This isn't a big race, this isn't Royal Ascot, but a regular Friday night with 20,000 people.
I feel relieved and very grateful.
After the victory, Detori and Predilection are greeted with applause and cheers.
Two jockeys have achieved this record in racing with obstacles - champion Richard Johnson and career-ending 20-time champion Sir Antony McCoy, who set several records in his career, winning over 4,300 victories.
Lester Piggott, a nine-time derby winner, has won 4,493 victories during his career.
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of our time and it is no surprise that he has achieved what few people can achieve.
He is stylish and strong, but his sense of tactics distinguishes him from other jockeys.
He is a fantastic racing representative, his enthusiasm and charisma for years attracts fans for this sport.
A few weeks ago at the Epsom race, I told Frankie that he would have won 6,000 victories if he didn't participate in just weekends and big races.
But to be serious, it's a real pleasure that Frankie has been regularly winning UK races for 30 years.
He is a jockey who is great at British racing, and he is also a great jockey.
Frank Detori noted this achievement with his trademark - the flying jump.
From finishing at wind speed to flying jump, Frankie Detori has been the face of British horse racing for twenty years.
This has been a journey full of adventure.
He has won countless major races, including the famous 1996 "Great Seventh" in Ascot, and in addition survived an airplane crash and disqualification for using preparations.
Three years ago he found it difficult to return after six months of disqualification, but he demonstrated his strength of character by challenging those who questioned him by returning to his best form.
And he could still participate in the race for a while - Detori has previously said that he would be happy to continue participating in the race until at least the age of 50.
Russian President Putin dismisses head of administration Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly sacked the head of the administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been in the circle of Putin's closest people for many years.
The 63-year-old politician has now been appointed Special Representative for Nature and Transport.
The Kremlin's statement said that Putin "decided to release Ivanov from his duties as the head of the Russian presidential administration", without giving any reason.
Anton Vaino, who had been his deputy since 2012, has been appointed to succeed Ivanov.
44-year-old Vaino is a former diplomat.
Vaino was born in 1972 in Tallinn, Estonia, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MVSAI) and later worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
It’s a great way to get to know each other.
After his appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
In my opinion, the main task of the administration is to support you in your work as the President of the country by drafting laws and controlling the enforcement of your decisions.
Putin told a Russian broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov himself wanted to leave office and recommended Vaino as his replacement.
Do smiles convince you?
This step confused Moscow.
Sergey Ivanov is an old and close ally of Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, he once worked for the Soviet security service in the KGB.
In this capacity, he was one of the most influential men in Russia.
In a sitting broadcast on state television, the two men announced that Ivanov was resigning on his own initiative.
But despite the smiles on the cameras, rarely does such an explanation convince, especially before the parliamentary elections.
Is it the outcome of a power struggle?
No one knows.
But the official claim that the man, who was considered a possible president, suddenly wanted to become the head of Russian environmental policy, is perceived with great scepticism.
In remarks published on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov says to Putin: "It is a fact that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to entrust me with this difficult position, one could even say, a problematic position, for four years.
It turns out that I have worked in this position for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He has previously served as Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former employee of the State Security Service of the KGB, as is Putin.
In the late 1990s, Putin led the Federal Security Service, which is the successor to the KGB, Ivanov held the position of his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusts most.
At the end of Putin's second term, Ivanov was considered a potential candidate for President of Russia, as Putin's re-election to a third term would be unconstitutional.
But then another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev, became president.
Putin became prime minister, and returned to the position of president three and a half years later.
The appearance of a mysterious fish in a garden in the city of Banff
A man from Banff asks for help to find out the conditions for the species to appear in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bane thinks that 75 fish could be sand eels that have been towed with a waterbed.
Mr. Bane, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, posted a video of the fish on his website Periscope, hoping that someone would know how the fish of this size of 5 centimetres got to his garden.
The intersection of Queensferry: the bridge is now connected to Fayph.
The project, currently worth 1.35 billion pounds, is planned to be completed in May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern portion of the Queensferry junction and the viaduct, meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fayfu.
The first of the four connecting parts is completed, which means that the construction of the bridge is nearing completion.
The Fife Bridge is 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It consists of 10,000 tons of steel, 20,000 tons of concrete, and 46 support cables.
Currently, the GBP 1.35 billion project is expected to be completed in May 2017.
Economic Secretary Kate Brown had come to the construction site today and was one of the first to climb the bridge.
He said, "This is a symbolic and historic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Bridge."
In this project we see an unrivalled engineering solution where only this part has been built using more than 30,000 tons of cement and steel.
Despite the huge weight and size of the bridge, connecting the bridge and the viaduct is an extremely delicate process that requires tremendous precision.
Overall, more than 79% of the bridge deck has already been built and the final section connecting the bridge to Rosita will be laid today, which means that all parts of the bridge are ready to be laid.
Michael Martin, project director of the Fourth Bridge Connection, says, "The first connection is a very important point in the construction of any bridge."
In this fantastic project, the first connection demonstrates top-class engineering.
After the installation of the last road section and its connection with the support of the north tower, we had to connect the north road section with the part of the ground or viaduct.
This was done by pushing a portion of the northern access viaduct 700 millimetres to the south.
It was a huge and, at the same time, very delicate operation.
Huge, as the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled tilted by about 3%.
Delicate, because the tolerance in both directions that the team worked with was only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything worked out well.
Simone Bails wins gold in gymnastics for women.
Forget the tension.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Bailes doesn't care.
Dynamic leaps.
Effortlessly perform the exercises on the log.
Unsurpassed on the floor.
Absolutely perfect.
And finally the Olympic champion.
On Thursday, the 19-year-old American gymnast won the gold medal, fully demonstrating the difference between herself and the rest of the world on the Olympic stage.
Her total score of 62,198 was a headcourt superior to that of the silver medal winner and her teammate Aliya Raismane and the bronze medal winner, Russian athlete Aliya Mustafina.
On Thursday, U.S. athlete Simona Bails performed an exercise on beam sports gymnastics in the individual multi-fight final for women at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Bails became the fourth consecutive American woman to win a multi-fight champion title and the fifth best gymnast, gradually establishing a reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and possibly the best gymnast in history.
When the final result was announced, she burst into tears as the long road to this moment was over.
This achievement places him next to such unbeatable athletes as Michael Phelps, who raised his sport to another level.
Bails has dominated her sport for the last three years, winning 15 medals at world championships, including 10 gold medals, performing such outstanding, accurate and ambitious exercise combinations that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lu Reton called her "the best gymnast she'd ever seen".
In Brazil, she was met by a final ordeal, where she had to compete largely with the expectations placed on her rather than the rest of the athletes.
She would be disappointed if she returned to her home in Spring, Texas with no gold medals.
The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 210 concerning detailed rules on the application of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article.
Bails won her first gold medal on Tuesday, making a special farewell party for random coordinator Marta Karolji.
Though Bailes claims that she did not expect anything like this on her long journey to the heights of fame, it is not true.
Part of her performance in the free movements, which includes her special acrobatic transition, is accompanied by Latin music that would fit perfectly on the street next to the Rio Olympics arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl, adopted by her grandparents when she was still an infant and discovered by coach Amy Boorman's mother on a trip to the gym, where Boorman's terns were held, has now become a force to be reckoned with.
She has not lost a multi-fight race since the summer of 2013 and the series of wins can continue for as long as Bails wants.
Although Mustafina took the lead somewhat during the two rotations, it was only an illusion.
The balance beam and free movements - the part of the race where Bails will defend her champion title is still ahead.
She took the lead with a score of 15,433 on the beam and strengthened the lead with a score of 15.933 in free movements
Raismann hugged her gently while they waited for results that were just a formality and she burst into tears of joy when the dream she had once recorded in her notebook came true.
Raismane's score was like a little revenge for four years old events when she shared third place with Mustafina, however, she lost the fight for the bronze medal.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, called "grandmother" by the Americans, took a convincing lead.
After performing in free movements that dispelled doubts about her return, she was able to devote the air kiss to the crowd.
In the meantime, the 19-year-old Bails' viral Twitter record r, which she published this week, now has a completely different meaning.
6-year-old Mahay Brown "scared" survives a shootout in Philadelphia.
The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 210 concerning detailed rules on the application of this Regulation.
Grandparents of the child confirmed to the CBS Philadelphia news channel that it was Mahay Brown.
Grandparents say Brown was shot several times, including in the groin, leg, arm, and abdomen, but was still conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
His grandmother, Delores Melendez, tells television: "His little body was just bullet-thumped".
I can't believe it.
The boy has been hospitalized in critical condition and has already undergone several surgeries.
The family informs him that he will definitely recover.
He had to start going first grade in a local elementary school.
Brown is one of four people shot in part of the city of Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man.
The channel CBS Philadelphia reports that one of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition, while the other two victims are in stable condition.
The channel says the child was found in the front seat of the car next to the 29-year-old victim in critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police are investigating if any of them were the attacker.
The investigator told CBS Philadelphia that several gunmen were likely involved in the shooting.
It’s a great way to get to know people.
Looks like it's been a long-running gunfight.
Shells have been found on both sides of the pedestrian sidewalk.
"So it looks like there were a number of armed gunmen here who actively participated in the shooting," according to Philadelphia Police Captain Antony Ginaldi.
Several houses and cars have also been damaged.
No one has yet been detained and police are reported to be examining surveillance camera records.
On Tuesday, a lost bullet hit a 6-year-old girl in the arm while she was toying in front of her house in the West Oak Lane area.
She is slowly recovering, but the police are still looking for the culprit.
Why do we need Simona, Gabby and Laurie?
I call it the Women's Olympic Athlete of the Year Team for a number of reasons.
First of all, I've been to all Summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. team has never been so good.
Secondly, this team consists of three athletes, Simona Bails, Gaby Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who inspire many girls of new origin.
People can be proud that this team also includes Alija Raismane, who is Jewish and Madison Cocian, who is Catholic.
Finally, this team truly represents America.
It has also strengthened the participation of black and Latin American athletes in this sport.
For the past four years, the best gymnast has been an American of African descent.
Last year, Simona and Gabby took 1st and 2nd place.
These are impressive results.
At the previous Olympics, Gabby Douglas surprisingly became the Olympic champion, and America could rejoice.
The world has now seen incredible exercises performed by triple world champion Simone Bails, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, performing unprecedented but masterful exercises.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth consecutive American woman to win a gold medal in the individual multi-fight for women.
Her teammate Alija Raismane won the silver medal.
We have seen the best that this sport can bring, but in the rest of the country the situation in gymnastics lessons is completely different.
Simona, Gabia and Laurie entered the Olympic team just as did Allie and Madison.
They are the "Olympic Five", because the next Olympic gymnastics team will have only four athletes, and this is the last year of coaching Marta Carola.
In fact, gymnastics is an expensive sport. Gymnasts mainly train in private athletic clubs, and are maintained by parents who pay for training, rooms, travel, uniforms, hotels (trainers, athletes and their families) and other expenses.
Most of these athletic clubs are located in urban areas that can afford this sport.
In these clubs, athletes conduct all their trainings, and this is an expensive and long-term investment for athletics families.
Amy Boorman - Simona Bails coach and Maggie Hainey - Laurie Hernandez coach has been training her female athletes since the two girls began doing athletics.
We need to provide young girls who are inspired by Simona, Gabby and Laurie with cheaper gym training options.
I founded my athletic organization 20 years ago.
My organization is based in Haarlem and we offer more than 15,000 city youth (mostly black and Spanish) free or low-cost exercise sessions. We have also trained national and international champions.
In September, we will open a branch in Detroit (my hometown) to provide local youth with the opportunity to get to know this great sport.
Athletics develop strength, flexibility and coordination of the body, as well as teach hard work, discipline and aspiration to the goal.
This combination ensures a long life with good health and success, both at school and at work.
This team will inspire thousands of young girls to practice athletics and it's fantastic.
Doing this sport is very important, especially for young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thanks to Simona, Alija, Gabija and Madison for the great demonstration of "Girls Power", obtaining the gold medals of the Olympic Games and motivating countless young girls of different origins to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After rejecting Jeremy Hunt's offer, the new doctors plan to deploy more strikes.
Ministers hoped to end the controversy by reaching an agreement on changes to the treaty with representatives of the British Medical Association. But this was rejected by 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who participated in the vote.
In July, Hunt announced plans to enter into a contract, stating that the NHS was in an unstable state and that further delays would only harm workers and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract, which provides for changes to the conditions for working during night shifts and weekends to improve working conditions during non-standard working hours.
Last night, Dr. Ellen McCourt, a representative of the BMA's new doctors, stated that the new doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially that it will deepen the labor crisis and it does not provide for a level playing field for all doctors.
There are eight weeks left until the first group of new doctors signs the new treaty, so progress needs to be made, as there is not much time left.
BMA's efforts to solve the problem through negotiation have faced the government's reluctance to engage and sometimes complete silence.
This is despite the fact that Jeremy Hunt said last month that his door was always open.
Jeremy Hunt must take immediate action , stop inaction and cooperate with the new doctors.
If he does not, then the young doctors are ready for new protests.
Over 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 visits were postponed during the last strike in late April, while nurses and consultants attempted to replace doctors who had gone picket.
Ministers hoped to end the controversy by reaching an agreement on changes to the treaty with representatives of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants to raise the rate for work on weekends for 54,000 young doctors who would be covered by the new contracts.
NHS employment CEO Daniel Mortimer called on young doctors not to go on strike.
Mr. Mortimer explains that strikes do not solve anything, but only increase the pressure on busy workers and worry, create stress and hindrances for patients, carers and their families.
We have been talking to the new doctors committee for the last two months and together with the Ministry of Health and other institutions we have answered positively to their questions about the guardians and whistleblowers.
Employers hope that active cooperation on other important issues such as placement of employees, flexible training, additional training for those returning after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of training programs, drop-out and gender pay inequality in medicine - show that employers, England health education institutions and the Ministry of Health are serious about implementing the agreements concluded with BME in November, February and May.
The medicine may reduce the risk of a heart attack by 2 pounds per day.
Thousands of patients who have had a heart attack could be treated with the medicine at a rate of 2 pounds per day, as official representatives recommend using it for more people and for longer periods of time.
The anti-clotting drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks in people with heart disease.
This drug is already prescribed for use 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a recurrent heart attack.
NICE, represented by the NHS, is recommended to use this product 4 years after heart attack to further reduce the risk of heart attack in people with cardiovascular problems.
However, NICE, currently under NHS control, is recommended to use this preparation 4 years after a heart attack to further reduce cardiovascular risk.
Every year about 140,000 people in England experience a heart attack and a quarter of them experience a recurrent heart attack or stroke.
A heart attack and stroke are caused by the accumulation of fat in the walls of the heart forming blockages.
If the blockage ruptures, it can cause a thrombus, blocking the flow of blood to the heart and causing a heart attack.
On the other hand, if a blood clot separates from the wall of blood vessels, it can get further into the bloodstream and block blood access to the brain, causing heart attack.
People who have had a heart attack are at greater risk of having a repeat heart attack.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British firm AstraZeneca and marketed under the name Brilique, reduces the risk of blood clots.
The new NICE guidelines published today recommend that people take 90 mg of Ticagrelor for 12 months and an additional 3 years at 60 mg twice a day with aspirin.
Professor Carol Longson, the director of health technology at NICE, explains, "Despite the availability of medication to prevent recurrent heart attacks, more than a quarter of people who have had a heart attack experience another heart attack or stroke that often has severe consequences."
Fear of a repeated heart attack can have a negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
Evidence suggests that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of recurrent heart attacks and heart attacks in people who have already experienced them.
With the preliminary recommendation of treatment with Ticagrelor, we are happy that we can extend the treatment options to thousands of people who benefit from it.
In view of the limited information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor, in particular the risk of bleeding when used for more than three years, the draft guideline does not recommend its use beyond this period.
The culture of political correctness encourages electoral fraud in Muslim communities
According to a management report, former Tauerhamlet city mayor Lutfur Rahman was dismissed over corruption.
A government report reveals that the culture of political correctness results in turning a blind eye to large-scale cheating in Muslim communities.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickle criticizes police, election supervisors, and city councils that they ignore signs of cheating in the electoral process because they "are afraid of hurting ethnic and religious interests."
The former community secretary, who has now become the head of an anti-corruption organization, says that voter intimidation is so common for religious reasons that police should be allowed to place guards at polling stations to protect intimidated voters.
He also suggests that voters should present a personal identification document when they vote to prove their true identity.
Currently, only the name and address have to be provided to voters.
He even suggests marking the fingers of voted voters with special ink to prevent double voting.
The whistleblowers must also be given more protection, says Sir Eric.
He felt that the press should be given greater access to Council documents and decisions taken by informal committees and working groups.
He says, "The goal is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to protect the local government from a wider culture of corruption and fraud that goes hand in hand with it."
The report was commissioned by Downing Street following a scandal in connection with the election of the Town of Tauerhamlet.
Last year, the special election court decided to remove City Mayor Lutfur Rahman from his position as Mayor due to corrupt and illegal actions.
The court found that Rahman "cynically misrepresented" the religious outlook of his Muslim community and silenced his critics by accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
"Rahman led his election campaign with a statement that it is the religious duty of the Muslims of the believers to vote for him."
About 300 votes were fake or questionable, as one person had voted multiple times.
Sir Eriks also points out that there are signs of fraud throughout the country.
He pointed out that it was particularly worrying to vote in the mail, where senior members of Muslim communities forced others to vote for their preferred candidates.
Sir Eric recommended a series of measures to improve the electoral system, including the production of an identity document to establish a person's identity.
His report states, "Evidence shows that vulnerable members of ethnic minority communities, especially women and youth, are being pressured to vote for community senior-chosen candidates, particularly in Bangladesh and Pakistan communities."
"There is concern that county authorities are not paying attention to these problems due to political correctness because ethnic and religious interests could be harmed."
Sir Eric outlined 50 recommendations on how to improve the electoral system, which also includes prohibiting political activists from running with votes cast by mail to prevent "vote gathering".
The report, which is being examined by Theresa May, also calls for a more thorough check on registration to prevent voter lists from being used for immigration and benefit fraud.
Consider requiring voters to produce an identity document before voting.
Mark the fingers of the voters who voted with special ink to prevent double voting.
Systematically check the nationality of individuals to make sure they have the right to vote.
Set a three-year limit for requests for automatic mail voting.
Prohibit political campaigners and activists from working with votes cast by mail and ballot envelopes for postal voting.
Providing police with the power to place security guards at polling stations.
Make changes to the law to facilitate the prosecution of individuals for intimidation under the Human Rights Act 1983.
Prohibit photographing at polling stations.
To require the use of English only at polling stations (except in Wales).
Reinforce training to ensure that precinct staff members ensure that voters go to the ballot boxes one by one.
Sir Eric strongly criticizes the Metropolitan Police, expressing incomprehension that no charges have been brought in the Tauerhamlet case .
He says, "The election court only disqualified Luftur Rahman and his representative for actions related to corruption and cheating."
He was conclusively found guilty on the standard of criminal law evidence based on irrefutable evidence.
He also criticizes the inefficient "box check" of city council voters at voter registration precincts.
Sir Eric states, "The court decision made last year is an alarm bell.
Our country is known as the birthplace of Parliament, but the alarming and covert spread of electoral fraud and the pretence of authorities that fraud does not happen is a threat to this good reputation.

CBC Olympics commentator apologizes for his comment that the Chinese swimmer is said to have 'died like a pig'.
Byron McDonald's analysis of a 14-year-old Ai Yanha finish in fourth place in the 4x200 m freestyle relay for women, prompted a storm of indignation in CBC viewers.
The Canadian channel CBC was forced to apologize because one of its commentators made comments that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer from the race had "departed from the race that died alone" and "died like a pig".
Commentator Byron McDonald thought his microphone was off when the women of the 4x200 m freestyle relay set out their personal views at the conclusion of the final.
McDonald, who was included in the CBC's panel of commentators to give the comments liveliness, said, "That little fourteen-year-old from China can't keep up".
"Too run over, she flew out of the race that smelled just and died like a pig".
Thank you very much.
14-year-old Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan's score in the second stage was 1:57.79, it is 1.61 seconds slower than that of Canadian Taylor Rucka, allowing Canadians to catch up with China.
Viewers across Canada immediately responded on the Internet because they were shocked to hear such tone and expressions.
Emmett McFarlain recorded on Twitter, "Did a direct CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "died like a pig"?".
Idiot didn't realize they were still on the direct air.
Ai Yanha of China in the 4x200m freestyle final for women was named "the little fourteen-year-old from China who doesn't keep up."
Criticism against Byron McDonald quickly took hold as many demanded clarifications.
Twitter users could not believe it, hearing Byron McDonald's unsympathetic comments.
Twitter user Sarah Paradi wrote, "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and you because we all sound like racists. #disgusting.
Soon after, Scott Russell, who was running the CBC live at the time, apologized for McDonald's comments, saying, "We're sorry that the comment about the swimming result aired live."
It was a bad choice of words and we are very sorry that it happened.
CBC apologized to over 90 people who had responded to Twitter for the comment.
McDonald's colleague Scott Russell had to apologize in his place.
CBC then copied the apology to over 90 Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comment.
The channel also quickly published an apology and statement.
We very much regret that such comments were made and they went live.
Yesterday we immediately responded and apologized to all live viewers and followers on social media.
For the sake of clarity, it should be said that Byron's comments were made about the performance of the swimmer, and not addressed to her personally.
However, these were in any case unprofessional and unsuccessful statements and Byron deeply regretted what had happened.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald personally apologized on direct air and attempted to explain that he did not think his comment would be perceived as a personal attack.
He said in the live broadcast of the CBC Olympics, "I would like to take a moment and apologize for the comment I made yesterday after the women's freestyle competition."
I'm talking about a swimmer's performance, not about him personally.
Needless to say, I hadn't meant to show disrespect and I'm really sorry that it happened.
Primark buyers are shocked by a woman who unashamedly tries on in the middle of a lingerie store.
Buyers felt uncomfortable when a woman started undressing to try on panties in the middle of the store.
Further aggravating the situation, she tried them to make sure they fit her and then took off, putting her panties back on the store shelf.
She went on to look for clothing at the Folkestone Bouverie Place shopping mall store and tried on four more panties.
Primark store in the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone – the place where this woman tried on her underwear and then she put it back on the shelf.
If you’re looking for a new job, you’ll want to make sure you’re doing the right thing.
She points out that people couldn't believe their eyes.
In the middle of the store, she took her underpants off the shelf, took off her tights and trousers, and surveyed them right there.
She didn't even try to find a more discreet place to measure them, she just tried them right there.
Everyone watched her take off her panties and apparently the woman didn't like them because she just put them back on the shelf.
She surveyed three more panties until she decided she didn't like either of them and left the store.
She didn't seem to be bothered by someone watching or thinking about someone buying the clothes she was trying on.
Ms. Davidson (33 years) from Kent says, "The thought is that someone will buy clothes that have been tried on by another person and have not been washed out afterwards."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson adds, "I assume that the store staff took those clothes out of the store shelves after her departure - which is also acceptable."
I can't imagine buying new underwear and finding out that another woman has tried them and hasn't washed them after that.
A spokesman for Primark indicated that Primark was aware of the incident, which occurred on Tuesday, August 9.
The specific clothes have been removed from the store shelves.
How to protect yourself from firearms using Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer.
To find out how to protect yourself in a close distance from attackers with a firearm, we spoke with Krav Maga Grandmaster of New York Ron Mizrake.
Whether you are attacked from the front or behind, this video shows you how to protect yourself and get the upper hand over the attacker.
Mizraki indicates if an attacker attacks from behind, then you must first turn to see the attacker clearly and avoid the trajectory of the shot.
Then the weapon must be held between your front arm and shoulder and hit the opponent's face with your free elbow.
Then comes a blow with a knee through the groin and while the attacker freezes in pain, take away his gun, hit him in the face with the weapon's handle and retreat, continuing to point the gun at him.
If the attacker approaches from the front, the situation is similar - avoid the trajectory of the shot, grab the weapon and fold it so that the villain can not fire.
At the same time, pressure must be exerted on the weapon and the opponent must hit his chest and finally take away his weapon and retreat while continuing to aim at him.
Sound complicated?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrakhi is doing.
But remember, if you're not the master of Krav Maga, it's safer to give your money to the robber.
The Wandal family defuses the Saltash Cornwall social house and is laid out on the street.
The Wandal family has been evicted from their residence for terrorizing neighbors, causing damage to a social house of 50,000 pounds.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Sean Trebilcock were just made out of property in Saltash, Cornwall, as several complaints were made about them.
After they were forcibly evicted from the property, shocked housing officials found the property had been completely defunct.
Holes had been knocked out in the floors and walls, waste was scattered everywhere, and the walls were graffiti-covered.
The family is now evicted from the property and most likely lives on some private property.
Donna McEvoy, manager of the Cornwall Housing Service, says there are fears that the housing will not be possible to renovate.
She says that it has been extremely difficult for people who lived here, and she believes that people cannot live that way.
In this case, a number of factors need to be considered, as the property will not be of good repute in Cornwall in the future.
This family is famous and their name is well known.
The couple had three sons who periodically resided on the property and police say their terror took the form of violence, street banging with baseball bats, intimidation of local residents, drug use, drug sales, and loud shouting and swearing.
The 47-year-old Skeldone, who had property in her name, was sentenced in June to anti-social behavior.
A number of rooms in the derelict house have been found strewn waste.
Several floorboards have also been ripped out in a house where previously trafficked drugs are possible.
Neighbours say that they regularly went to the street and were constantly called the police.
They were forced out of the estate by the Cornwall Housing Service when they had been given 11 weeks to move out of the house voluntarily.
The desperate neighbors were very happy about the eviction because their lives were said to have been absolute hell.
One said, "They didn't care about other residents ."
We lived next door to them for 20 years, it's always been crazy.
I can't believe how often we've seen the police here.
We couldn't sleep this morning.
We woke up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, here'll be wonderful.
Adam Fitzpatrick, who is the head of neighbourhood protection for the Cornwall Housing Service, said the family did not cooperate with local security authorities.
The family has lived here for 20 years and here is regularly called the police.
Various old and unusable items were found in the home's overgrown garden.
He also said, "It is a great pity that the tenants did not show any responsibility for their behavior, as eviction from the house is always the last step considered by Cornwall Housing Service."
This was a very difficult case because their behaviour was extreme and the neighbors were said to have been watching their behaviour very hard.
I appreciate the work done by my entire team, the Devon and Cornwall Police and the community members, who were brave and cooperated with us in providing the necessary information.
I hope this event will make life easier for neighbors and show that anti-social behavior is unacceptable.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons were said to have lived here at different times, but all were said to be about 20 years old.
A dirty mattress left on the floor of one of the rooms after eviction.
The staff will now have to clean up a pile of garbage left in the house.
In 2014, police raided the house and found more than 70 grams of marijuana, weights, supplies, and 1,700 pounds in cash.
Skeldone has only been found guilty of possession of Class B drugs with the intention of distributing them.
She insisted that the money was intended for a monument to her son Lee Sheldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After the eviction, it became known that they were currently renting a private property in Plymouth.
On many of the walls of the house were drawn graffiti.
Police say they will continue to put out tenants who break their leases.
Devon and Cornwall Police spokeswoman Angela Crowe points out that this eviction is a clear warning to other tenants who continue to break the rules.
She also said that, "This is a warning to those who believe they can behave as they want and there will be no consequences."
Criminal and anti-social behaviour is unacceptable to the Devon and Kronwall police, and the police will continue to work with our partners to protect local communities.

The mayor of Cannes has banned burkini swimsuits on the beaches.
The mayor of the southern resort city of Cannes in France has banned the wearing of burkini swimsuits on the beaches of that city, which almost completely obscure the woman's body and closely resemble a wetsuit, local officials said on Thursday.
The mayor of Cannes, David Linar, has signed an ordinance that "access to beaches and swimming is prohibited for anyone without a bathing suit respecting good customs and secularism" as a basic principle of the French Republic.
"A beach suit that ostentatiously shows religious affiliations at a time when France and places of worship are the target of terrorist attacks may pose a risk of public disorder (robbery, clashes, etc.) that needs to be prevented", the ordinance says.
"We are not talking about banning the wearing of religious symbols on the beach, but about outward clothing associated with loyalty to the terrorist movements that are at war with us", Thierry Migul, municipal utilities manager, explained.
He added that the burkini swimsuits have not been seen on Cannes beaches since July 28, when Linar, a member of the centre-right party "Republicans", signed the order and it came into effect.
This week, a water park in the city of Marseille cancelled a planned private event for Muslim women who would have been dressed in burkini swimsuits, as outrage was expressed by politicians from both right and left circles for such an event.
In France, wearing face veiled Muslim women's headgear is prohibited, but religious symbols or appropriate clothing are not prohibited.

On Thursday, August 11, the evening in Lucavsala was given the start of one of the last festivals of this summer - "Cuban" will be held there until Sunday night.
The first night of the meeting was pampered by such groups as "Enter Shikari" from Great Britain, which was expected last year, but disappeared from the program without notice, American punks "NOFX", DJ Maxim from the group "The Prodigy" and others.
Also in the next days of the festival, there are noteworthy names in the program - "Guano Apes" and "Garbage", drummer of punk rock legend "Ramones" Marky Ramone with "Marky Ramone's Blitzkrieg", "Brutto&Lyapis" with Belarusian punk rock leader Sergei Mikhalok at the head, popular Georgian actor and singer Wahtang KikabiVikadze here.
This is the second year that the Kuban festival takes place in Latvia.
Last year it suffered a financial setback and huge losses, but it did not stop the organisers from re-trying - they added a long-mark to the name, included a Latvian group in the programme (on Friday night 19:15 all-day long will be on stage) and announced that the festival has now become "closer and has acquired a local colour alongside such symbols of Riga as its panorama and cats".

The President who remained in the shadows: Gustav Zemgals - 145.
On Friday, 12 August, 145 years have passed since the second President of Latvia, Gustavs Zemgals, was born.
It’s important to note that this is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur.
No one else of our statesmen has defended democracy and the rule of law as much as Zemgals, Arnolds Auziņš writes in a book about Gustavs Zemgals published ten years ago.
It’s also important to remember that you don’t have to be an expert in your field to make sure that you’re getting the best results.
The rest of them are stiff, always right.
He learned not to be like that, nowadays it could be similar to that of Raimonds Vējonis.
“He was one who was close to the people,” says Auziņš.
Modern politicians know history badly, they referred to Kārlis Ulmanis as a good leader, but few people know how furious he was.
The only person he hasn't been yelling at was General Balodis.
Even if in pictures he is kind and smiling, by nature he was hysterical.
“Zemgals with his sense of humor and democracy leaves exactly the opposite impression”, says Auziņš.
It’s a great way to get to know people and make them feel like they’re in a better place.
He also notes that Zemgals has distinguished himself with respect for minorities, having regularly invited Jewish representatives to the presidential palace.
"At that time it was not the usual course of action, after the presidency of Zemgals Alberts Kviesis took over this tradition", the historian says.
He was such a quiet and steady person who had to be persuaded to become president for a long time.
He didn't pursue it himself, he just didn't crave fame.
He was also quite critical of himself because he did not know French, but he felt that the President must necessarily know it.
“During the presidency, the basics of the French language were learned,” explains Strang.
This is the first time I’ve heard of this book.
In any case, he is a highly respected figure in the history of Latvia, even before entering the presidential palace he was in a serious position - he was a highly sought-after notary.
In addition, Zemgals managed the famous Zemgals treasury at 3 Suvorova Street, where the society of depositors and depositors was located.
He was always progressive.
It’s not a big deal for Ulmanis, but he wasn’t publicly opposed either.
It’s a great way to get to know people and get to know them.
He lived a peaceful life, there is no suspicion of wrongdoing or corruption.
How is Zemgale remembered today?
It is a pity, but for most of them he is associated only with a street in Riga.
He was an absolute democrat, views were centered.
"There were no major upheavals during his time, that is, he could associate with such a truly stable presidency", sums up Strang's.
During the presidency of Gustavs Zemgals, from 1927 to 1930, the state visit of Latvia to Sweden took place, which at that time implied full recognition of Latvia in the neighbouring country and its integration into the Northern European family of democratic nations.
On 28 May 1929, Zemgals made a state visit to Stockholm.
The Swedish King Gustav V’s return visit to Latvia took place on 29 June 1929.
The second President of Latvia was born in 1871, but passed away in January 1939.
Simple ways to help your child cope with bouts of anger.
I often have to face the fact that the appearance of anger, rage in a child is considered by parents to be something wrong and insane.
When the child openly shows his anger - we do not know how to react, "Econet" says psychologist Jekaterina Kesa.
The specialist encourages a little conversation about these so natural and human feelings - anger and rage, which everyone periodically experiences.
Aggression - this is already a physical action, addressed to another person, and it usually appears when we feel angry.
When we adults are angry, excited - we usually know what is happening to us and how to deal with it.
We can express our anger and rage in ourselves: express, suppress, hide, keep within ourselves, tell about it to our friends or other loved ones, we can kick the sofa in anger, smoke a cigarette (this is not the best way to dispel anger!), take a shower, hit with a kulaka over the table and do other things we don't usually do.
We do not turn our aggression against others, because we know various other ways to deal with these emotions.
Children, when anger strikes them, do not understand what happens to them, what to call them and how to live with them.
They may say, "Go away!", You're a fool", "Bad Mom", "Don't see you", "I won't be friends with you" - and very rarely, when you can say, "I'm mad at you".
Children live in the literal sense, they are fully present right here, at this point, they are spontaneous and sincere in showing their feelings, and often also are in captivity for various emotions.
It is very important that parents do not forbid the child to show feelings, including anger, do not be ashamed of it and do not scold, but on the contrary - help the child.
Do you need a break in your relationship?
A long working day, where everything has not quite gone the way you would like, or just a bad mood - there are so many reasons why you would like to for a moment, a day or even a longer "unlock" from all over the world.
Is it possible to pause the relationship for a while and breathe a little?
Or does it suggest that each of the partners has their own path to follow?
There is a difference of opinion between men and women at different ages.
John (23) is short and concise: "In my view, if a relationship requires a pause, then you are not with the right person".
Meanwhile, Eduard (30) has discovered a scheme that may be able to help someone.
If you feel that your partner is starting to fall on your nerves for every little detail, then definitely - this is the right time to look at other hunting fields to see if you miss him, or especially think about him or even do not want to see him anymore.
So the answer is yes, taking a break can help you save time and understand how important it is for you.
Kaspars (29) reveals his theory.
In my opinion, in a relationship one has to have a break from each other on a daily basis, because if you spend time with a person 24 hours a day, seven days a week, then disputes are inevitable.
They are caused by the fact that you notice every detail that the other person does, and it begins to fall on your nerves.
People start to bother each other, especially when there's nothing to talk about anymore, just about what you've done during the day.
My personal experience makes me think like that, so I haven’t been in a relationship for more than a couple of months either.
If you think for a moment about the fact that somewhere else or at another is better - then why does this woman with whom you are with deserve one who can think about the fact that there is not good enough here and beyond the mountains there are fields of paradise?
Thinking alone is already the little betrayal.
If not, it is not.
"I have, so I condemn those who don't". says Edmund (46).
This is the first time I've heard of this book.
I think everyone needs a moment for respite.
You can't look each other in the eye every moment, all the time, from morning to evening, and rejoice in the enduring love.
Come on!
There are so many things - friends, work, parties.
Everything has its time.
Of course, for a friend or wife, too, but if both can keep that balance between family life and the rest of the world, then it can live up to the edge of the grave.
So, and so on.
In addition, it is important to note that the use of this product is not recommended for pregnant women, as it is not recommended for women who are pregnant or nursing.
If this question is raised, then it is necessary to take into account that in the near future there will be some changes - for the better or for the worse, it depends on themselves.
I think, while you are still young and crazy, it is necessary to pause - at least all the time, but when everything remains serious and the relationship goes into a completely different phase, then there can be no question of rest.
You decide to spend the rest of your life together!
"If you can't stand each other's society now and need a respite from time to time, what will happen when you are retired, who comments on how the passing cats sniff or argue about which day the garden should be better weeded", explains Kristaps (19).
All lords' names have been changed.
With his enthusiastic and enthusiastic personality, Rozentāls first aroused the interest of the Latvian people in the fine arts.
"In this sense, he was the first love of the Latvian people, which as such will remain forever unforgettable", Roman Suta wrote about the old master of Latvian painting Janis Rozentāls.
Also in 2016, when the old master’s extensive retrospective exhibition was opened in the restored main building of the Latvian National Museum of Art, it is clear that Rozentāls is the first love of Latvian art.
The exhibition was opened on 12 August, but from 13 August it is open to visitors and will be on view until 30 October.
The Latvian National Museum of Art honours painter Janis Rozentāls (1866-1916), whose hundredth birthday is included internationally in the UNESCO calendar of celebrations.
The retrospective exhibition, which features more than 150 works, is one of the central events of Janis Rozentāls’ anniversary programme.
The selection of works of art is mostly made from the collection of the Latvian National Museum of Art, which convincingly represents the main stages and genres of the classic’s creative activity, stylistic variability and variety of techniques.
In addition, there are exhibits from Akseli Gallena-Kallela Museum, Literature and Music Museum, Liepāja Museum, Tukums Museum and several private collections in Latvia and Finland.
At the turn of the century, the atmosphere is revived by the presence of photographs, and the exhibition’s mobile application reveals the connection between individual works of art and photographs taken by the painter with his own camera for creative purposes.
In turn, the Finnish-Latvian Commonwealth Society "Rozental-seura", named after the Latvian classic, at the Latvian National Museum of Art offers at the same time the first stop of a small informative traveling exhibition "With a Look at Finland, with a Heart in Latvia".
A similar exhibition in English, Finnish and Swedish will be opened at the Virka Gallery in Helsinki in the autumn.
Matt Leblanc is looking forward to returning to the show "TopGear".
In addition to the above, we may also share your personal data with third parties for the purposes set out above.
So far, nothing is officially happening.
"If there are, then the BBC will announce it", Leblanc revealed in a conversation with television critics.
Doubts about the future of "The Gas in the Floor!" arose in July when Leblanc's partner Chris Evans announced that he was leaving the show.
After leaving, Evans admitted that Leblanc and "The Gas in the Floor!" were "as created for each other."
Evans describes the former star of the series Friends as "a real and good man", thus dispelling rumors that the two's friendship was messed up during filming.
When asked what he liked most about the show, Leblancm replied that he was traveling to other countries such as South Africa, Morocco and Ireland.
The BBC says that Evans is not scheduled to be replaced in the show's new 24th season.

It is expected that the meldonia of the Latvian-made medicine Mildronāts could already be excluded from the list of prohibited substances for athletes this year, on Friday morning the director of the Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis, academician Ivars Kalviņš, said in LNT broadcast for 900 seconds.
He told that he would travel to Canada in September to discuss the meldonium issue with representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).

The backstage of the US model business, he interpreted, gained the elegance of a perversely sophisticated photo shoot and the insolence of a horror film.
In essence - a very provocative, balancing work on sophistication and banal vulgarity, in which the borderlines between European art house films and the territory of the Hollywood genre are difficult to draw.
The film with Vigo Mortensen in the lead role accentuates the question whether the parents' conceptually chosen patterns of life (ecologicalism, vegetarianism, alternativeism and disassociation from consumer society's slumber and values) bring blessing or destructiveness to their children.

The Islamic State captured 2,000 civilians in Syria.
The Islamic State militants in Syria's Aleppo province have captured about 2,000 civilians used as live shields, the U.S.-backed Kurdish-Arab alliance and observers said Friday.
"We did not shoot at them because they took civilians with them as they fled to Gerabulus", stated a spokesman for the Kurdish Menbiz Military Council.
After two months of fighting, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (QSD), a U.S.-backed Kurdish-Arab alliance in northern Syria, announced Friday that Menbizha had been liberated from jihadists.
The Islamic State captured Manbij in 2014.
QSD expelled most of the Islamic State militants from Menbij as early as last week, but some held on and showed fierce resistance.
However, they left the city on Friday, taking the captives with them.
Islamists go to Gerabulus, which is located on the Turkish border.
The London-based Syrian activist organization Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) also reported that about 2,000 people were kidnapped by the Islamic State.
The SOHR reported that Islamists hijacked the city's residents' cars, forced people to board them, and then took them to Gerabulus.
The Islamic State militants have also carried out mass kidnappings in the past.
In January, Islamists hijacked more than 400 civilian residents, including women and children, by conquering territories in Deir ez Zora province in eastern Syria.
Later, about 270 of the captives were freed by the Islamists.
How many Islamic State militants have fled from Menbizha is not known.
A spokesman for the Kurdish Menbij Military Council reported that the QSD managed to rescue 2,500 people held captive by Islamists in Menbij.
It’s important to note that this is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur.
299 QSD fighters and 1019 jihadists killed.

The Freeport of Riga has implemented all recommendations of the SAO regarding the Krievu Island project.
The Freeport of Riga Authority has implemented all of the five recommendations of the State Audit Office regarding the implementation of the project Infrastructure Development on Krievu Island for the transfer of port activities from the city centre, the portal Diena.lv informed the company.
The project approval is planned for the next meeting of the Freeport of Riga Board.
In order to implement the recommendations in accordance with the SAO recommendations, when preparing the documentation necessary for implementation of the recommendations, the Freeport of Riga Authority was guided also by the conclusions of the legal and operational audit carried out by the international auditor Deloitte in the Freeport of Riga Authority and the recommendations for improving the project management during the subsequent project phase.
Information on the implementation of the recommendations has also been sent to the SAO today.
Despite the fact that the Freeport of Riga Authority does not agree with the opinion prepared by the SAO on the usefulness of the implementation of the Krievu Island project, we are very responsible for the implementation of the project and the provider of funding - the European Commission (EC).
I would like to emphasize that all the planned construction works within the project have been fully completed within the set deadlines and planned amount.
"In order to prove to all those involved in the implementation of the project, including the EC, the SAO and also stevedores, that the main objective of the Freeport is successful implementation of the project, we have implemented all recommendations of the SAO regarding the issues of project management and supervision," says Sanita Kaire, Project Manager of Krievu Island.
To control and monitor the achievement of the project goal, the existing long-term action plan was supplemented with the most important planned activities of the involved parties and deadlines of the necessary decisions, definitions of meetings and regular reports and their deadlines, tools for monitoring the planned construction process, as well as the definitions of the most important border points.
The approved action plan for reaching the project goal by 31 December 2018, in accordance with the recommendations of the SAO, has been supplemented with implementation monitoring activities, thus reinforcing the control of the deadlines for the activities of other parties involved in the implementation of the project by the Freeport of Riga.
To improve project management and reduce potential risks, a project management plan has been developed, defining the project management areas and indicating the developed documents that provide a control and monitoring mechanism for each of them.
A project management structure has been developed to increase the capacity of the project, which reflects the planned structure of the project management team, qualification and functions of the employees.
In order to improve the communication between the Freeport of Riga Authority and the parties involved in the project, a communication plan has been developed for the parties involved in the project, which, in addition to the parties specified in the project action plan, defines the parties involved in the successful completion of the project, the principles, types and periodicity of the information exchange.
However, in order to improve control over the use of financial resources, the necessity of entering into a service contract or commencement of procurement and the rule of law will have to be justified in more detail in the future.
Within the framework of the project, four new deep-water piers, railway inlets, as well as engineering communications have been built on Krievu Island.
The constructions co-financed by the Cohesion Fund have been completed and put into operation at the end of last year, achieving a saving of EUR 10.6 million.

"Given the threat, we have stepped up security measures at international airports in Bratislava, Poprad and Košice," a spokesman for the Slovak Interior Ministry told AFP news agency on Friday.
"The Center for National Security and Analysis is currently analysing the information we have received", he added.
On 16 September, an informal European Union (EU) summit will take place in the Slovak capital, in which all the countries of the bloc, except Great Britain, will participate.
The meeting will discuss the consequences of the UK’s Brexit referendum and the future of the EU without Britain.
Slovakia holds the EU Presidency until January.
German researchers discuss the number of "victims of the Berlin Wall".
According to a new study, the death toll at the former eastern German border under the Communist yoke could be much higher than previously thought, but doubts about the true number of casualties have still not been allayed.
According to data released Wednesday by the Checkpoint Charlie Berlin Wall Museum, between 1945 and 1989, 1,841 people were murdered by the communist authorities on the border with the zones of the western allies and later West Germany, attempting to escape from the territory under their control.
The museum has been studying border-related deaths for years and occasionally corrects the number of victims.
This year, 11 more deaths have been added to the list, including a six-year-old boy drowned as the family tried to get to West Germany via then Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
Among the new victims of the Berlin Wall are also deserters of the Soviet army.
"The final extent of the damage done by the double evil of communism and socialism is not yet fully documented", according to museum director Alexandra Hildebrandte.
"Our task is to ensure that the graves of those who died trying to escape from the Communist-controlled state are maintained and do not disappear", the statement released by Hildebrandte said.
But other researchers have already questioned the new figures.
"The figure 1841 is inconclusive", in an interview with the newspaper S-ddeutsche Zeitung claims Jochen Stat, an expert in the history of East Germany at the Free University of Berlin.
He and other researchers at the Free University of Berlin are currently reviewing suspected deaths at the border, and so far they have only been able to confirm 260 cases.
In the past, researchers estimated that it was only at the Berlin Wall that the communists murdered 138 people.
Considering those who died trying to escape through the Baltic Sea or into the West through the territory of neighbouring countries, according to the State, the number of casualties could reach about a thousand.
However, this is still significantly less than in 1841.
One of the reasons for the different number of victims could be different methodologies.
The Checkpoint Charlie Museum also lists all suicides by East German border guards, whether or not they were directly related to their service.
The museum also lists deaths that do not involve direct violence.
"If seniors aged 70 to 80 died of a heart attack after contracting border control", this should be the consequence of this "killing margin", Hildebrandt believes.
However, the State is convinced that a distinction must be made between the old people, who may have died as a result of the treatment they experienced, and those whose deaths were caused by prolonged waiting in hot weather on the bus at the border.
Regardless of this, the recording of victims is not easy, as the communist authorities in East Germany did not collect such statistics, and the researchers have to select documents in various scattered archives, states Stats.
However, the Stat Group has recently come up with new documents and could therefore come up with a new estimate of the number of victims in the near future.

Initially, the list of riders included approved swimmers Aļona Ribakova and Uvis Kalniņš, coaches Jakubovskis and Dave Collins, as well as Federation President Pone.
The Latvian Swimming Federation registered five participants for the Olympic Games, and even before the departure Aldons Vrubļevskis claimed that German would be and he was looking for tickets.
"However, apparently for objective reasons he was not", expressed Pone, expressing the opinion that it did not affect the result of Ribakov.
At the Federation's request, Uvy's coach undertook to help her.

"I don't know why there wasn't enough space for the Swimming Federation", Pone said that the work of the federation and their presidents was not appreciated by the public, reminding them that the presidents of the federations don't receive salaries.
Pone also criticized Jakubowski himself, saying that before the London Olympics, when Ribakova was not approved among the participants, he appealed to the International Water Sports Federation (FINA) and asked Latvia not to send any athletes.

In the spring and early summer of 2016, pike and lamprey larvae will be released, in June - whitefish, in July - summer salmon, in August and September - zander and vimba.
The production director of Latvenergo, Māris Kuņickis, said that caring for the environment is one of the cornerstones of the sustainable development of Latvenergo Group.
“Every activity of the measures for the protection and reproduction of fish resources is aimed at environmentally friendly activities in close cooperation with the Bior scientific institute, both by breeding and releasing young fish into the Daugava basin and by implementing other activities,” Kuņickis pointed out.
This year, more than 600 000 annual cubs of salmon and sea trout will be allowed into the estuary of the Daugava River.
For the second year, fish fry are tagged before being let in by cutting off the fat fin.
The cargo brought today contains 25,000 salmon cubs with an average weight of 31.3 grams.
Each year, in a scientifically based species composition and quantity in the Daugava and its basin water bodies, the release of juvenile fish and larvae takes place.
The reproduction of fish resources in the Daugava River and its basin water bodies shall be carried out by Bior in accordance with laws and regulations, on the basis of an expert-examination of the losses caused to the fish resources as a result of Latvenergo’s economic activities and providing an opinion on what compensatory measures are to be taken to ensure the diversity of fish resources.
In turn, the State Environmental Service shall take a decision on the amount and type of compensation on the basis of the abovementioned expert-examination.
The annual compensation amount for Latvenergo in the fish restocking programme is EUR 1 035 000.
In the spring of 2016, Latvenergo in cooperation with the association "We fish" for the fifth year is placing 400 artificial fish spawning nest in Daugava near Kaibala and Ikšķile.
Cooperation with the association in promoting fish natural spawning is an additional initiative supported by Latvenergo within the framework of the fish restocking programme.
The placement of artificial spawning nests in the reservoir is an important event that contributes to the protection and reproduction of fish resources in the Daugava River.

Reid claims if Clinton is elected to the office of president, then she will appoint Garland as a Supreme Court judge .
Harry Reid, leader of the Senate Democrat Party, is confident that if she becomes president, then she will nominate Merrick Garland as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
The Senate Republican Party has blocked Garland's approval since March, when he was nominated by President Obama.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the next president would choose who would replace current Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
On Thursday during his conference, Reid announced that he was confident Clinton would choose Garland.
A spokeswoman for the raid later said that he had not spoken personally to Clinton on the subject and that it was just speculation.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team would not want to "rock the boat" with another choice.
Garland is the chief judge of the United States District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Reid said that Republicans blocking Garland's nomination were "inputs" and were acting in the interest of Republican Party presidential nominee Donald Trump.
He also said that Trump was not fit for the job of president.
The Treats announce a nude calendar for women and men.
Treats magazine will collaborate with photographer David Belmer to create the 2017 calendar in the style of Pirreli in the 1970s.
In its 2017 NU Muse calendar, it is planned to showcase the new supermodels, not naked celebrities.
Earlier this year, Steve Shaw, president of Treats magazine, stated that his erotic art magazine was different from the old-fashioned Playboy because "Playboy is a men's magazine".
This magazine is for women.
He also seems to be talking about the calendar.
In a press release on the making of the calendar, Shaw states, "We must return to portraying enduring and classic nudity in pictures where the female body does not confuse but inspires both women and men."
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a great work of art.
Models can send their photos electronically or in person during casting sessions in Los Angeles and New York.

Greenland shark is the longest-lived vertebrate - video review

A French court rejects the request to demolish shops in a "Jungle" refugee camp.
A French court rejected a demand from the Calais authorities to demolish dozens of self-made shops and restaurants in the jungle camp, which is home to several thousand refugees.
At a court hearing in Calais this week, the authorities said the country should dismantle 72 self-made shops, where people sell various goods such as cigarettes and energy drinks, offer hairdresser services, tea for 50 cents (40p) and simple meals for a few euros in self-made restaurants.
The office of the prefect of Calais pointed out that these self-made enterprises should be demolished because they form a shadow economy and do not pay taxes, as well as causing fire and sanitary risks.
Representatives of the humanitarian group explained to the court that these small businesses are important because the food provided by the government and support groups does not provide for the needs of the camp, in which the number of residents continues to grow.
They also pointed out that self-designed shops and restaurants often offer free shelter and food for those who need it most.
The court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for expelling people who created 72 self-made boutiques, but it understands the concerns of the prefect of Calais.
Justice Jean-Francio Moll said that food, coffee and restaurants play a greater role than simply providing food to people who live in "extremely humble conditions".
He pointed out that these places are peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the sites at risk of demolition is the camp cafe "Jungle Book Kids", which provides more than 200 free meals a day, English and French classes and provides asylum advice to hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors.
Over 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect a children's cafe.
A letter addressed to the Guardian states that the liquidation of the café "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old."
On Friday, two charities, "Help for Refugees" and "L'Auberge des Migrants", reported that the number of residents of the "Jungle" camp had increased to 9,000, the highest rate since the rapid influx of migrants in the summer.
Britain wins silver in rugby-7 series fight when Fiji national team masterfully wins gold.
The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 210 concerning detailed rules on the application of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article.
Fiji demonstrated a master class in ball possession, ball play with foot, support play and brutal power play, winning gold - the first Olympic medal in its history.
The defeat brought a respectable consolation prize - the silver medal, which was Britain's third medal that day. The British team can be proud of their success in the first Olympic Rugby-7 tournament, in which they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
It’s a great way to get to know each other better and get to know each other better.
But in any case, the Fijian team is currently in its best form to also win the 15-man squad.
Although unlikely, however, a certain consolation for Britain could be the fact that at least one Briton won the gold medal. This is the head coach of the Fiji national team Ben Ryan - a former England coach from Wimbledon.
It was an exciting adventure for Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's leadership, they lost all games in the rugby-7 series stage in Adelaide.
This time they only lost one game.
The defeat is painful, but the growth is amazing.
Fiji impressively started the match, reprising Britain's power techniques for fun.
Capt. Tom Mitchell and members had it as a run-up to a number of facing buses and the World Series champions took the lead with 5:0 when Osea Kolinisau scored the first touchdown.
Jerry Tuwai also increased the lead further in the final four minutes, realizing a touchdown on the right wing.
It’s not just a matter of how much money you’ll have.
Mitchell's excellent power technique prevented the shaky Leoni Nakarava from scoring three, but this only had a slight effect on Fiji's score.
In the seventh minute of the game, Yasa Veremalua scored a touchdown in the right corner, strengthening the lead over Great Britain to 17:0.
After the rematch, Nakarava further increased the lead and had more than a minute left by the end... the end of the first half.
Watemo Ravouvou avoided some clumsy British force techniques and crossed the line, scoring.
The touchdown secured a score of 29:0.
Fiji seemed to have been born to play rugby-7 matches while the British were still learning.
In fact, that is true.
The British team made a profound change at half-time, breaking the line of Fiji players... full four minutes, which by the standards of the first half-time was good, to the point where Joshua Tuisova, after a fantastic match of the team, scored a few more points for the Fiji team.
Dan Norton managed to score for the British team by making a touchdown in the left corner and achieving a score of 36:7, but the game had already been lost, meanwhile the fans of the South Seas Islanders sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
One cannot fail to admire Fiji's cheerful attitude.
Mata Viliame made Fiji's win even sweeter with another touchdown at the end of the game.
When the final whistle of the game sounded, Fiji could begin to celebrate, but the British were able to sit down in grass after the defeat alone.
In the first half of the day, Fiji defeated Japan by a score of 20:5, while the British were superior to South Africa, where in a very tough fight both teams scored by a touchdown and the South Africans lost by only a few points.
During the first half, Kyle Brown put Boks in the team lead, but during the second half, Dan Norton crossed the line with brilliant craftsmanship and delivered the ball between the poles, securing the British victory.
Markus Watson, who is the brother of England rugby-15 team player Antony, the great power technique at the end of the game provided the team with a win and another silver medal.
The coach's battle with cancer inspired Helen Glover and Heter Staning to win the rowing race.
It will be the most emotional gold medal in this race and it already says a lot.
From the first to the last stroke, Helen Glover and Heather Staning's golden moment played a special role on the Estacio da Lagoa track.
Although the boat only has both female athletes, they were accompanied by an echo of Robin Williams, who inspired them until the second Olympic gold medal for pair rowing women, becoming the first women in British sporting history to achieve such success.
They clearly dominated, as they scored an unbeaten, unprecedented victory for the 39th time.
The two great athletes with the elegance of the swan sliding on the surface of the water do not fully reflect this triumph.
A team behind each gold medal in rowing is working hard to ensure that athletes continuously improve their performance and the greatest contribution to their success has been made by a coach who, 30 months ago, did not know if he would experience this day because he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to him, it disappeared as quickly as it appeared.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of those that can be operated on and so it happened.
If it didn't, it would spread throughout the body.
And the situation would get out of control.
It changes your vision a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
This trio was lucky that William was able to start the recovery procedure at the beginning of the 2014 midseason and reduce the duration of the break to a minimum, if you can say so.
I needed income, so I had to recover quickly.
It stimulated recovery.
I was in the hospital and I walked 6, 10 and even 15 meters, although the doctor said that a few steps would suffice.
That's how it all began.
Rowing itself is a challenge, but this time it was even bigger.
After the victory, the first thought was immediately about Williams, who was very worried all morning and spoke more than usual under the influence of excitement.
Staning, who has served in the Royal Artillery Unit in Afghanistan, said, "This was an emotionally hard week, but it means a lot to me."
It just confirms how much it means to us and how much I, Helen, and Robin have worked.
The last 3 years with Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin, we wouldn't have achieved anything, so thank you very much, he's the best coach in the world.
I can't think of a better trainer or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Staning have not lost any races in five years.
The pair achieves such a huge speed that competitors cannot compete with.
Even in the last 500 metres, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, the predominance of Staning and Glover was too great.
We felt every moment.
Helen shouted, "Keep the rhythm, keep the rhythm."
Staying focused is really important.
We managed to get a good start, but at the same time we did not have high expectations.
That day, we didn't have the intention of cutting records, but just rowing and winning races well and that's what we did.
A couple of years will rest to decide what to do next.
Next month will be the wedding of Glover and television adventurer Steve Bashal.
For now, she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say this was my last race.
That would have been too much pressure.
It took me about six months in London to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
It was a new experience and I was very worried.
It took about four minutes this time.
She said, "The feeling is fantastic."

It’s a great way to get to know each other.
In Spain, the deficit reduction potential is threatened by the failure to form a government.
A month ago, on 12 July, the European Commission (EC) said that Spain and Portugal had not taken sufficient measures to bring their deficits down to 3% of gross domestic product (GDP) required by the euro area.
According to estimates, despite austerity measures, Portugal's budget deficit at the end of last year was 4.4% of GDP, while Spain recorded a deficit of 5.1%.
The European Commission decided, however, not to impose economic sanctions on both countries, while at the same time setting fiscal targets for the coming period.
One of the reasons why the EC did not impose sanctions against these two countries, however, is the growing Euroscepticism in many countries of the European Union.
Additional sanctions would only increase such negative sentiment.
Critics point out, however, that the EC is not consistent in its decisions, agreeing on common rules from the beginning and then failing to apply them in real life.
For example, the President of the German Bundesbank, Jens Weidmann, pointed out that Europe is losing confidence in itself in this way, creating the impression that the European Union's rules are recommendatory and not binding.
The Commission has now proposed and all Member States have approved an extension of the deadline for correcting the budget deficit to Portugal by the end of this year and Spain by 2018.
The European Commission promises to examine the progress made by both countries in the coming months, while at the same time pointing out that both Spain and Portugal must be prepared to introduce additional austerity measures if circumstances so require.
Preliminary forecasts indicate that the target for Portugal could be reached in due time and that the budget deficit could fall to 2.5% of gross domestic product already this year.
This means that, as part of the Stability Programme, the government of this country has to implement austerity measures of 0.25% of GDP this year.
These measures should be included in this year's budget, with an additional focus on controlling the cost of purchasing goods and services.
In the case of Spain, the situation is much more complicated.
This year, the budget deficit should be reduced to 4.6%, next year - to 3.1% and 2018 - to 2.2% of GDP.
In addition, consolidation measures should amount to 0.5% of GDP annually over the next two years.
The fact that the Spanish political parties have not been able to agree on the formation of a government for eight months makes it particularly difficult to achieve these objectives, and it is becoming increasingly likely that Spain will have to hold early parliamentary elections for the third time in a year.
However, opinion polls show that the political picture in the country would not change significantly for the third election.
The most popular party remains the popular party led by current Prime Minister Mariano Rahoy, who would win less than 33% of the votes again in the election.
Only the socialists have gained a little popularity, while the popularity of the anti-austerity parties Podemos or Together We Can and Ciudadanos or Citizens has diminished a little.
The people's party wants to get the socialists and the "Ciudadanos" involved in the government as late as this month, otherwise it will not be possible to adopt and submit the draft budget for 2017 to the European Commission for approval by mid-October.
If the government fails and parliamentary elections are held for the third time, Spain will be a laughing stock of Europe as a whole.
The purity of the beaches in the Gulf of Riga is critical.

The most polluted bathing areas are in Riga.
It’s a great way to get to know people and make them happy.
In addition, waste left on land can be washed into the water during heavy rains, thus significantly damaging its quality.
Except for the Liepaja beach and some places in Kurzeme, the purity of beaches in other parts of Latvia is critical.
This week’s announcement was made by volunteers of the “My Sea” campaign.
If you want to know more about how to get rid of the problem, you can read here.
Unfortunately, this year, this critical assessment has come to pass.
"We see that this will be the year when the number of garbage on the beach 100 meters, perhaps, can even exceed 200 units", says the representative of the expedition "My Sea" Jānis Ulme.
It’s a great way to get to know people.
This year, among the various household wastes and remnants of picnics, activists have collected even daylight bulbs left tossing in the sea sand.
This is the first time I’ve heard of this book.
"The main source is the beach visitors themselves, because more than half of the total waste is plastic, various waste, starting with bags, pieces of plastic, which are already in the stage of degradation, they can no longer be identified, and for smokers, bottles, corks," says Ulme.
Among the dirtiest beaches there are also swimming spots in Riga.
For example, in Daugavgriva almost 800 units of waste were collected every hundred metres on average, which is a critical amount.
The organisers of the campaign also explain that at almost every turn there are also mockerys and not everywhere placed warning or prohibition signs.
"The average figures for all three bathing areas in Riga together - Daugavgrīva, Vakarbuļi and Vecāķi - unfortunately turn out to be large and far exceeding the desired or goal, which Latvia is moving towards, to reduce the number of waste units to 135 units by 2020," concludes the environmental defender.
It’s a great way to get to know people and get to know them.
However, the fight against filth is rather difficult.
We return to the issue of these people's culture.
"Those who indulge, drink alcohol, smoke and do all those things that should not, even special signs do not work," Vidauskis said.
This is why Vidauskis calls for bathing visitors to report polluters to the police as well.
One can call the police, safely point to these violations and in this way all fight.
Perhaps some new warnings can be put on, but as I said, it is unlikely that this will radically change the situation.
"Since all must simply act together and be intolerant of such violators", he emphasizes.
This is the fourth time that water quality measurements have been carried out by the Health Inspectorate this summer, which may impose a ban on official bathing sites.
This year, like other years, water quality is good and satisfactory everywhere.
The situation at the moment is that in all 56 bathing areas, the quality of the water has been good all the time and there are no restrictions on bathing.
“We will take analyses for the last time at the end of August,” says Normunds Kadiķis, Senior Environmental Health Specialist of the Inspectorate.
Waste left on land during heavy rains can be flushed into the water.
This can affect the quality of the product, says the environmental expert.
It is also important to remember that this is not the end of the world.
He quit his job?
Vladimir Putin has told Russian media that Sergei Ivanov himself wanted to leave the office and will be the president's special representative for nature conservation, ecology and transport.
When Putin announced the changes, he congratulated Ivanov on television cameras: "Dear Sergei Borisovich, we have been working together with you for many years and are doing it successfully."
I am satisfied with the way in which you are fulfilling your responsibilities.
I remember well about our agreement not to use you in this position of head of the presidential administration for more than four years.
That's why I understand your desire to change the scope.
And I hope that in your new role, too, you will make full use of your knowledge and experience.
However, it is highlighted that the running of the presidential administration is a very important position and this made Ivanov one of the most influential people in the country.

It’s a great way to get to know each other better.
Ivanov has been an old and close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He started his career in special services in 1975, where he met Putin.
Later, as Putin became head of the Federal Security Service, Ivanov became his deputy.
In turn, at the end of the reign of the first President of Russia Boris Yeltsin was appointed Secretary of the Russian Security Council.
In 2000, after Putin came to power, the "Doctrine of Information Security" developed by Ivanov was approved, which provided for the revitalization of state censorship mechanisms in Russia, among other things.
In 2001 Sergey Ivanov became the Minister of Defense of Russia, and already in 2005 - Deputy Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov and was responsible for the development of Russian defence companies and arms exports.
Now, after leaving the post of head of the presidential administration, Ivanov will also retain his seat on the Russian National Security Council, where the new head of the presidential administration, Vaino, will also serve.
It is the only way to get rid of them.
It’s not just a matter of how much money you’re spending.
Anton Eduardovich and I have known each other for a long time.
From the time we were in the government under your leadership.
And for the last almost five years, we've been communicating practically every day.
"Therefore, I am sure that after all the professional and personal qualities of character he is ready for this job", Ivanov said.
Vaino comes from a family that belonged to the elite of the Soviet party.
His grandfather Karl has held senior positions in the Estonian Communist Party, including being its first secretary for ten years up until 1988.
The online edition "Meduza" with a reference to the book "Estonian self-determination and independence" writes that at the end of the 80s, Karl Vaino asked Moscow to give permission to use force against demonstrators.
However, he is said to have received a refusal and soon lost his position.
Shortly afterwards, Vaino moved to Moscow.
Anton Vaino is a graduate of the Moscow Institute of International Relations and is fluent in Japanese.
However, he has left the diplomatic service to serve in the Presidential Protocol Administration.

It’s also important to note that this is not the first time in the history of the company.
The team is losing.
This time, there was definitely a lack of luck as well - in the third set only two attacks by Evandri almost flew out of the court, but the ball still hit the line.
Two eisis were next to the line.
Also, the controversial episode in the video was decided in favor of opponents.
If the first two games Evandru were plagued with serves, then they were very productive against ours.

Of course, it should also be taken into account that beach volleyball is becoming more popular, young couples are entering into circulation, and only the rare one has a height of less than two meters.

In Latvia, the opera "Porgy and Bess" premiered at the Latvian National Opera in 1973.
Since then, the internationally acclaimed masterpiece has not been performed again.
That is why the organisers of the Cēsis Art Festival and the Liepaja Art Forum have decided to give the audience the opportunity to enjoy George Gershwin’s Shederv.
"We are very pleased that after a ten-year break, when the last time Liepaja could enjoy the production of the opera, this great version of George Gershwin's "Porgy and Bess" can be enjoyed here in the new, newly opened concert hall "Great Amber", says Baiba Bože, the director of the concert hall "Great Amber".
Opera "Porgy and Bess" is a story told in bright musical language about love, its volatility, passion, as well as household tragedies and simple everyday pleasures.
It reflects African-American vitality, music, and rhythm.
It is this lack of political correctness in this opera, this exclusion of tolerance, that makes it so alive.
"And yes, this love story is extremely powerful, extremely beautiful and in some way really deep", says director Viesturs Kairišs.
What I like the most - listening to or playing this opera, there are always such stops - famous melodies, famous motifs, but these transitions from one character to another, illuminating one character or another character, or a choir or an orchestra.
"It is the most exciting, this building", the opera is appreciated by Andris Poga, musical director and conductor of the opera "Porgijs un Besa".
Visitors to the opera agree that this is a grand event.
They are delighted to hear this world-famous opera by Gershwin.
I’m happy that you can feel the world’s breath.
"Execution professional", the opera is appreciated by visitor Edgars Lāms.
The concert production was special because in the newly opened concert hall "Great Amber" for the first time an orchestra played in the orchestra pit and for the first time an opera concert performance was held.
The area near the renovated building of the Art Museum could be named after Janis Rozentāls.
The Vice Mayor of Riga Andris Ameriks told at the opening of the exhibition that the museum’s own address might not be Krišjāņa Valdemāra Street 10a, but Janis Rozentals Square 1.
The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 210 concerning detailed rules on the application of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article.
The city of Riga has laid a kind of foundation stone for this idea in 1936, creating the Burkards Dzenis monument to Janis Rozentāls, which stands by the museum.
The then director of the museum, Wilhelms Purvītis, was one of the initiators of the creation of this monument.
In this way, this further action could be quite logical.
I have a bit of a conscience all the time - but Wilhelm Purvītis, where are we going to put his name?!
"But if you, Mr. America, promise to think"... said Bear.
It is reported that the National Museum of Art building officially opened its doors in May this year after major reconstruction and modernization.
This week will finally begin the reconstruction of the VEF Culture Palace.
It’s a great way to get to know people.
It is planned to renovate several rooms of the castle, including two auditoriums, as well as to adapt the building for people with reduced mobility.
The European Commission has today published a report on the state of play of the negotiations on the future of the EU's single market.
"Despite the fact that the political will to start repairs of the VEF Culture Palace, involving the European Structural Funds, is, we are waiting for months for a decision, the real action from the officials of the Ministry of Finance will be the money allocated or not", says Burovs.
Last December, we were told that everything depends on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance received a letter from the European Commission saying that you are making your own decision that Brussels does not make a decision here.
We see now that another circle of discussions is forming, and then we will see what we can expect in the next few days.
“I want to say that Riga City Council no doubt guarantees that this process will be started and completed within the deadlines,” Burovs said.
As reported earlier, more than a year ago, in March 2015, VEF Culture Palace collectively held a farewell concert before the upcoming renovation of the building.
Although a year has passed, the renovation of the building had still not started and collectively continued to work in unsuitable conditions.
In the strategy of the Riga City Council Property Department, the renovation of the VEF Culture Palace is divided into seemingly independent sets of reconstruction works, each of which will ensure the implementation of different functions of the Palace.
The first is to increase the accessibility of the VEF Culture Palace and improve the surrounding area.
It is planned to arrange the surrounding area and utilities, as well as to restore the facade of the building.
The second is the improvement of the VEF Culture Palace service offer.
It plans to restore the interior, walls and ceiling of the building, improve the stage and sound recording studio, as well as arrange the internal engineering communications of the building.
The third is the improvement of the working conditions of creative amateur teams, which includes plans to improve workshop equipment, space heating and ventilation systems.

The exhibition will feature various "Līvu" characterizing objects - photographs arranged in a timeline to reflect the group's activities from the beginning until 2010, when the end of the group's activities is announced.
In addition, there will be performances of stage costumes, musical instruments, awards and concert recordings, as well as other things that have not yet been seen by the general public, which reflected the creative work of the band "Līvi".
The exhibition will be supplemented with items from the Liepaja Museum.
The visual design of the exhibition was created in collaboration with the fashion artist and painter Elita Patmalniece.
It’s also important to remember that you don’t have to be perfect to be perfect.
The origins of "Līvu" can be traced back to 1972, when a vocal instrumental ensemble was created in the Liepaja Culture House, which was led by Juris Pavītols.
The ensemble participated in the festival "Liepājas dzintars" in 1972 and 1974, as well as in the city and republic shows.
In 1976, a fateful meeting took place when Juris Pavītols met Ēriks Ķīģelis and founded a group at the Metalurgs Culture Palace, inviting him to join Ingrīda Gūtmanis, Andris Krūziņš and Jānis Grodums.
Over the years, the group has grown more than once.
Participants have joined, others have gone their own way, some have returned.
However, the main thing - the desire to prove that Latvian rock music is able to live and exist - has remained unchanged.
"What to see was not lacking - denim, hairy and bearded, these boys appreciably differed from the generally accepted stereotype of the stage singer", said music reviewer Klaas Squirrel about the band.
In addition to the musicians mentioned above, the group includes such outstanding musicians as Igo, Vilnis Krieviņš, Modris Šterns, Valdis Štarks, Laimis Rācenājs, Tālis Pusbarnieks, Ainars Virga, Aivars Brīze, Guntars Mucenieks, Dainis Virga, Tomass Kleins and many others.
Entrance to the exhibition is free of charge.
The exhibition is open from August 19th to October 30th.

Bulgaria is experiencing inflation for the first time in 8 months.
In July, Bulgarian state statistics posted a 1% monthly inflation.
This is the highest rate since 2012 and the first above zero since October of the previous year, when it was positive (0.2%).
Annual average inflation by CPI, in the last 12 months (August 2015 – July 2016), compared to the previous year, was -0.8%.
The consumer price index was 101.9% year-on-year in July 2016 and average monthly inflation was 1.0%.
As of the beginning of the year, inflation was -0.2% (July 2016 compared to December 2015) and annual inflation was -0.2% in July 2016, compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016 there was a rise in prices of the following groups of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%); entertainment and cultural events (6.3%), hotels and restaurants (1.2%), and consumer goods and services (0.3%).
Prices decreased for clothing and footwear (2.2%); household appliances and regular household cleaning (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the previous month's level for alcohol and tobacco, management, water, electricity, gas and other types of fuels, communications and education.

Many are already on their way to the celebration of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Aglona.
What message will the faithful receive there this year?
In recent years, the desire to conduct the principal service in Aglona has been expressed by the papal nuncio.
The content of the main message is also up to him.
It is also a kind of tradition that the Way of the Cross is led by Bishop Jānis Bulis.
He will also create his own message.
I'm conducting a festive vigil service the previous day.
Last year I turned to the encyclical "Laudato si" by Pope Francis and actualized the common house captured in it, the theme of the Earth in the context of Latvia.
This year... Of course, I watch what is happening in the world, and I try to respond to it in my address.
My approach coincides with the church’s suggestion that the message of the Gospel should be put at the center of life.
It should be demonstrated that the Gospel responds to the most painful problems of human life and gives him inspiration on the way forward.
Then it speaks to people.
But in Cēsis, in the Lampa discussion, you said that "you must return to the understanding of the full man."
What do you mean?
Does this mean that a person is turning away from the message of the church?
And does the church have such a return resource today?
A man dying on the side of the road is robbed in the Indian capital.
In the Indian capital, no-one has ever seemed to care about a man dying on the side of the road - he turns out to have slept an hour on the side of the road and then been robbed, informs the BBC.
The man, identified as Matibul, was reportedly riding a rickshaw during the day, but worked as a security guard at night.
Mathibul went home at 5:30 a.m. on the road when he was hit by a passenger car.
The surveillance camera record shows the driver got out of the car to look at the victim, and then left.
After an hour, when no one seemed to care about the bleeding man, he was robbed by a man of a garnish.

The reconstructed section of the road has been opened in Medumi.
The Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis, the management of VAS Latvijas Valsts ceļš (LVC), as well as the representatives of the builders SIA "Binders" and local governments today opened the reconstructed Russian border (Grebņeva) - Rezekne-Daugavpils-Lithuania border (Medumi) (A13) section from Medumi to the Lithuanian border (156,4-163,05. km).
Roads are the calling card of the country, especially frontier roads, so it is especially gratifying to discover a reconstructed section on the border with our southern neighbors.
This is another example of how the situation on the country's main roads is improving thanks to the cofinancing of European Union funds.
"According to the forecasts, in this planning period the funds available for roads will be used already in 2018, and we have to think about how to continue to maintain the most busy roads in very good quality, and also to ensure the mobility of inhabitants in all regions of Latvia without the European Union funding", Uldis Augulis emphasized by cutting the symbolic tape.
The Minister for Transport also indicated that the proposals on sustainable financing for Latvian roads prepared by traffic experts will be presented to the government in the near future.
Construction works in the section from Medumi to the Lithuanian border (156,4-163,05 km) were started by SIA Binders last year and this year they were continued after the technological break.
The cost of the reconstruction is EUR 13.5 million (including VAT), the project was co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
"The reconstructed road section has been completely restored and next year repairs will be started in the next stage from Medumi to Daugavpils, so the whole road will be arranged from the border of Lithuania to Daugavpils," said LVC Chairman of the Board Janis Lange.
The country's main roads are the most busy, and by 2018 we plan to have all of the country's main roads in good condition.
The next task will be to maintain them in good quality, ensuring timely periodic maintenance and replacement of the asphalt surface every 7-9 years.
"This will, of course, require adequate funding, and all the travellers look forward to the proposals developed by the expert group for the arrangement of the road financing system," Lange noted.
Within the project there are arranged road connections and lighting in Medumi center.
Significant earthworks have been performed: in four stages large-scale annealing and large-scale excavation and embankment works, leveled longitudinal road profile, which until now was very uneven.
Public transport stops have also been restored and a turnaround area for public transport has been newly constructed.
Previously, the road had insufficient load-bearing capacity and the terrain was not transparent due to hilly valleys, as well as the old road common terrain.
In the next construction season it is planned to restore the road section from the border of Daugavpils city to the now reconstructed section (144,80-156,40 km).
This year the LVC plans to carry out different types of work in more than 1100 kilometres of state roads.

"In order to achieve the desired weight loss results, the right choice of combinations of foods is very important", says Lithuanian nutritionist Laura Romeraite-Kuklieriene.
In addition, it is easy to do in the summer period, when fresh fruits, berries and vegetables grow in our own gardens.
A well-thought-out combination of dietary products can help not only to reduce excess weight, but also to purposefully promote various processes of the body.
Macaroni and vinegar are a successful combination because they provide a long-lasting feeling of satiety and help fight fat.
Research published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition has shown that vinegar has a beneficial effect on blood glucose levels and helps us feel refreshed.
Cayenne pepper and a protein-rich dish such as poultry or protein cocktail not only create a feeling of satiety, but also reduce the craving for large meals for subsequent meals.
Such a combination of dishes is also able to increase the amount of calories burned after a meal by up to 35%.
Studies have shown that Cayenne pepper can help to get rid of fat deposits in the abdominal area.
Eggs contain a metabolism-promoting nutrient - choline, while paprika is a good source of vitamin C.
By taking a sufficient amount of these nutrients, the levels of cortisol can be reduced, hence the accumulation of fat around the middle part of the body.
Oatmeal porridge with the addition of fresh berries is another delicious and fat-burning meal for breakfast, which is worth including in your menu.
Oat flakes and berries contain fiber, which, according to Canadian scientists, control ghrelin - an appetite-stimulating hormone - and thus the feeling of hunger.
In addition, the berries contain polyphenols, which are assistants in reducing weight, and also prevent the formation of fat.
Vegetables and proteins are also able to do wonders in reducing weight.
Such a combination is able to create a feeling of satiety.
Vegetables contain water and fiber, so contribute to the feeling of satiety.
At the same time, proteins slow down the digestive process and provide a feeling of satiety for a long time.
For lunch, you can eat a chicken with a salad or make a protein cocktail from the finished mixture and enjoy it together with your favorite vegetables.
What product combinations to avoid.
Fruits contain sugars - monosaccharides or disaccharides - compounds of one or two molecules.
Starch, on the other hand, contained in vegetables, is a polysaccharide.
Fruits decompose in the stomach mechanically, while chemically they do not degrade until they reach the third or fourth degree in the process of digestion, which occurs in the intestine.
Starch divides into three different stages, which begin already in the mouth.
Therefore, it is important not to eat sweet food immediately after a meal.
When eating sweet food immediately after a meal, it is "capped" in the stomach along with other dishes, where it is not chemically digested and begins to rot.
Do not eat bread, potatoes, peas, bananas, dates, or other carbohydrate-containing foods with lemons, limes, oranges, grapefruits, pineapples, or other acidic fruits.
The enzyme pthialin, which is present in saliva, only works in an alkaline medium.
Fruit acids not only inhibit the digestion of carbohydrates, but also contribute to their fermentation.
Do not eat eggs and meat, nuts and meat, cheese and eggs or cheese and nuts, meat and milk, eggs and milk or nuts and milk and similar combinations of protein-rich products in one meal.
Their processing requires different digestive juices, each of them with different strength, features and time of arrival in the stomach.
Watermelon, honeymelon, musk and other melons should always be eaten separately from other dishes.
Melons are not digested if they are in the stomach along with other foods.
Fat in combination with protein-rich products.
Fats form a successful combination with starch, however, the same can not be said about fats and proteins - fats inhibit the digestion of proteins.
Proteins can be combined with a very small amount of fat.
When consuming large amounts of protein products, avoid eating fat altogether.
This also applies to raw - it is not recommended to combine a large amount of nuts (contains proteins) with whole avocados (contains fats).
Such a combination inhibits effective weight reduction.
How better to cook?
"Cooking, heat treatment leads to a significant loss of nutrients - about 15% to 55% of the initial nutrient composition of the products", says the nutritionist.
In most cases, nutrients go to waste when cooking foods in water.
However, the nutritional value of some foods increases with direct boiling.
After cooking vegetables, the remaining liquid should be used to prepare the soup - in this case, you will not lose the nutrients left in the water, and you will be able to eat them later.
It is recommended to cook vegetables also by steaming them.
Heat treatment significantly increases the bioavailability of the lycopene contained in tomatoes.
When boiling tomatoes for 30 minutes, the amount of lycopene increases by 25%.
Heat treatment also significantly increases the bioavailability of betacarotene, which is found in red, yellow, orange plants such as tomatoes, carrots, sweet potatoes, and spinach.
Heat treatment of eggs and meat deprives them of the natural properties of the proteins contained in them, making them easier to digest.
Also, the heat treatment of meat and eggs makes the iron and other minerals contained in these products more easily absorbed by the body.
It should also be borne in mind that freezing products can reduce the amount of vitamin C from 10% to up to 90%, but the freezing of fiber does not affect.
Beans in combination with tomatoes can increase the intake of iron in the body, which in turn ensures better brain and muscle function.
Our body absorbs up to 33% less non-bleeding iron found in plant products such as beans, leafy greens, cereal products than in animal products such as beef, fish and chicken.
You can significantly increase the body’s absorption of non-bloody iron by eating non-bloody iron-containing foods along with sources of vitamin C such as oranges, tomatoes and berries.
Vitamin C helps to change non-blood-producing iron so that our body absorbs it more easily.
Iron is necessary for the production of hemoglobin, which provides oxygen to the muscles and brain.
To make the most of the salad, add healthy fats such as olive or linseed oil to them.
When making sandwiches with salmon, add vitamin D-rich salmon or sardines-free yogurt, which is a good source of calcium.
Vitamin D increases the amount of calcium absorbed in the intestine and plays an essential role in bone formation.
Oats (as well as other whole grain products) along with sources of vitamin C, such as strawberries, black currants, raspberries and other fruits or berries, help stabilize cholesterol levels, as well as avoid blockage of the arteries.
Snapchat "Anime" effect criticized for Asian cartooning
Snapchat representatives say that this filter is inspired by animation, but some commentators claim that it is racially insensitive.
With this lens effect, Snapchat allows 150 million users to change reality and play with their identity in a completely absurd way on a daily basis.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or an image that would fit into Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Lenses are misty, image-distorting instruments that generate more than 30 million converted selfies per day.
Any mistake quickly becomes public notice.
The effects of Snapchat lenses have been criticized in the past, receiving accusations that the application promotes too blackish or light shades of facial skin as a benchmark of ideal beauty.
This week, new lens effects were published that allow users to make crooked eyes, crooked teeth and round cheeks, with some critics calling it a racist Asian cartoon – a “yellow face”.
Also, the question was asked whether such contradictions did not indicate that the company had greater problems with diversity.
News and public negations flared up on Wednesday when editions of The Verge and Motherboard announced that lens effects had been removed from the app.
The company explained that the objective of the lens is to portray Anime characters rather than to caricature people of Asian descent.
But for those who have experienced racism, these effects resembled the painful stereotypes.
Others categorically denied the similarity to Anime.
A Twitter record of the images by Grace Sparapani, a Korean-born American art student, gained widespread resonance. In an e-mail, she states that the lens effects were "offensive and uncomfortable to say the least".
She added that it was difficult not to notice the obvious similarity between Asian cartoons and lens effects.
This suggests that the lens effect is not simply a yellow face, but a yellow face in a sense of racism.
Snapchat is not the only company that has fallen into this cultural trap.
American culture is also involved in a never-ending struggle for diversity and inclusion, from business meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices we use on a daily basis.
And Snapchat's large youth audience, representing different races, unlike the older population, is more sensitive to such things.
If Snapchat lenses create an image that offends users, then "these things don't go unnoticed today," 25-year-old Katie Jough said in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Jou, Product Manager at Media, deleted his Snapchat app and advised others to do the same.
In her article ‘Medium' and telephone interview, she explained that she felt race-related problems were due to Snapchat's employment policies, which did not sufficiently support racial diversity.
Jou criticized the management of the company, which consists mainly of white men and then concluded his article with the reference #DeleteSnapchat.
"This means that there is no racial diversity in the company, so such decisions are made. Whether a few representatives of other races work in the company, but they do not hold such a position that they can safely and comfortably express their opinions", according to the American woman of Chinese origin Joo.
Her opinion is shared by others, while Snapchat has not responded to her complaint.
The company does not disclose how many employees are represented by different races, indicating that it is a private company.
Snapchat refused to discuss the origin of its employees, but its spokesman revealed that the company had hired a staff specialist who would also focus on representing racial minorities in the company who were not widely represented and would promote inclusion in the company.
Jow, on the other hand, won't update his Snapchat account, adding, "It's interesting if they really need more users like us to realize this isn't right."
The House of Congress states that military officials have misrepresented reports about the Islamic State.
In a statement issued on Thursday, the congressional chamber states that U.S. Central Command members misrepresented reports depicting the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria far more optimistic than it actually is.
Central Command's intelligence analysts express general discontent over the interim report of the task unit set up by the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee, and the Defense Funding Subcommittee's Republican Representatives, stating that their leadership controlled reports of American successes in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as Centcom, is a military base in Tampa, Florida that oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The latest news of the report says that intelligence reports, endorsed by high-ranking Centcom executives, reflect the U.S. fight against terrorism more positively than it actually is. The facts were routinely misrepresented, portraying better achievements than other intelligence analyses suggest.
California Republican Representative Ken Calvert says, "Centcom's actions are unacceptable - our soldiers are the ones who suffer if our policy makers receive false reports."
Centcom's management errors can be traced back to the top management of the organization.
This 10-page report details ongoing problems in Central Command coverage and analysis of American efforts to prepare Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While this does not provide conclusive evidence that senior officials of the Obama administration have caused the reports to be distorted, it does suggest that the Centcom leadership has put some pressure on analysts to portray a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL).
The report notes that in the first half of 2015, press releases, statements and reports from the Central Administration to Congress portrayed the situation in a significantly more positive light than it actually was.
For example, Centcom representatives publicly stated that the Mosul recovery operation could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul is Iraq's second largest city, still under Islamic State control.
Representative Mike Pompeo of the Kansas Republican Party states in his report, "A months-long investigation clearly confirms this."
Between mid-2014 and mid-2015, key U.S. Central Administration officials misrepresented reports depicting ISIS's threats in Iraq weaker than they were in fact.
The Republican Party formed a task force on learning that analysts were concerned that information about the Islamic State was being misrepresented.
As the investigation continues, the report released on Thursday will be followed by new findings in the case.
The Ministry of Defence's General Inspectorate conducts an investigation into Centcom's intelligence activities.
Members of the Intelligence Authority Committee's Democrat Party released their own report on Thursday, in which they agree with some of the conclusions of the Republican Party's Task Force.
Democrat Representative Adam B. Schiff, in his report, states that between 2014 and 2015, Centcom over-restricted the production of intelligence assessments reports related to ISIS and Iraqi Security Forces.
Mr. Schiff explains that this process "stopped the dissemination of information," worsened analysts' work ethic, and "distributed facts that were not true."
But Schiff and members of the Democrat Party added that there was no evidence that the White House had pressured Centcom analysts to produce reports, in line with "pre-determined or political positions."
The Daily Beast published preliminary results of the congressional inquiry on Thursday.
In August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon's inspector general's inspection launched an investigation following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans stated that the Pentagon would not comment on the congressional report while the investigation continued.
He also added that experts sometimes interpret complex data in different ways, and the Ministry of Defence and the intelligence authority are calling for a constructive dialogue on vital national security issues.
The investigation is not limited to the question of whether the American-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is a success (an allegation made by an increasing number of Defense Ministry representatives).
But last year's accusations call into question whether President Obama can fully rely on reports from Central Administration about military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hotspots.
The criticism regarding Islamic State intelligence is reminiscent of events more than a decade old when Centcom's intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker released a study claiming that the George W. Bush administration launched the Afghan war with too little thought of its possible consequences.
Hooker also played an important role in the revelation of the Islamic State's intelligence issue.
Last year, official representatives reported that the Hooker team discovered that, contrary to public reports, air raids on Islamic State oil plants had not significantly worsened the financial situation of the terrorist group, as they had built temporary plants to sell oil on the black market.
The Times reported in the September edition that this discovery did not come outside the walls of Central Authority.
General Lloyd Austin III, commander of Centcom at the time, received sharp criticism as many lawmakers believed that the war reports described the situation too positively.
In April, General Austin retired and was succeeded by General Joseph L. Votel.
In the United States in a duel with Great Britain in women's field hockey, wins the United States, thus gaining already the fourth win in a row.
A day after winning over Japan with a score of 6:1, on Thursday Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the U.S. women's field hockey team when the American women defeated the Indian team with a score of 3:0.
If you’re looking for a way to lose weight, this is a great place to start.
She said, "I have no idea."
I'm not one of those people who counts my goals.
But she knows that the American result at the Olympics is 4:0, which gives them a draw with Great Britain in their group, which on Thursday, after winning over Japan with a score of 2:0, remained undefeated.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday to play the last match of the first round games.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals and the game will only determine which team will take first place in the six-team group and which second.
The first place winner will avoid a meeting with the strong Dutch team, which is the leader of the second group, a little longer.
The European Commission has adopted a new strategy for the EU’s external relations with third countries, which aims to improve the functioning of the EU’s external borders.
That team also included Bama
She grew up in Blubel, took the field hockey stick in her hands for the first time at the age of 3 (her older twin sisters were already engaged in this sport in Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16 years old, becoming the youngest player in history for the team.
She did not go to the 2008 Olympics because she did not enter the final.
But 2012 was unsuccessful for her and her team.
The following year, English Craig Parham was appointed as the team's coach and everything changed for good.
Bama called it "cultural, mental and physical change."
We did not invest as much work in London as we do now.
We have changed everything.
In Thursday's game, Bama opened the score, scoring a goal at the first half time with a rear shot from a close distance.
India started the game without winning their account, but their team was very fierce and held a minimal score of 0:1 until the end of the third period, when Bama scored repeatedly.
In addition to the above, we may also share your personal data with third parties for the purposes set out above.
In the middle of the fourth period, Melissa Gonzales scored another goal.
This was the first dry game of the Jackie Brig of the U.S. Goalkeeper, bringing in one goal in each of the first three games.
She's running in.
And so does Bama.
"We're doing very well right now," Paham said, but how well, will show the game on Saturday.
The most depressing food of the depression period is the "Satisfying Meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his election as president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the oval room to have a meal.
President Roosevelt tasted fine culinary delicacies such as goose liver pate, or fuagre, and Maryland turtle soup.
But that day his meal was much more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes, and in dessert - plum pudding.
Jane Ziegelmann says, "It's a way to show solidarity in cooking with people who were doing very hard."
Her husband, Andrew Kou, adds, "It's also a message to Americans how they should eat."
The couple from the Brooklyn Heights district are food historians.
Kou's last book, "Vegetable Stitching", describes Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelmann's book, "97 Apples", describes life through food in a tenement house in eastern Manhattan.
Their new collaborative work, The Hearty Meal, to be published by Harper on Tuesday, is a story about American food during the Great Depression.
Showing some solidarity in cooking, they ate a meal together at the Reporters' Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a simple lunch diner located in the Flatiron area operating from 1929, when the Great Depression began.
Mrs. Ziegelman, 54, ordered a sandwich with processed cheese and chopped olives, while 57-year-old Kou ordered turkey, potato porridge and vegetable salad.
When the reporter ordered the fake bunny, the couple admitted that his choice was very appropriate for the conversation about the food of the Great Depression time .
Mrs. Ziegelmann said that the fake bunny was very popular.
There was a peanut bunny, a liver bunny, and a bean bunny.
They were made from basic ingredients and other ingredients that enriched the meal.
Imagine what it's like to eat so many peanuts that they're instead of lunch.
Mr. Kou moaned.
"It must have seemed like the belly was full of lead," he added.
During the pre-depression years, the American dining table resembled a buffet table, especially in rural areas.
Women were cooking for their husband-workers and freshly cooked casseroles were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
During the First World War, it was the Americans who sent the Europeans food. The "satisfying meal" describes how the Americans adapted to circumstances when America suddenly ceased to be a land of abundance.
"At the time, food became the main focus of the American people on a daily basis," says Mr. Kou, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write specifically on this topic.
Equally significant were the new budget diets: unknown foods such as the fake hare and stews became commonplace, stews were "a great way to use leftovers," Ms. Ziegelman noted, as cooks could hide the unattractive ingredients under a creamy sauce.
The fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit.
Meat, which had been a key ingredient in American meals for years, now became an extremely rare luxury item.
At a time when the number of calories and the nutritional value of food were more important than taste, new, as yet unseen formations were born.
In an ancient cookbook, Mrs. Ziegelmann found a recipe for making onions filled with peanut butter.
Mr. Kou adds, "It was not a popular addition to the dining table."
Mrs. Ziegelmann emphasizes, "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and fried onion are incompatible.
Many recipes of homemade dishes adapted to the difficult times.
Household economists such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Household Economics from 1923 to 1943, determined the eating habits of the state that had not been experienced before or after the Great Depression.
By publishing articles and recipes in newspapers and magazines, they advised housewives to become "economists" and accept challenges such as turning the pasta and carrot mix into a delicious meal.
"The hearty meal" is a feast of historical treats.
Evidence of the government's attitude towards its starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "let me eat cake" attitude, is particularly interesting.
Although he publicly told of his simple childhood and catering in Iowa, he actually ate like the fine millionaire he had become.
Mr. Kou says, "He liked European cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce."
He ate in an almost gilded living room wearing a lunch jacket.
He was totally detached from reality.
President Roosevelt would have made the same mistake unless his wife Eleanor had advised him to set an example with her eating habits.
The book says that Roosevelt hired a housemaid who was not able to cook, so the White House became the place "where not only was served one of the most unpalatable dishes in Washington, but also the worst cooked dishes".
As soon as the country's economy recovered, most of the culinary customs of the depression era disappeared.
But we continue to pay attention to calories and nutritional value, as well as how to apply science in cooking, added Mrs. Ziegelman.
The couple say that when they wrote the book, they gained a greater understanding of Mrs. Ziegelman's mother's eating habits, such as why she was unable to throw food out.
"She was truly afraid to throw out the food," Mr. Kou said.
Ms. Ziegelmann said, "She actually freaked people out."
There was once an incident with wind cakes.
After we had eaten at Eisenberg's diner, a couple of writers pulled a homemade dessert from their bag: the plum pudding that President Roosevelt used to eat for lunch.
"It's plum whipped cream," Ms. Ziegelmann said, adding that at the time it was a common habit to give a chic name to modest dishes.
It does not contain whipped cream, just prunes, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
All impatiently dipped the spoons in the brown mass that was on the plates.
Surprisingly, it wasn't that bad.
Mr. Kou ate a few more bites.
Sounding like an experienced "economist", he said to his wife, "A pinch of ground hazelnut."
Gilead Will Receive Reimbursement for Legal Expenses in Combating Merck for Hepatitis C Patent
The district judge has ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to get back the costs of legal services it has paid in the case for breaking the Hepatitis C patent against the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was acquitted in a case of a 200 million pound fine for breaking two Merck patents that threatened it in connection with the successful Sovaldi and Harvoni tablets when a U.S. federal judge found irregularities in Merk's activities, such as lying after taking an oath and other unethical acts.
In the trial on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman pointed out that Gilead has the right to claim compensation for legal expenses it has incurred in defending the case.
Merck is trying to gain a position on the market against Gilead, which dominates the market with a new generation of Hepatitis C drugs that are effective in 90% of liver diseases.
The case was started as early as 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other in an attempt to gain ownership of the newly developed active component, sofosbuvir, a major component of Gilead's medicines.
The U.S.-backed forces claim to have taken full control of the city of Manbij from the Islamic State.
The US-backed forces have taken full control of the city of Manbij in the northern part of the country near the Turkish border and the last Islamic State soldiers have left the city, a spokesman for the group said Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) are currently clearing the city of the last opposing fighters who have not yet left the city.
They have freed more than 2,000 hostages-civilians who had been captured by militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDS's ally, the Manbij military council, told Reuters news agency.
"The city is now under our full control and we are conducting a search for militants", he told Reuters agency.
Clinton's income reached $10.75 million in 2015 and the couple paid a 34.2 percent federal tax rate.
Hillary Clinton released the 2015 tax return on Friday, showing that the Democratic Party's presidential candidate and her husband have earned $10.75 million this year and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent accordingly.
During 2015, the Clintons have donated $1 million, mostly to their Clinton charity. Former President Bill Clinton earned about $5.3 million, performing as Speaker and former Secretary of State earned $3 million in income from his book on his work for the State Department, published in collaboration with Simon & Schuster.
Clinton's election ally - U.S. Virginia state senator Tim Kane and his wife Anna Holton have released their tax return for the past 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a federal tax rate of 20.3 percent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set new standards for financial transparency", said Clinton's campaign partner Jennifer Palmieri in a statement.
Donald Trump, on the other hand, hides behind various pretexts and disclaimers so that promises to disclose his tax information are not fulfilled.
Making paid tax information public is a recording practice for U.S. presidential candidates, but it is not required by law.
New York businessman Trump and his attorneys cite the State Revenue Service's audit as a reason not to disclose tax information.
"Your move," said Clinton's campaign partner Ian Sam on his Twitter entry, about the tax information of the Democrat party's candidate.
On Thursday, Trump's special adviser, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release tax information until audits had been completed.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican Party presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republicans, argue that his refusal raises questions about his true amounts of property, donations, and other commitments to his business, including his commitment to Russia.
Clinton poured oil on the fire, releasing a video on Friday, where several influential Republicans are demanding Trump release his tax information.
She returned to the issue once again during an economic speech on Thursday in Michigan.
She told the crowd, "He refuses to do what the other presidential candidates have been doing for decades."
"Politico" said Trump had paid very little or no taxes for two years during the 1990s, and the author of the New York Times business column said Friday that many accountants and lawyers believe that nothing has changed today.
Federal tax rates are an important issue in this presidential election.
Clinton, in support of billionaire Mighty Buffett's proposal, promotes the idea that anyone who earns more than $1 million a year must pay a tax of at least 30%.
This proposal is also supported by President Barack Obama.
Last week during Clinton's performance in Omaha, Nebraska, where his "Berkshire Hathaway" conglomerate is also based, Buffett called for Trump to exchange tax returns.
Baffett said that he too was undergoing an audit of the Revenue Service and Trump was afraid of voters rather than the tax authority.
Clinton's campaign has released tax information up until 2007.
The Clintons now live in Chappaqua, New York and have paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent and a total tax rate of about 40.5 percent between 2007 and 2014.
The Clintons' 2015 tax review shows that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income is a salary.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, from which the Clintons have received $109,000 in dividends.

Jewish film director criticises hotel in Berlin for disconnecting Israeli long-distance code at the request of an Arab - RT News
The director of the French film of Jewish origin stormed social media when he discovered that the Israeli long-distance code was not available at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin.
Claude Lanzmann, director of the documentary about the Holocaust Shoah, did not hide his dissatisfaction with the Berlin-Kempinski Bristol hotel and addressed an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During a recent visit, Lanzman attempted to find Israel's long-distance code on the hotel's proposed list.
However, this country was not included in the list of countries to which you can call directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible that Israel was swept away and destroyed in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany?
Written by Lanzman.
Instead, the Kempinski Bristol hotel offers to call this country through its call center.
The director requested an explanation from the hotel staff.
Lanzman writes that the response he received "has shocked him."
The hotel administrator explained that "this was a deliberate decision of the hotel management".
The reason for the removal of the code further enraged the film director.
"Most of the guests are Arab and they requested the deletion of the Israeli code," Lantzman quotes an explanation from a hotel employee.
Suddeutsche Zeitung states that the Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadda-Handelsman allegedly called the incident a "great shame".
We are surprised and shocked by this incident.
This in itself is a great shame.
And the fact that this has happened in Germany is an even greater humiliation in this hotel chain.
Explanations are not required.
The official stated, "We hope the hotel will draw the right conclusions".
This event was also quite widespread on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.
Others believe that the Kempinski Hotel has simply indulged Arab customers.
Another record said "ashamedly", indicating that the hotel was located on Kurfurstendamm Street next to the synagogue.
In addition to the above, we may also share your personal data with third parties for the following purposes:
"We have not received a direct order to remove Israel from the list of country numbers," Suddeutsche Zeitung quotes a representative of Kempinski.
The code was added to the list again.
Police use rubber bullets and tear gas against protesting Brazilian students.
The clash between students and police took place on Thursday in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil, where students rallied in a demonstration against reforms to the government's education system.
Police used rubber bullets and tear gas against students.
Problems began when law enforcement tried to drive out students, resulting in the police applying rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstration to show their dislike of the reforms of the education system.
The proposal by Governor of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmina provides for the closure of nearly 100 public schools, while 300,000 students will be relocated to other schools with the intention of saving money.
Some demonstrators drew graffiti on the walls with messages against interim President Michael Temer.
This protest came just days after the previous protest, when students gathered in demonstrations with the aim of expressing support for the suspended president Dilma Rousef, whose impeachment was voted for by the senate.
Scott Kelum Skinner finishes first, bringing the gold medal in cycling to Great Britain
Kelum Skinner from Scotland finished first in the men's cycling team sprint race at the Rio velodrome, which took place last night. The British team secured its champion title, which it won at the 2012 London Games.
The 23-year-old athlete from Glasgow played an important role in these races, making the legendary Scottish Sir Chris Hoy proud and bringing down the winning favourites for New Zealand.
Four years ago, Britain won an amazing victory when Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they also repeated it at the World Championships in London, although Hoy had already finished his career as an athlete.
The problems were in the stage between the Beijing and London Olympics, as the experienced starter Jamie Staff had to be replaced.
They managed it at the last minute.
When Hoy left, Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill his place.
It’s a great way to get to know each other better.
Hindes, Kenny - champions who started four years ago with Hoy and Skinner, who set an Olympic qualification record, but the race better start was for the New Zealand team
However, the British trio won gold medals.
Hindes was in close propulsion after his lap, Kenny took the lead and Skinner secured that lead.
The change of strategy played an important role in the victory as the Hindes drove a larger gear to allow Kenny and Skinner in particular to drive faster.
Hoy watched the race as a spokesperson for the BBC and caught the eyes of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes the moment they climbed the podium.
The 23-year-old Glasgowman said, "It was an unspeakable honor."
I'm doing everything to defend my name.
In the final we set the Olympic record and defeated the World Champions.
It was just incredible.
There is no better victory.
After winning with Kenny and Hoy at the 2012 Olympics in London, Hindes confessed that he intentionally fell on the track after failing to start.
He later refuted this comment and British competitors were unable to prove otherwise.
There were no such incidents this time.
Hindes said, "British flags in the stands recalled London."
Over the past 3 months, we have become a united team.
We have lost so many World Championships, so winning the Olympics was really special.
One medal in the race for the country, which won seven of the ten gold medals in cycling in Beijing and London.
If this achievement is an indicator of the team's progress over the last five months, then the next five days will be very exciting.
Given Kenny's result, he could really repeat Hoy's success by winning three Olympic gold medals.
For Kenny, this would mean six won gold and one silver medal. In addition, Kenny was also born on March 23 (it appears that this is a British holy date, since Steve Regreiv, Mo Farah and Roger Banister were also born on that day).
Hoy was also born on this date.
Kenny's next race is the sprint, which starts today and will continue for the next three days.
The 28-year-old athlete from Bolton said, "I just enjoy it all right now.
Team travel is always the best.
Because then you can win with your teammates.
To be honest, winning one is a little lonely."
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be appointed to the knighthood."
That day it was the only fight for medals, but it was not the only good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggin, Ed Clancy, Steve Burk, and Ovein Doul showed the fastest qualifying time in a four kilometer inning of fours.
Their time was 3:51.943
The world record, which was set in London in 2012, is 3:51.659.
The first round and final will take place today in the second half of the day, where Wiggin will definitely be the focus of attention.
He had disagreements with the commissar yesterday before his qualifying trip, when he was called by the judges to measure his height.
On the women's trip, which will continue and close today, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker, and Katie Archibald of Milngavie set a new record time of 4:13.260.
The British delegation hopes that the British cycling team will win medals in the middle of the Olympics in the hope of winning medals.
Remembering the excellent and unprecedented performance in Beijing and London, everyone expects the same achievements in Rio as well.
Meanwhile, various have gone behind the scenes, after accusations of sexism and harassment of respect, technical director Shane Saton resigned, and Hoy and Victoria Bendleton also end their careers.
But with the start of the first cycling race, it seems that Britain will always reach the highest level at the right time.
The future of the Portland smelter is becoming uncertain as an ambitious contract is aborted.
The future of the aluminum smelter and hundreds of its employees in Portland, Victoria has become uncertain, as its main customer, the energy company, has announced a cessation of cooperation.
This announcement is based on plans by the Victorian government to stop subsidising the energy company, which is vital for the company to continue to work.
The 20 years of subsidies will cease in November.
As a result, more than 2,000 jobs at the Alcoa Portland factory are at risk.
Up to 2,000 direct and indirect jobs could be at risk.
In addition, it will also have unpredictable side effects, as the smelter consumes about 10 percent of all Victorian power supply.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the "Point Henry" smelter, which led to the interruption in the operation of the Anglesea power station.
The Alcoa Portland smelt works at a loss and can be closed.
These events were triggered by years of speculation about the appreciation of the Australian dollar and the cost of production at the plant.
AGL, the energy supplier of the plant, which supplies energy from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latroube Valley, says the other three owners will likely also terminate their contracts.
Most of the power plant is owned by Alcoa and Alumia joint venture, in addition to the company's shares are owned by Chinese CITIC and Marubeni Corp holding companies.
"AGL" looks forward to continuing operations at the Portland plant, which would mean further energy supplies to the smelter," its spokesman said.
AGL stated that the contracts are so-called "risk limiting contracts", which are expected to enter into force from November 2016.
Contracts have a 12-month validity period and will therefore remain in force until 2017.
"AGL" plans to receive revenue from these contracts also in fiscal year 2017," a spokesman for the company said.
Starting from fiscal year 2018, the potential impact on profits is limited by favourable market forecasts for wholesale electricity prices in the future.
“AGL” claims to have already factored $187 million in losses into its forecasts, with the expectation that these contracts will be terminated.
Alcoa says that the decision to terminate the contracts will not affect the ability of Alcoa to continue operation of the smelter or to supply it with energy.
The U.S. company says that in 2010 it signed a contract with Loy Yang for 20 years, but in November it will be terminated. The company does not explain why it will cease cooperation.
Analysts have raised concerns about both the potential closure of the Portland smelter in Victoria and the closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle, due to the industry's weak economy.
Steven Mickelson, CEO of AGL, said last week that Portland uses 600 megawatts of energy and 900 megawatts of tomago during the year, according to analysts estimates.
If both of these plants were to leave the energy market, then energy demand would fall significantly.
And that wouldn't be good at all.
The Community legal centre rejects 160,000 people each year.
The demands of more than 160,000 people are rejected every year, and the situation could get worse as the budget goes down.
Three out of five people in Queensland - mostly pensioners, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the means to fight illegal eviction - are refused free legal aid and representation.
The Community legal centre, which is already overburdened, warns that the situation will only get worse as funding decreases.
Already from June of next year, these legal centres will receive 30% less funding than before.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Legal Center, said the latest report from the National Legal Centers Association says that at the moment, legal aid is being refused to thousands of people in need.
Mr. Farrell pointed out that if this decision is not overturned, the situation will only get worse.
He also says, "The Queensland legal centre is constantly under-funded, meaning that aid is refused to thousands of people in need."
People who are trying to end violent relationships, people with deep debts, families who are going through a divorce, workers who are unfairly fired - all these people have legal problems and this report shows that they are not getting the help they need.
As of June 2017, the federal government will cut funding by 30 percent, meaning that several thousand more Queenslanders will have to deal with their complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Attorney General and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately halt the cuts so that people in need of legal aid can get it.
Last year, the government unveiled its plans to raise the level of legal aid to the national average.
Now it's time to focus on the needs of local communities and their customers and the government of Palazchuk to invest in this important area.
Donald Trump's campaign sued because one of the employees pulled out a firearm
New York: Donald Trump's campaign organizers sued because they had not acted upon receiving information that their North Carolina operations manager turned a firearm against a staff member when they were driving in the same car in February.
This incident was described in a court action filed in Charlotte Court on Wednesday by Vincent Bordini - a former campaign programmer.
Bordini said that he had been waiting for months for an internal review of the case to begin, but realised that this would not happen.
The driver, Earl Philip, "pulled out a pistol, put his right index finger on the cock and turned the barrel against Vincent's knee", Bordini claims in his complaint.
He also claims that by filing complaints to local and regional campaign management, Bordini learned that at least four more people had experienced the same.
"Weapons do not need to be fired to cause damage," according to Bordini in his complaint.
Just two days before this case was filed, a Republican Party candidate for president sparked a scandal by telling people that "People of the Second Amendment", i.e. gun owners and enthusiasts, could act in case his rival Hillary Clinton and his elected judges won the election.
Trump campaigners stated that the media had taken his words out of context, and he had never incited anyone to violence.
Bordini, with his demand, wants to recover compensation from campaign organisers for negligent surveillance, and from Phillips for assault, unlawful use of a weapon, and creating emotional stress.
Trump's spokeswoman, Houpa Hicks, did not comment immediately.
Failed to contact Phillips.
WCCB - Charlotte's local news agency says Philip has recently left the campaign.
He also failed to call his consulting firm "Innovative Consulting Services".
Republican Party presidential candidate Donald Trump has conducted a controversial election campaign.

A new tradition - parish and sports festival in Ķīciems.
This is the first time that people have gathered for the first time in Ķīciems for a parish and sports festival.
After celebrating ten years, this time it was decided that there would be no more Lake Festivals.
A new page has now been reshuffled.
The day began with sports competitions.
This time the race was not in traditional ways and too serious to take, because, for example, darts had to be thrown at a sleeping target, the boot flew, with the left hand of the person thrown, "balling" was not at all at any Olympics.
However, each participant could show how strong, brave, agile and resourceful he is.
It’s a great way to get to know people and make them happy.
In the meantime, there was also a "children's corner", where the little ones could break into inflatable attractions and get a new image in the make-up of their faces.
A new thing that could become a tradition was the parade of motorbikes and tractors.
In order to ensure a high level of consumer protection, the Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) concerning the definition of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

It is good that the parish is filled with five little girls and one little boy.

Britain must maintain the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow.
Heathrow will not only promote prosperity and growth in the local regions and London, but also throughout the country.
This, in my opinion, makes Heathrow very attractive, as it did in London in 2012, where we put a huge amount of work so that all the regions of the country can benefit from the Olympic Games.
Stratford and Eastend won an enormous amount from the Olympics.
And we will do it again by providing local people and businesses with business opportunities near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we will create 10 000 new business opportunities, 40 000 new jobs and finally put an end to youth unemployment around Heathrow.
As in the London Olympics in 2012, this time there will be people who believe that this challenge is too great and that the expansion of Heathrow is too ambitious.
People at the time said that Britain would never get ready for the Olympics and that it would be a worldwide failure.
The skeptics were wrong about 2012, and in the case of Heathrow, they will not be right either.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow has overcome everything so far.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that will benefit society as a whole, not individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, economic growth of 211 billion, creating the ground for both employment and experience at this airport and throughout Britain.
Heathrow has an excellent team that has created an 11 billion-pound infrastructure investment programme within the time frame and budget, starting with Terminal 5, which has been named the best airport terminal in the world for five years and ending with Terminal 2, which is built between the two most intensively used runways in the world.
They are now ready to set up a third runway, which will be financed by private investment of 16 billion pounds.
The 2012 London Olympic Games were a great success, and I am sure that this will also be the case with the expansion of Heathrow.
It is time to revive the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing the future of our trade and creating a new employment environment that Britain could be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton is a board member of Heathrow and former Secretary of Commercial Affairs for the Ministry of Economic Affairs.
In Switzerland, a woman runs onto a highway in an attempt to commit suicide.
The victim slept on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are attempting to find witnesses to the accident when she was crossed over several cars early on Thursday morning on the highway.
The accident occurred on Thursday shortly after midnight on the A1 road near the city of Morge in the canton of Vo.
Vo's cantonal police report says that desperately wanting to commit suicide, the woman was lying down on the road in the dark, where she was run over by several cars.
In a clear attempt to kill himself, the victim, a 49-year-old Swiss woman, ran into several cars, including a truck.
She died at the scene.
Several of the drivers involved in the accident have already given evidence, but others involved have not yet been identified, say police, who are calling for the drivers involved and witnesses to the accident.
A criminal investigation has also been launched into the case, which is a logical step in this case, lawyer Gilles Hofsteller told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it is not yet known whether any of the drivers involved will be punished.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
Hofsteller adds, "This will be clarified by the prosecutor."
Two similar cases that have occurred in the last 5 years indicate that none of the drivers will be prosecuted.
In both cases, the pedestrian had gone out on the highway in the middle of the night, so it was decided that drivers could not predict that there would be a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night, according to the newspaper.
Last year, a policewoman was acquitted of killing by negligence when she drove off a man who was lying on the A1 road near Paijerne in the middle of the night.
It’s a great way to get to know each other.
The court concluded that the policewoman, who was on her way to the scene of the accident, was driving in a manner appropriate to the circumstances and the judge recognized that the sleeping man on the road was a "totally unpredictable and extreme case".
Anyone who has information about the accident that occurred on Thursday near Morge is invited to contact the police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
This is the first time in my life that I’ve ever seen such a thing.

Latvenergo follows the process of opening the gas market also from the position of a potential trader.
“Latvenergo” follows the process of opening the gas market both from the consumer and from the position of a potential trader, said Ivita Bidere, the company’s press secretary.
"The decision on whether Latvenergo will join the gas market also as a trader in the future will be determined by what model of the gas market and the legal framework will be established."
"Therefore, from our side, we are actively involved in creating and commenting on regulatory enactments, as well as submitting our proposals", Bidere said.
The Agency BNS already wrote that the Ministry of Economics (EM) in cooperation with the Public Utilities Commission and the energy company Latvijas Gāze has developed a draft Cabinet Regulation "Regulations for the Sale and Use of Natural Gas" that will change the existing principles of operation of the natural gas market, as of 3 April 2017 providing natural gas users with the right to freely choose a natural gas trader.
When working on the new regulation of the natural gas market, the aim of the EM is to make the trade process of natural gas as simple and user-friendly as possible.
Therefore, as the most efficient and user-friendly service solution, the "central model of the trader" is chosen, in which all activities related to customer service are provided by the trader - one contract, one invoice and one information provision and customer service location, leaving the technical issues of the natural gas distribution system to the discretion of the distribution system operator.
A similar solution is currently being implemented in the electricity trade.
We would like to remind that a gradual opening of the market is planned for household users - even after 3 April 2017, those household users who do not want to choose another natural gas trader will be able to continue receiving natural gas from the existing trader at a regulated price, thus becoming related users.
"In this case, the obligation to supply natural gas to connected users at a regulated price is imposed on the public trader", the Ministry informed.
In turn, merchants will have to choose a natural gas trader with whom they have to conclude a natural gas trade contract.
Until the conclusion of the natural gas trade contract, the existing natural gas trader will ensure the trade of natural gas for a certain period of time for a specified price.
The Cabinet Regulation project details the rights and obligations of the natural gas trader, the system operator and users.
This Regulation prescribes the procedures by which natural gas shall be supplied to customers and the supply thereof shall be suspended, the requirements for the safe use of the natural gas system, the rights and obligations of a trader, public trader, system operator, user and the owner of a gasified object in the supply and use of natural gas; the procedures by which payments for the services received, the amount of late payment interest, the procedures for the change of traders and the supply of users in case of natural gas supply shall be ensured by a public trader.

Oil prices continue to rise; stock indices in the US and Europe are on the rise, as well as the value of the US dollar.
Oil prices in the world continue to rise on Friday morning, with investors’ sentiments positively impacted by statements by the Saudi Arabian oil minister, which reinforces expectations that major oil-producing countries will take action to stabilise the global oil market at the upcoming OPEC meeting in September.
The three main US stock indices reached record levels on Thursday, which had not been observed since 1999.
The main positive factor in the market was the rise in oil prices and the strong financial performance of several large companies.
The rise in oil prices and strong financial indicators of several companies on Thursday were also the reason for the rise in European stock indexes.
The value of the US dollar rose on Thursday relative to the euro, relative to the British pound and relative to the Japanese yen.

The company’s management report states that in 2015 the company was operating at a loss due to several reasons, including a constant lack of working capital caused by Unicredit Bank’s exit from the Baltic market, ceasing its previously existing credit line, and leaving the Blue Lagoon with concluded contracts without being able to execute them.
As a result, the company did not have sufficient funds to buy cheaper raw materials in large quantities and receive a volume discount.
The withdrawal of the respective bank from the Latvian market also prevented the company from implementing European Union structural funds support projects, which would have allowed the plant to purchase new production equipment and modernize its infrastructure.
The financial indicators of the company in the last year were also negatively affected by the rise in the prices of raw materials and the unwillingness of customers to pay more for the goods produced by the company.
"Only in the second half of July 2016 customers acknowledged the changes in prices and were ready to buy goods for the new - the highest - prices," the company's management said.
In 2015, Blue Lagoon also began negotiations with potential investors, including valuation of the company’s movable and immovable property.
Investors have already been with Unicredit Leasing, the company's largest creditor, where the parties have met and discussed possible investment plans.
At the same time, the company’s operations and development were positively influenced by the implementation of the restructuring and optimization plan started in 2014 and 2015.
This plan included the improvement and optimization of technological processes, which allows achieving greater productivity and capacity of production.
“There were a number of devices purchased that provide a higher speed of production,” the company’s management said.
It is also important to note that the equipment purchased in 2016 will allow the company’s plant to fulfill orders that had not been possible before.
The first batch of products to be produced on this equipment will be ready in August.
Since there have already been signed letters of intent for the sale of the product, all produced will be sold according to the letters of intent.
The new product will increase turnover by about 300 thousand euros per month”, the company’s management points out.
In August 2016, the company also plans to sign a cooperation agreement on the supply of fish products to Iraq.
"Blue Lagoon" in 2016 sent the first experimental container to Israel, expanded the market to Cyprus and this year in September will sign a cooperation agreement with a new supermarket chain in the United States.
As a result of all the above measures, the company plans to increase its turnover.
In 2014 "Blue Lagoon" worked with a turnover of 6.347 million euros and a loss of 5.113 million euros.
"Blue Lagoon" was founded in 1997 and its share capital is EUR 1.156 million.
The company belongs to two Latvian individuals - Mikhail Kaidanov (89.11%) and Igor Širšon (10.89%).
Welcome to the museum at 15 a.m. to see cinema diva Zāra Leandere and participate in a press conference.
Riga can be considered the city of beginning and inspiration for the beloved film diva Saara Leandere.
In 1924, Zara Lendere visited her godmother Ruth, who was the Swedish ambassador to Latvia, and in Riga it turned out to be fatal, because it was she who discovered Zara Leandere’s woman’s unusual low contralto, which she tried to make her debut on the stage of the Riga cabaret theatre.
Perhaps it was the accidental fun in Riga that became the fateful turn on the creative path of Zara towards the glory of the world.
Riga was associated with warm memories for Zara Leandere, and she hoped to come to Riga for guest performances, but unfortunately these hopes were not destined to come true as World War II began.
This meeting will take place at the Riga Festival 2016 and the great Ieva Kerēvica will play the role of the outstanding Saara Leandere.
There are a lot of traffic restrictions in the Aglona area.
In order to ensure the safety of the participants of the reception of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Heaven, starting from 17.00 on 12 August until 18.00 on 15 August, the transit traffic of trucks along several national roads in the vicinity of Aglona will be closed, SJSC Latvijas Valsts ceļi informed.
It’s time to start a new chapter in your life.
It should be noted that in the section of the motorway P62 Krāslava-Preiļi-Madona from Krāslava to Krāslava station (0,80-4,00 km) construction works take place and only public transport and pedestrians will be able to cross the Aglona during the festival.
This is the first time I’ve ever seen a movie like this.
Traditionally, a large number of participants, including pilgrims, arrive to this festival.
Therefore, motorists should be especially careful, because on different road routes towards Aglona there will be intensive pedestrian movement.
We encourage drivers to be aware of the traffic restrictions introduced, to follow the order of traffic organization, as well as to take into account possible longer travelling time.

Kurdish activists occupy the German public broadcaster building.
A Kurdish group of 30 took a public broadcaster's WDR building in Dusseldorf on Thursday evening, where they held nearly two hours of protest action, German police reported.
The demonstrators, who came with their posters they took with them, chanted various slogans, trying to draw attention to the current situation in Turkey.

The insurer pays compensation to the passengers of the flight cancelled at the airport on Wednesday.
If Insurance has paid travel insurance indemnity to a family for the cancellation of the flight at Riga Airport on Wednesday, 10 August, due to which they had to refuse the planned visit to the music festival.
On 11 August, If Insurance received an application for compensation from a client.
The family had planned to go to a music festival in Belgium, but as it was not possible to do so on Wednesday due to cancelled flights at the airport, the client was charged a fee for booking accommodation that could no longer be cancelled, as well as for purchased festival tickets in the amount of 204 euros.
In turn, the airline has promised to compensate the customers for the money spent on the plane tickets.
If Insurance covers all travel insurance claims, on average in 15% of cases compensation is paid for interruption or cancellation of the trip.
"Such times, expenses are reimbursed for the purchase, return or exchange of tickets, as well as for the reservation of accommodation", says Dagnija Rutka, Head of the If Insurance Person Risk Insurance Product.
As you know, on the evening of 10 August a private aircraft stopped on the runway of Riga Airport due to technical problems, therefore several departing flights were cancelled, but several incoming flights had to be diverted to other airports.

The independent expert has developed his opinion, but the building authority considers it incomplete and superficial.
The expert has not indicated whether metal lattice of this load-bearing structure is affected, so there is no certainty that the owner of the lower apartment is being threatened.
“We have therefore requested additional clarification from this expert,” says Ilze Žūka, representative of the Riga City Construction Board.
Despite the ban on any repairs in the upper apartment, from there it is still heard that the construction continues.
The penalty for arbitrary construction without a construction permit is from 70 to 700 euros, but in this case the penalty can be much more severe.

“This is an unprecedented case in the practice of the building authority, where in this way, due to their ignorance or simply unwillingness, residents may have created a threat not only to their property, but also to the owner of the lower property, as a result of which this owner cannot exploit their property,” says the representative of the building authority.
Now it is time for Dmitry to look for another place to live - at relatives, friends, in a hotel or rent another apartment.
But Dmitri can try to recover the losses from his neighbour in a civil legal way, which can take a lot of time.
Due to arbitrary construction, it is currently prohibited to stay in both apartments until the civil engineer gives his conclusion, and it may take up to three weeks.

The conversion of the former Kemeri sanatorium into a five-star hotel will cost EUR 22 million.
If you want to know more about how to make money online, here are a few tips to help you make money online.
The establishment of the hotel is the first stage of the restoration of the former sanatorium in Kemeri.
The second stage will be the wellness clinic, which is scheduled to open in 2022, while the hotel is scheduled to open in May 2018.
Želve notes that the exact cost of the clinic is not yet known.
It’s a great way to get to know each other better.
The clinic will be located on three floors.
The owner of Park Hotel Ķemeri and the planned clinic is the international foundation G Capital Europe, which invests in European assets.
“G Capital Europe has several investors who invest money in this fund,” says Želve.
As George Jones, CEO of G Capital Europe, said earlier, it is planned to invest 12 to 15 million euros in the development of the former resort polyclinic, with the total investment amount exceeding 30 million euros.
It has already been reported that in the restoration of the cultural-historical park with an area of more than 42 hectares, in the restoration of access roads and street sections, in the construction of an interactive nature tourism object, in the improvement of the territory and in the construction of a parking lot on Emīls Dārziņa Street, which will promote the socio-economic development of Jūrmala city and increase the number of tourists, Jūrmala City Council plans to attract from the European Union funds 14.5 million euros, co-financed with three to four million.
This is the first time I’ve ever seen a movie like this.
As reported, in the historical sanatorium complex "Kemeri" it is planned to build a five-star hotel "Park Hotel Ķemeri" and "wellness" or wellness clinic.
However, the reconstruction lasted longer.
The 2010 report further stated that Ominasis would regularly communicate with the hotel operator Kempinski, which continues to provide daily technical control in the sanatorium Ķemeri, and in 2011 would definitely be "completed reconstruction of the future hotel Ķemeri" and the preparations for the opening of the Kempinski chain hotel would begin immediately.
In October 2014, the Ķemeri sanatorium property set owned by the insolvent Ominasis Latvia was confirmed at the auction by Park Hotel Ķemeri, but one month later the auction was declared as not having taken place because the winner had not paid for the purchase within the specified time.
The price of the sale was set according to the starting price of the last auction, EUR 2.86 million.

The President will present the Order of the Three Stars to the opera singer Antonenko.
It’s important to note that this is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur.
It’s not just a matter of how much money you’re spending.
According to the information provided by the Latvian National Opera and Ballet (LNOB), Antonenko graduated from the Jāzeps Mediņš College of Music in 1998, where he studied wind instruments and singing with Margarita Gruzdeva.
It’s a great way to get to know people and make them happy.
In 1997 he started singing in the Latvian National Opera choir, but in 1998 he made his debut with the role of Oberto in G.F.Hendel's opera Alcīna.
He received the "Great Music Award 2003" for his vocal performance in opera performances and Verdi's Requiem.
It is noted that in the 2004/05 season it has become the most internationally recognized tenor of Latvia, which is represented by the largest opera houses in the world.
Since the autumn of 2004 he has been singing at the Deutsche Oper am Rhein, Berlin and Graz Opera, Dresden Semperoper, Oslo and Stockholm Royal Opera, London Covent Garden Opera, Monte Carlo Opera, Vienna State Opera, as well as the Geneva, Dresden and Dusseldorf Opera and Salzburg Festival.
In 2009, Antonenko made his debut with great success at the Metropolitan Opera in the role of Prince in "The Mermaid".
In 2011 Antonenko with Riccardo Muti and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra sang the title role of "Othello" at the Paris Opera, Covent Garden Opera he sang in the new production of Luigi's "The Camp", as well as in Stockholm participated in the production of "Girl from the West" by Christoph Loy.
A year later, Antonenko sang the role of Othello with great success at the Covent Garden Opera in London.
The e-mail of former NATO commander Brāllov has been hacked by Russian hackers.
The hackers, who hacked the computers of the US National Committee of Democrats (DNC), may have made several other cyber attacks, including hacking an email from NATO's European forces former commander Philip Brawlow and servers of the George Soros Institute's Open Society, said the business news agency Bloomberg on Thursday.
The hackers have published the information on the site "DCLeaks.com".
It’s a good idea to take care of your feet every day.
For hackers, the institute's computers have been available for a whole year.
It’s also important to remember that you don’t have to be an expert in your field to make sure that you’re getting the best results.
The Wall Street Journal reports that US President Barack Obama’s administration is currently investigating the issue of imposing new sanctions on Russia in response to the hacking of DNC computers.
To enforce sanctions, the administration will have to formally prosecute Russia or hackers backed by Russian authorities in a cyber attack on Democratic Party servers.
The website WikiLeaks released about 20,000 e-mails from the DNC's computer system in July, from which it is clear that the leaders of the Democrat party have tried to harm the party's candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign of former rival Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders in the fight for the run-up to the Democrats' nominations in the presidential election.
According to U.S. press sources, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which conducts investigations into democrat server hacking, as well as other U.S. special services, believes that Russia's connection with the cyber attack is almost unquestionable.
McCartney: The presence of Yoko Ono threatened The Beatles.
It’s a great way to get to know each other better.
The 74-year-old rock star currently maintains a "good" relationship with the late John Lennon's widow, but at the time she went to the band to visit the recording studio, McCartney was frightened because Ono was the only woman among the band's members - George Harrison, Ringo Starr, Lennon and McCartney.
When asked about the relationship between the two, the singer replied to Rolling Stone magazine, "It's really good."
We felt threatened at the time.
While we were recording, she was sitting on boosters.
Most of the group could not tolerate this.
We were able to do it, but not very successfully, because we were very tense.
We weren't sexists, but the girls didn't usually come to the recording studio, they let us work.
When John started dating Yoko, she wasn't sitting in the control room, but in the middle of our four.
The author of "Yellow Submarine" has also admitted that he is now in regular contact with former bandmate Ringo, and from time to time approves of the work plans of the recording studio "Apple", but otherwise "The Beatles" have "ended to work".
When asked if he was still dating the other only still living member of the legendary rock band, McCartney told Rolling Stone magazine, "Often no."
We meet at social events and parties.
But I don't go to meetings, I feel a little isolated from it.
I left Apple during a hard divorce.
In my place, I sent John Eastman to the meetings and said, "Refer to me what everyone says because I can't stand sitting at that table".
It was too painful to see our pet die.
The company now works so I just listen to all the records.
I am part of the approval process.
NASA's climate model: Venus used to be a habitable planet
Based on NASA's latest climate models, Venus has once been a habitable planet.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Space Research Institute have developed a model to explore the history of Venus using tools and algorithms that climate scientists also use.
The model was developed to determine whether there had ever been Earth-like conditions on Venus, whose surface is hot, where there is no water, and whose atmosphere consists almost exclusively of carbon.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus’ slow rate of rotation is due to the dense atmosphere.
However, the latest simulations show that Venus once had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and turned slowly.
The model also looks at Venus's earlier topography.
There have been more dry areas on the planet than there have been on Earth, but there has been enough water and geographical diversity on it to allow life to form and to prevent the evaporation of water.
In early Venusian times, the sun was 30 percent brighter.
In the simulation of the GISS model, Venus's spin pattern reveals that the light part of the day on it lasts 2 months, the GISS scientist Antony Del Genio explained in a press release.
This process heats the planet's surface and causes rain, which in turn forms thick layers of clouds that act as an umbrella, protecting the planet from the sun's heat.
This results in a moderate climate temperature, which is actually a few degrees lower than the temperature on Earth today.
The model represents the history of Venus, which is similar to the theory of evolution developed by scientists in their hypotheses.
Although it was once habitable, Venus has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet rays for billions of years.
Its oceans evaporated, and the spirits were burned by ultraviolet rays.
As the water completely evaporated, only the thin carbon dioxide atmosphere with a deadly greenhouse gas remained - Venus as we know it today.
Scientists published the results of the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
On Thursday, Colorado Avalanche coach and vice president of hockey operations Patrick Roy filed his resignation citing, as a reason, the insufficient impact in the team's decision-making process.
Vice President and General Manager of Colorado Joe Sakik confirmed this news and informed that the club would immediately start looking for a new coach.
“For the past three years, I have been energetically, enthusiastically, and purposefully pursuing my duties as head coach and vice president of ice hockey operations at the Colorado Club,” says Roy, 50 years old.
During this summer, I've thought a lot about how I could improve the team's performance to give it the brilliance it needs and achieve higher level results.
To achieve this, the visions of the head coach and vice president of hockey operations must fully coincide with those of the organization.
He should also be able to influence decisions relating to team performance.
At present, these conditions are not met.
Sakik, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.
Sakik said Patrick informed him of his decision today.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization and wish him all the best in the future.
In his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014, Roy was recognized as the league's top coach and received the Jack Adams Award.
He helped the club to 112 points and first place in the Central Division, but in the first round of the playoffs Colorado defeated Minnesota hockey. Since then, the club has not entered the playoffs for two years.
The Avalanche finished the 2015-2016 season with a score of 39-39-4 and remained five points behind the Wild team without winning the Western Conference organizers' second special invitation.

North Sea oil rig workers resume talks and strike
It’s a great way to get to know people and make them feel good about themselves.
Periodic strikes are being held against the oil processing company Wood Group on the North Sea oil platforms in which the company Royal Dutch Shell operates.
The joint statement says that the Wood Group and Unite and RMT unions have agreed to resume negotiations to resolve the dispute.
Over the coming weeks, several full-day meetings are scheduled to begin early next week, with a view to re-examining the problematic issues.
Trade unions said that their recent actions, organized after more than 25 years of suspension, were against the planned 30 percent wage cut.
Due to the negative market pressure, the Wood Group reduced wages for North Sea workers by 9 percent this year.
Already in 2014, the company reduced the wages of land workers by 10 percent.
The company explains that additional salary cuts would allow the company to survive the market downturn.
Shell, on the other hand, has already reduced wages for several thousand people and announced plans to cut oil and natural gas operations in 10 countries to optimise its work in preparation for a large-scale merger deal with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of falling oil prices, and the situation is further complicated by Britain's decision to leave the European Union.
Earlier in the week, Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with workers' representatives to discuss one of the most important issues - North Sea strike plans.
He said the North Sea was vital to the region's economy.
In his report, he explains that the North Sea and the country as a whole need an economy that benefits everyone, not individuals.
Nearly $1.4 billion is expected to be invested in new North Sea projects in 2016, compared to $7 billion invested over the past five years.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of stars in the Pleiades constellation.
The latest Kepler telescope mission has helped astronomers compile the most complete catalog of the speed of stars in the constellation of Pleiades.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars rotate at different speeds in this constellation, as well as how the speed of stars is related to the formation of planets.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other constellations, we will get more information about the relationship between the mass of stars, age and even the history of its solar system," said Pasadena Caltech Infrared Process and Analytical Center scientist Luisa Rebula in a news release.
The constellation of Pleiades is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many stars in this constellation are just beginning to rise, reaching about 125 million years of age.
They rotate at maximum speed.
When rotated at maximum speed, these rising stars emit large amounts of star wind.
As the winds get into the magnetic field of the stars, they brake the stars.
As stars age, their rate of rotation decreases.
Kepler measures the rate of rotation of each star by determining the time between the appearance of recognizable areas of stars such as sunspots.
The latest catalogue of star velocity shows that larger stars spin slower than smaller stars.
Rebul compares stars to dancers, dancers of larger stature perform pyretes more slowly than dancers of small stature.
Rebul tells us that Pleyade's "ballet" shows that slowly rotating objects are larger and more massive, while faster rotating objects are very small stars.
Due to the fact that the constellation Pleiades is so close, it serves as an excellent space laboratory, where you can compare the characteristics of stars with spin speeds.
Rebul says that the Pleiades constellation helps create theoretical models for star rotation in both directions for both older and younger stars.
We still have a lot to learn how, when and why the speed of rotation of stars slows down and about their complete stopping process.
Rebul and his colleagues presented in detail an analysis of Pleiades' stellar rotation rates in three new publications to be published shortly in the Astronomy Journal.
