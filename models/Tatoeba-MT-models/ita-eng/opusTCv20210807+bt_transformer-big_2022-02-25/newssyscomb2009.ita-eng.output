The triumph of right-wing populists in Austria: in total they have 29%
The perceptible weakening of both parties existing in the grand coalition and this marked strengthening of right-wing populist parties, led, according to the first provisional results, to early parliamentary elections on Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (VP), within which the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously faltering, has suffered particularly strong losses.
On the contrary, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZ?), the sub-prefect of K?rnten J?rg Haider, is preparing the triumphant return in national politics.
According to the provisional results, the strongest party in the country remains the socio-democratic party (SP) with 29.8% of the vote, compared to the last elections in 2006 it loses 5.5%.
Even worse, it went for ?VP, who lost with 25.6% almost 9% of the vote.
These are the worst results of these two great parties in the Austrian post-war history and above all the literally catastrophic result of the popular, which provoked early elections.
Even at the beginning of July, when the ?VP abandoned the coalition, the popular had in the preferences ahead of SP? a considerable advantage.
But voters evidently punished them for sinking the government.
Already in early reactions to the results there has been speculation about the possible resignation of the party's president, Vice Chancellor Wilhelm Monterer.
Observers believe that they could take place as early as Monday during the extraordinary convocation of party leadership.
This evolution should perhaps facilitate the path towards the increasingly likely way out of the election result, i.e. towards the renewal of the SP- and ?VP coalition.
Regarding the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the liberals (FP) have gained 18% early and the BZ- 11% of votes- but the socio-democratics have simultaneously revealed the concern of another 1999, when the populists agreed with the popular to the collective government, (then the FP- was still united, in 2005 it separated from the BZ-) which was even a cause for sanctions by the Union.
On this evolution Haider evidently plays, who has already stated that he is ready to collaborate with any party and presumes a return to Vienna in national politics.
The Green Party also managed to enter the Parliament but fell slightly, falling among the Austrian political parties from third to fifth place.
No other party has clearly passed the 4% threshold and has not entered Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can be cooled
If the problem could not be solved with Czech scientists being accused of illegal beetle collection in India, it would happen according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The Minister mentioned this in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If it were not resolved, then it would be some cooling," he noted after the meeting which took place under Czech initiative.
Mukherjee after the negotiations said that the executive power can hardly meddle in legal matters.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Avecha, who was acquitted of the charge and punished with a fine, the central government can negotiate with the local one in Dardjeeling which falls under his jurisdiction.
"Your problem could be solved," the Minister said.
According to Mukherjee it would be better, for Emil Kusera sentenced to three years in prison, to resort to a higher instance.
Then he can demand release on bail and wait for the sentence to be released.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that, his partner expressed himself the same way during the negotiations.
"Recommend the appeal to the Major Court then it will be possible to obtain the pardon," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can get into the matter is to lend the condemned the "competent legal support", the Indian Minister argued.
At the same time he said that such support is already lending him the Indian side.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations that have been handed down for many years with India.
Indians admit it too," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he said to TK, in front of his partner he stressed that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We truly consider the imprisonment and prosecution of these Czech scientists to be a profound mistake," he said.
The minister avoided answering the question of whether he got on the Indian side the promise to deal with the matter.
"I've gotten relatively many promises," he just noted.
A Czech judge in the battle for the seabed
It approaches the electronic map on the wall on which Australia and adjacent marine areas are drawn.
But he is not interested in the continent but in a small spot lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is at the same time as the continent itself, says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of a team of 33 OSN Division workers for ocean and maritime rights issues.
His boss, the Czech Lawyer Director of the Division, Vaclav Mikulka, is following his exposure and occasionally adds something.
It dominates the desire to work and enthusiasm.
The seabed still hides a little-known world rich in natural resources.
It is possible to find oil, metal ores and other mineral materials, but also living organisms that are unknown until now that carry within themselves the key to the discovery of cancer medicine.
The largest seabed on the mainland
Coastal states have begun to lend interest to submarine territory.
According to the OSN convention, they are appropriating the laws on which they made an agreement in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf that often extends up to several hundred kilometers from the coast of the state in question.
That has, according to the convention, an exclusive right over all the resources of the continental shelf.
"In short, the continental shelf means that part of the seabed and its subsoil which is a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
The so-called exclusive economic zone extends beyond the territorial sea often beyond 200 nautical miles," Mikulka explains.
The request for which the country submits to the Continental Shelf Size Defining Board must be accompanied by very extensive scientific and technical documentation based on many costly surveys and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparation.
"One of our tasks is to provide the committee with legal and technical-professional aid.
The commission has so far dealt with 5 requests namely Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three nominees were successful," Mikulka adds.
The recent success of Australia which has greatly expanded its marine holdings has registered a worldwide echo.
But New Zealand also gained us - the surface of the seabed, which was assigned to it by the commission last week, of about 1.6 square kilometers so more or less six times larger than the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in research.
Profit, which will yield to him in the future from the seabed, as they promise will be invaluable.
Other states will also gradually submit their demands.
They can do so for ten years since the "Montego Bay Convention" was ratified.
Where the continental shelf ends the area of the ocean floor begins which the convention has declared to be a common heritage of humanity."
No state here now has an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by this international institution established by the Convention.
"But the seabed is not Klondike," director Mikulka says exaggeratingly, "with the fact that its individual parts are legally demarcated and their regime contractually established."
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed now also belongs to the Czech Republic.
If it shares it with other states of the former Soviet bloc within the framework of the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This acquired in 1991 according to the convention, as well as investors from a few other states, the status of so-called "pioneer investor".
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean extended between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor and little larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is jagged, it is a near submarine replica of Tatry.
"It is possible to extract on the total area of 75 000 square kilometers.
The area is a field rich in polymetallic agglomerations containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," explains another Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A worker from the division of Macedonia Rober Sandev brings with him an exhibit to show it.
It looks like a small potato or with a little fantasy, a legendary scheme, as in the legend of the Golem awakening.
German special units were present at the release of the hostages
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany for the release of the hostages – experts then arrived.
When the situation became critical, the special units were ready, but did not intervene.
On the circumstances of the release of the 11 hostages seized in Europe, we are getting more and more detailed information.
German special units participated in the rescue operation as quoted by the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior.
In addition to the army specialists there were GSG9 units, the Federal Avian Police, the Federal Criminal Office as well as logistical experts from the technical institution.
As the ministry spokesman reported on Monday night, German units did not intervene because the kidnappers, given the danger of a force intervention, released the hostages fleeing.
The Egyptian government accepted the help offered by the Germans, to join as assistance directly on the spot.
"We didn't get there luckily," says an interior ministry spokesman.
Aggressors kidnapped a group of travellers on 19 September in southern Egypt: 5 Germans, 5 Italians, one Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian escorts.
After the kidnapping in a deserted area in southern Egypt the hostages were deported to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers to the end remained secret as well as details of the release or possible ransom payments.
The freedmen meanwhile arrived in good condition in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the freed hostages are under the protection of the German embassy.
It did not explain the details of the release.
There had been no information in Berlin by the time they returned to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild" the 5 vacationers and special units are expected to leave in flight with an Air Force Airbus and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives rejects the rescue package.
The first U.S. congressional chamber just bankrupted the $700 billion bailout package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell low.
With 206 entries towards 227 the American representative house rejected the government's rescue package for the financial markets.
Despite U.S. President George W. Bush's appeals and prominent politicians from both parties there had not been a majority for the program, with which the chaos of financial markets should have been stemmed.
In a dramatic action supporters have tried desperately, to persuade critics from the heavy $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the negotiations, incited MPs to consent, even though the plan was unpopular.
8. It is difficult to have gratitude to avoid something, which has not yet arrived..
While suffrage was underway the Dow Jones collapsed more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The reason for investors' concerns was that the state bailout package could have failed.
He recovered before the end of the vote and then, after the announcement of the failure, collapsed again.
Experts now expect more serious turbulence in international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, it must have the approval of both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate.
Promoters record increasing numbers of bookings
It looks like it will be a good winter for German tour operators:
According to a study the turnover on travel bookings for the next few months compared to the previous year has clearly increased - for the winter season even more than 30%.
Despite weak economic views the desire to travel of the Germans according to an investigation remains firm.
On the reservations for the winter season the travel agencies recorded a plus of the turnover of 31 % compared to the same period of the previous year , as the German association for tourism DRV made known on Monday in Berlin.
According to the survey of the market research institute GfK there are increased booking quotas even already for the autumn months.
So the surplus of travel agencies for October compared with 2007 would have amounted to about 11%, the DRV reported.
Alleged for these results are the figures of the GfK, which monthly analyzes the booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and develops statistical projections for the entire market.
Also included would be travel bookings made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar quotation, required in particular would be travel to the United States, the DRV reported.
Here the increase in bookings would amount to about a third.
They would also be particularly popular with Germans in Spain, Turkey, Greece, as well as locations within Germany.
Especially the all-inclusive trips have a high quote, explained DRV president Klaus Laepple.
Considering the rising costs for energy and food, the costs in this case would be "better calculated for customers than for an individually organized holiday".
Consumers could save money through, among others, discounts for bookings made well in advance or offers with everything included, Laepple explained.
Even the summer months would have recorded excellent booking figures, so much so that compared to the year before there would have been a surplus of turnover again - although according to a further study the number of Germans who embarked on a journey, compared to the previous year has fallen.
My first time at Oktoberfest
Ballermann hits, one-litre mug beer and vip in Dirndln branded.
A Debut at Wiesn
Susanne Kronzucker and I actually don't have much in common.
She is blonde, television moderator and wears a custom-made Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is second-hand.
One thing, however, unites us: just 3 minutes at Wiesn, already the photographers throw themselves at us and take pictures until they fill the memory of the cameras – very flattering, and this on my first visit to Wiesn.
That's how friends make each other
The cheap Dirndl seems to achieve its purpose.
As a Wiesn tourist and actually living north of the white sausage equator, the sense of well-being in the costume/dress to this day still remains within limits.
And instead once you get to Theresienwiese, it's nothing serious.
Almost everyone wears the Dirndl or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed – all perfectly normal.
Only my Dirndl's apron picks up strange looks at the chocolate banana stand.
A Monacense woman points out to me that I would have fastened the apron incorrectly: "On the left you are free, in the center you are a virgin, on the right you are busy, behind a widow."
I'll sneak up on the bow from back to left.
All right," he says and laughs.
Others make less of a waste of subtle flirting techniques and wear sober felt hats, on which he heads "To Drunk to Get Dressed!" and iron his bare back against an uninvited one.
The boy with exhibitionist leanings is named Bob, he comes from England and also visits Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a "oooooo" trail.
This tells me, after he got rid of his one-litre beer mug drunk earlier.
Right next to one of these hydrants, which everyone thinks is a garbage can.
Bob is one of these infamous "Wildbieslers."
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At about 8 o'clock in the evening they walk in packs on the forecourt of the feast the sanitary men, who must take care of the poor beons
Nurses appear each time in herds – always 4 at a time drag a tent-covered stretcher into a tent.
This works as with most visitors to the Wiesn: you go empty, you return full.
Those who lie under the tarp in this blood alcohol-rate coffin, you can't see.
"Des sind die, wos goarnimmer packn", one of the sanitariums screams at me and disappears into the baraonda.
Victim of an incident identified by police
A 63-year-old woman who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle while walking in Essex was identified.
Carole Paulson, of Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the incident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but died shortly thereafter.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on charges of reckless driving.
He was released on bail.
Turkey is broadening diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey tried to enter the European Union, the European powers were anxious to penetrate deep into the Turkish hinterland.
On the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 steps into Asia, is one of the finest relics of this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo-Renaissance style.
That's at least what the tour guides tell you.
The building stands between the end of the platforms with a tower on each of its corners looking at the world as some German provincial municipalities.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building slightly decaying.
But once inside the ticket office from the vaulted ceiling, there is no doubt about the magnitude of the feat of what was the westernmost passage.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a laggard to the imperial game, wanted to realize its ambitions to dominate the Middle East by means of this railroad that ran to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond in what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany's imperial ambitions sank during World War I.
His railroads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
Its isolation from the surrounding region, generated by the icy borders of the Cold War, has passed
British and Dominant forces advanced out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was bad news for Hyderpasha station as well.
In 1917 an ammunition train broke out destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then it has slowly decayed, largely surpassed by history.
But nowadays, this railway outlet for Anatolia and all points to the east, serve - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's ever-larger diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development party - the AKP - has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
Its isolation from its surrounding regions, generated by the icy borders of the Cold War, has passed.
Now there is a new policy of commitment.
Remarkably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To estimate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded the sleeping car for the Turkish capital Ankara, to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the AKP, the Turkish deputy Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a run of jolts along the tracks that produced the ancient world cadences of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - proposed as a new city for a secular state intent on turning its back on its Ottoman past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots represents an exemplary shift in Turkish consensus.
He suggested some suspicions in the West, most notably in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by half-built shopping malls and power bakeries, where managers in business suits - both men and women - meet to make early morning contracts.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician from almost every other political party in Europe.
Complete, tie, I'm sure he also had a Blackberry.
"The purpose of the foreign policy party now is to reintegrate Turkey with its closest neighbors.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he tells me.
Turkey was cut off from its hinterland.
Today it has to look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't the case with one or the other.
They must be both.
"But surely at some point, "I ask, "Will Turkey be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he says, "does not want where to face that choice."
Then he points out a point that almost everyone I have spoken to here has recited by heart: the ties of not only the Middle East, but also the Caucasus, and all around the Black Sea, are as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, The whole of Europe can metaphorically travel those railway lines eastward through Asia and into the Middle East.
Back at the Hydarpasha station, after another night off, I think of those two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who had looked at this building built 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to find that Europe's Middle Eastern ambitions can now be, to a large extent, in Turkey's hands.
And while I wait at the terminal for the ferry that takes me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey has always been called "the sick man of Europe".
Then at least there seemed to be no doubt as to which continent should make claims about this fascinating country.
Lives Remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As musical director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrology, September 11) had in charge the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and choir.
As a member of his music scheme for the municipality, the following year he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus.
They were supposed to be under-21/ under the age of 21, but by the time the Proteus sang its final in 1979, many of us were in our 20s - we simply refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being-mutable) represented the good will of the choir and the ability to deal with everything the music presented to do, both madrigals and Messiaen, without accompaniment or with the whole orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often astonishing, always exciting, and it was all because of the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant through the years.
How often we were told by Tod to "let music speak for itself".
He had said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in the music.
So sing it!"
His technique in using the wand was absolutely clear and precise, though never dictatorial nor flowered.
Whatever the musical standard, it made him more and more elevated.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If you were to knight a conductor it would be Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
During the past 40 years and more I have covered more than 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I have never disagreed with just one of them - and many times inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He hated conductors who, in his own words, simply "rided around the world one or two well-known battlehorses".
He's gonna miss so many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary by William Woodruff (25 September) specifies that "in 1946 he resumed studying economic history at Oxford and in 1950 became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... studying at the same time for a degree in science, one in letters and a PhD".
This follows from Woodruff's note in Beyond Nab End, but is incorrect.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a university professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, at which time he completed a PhD thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J. D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He spent 1950-51 in the US as a researcher at Houblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he permanently left Nottingham for Illinois.
Because Woodruff chose to cover this part of his career, it is not known.
J. Vincent Resino at the Faculty of Philology
"I recommend José Vicente Resino's exhibition "Flamenco y vida", because his black and white photographs, in documentary style, are extraordinary.
They attracted my attention for the simplicity and strength they convey, while treating the protagonists with particular respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feeling.
Resino manages to capture magical moments."
Second assault for Honda supersales
In November, Honda will begin marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the previous model was already equipped with great habitability, this new minivan has an even larger interior space.
A refined mechanics must be added to everything, which increases driving comfort and saves fuel.
Evolution vs. Revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz has a line very similar to that of the previous model, the changes in this minivan are numerous.
Among others, it is worth mentioning an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before moving on to analyze the new model, it is useful to note that this new Jazz comes six years after the market entry of the first generation.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than those used by other manufacturers.
Although the Jazz model is less well-known in Europe than in other markets, it remains a unique sales phenomenon.
This is exactly the case in Japan, where Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
Almost one million units of Jazz have been sold in Japan since its launch.
The second market was that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
Despite these numbers, Honda believes that the new Jazz will allow sales to increase in the segment.
Thus, if in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of this model, for 2009 the estimates are around 100,000 cars, assuming an increase in sales of 17% in the European market.
As for the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, accounting for 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, those responsible for the Spanish branch expect to sell around 2,000 units of Jazz over a year.
Just the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda . to reduce by good measure the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, the company's managers expect to arrive at the end of the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, or 4,000 less than in 2007, with a drop of 16%.
Despite the increase in sales Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
In addition, the Japanese company expects to reach 2% in 2010.
In order to do so, Honda is confident that another new model will arrive.
It is Insight, a five-door hybrid and compact size - 4.37 meters in length - of which the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200,000 units a year worldwide.
For markets and according to estimates made by the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight's sales will take place in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, immediately after the company presentation in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has grown in all its parts.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the wheelbase 2.50 meters, with an increase of five centimeters.
The height, however, remained unchanged at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in size, the habitable interior is also expanded.
This advantage comes from the insertion of a new platform on the one hand, and the introduction of the fuel tank in the central position on the other, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz model.
In addition, the capacity of the trunk – equipped with a double background – rises to 399 litres, that is, 19 litres more than the capacity of the first generation.
It should be noted that these are the measurements of the 1.4 engine version, and that the boot capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements, such as rear leds or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - concern an improvement in accessibility to the rear seats.
The doors that allow access to the rear positions, in fact, open at an angle of 80 degrees, compared to 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
In addition, the engines in this second generation of jazz are also new.
At the time of marketing, this small model will be proposed in models with 1.2 and 1.4 litre petrol engines.
Both mechanics include i-VTEC technology that lowers fuel consumption, produces less carbon dioxide emissions, optimizes the mechanics and at the same time keeps the engine torque high in all its phases.
The 1.2-litre model allows a power of 90 hp at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm. at 4,900 rpm.
The propulsion – which in the previous Jazz reached 78 horsepower – uses 5.3 liters of fuel and produces CO2 emissions of about 125 grams.
Compared to the earlier propulsion, which in the first generation model used 83 horsepower, 100 are now available.
The Jazz 1.4 to 100 horsepower achieves a combination of 5.4 liters of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 emitted.
The "bee car" to avoid collisions
As part of the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan has been inspired, this time, by nature, and in particular by bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, taking the flight of bees as an example, knows how to avoid accidents.
It is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which is the first step towards collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.'s Advanced Technical Center developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Scientific and Technological Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Brand Management Development, the BR23C is an expansion of Nissan's four-area Safety Shield.
This robot is intended to improve the ability to prevent collisions in the manufacturer's vehicles.
During the flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space that is very similar to Nissan's safety shield.
But the most important thing is the bee's compound eyes, which can see in all directions at an angle above 300 degrees, and which allow the insect to fly without interruption in its personal space.
To recreate this visual functionality, engineers have developed what they called a laser range finder.
This mechanism detects obstacles that are in front of the BR23C for a radius within two meters and with a maximum amplitude of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor that immediately, allows to prevent collision.
"The moment it detects an obstacle, the small robot mimics the movements of a bee and immediately changes direction by turning on the wheels at right angles or greater to avoid collision.
The most obvious difference with any assisted system is that the evasion maneuver is totally instinctive.
"If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot deviate up or down, nor even diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction in which it can turn its wheels and not exploiting infinite directions and ways as bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid collisions.
"This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and to act from this data.
It does not require the storage of information or the intuitive logic of previous maneuvers, so it can work without interruption and with only a couple dozen KB of memory.
This may come as a surprise, but we're not talking about gigabytes of memory, and not even mega."
It is the first step towards developing new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology that Nissan hopes will be standard in cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than the lithium ion type.
Another potential future application of this technology could be the integration of the units with a GPS satellite navigation system to bring the driver to their destination while avoiding the obstacles present in the route.
Tremble before applying for a loan
We must recognize that the U.S. Department of the Treasury, in addition to owning a lot of capital to intervene, is certainly not lacking in ingenuity.
Faced with the crisis and to prevent Americans from engaging in junk mortgages in banks with dubious insolvency, they have created a fun and instructive game for network users: "Bad Credit Hotel".
In other words, the "Hotel of bad credit"...or problems.
The bleak appearance of this arrangement and, in particular, of its receptionist serves to induce one to think not once, but two or even three times before applying for a loan.
And most importantly, where to do it, which is probably the primary goal.
Certainly the information that the game provides is useful, but it is not very detailed.
It is more of a page for teenagers than a site for the general public.
What happens if you complete the game?
Well, there's a songo room inside the hotel.
It's still something, because to buy a better house not if it even speaks...
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced the signing of an agreement with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, which will invest nine billion dollars in a 21% stake in the Company, a news report received following a sharp decline in its shares on the Stock Exchange.
A week after a provisional deal was struck, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's stock at an individual cost of $25.25, or a sum of $3 billion.
The established price is 19% lower than the book value of the securities at 31 August.
MUFG will also invest $6 billion in the purchase of convertible securities at a conversion price of $31.25, ensuring a 10% return.
Morgan Stanley has specified that the global operation would be carried out on the basis of an average price of 29 dollars in title, that is a percentage lower than its current course of 28%.
By 17.00 the Morgan Stanley stock was down 6.79% to $23.07, however.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition into a bank holding company," said John Mack, chief executive of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new charter last week, which should allow it to differentiate its shares while making them come under the control of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms how the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's biggest names to adopt a much more cautious attitude than they had previously taken.
The modalities defined on Monday also show that in the last few days the agreement has been modified: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced the sale of 20% of its shares to the Japanese giant for a sum of $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno, executive director of MUFG, explained: "We thought our stake would be exclusively composed of ordinary shares.
But considering the current situation of the world economy and the market, we have chosen to minimize risks and protect ourselves."
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will obtain Morgan Stanley securities at a price below their accounting value of 7%.
And the transaction would result in an investment of at least 20% of equity on a diluted basis."
The agreement provides that the MUFG will be able to convert in a year half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares if, during a given period, the latter are exchanged more than 50% below the fixed conversion price, or about $47.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the capital provided by MUFG would allow it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokesman for the group, however, declined to provide details regarding the strategic plans of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley is therefore expected to establish a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said it had "clearly" lightened its budget as of the end of August.
The last few weeks have put a strain on the group, which has seen the value of its shares halved while the cost of risk insurance has skyrocketed.
Cost that flowed back on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" among Wall Street's major investment banks after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the takeover of Merrill Lynch, announced it had raised $15 billion, in part at Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa à Quito, us Mondays.
To found the republic on a socialism of its own in the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chavez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
On Sunday, following the example of colleagues and friends, it was the latter who gave voice to the project of a new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since, according to official results, 64% of voters voted "yes" in the referendum, on a vote basis of 80%.
According to these results, the "no" was 28%, while 7% of the vote was null and 0.7% white ballots.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it should get half of the votes, plus one.
On Sunday, two polls carried out at the exit of polling stations and an estimate of a non-governmental organization had announced an overwhelming "yes" victory, placing it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had, on the other hand, claimed the victory of his draft Constitution on the night between Sunday and Monday.
The "Constitution has triumphed gloriously", he had assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians within the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As always, Chavez and Morales congratulated Rafael Correa, as did his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The ballot, which took place calmly according to the election observation mission of the Organization of American States (OEA), was based on a 444-point text designed to consolidate the "new socialism" defended by the president.
This draft Constitution consecrates the power of the state over the economy, reserving it the "planning of development" of a country that essentially lives off the oil extraction carried out by large foreign companies and consequently their currency.
Conceived by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants more power to the head of state, who can be elected for two consecutive terms of four years, to have the opportunity to dissolve the assembly.
Correa has already announced its intention to take advantage of this amendment and to re-apply for a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution also states the gratuity of health and education services, which the president has begun to promote in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It also prohibits the presence of foreign troops, a provision that will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts seized ten days ago.
I'm in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian chaperones held captive in the desert for ten days were safely returned to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
By the morning, they had been liberated in Chad by an Egyptian commando.
Apparently in good shape, the hostages arrived at Almaza military base, near Cairo International Airport, around 3:30 p.m., on board a special plane.
On board a helicopter, they were transferred immediately, without being able to give any interviews to the press, to the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, for analysis.
They enjoy "good health" and have not been paid any ransom "to the kidnappers," Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said on the airstrip.
Kidnapped on 19 September during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, bordering Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been tossed from hideout to hideout by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group consisted of 11 tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and 8 Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of Aegyptous, the safari organizing agency.
An Egyptian security official said that 30 members of the special forces, aboard two helicopters, had launched the assault during the night, just before dawn.
"There were gunfire, half of the kidnappers were killed, while the others fled," said the perpetrator who requested to maintain anonymity.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "blink" unit were sent to Sudan, where they would be supported by German and Italian commandos.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini stressed, from Belgrade, the importance of the role of Italian secret agents and special forces.
We have to admit that if we achieved such a result it was thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of the men of our secret services, of the special forces," he said, without adding any further details.
He also denied payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese army of patrol claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle in which the kidnappers were on board and to have killed six, including the Chadian leader of the kidnappers, and to have captured two.
According to the army, the kidnappers are linked to a Darfur rebel organization, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA_U), a claim immediately denied by the latter.
Letters- The Silent Majority of Culture
On the front page is a debate on the funding of the culture on which the current election campaign focuses.
All the better.
But a part of our cultural life always remains in the shadows.
Who will pronounce himself to denounce the meager sums granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical places that are starving?
What politician will dare to remind the federal government that it is neglecting monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we don't have any real laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government is paying three and a half million euros for the restoration of Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley alone?
Among our American neighbors, it is the Constitution that affirms that the protection of heritage is part of national culture and that the same heritage must be protected by every citizen, every political authority and every government department, and all this by mutual agreement.
In Québec, at the Federation of Historic Societies of Québec, there are at least 40 000 volunteers who, grouped into 211 societies for the preservation of historical, genealogical, archives and heritage preserve, with little money, private archives and archaeological sites.
It is they who, often, defend our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when real estate entrepreneurs and decision-makers attack our forgotten remains and cemeteries with their bulldozers.
When will the right space be reserved for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize part of Fortis bank
The Benelux states help through partial nationalisation the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which ended up in difficulty first in Europe for the crisis of the American credit market: the three nations will provide 11.2 billion euros to the financial institution - insurance with interest also in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands agreed on the weekend at the highest level, also involving the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
In the euro area the first major crisis in the context of the difficulties in which the international financial market has been struggling for more than a year is that of the Fortis bank, and from a certain point of view the decisions taken in this regard can set a precedent.
Under the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states will hold nearly half (49%) of the bank's share in the country.
The bank will almost certainly sell part of its interests, including first of all the assets, especially insurance, of the Dutch ABN Amro acquired a year ago.
Last week Fortis's shares had started with a vertical collapse, serious signs of the institute's crisis then showed up in the second half of the week.
Analysts, however, agree that the bank, with 85,000 employees, is too large to allow it to go bankrupt.
The bank's shares fell nearly 12% on Friday, the lowest point in 14 years.
Since January, the value of the shares has decreased by more than two-thirds.
Considering current share prices the group's entire capital value is around €14 billion, but according to the bank's executives this value is not real.
The corporate summit blames the collapse of Fortis shares on the uncertainties of the non-European market due to the acceptance of the US $700 billion plan.
On Monday, the title slowly started to rise again.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the bank's new CEO.
The financial institution has also sought private buyers but so far no one has come forward with a worthy offer.
The Belgian government had previously assured that investors should not fear losing money.
There was no panic among the bank's customers, the branches were not assaulted.
In Hungary Fortis owns autonomous subsidiaries and has also purchased leasing companies.
The fox in the henhouse
In America, life and health insurers, based on people's medical purchase data, often refuse to enter into an insurance contract.
Privacy experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a privacy program according to which the use of prescription drug data depends in any case on the approval of the person concerned.
This program must be in independent hands, otherwise it is like entrusting the henhouse to the fox" - writes the Washington Post quoting Richard Dick author of the program to follow the prescriptions of medicines.
Insurance companies make the insurance rate and the amount due in the event of claims subject to the health status of any customer and if they consider the risk too high they do not take out the insurance.
A while ago the client had to undergo a medical examination and the contract was concluded only after the outcome of the examination.
Dick 10 years ago invented a much cheaper procedure: based on the customer's identification code you can easily get information from pharmacies about which medicines he has purchased in the last year and a half and from this the program shows what diseases he suffers and in what health conditions he is in.
For example, if you regularly buy large amounts of cholesterol reducers this means that your blood fat level is incurably high and is classified in the highest risk category.
On the market there are various versions of the program, some also determine the risk multiplier, to the insurer so in addition to paper work there is not much left, even if there are small difficulties.
Among the cons is that some medicines are usable for multiple purposes, e.g. some compounds are employable against migraines or hot flushes, but are also effective against depression.
The latter, from an insurance - commercial point of view, applies as a risk increase factor, the first two do not.
For the request and processing of data, separate companies have been formed and these, before obtaining the necessary information from pharmacies, ask for the approval of the patient.
Now the authorities force them to do so even though they have not so far imposed fines for negligence.
Some companies lately also process the result of laboratory tests and link them to the medicine consumption data in order to provide a more precise picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to the data and at the same time the control of the use will be more and more difficult.
There is a separate privacy law but its validity extends only to health services and insurance.
In front of Congress there is a bill that gives the authorities control competence to companies specialized in data service.
Richard Dick admits that it is not enough: that is why he has developed a program that links data forwarding with the approval expressed by the person concerned.
Another issue is that the person concerned cannot so much deny approval because otherwise insurers do not enter into the contract.
So then eventually the hens are entrusted to the leniency of the fox.
Global Marseilles Menu
European Union and India double trade
Since the European Union and India are partners who trade mainly with each other, the agenda of the ninth summit meeting was also dominated by this issue, as well as all other global problems.
Today there will be a Franco-Indian summit that will deal primarily with cooperation on atomic energy.
The European Union recognises that India is becoming a major democratic power that should be given more voice in international affairs, but member countries have not yet been able to decide whether or not to support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
So there was no insistence on this issue at the ninth summit held yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as President-in-Office of the Union, José Manuel Barroso Chairman of the Commission and Javier Solana High Representative for Foreign Affairs received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they found the agreement to double in 5 years, i.e. increase to 100 billion euros, trade.
Considering that between 2000 and 2007 the exchange of goods rose from 25 to 55 billion, this is not too ambitious a goal.
As a result, the 26 bilateral civil flight agreements have been legally unified, so air traffic can also start in the future.
India would like to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the deal.
The goal is to balance because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi instead is only in ninth place among the EU's partners.
The summit paid attention to global affairs.
To the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and to terrorism, the latter condemned in all its forms on both sides, and urged the convening of a UN conference.
They urged the conclusion of the Doha Trade Round, although both sides played a role in the failure of this.
The EU has confirmed that it persists in the energy and climate programme, i.e. it would like to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agrees on this, as well as on the fact that a global pact should be made at the climate conference scheduled for next year and reduce greenhouse gas production by 50% by 2050.
They also want to curb rising food prices and have supported the convening of an international meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister will travel to the French capital today where at a bilateral meeting he is preparing to sign a treaty on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that in order to build Indian nuclear reactors, French firms will receive a 20 billion euro contract.
According to information from our news agency the deal would last 15 years.
In Frankfurt over three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
There will be over three hundred Italian publishers present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international event for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair awaits for this edition over 7 thousand exhibitors from 101 different countries who will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Fair with over 403 thousand titles on display and with Turkey as a guest of honor.
It will be the Undersecretary at the Ministry for Cultural Heritage and Activities Francesco Maria Giro to represent the Italian Government in the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Pavilion: Italy will in fact be present institutionally with a Punto Italia - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
The meeting with the press will follow at the Room Struktur in Hall 5.0 of the Buchmesse: this will be an opportunity to present figures, trends and perspectives on the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of foreign author books gradually decreases on the total of Italian production, and in particular on that for adults and children.
Steve Fossett's plane found, billionaire missing a year ago
The wreckage of Steve Fossett's plane was found, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying in the Nevada desert.
The wreckage was found on a plateau at an altitude of 3,000 meters, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammoth Lakes, on the border of California and Nevada.
Inside the aircraft, however, there were no human remains.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson dispelled the doubts that still remained: "The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that it's just the one Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared," he said at a news conference.
The sheriff then specified that no human remains were found either in the plane, or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was pronounced dead in February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Bureau (NTSB) said a few hours after the wreck was sighted, a team of investigators was dispatched, who then identified the device: it is the Bellanca 8kcab, missing since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, also in California, not far from the Nevada border, some personal belongings of Fossett had been found by a couple near their Mammoth Lakes home.
These are two documents with Fossett's name, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a hoodie.
Fossett's research had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of primates.
By 2002, on the sixth attempt, he had become the first man to complete the world tour in an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solo flying.
Three years later he had toured the world by plane and nonstop.
Among his many records, also that of flying at 15,445 meters high, over the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the publicity you don't expect
An out-of-the-box SUV with an original design and well defined by firm lines, wide surfaces and sharp angles.
This is, in short, Glk the latest born among the offroad "compacts" of the house of the star with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to give a breath of novelty in this sector.
Precisely because of its content outside the traditional canons, the communication that will accompany the launch of the Suv Glk, available at Mercedes-Benz showrooms from October 17th, will also be unexpected and unconventional.
So the advertising campaign that will accompany the debut of the new car will start an unprecedented mode of communication also through an futuristic 3D billboard campaign, used for the first time in Italy by an automotive brand.
A maxi-affission project, divided into three different phases, which will dominate the central Milanese shopping street, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision and thanks to special glasses distributed near Corso Como it will be possible to see the new Suv in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, looking at the image you will have the impression that the car comes out of the manifest.
Subsequently, through the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, and then reassembled into a single image.
Undoubtedly Mercedes with this advertisement is attempting to introduce something new into the stereotypical field of automotive communication.
Will it succeed with this formula to tease the interest of future buyers? We'll see.
That's who the Italian hooligans are.
Of the Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are those 150-200 boys and girls that all of Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been following the Italian national team for years and that has never, in truth, created excessive problems.
Nor had he ever clashed with opposing fans.
The extraction of the group is on the right.
The promoters are from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
Added to these in Sofia were groups (a few units, actually) from Campania and Puglia.
They have tricolor flags where the militants' home cities appear: Saturday night they were removed for not being identified.
They are inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria they found a fan of real Nazis, that of Levski.
The Figc had made 144 tickets available to Italian fans for the game: all names, therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminale in fact had controlled them all: among those who left for Sofia there was no one with a Daspo in progress, no one who had been inhibited from attending a stadium.
Four blue fans, who had a history of stadium offences, had been refused a ticket and prevented from travelling.
Now the Viminale waits to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police then will take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo for at least five years to the fans who have been arrested or to those who have been identified in the riots.
An international Daspo that prevents you from attending not only Italian stadiums but all over Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, will never set foot in a stadium again.
Luckily.
But now there is fear-emulation: that to those little more than a hundred and fifty, more are added.
"We have to put out this fire right now and not legitimise those who behave in this way," they claim from the Viminal.
Hence, "eyes well open especially in view of Wednesday's national team match in Lecce".
In Puglia, in fact, there is a small nucleus of Ultras Italia supporters.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, Tuesday the Casms which can also count on a section of the Aise, that is the secret services, which deals precisely with the problems of the stadium.
"Duce-Duce choirs and arm stretched out during Mameli's anthem? In Bulgaria it is not a crime...".
This is the thought (expressed in a very unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, a few weeks director of the Observatory of the Viminale (he took the place that was first Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had previously been quaestor of Trieste where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to praise the Duce but certainly the behaviour of those 150-200 fans was shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - adds the n.1 of the Observatory - crimes must be attributed in the country where the fact takes place.
Until now this group had remained in line, now we will see what happened and evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about the whistles at Mameli's anthem: even those are not felony, but if you allow me they are not education...".
