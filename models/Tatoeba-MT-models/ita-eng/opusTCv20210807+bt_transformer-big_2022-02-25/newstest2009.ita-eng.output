The Prague Stock Exchange at the close of the market had a negative collapse.
After the morning collapse, the Prague Stock Exchange restored the losses.
CEZ share transactions have reached almost half of the current daily trade.
Since the beginning of Tuesday, the Prague Stock Exchange has recovered from the collapse of the day before it was almost 6%.
Behind this downturn is the collapse of shares on Wall Street.
So, even here, we show a market reaction to the result of the vote of the House of Representatives in America, which refused to support the stabilization plan of the local financial sector.
Stock collapse in Asia
Asian Stock Exchange stocks experienced a dramatic slump on Tuesday, though indices, however, during the day subsequently wiped out some of the losses.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange's Hang Seng index wiped out nearly 4% during the day, but later also some of the losses stabilized at 2.5%.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which follows the movement of Chinese stocks to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell 3.8% while in Shanghai the markets were closed.
Shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than 5%, but eventually losses settled at 4.3%.
The Thay-Wan Stock Exchange, according to the local index, fell 3.6%.
"The planning of the rescue action is uncertain and this will affect financial markets around the world," noted Hong Kong Currencies Office chief Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, despite being part of China, manages its own financial policy, thus without depending on the Central Bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
American lawmakers, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, should quickly return to the dialogue and approve the proposed financial support.
Otherwise, there is a risk that other countries will also be affected.
Massacre of American Actions
The U.S. Parliament on Monday rejected the financial system's support plan, for which $700 billion (nearly twelve trillion Czech kronor) was to be allocated.
Legislators have thus ignored President Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush the plan would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks on Monday experienced a massacre and major stock indices recorded the biggest slump in over twenty years.
The Dow Jones index dropped by almost 7% and a collapse of similar size was last observed in 1987.
The index was already falling before the vote, but as soon as it was seen that the bill was not approved, it went into free fall.
Congress has caved in: the US government can give $700 billion to banks.
The highest representatives of the American congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of an understanding of economic support for the American financial system.
The vote on this will be early next week..
American lawmakers broke the ice in the dialogue on approving the bailout in the form of economic aid to the American financial system totaling $700 million (nearly twelve trillion kronor).
But it is not yet said.
Representatives of Congress, therefore, must define certain details of the understanding before publishing the final form of the law and voting on it.
The financial system's support plan will be discussed on Monday on the territory of the House of Representatives.
On Sunday, he told Reuters, the chairman of the Barney Frank chamber's banking and financial services committee.
In the Senate, according to some sources, one could vote on the plan probably not before Monday.
According to the economists the announcement that the approval of the financial plan will take place should be the first and fundamental psychological factor capable of reawakening the financial markets.
Thereafter, however, there will be a return to reality due to the complexity of the mechanisms by which, in practice, to reach the aid of the markets.
Paulson: Plan must be effective
"We've taken a big step forward."
"We have clarified our different views about the shape of the presentation of the market stabilization package," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to the same , the final vote could still take place on Sunday.
Legislators' delegates gathered the night between Saturday and Sunday with U.S. Finance Minister Henry Paulson, to give final form to the government's financial funds.
These funds should serve to acquire from financial companies non-transferable mortgage assets, which lead financial companies to serious losses and put the stability of the entire system at risk.
"We are at the completion of the final agreement of the plan that will work and that must also be effective in the market".
"It's necessary to continue the recovery plan, but I think we're on it," Paulson said.
The Signal for Asian Trade
The global financial crisis falls heavily on stock markets that are falling sharply.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers so are trying to reach a final agreement in Congress even before Sunday.
That is, they want to calm investors before trading in Asian financial markets, which are, in order of time, the first to influence Monday's market following the decision of Congress.
But for now it is not definitively clear when the two houses of Congress will vote on the law and even if negotiations can be halted at the last moment on some problem.
Legislators hope it will be approved in the coming days.
But the law will still undergo many changes.
The total amount provided for the support of the system must be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion must be available as soon as possible as President George Bush has requested.
But Congress can block the allocation of the rest of the sum in case it gets the impression that the program does not perform its function, blocking the next $100 billion and after the final 350.
Bush appreciated the progress in negotiations.
Although the President may veto this decision, Congress may overrule his veto right.
Despite these changes, the basic thinking of the program has been maintained, namely to get the finances to buy the passive mortgage values, the price of which has collapsed because of hundreds of thousands of Americans who are unable to pay their mortgages.
"We've worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote regarding the Sunday Act and the Senate Monday," as the Republican senator mentioned.
American President Bush is also pleased with the progress in negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto stated that Bush is pleased with Saturday's positive performance and appreciates "the effort of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Restriction of gold parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, the chief spokesman, said lawmakers agreed on responsibility for the financial program, protection of taxpayers from losses, closing the budget for reductions, splitting the financial plan.
The new law must also limit so-called gold parachutes for executives of companies participating in the program and is creating a committee that will control the funds.
These should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We've worked very hard and made a big step towards the deal that will work and be useful for the market and also for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan relies on helping homeowners who have payment problems.
The government should negotiate new mortgage installments that it will buy with the aim of lowering monthly expenses on installments for debtors and allow it to keep their homes.
Marek: psychological support
The proposed plan is, according to Patria Finance's chief economist, David Marek, a good idea but its implementation will be very difficult.
"And that's because we don't know how and for what price the problematic assets will be bought
This will be instrumental in how the financial sector and the government will split their losses," Marek said this week for the iHNed.cz website.
Whether the plan will be approved now or early next week is not, according to Marek, so fundamental.
"Much more important, it is that already this week the representatives of the congress find an agreement on the support of this plan and that they baptize it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of this agreement that will be approved is at this most important moment," Marek stressed.
Last Blood Duel: MP3 Players vs. Cellphones
We will advise how to choose
While almost every cell phone can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can phone.
From this it is clear that it is better to buy only the phone.
Nevertheless, there are many reasons to get an autonomous reader.
The choice depends entirely on the way of use and the needs of the future owner.
Perhaps you would hardly buy an expensive high-quality turntable to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
First of all these musical products do not come out as LP and from a qualitative point of view for this there is not even an objective reason.
If, however, hard-rock, jazz or blues vinyls are crowded on your shelves, at least you dream of it.
It also works with portable music, i.e. compressed music or simply in MP3 format.
Here, too, the price and quality categories exist.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend for an 8 thousand kroner player, as well as a Pink Floyd fan perhaps hardly digests the market's twenty kroner caps.
Two extremes between which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
It is the battery life that decides.
Some high-quality music players can do much more than just read music, but they don't even accidentally do cell phones.
There is no other current device as universal as the cell phone.
Next to the primary functions, phone and text, can read music and video, record both and has a camera, sometimes better sometimes worse and maybe even can navigate.
And if we consider smartphones and handhelds you will also have a miniature computer in your pocket.
It is a small miracle that no refrigerator can make the grill and no television can photograph anything.
The universality of the cell phone also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile phone and the sooner the on-screen indicator will require the charger.
And reading music consumes a lot of energy.
Few cell phones can read music for more than twelve hours,usually, and much less.
In this sense music players (especially the simplest ones) are much more effective.
As for the cheap uncounted cell phones that can last for more than a few hours.
If you still add to it, from time to time, some calls, get to work for safety another charger, this also applies to the most expensive appliances.
But you won't have this problem with an MP3 player, even the worst ones last at least 9 hours at continuous functionality with a recharge.
A further problem exists when downloading music to your mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of devices have the universal USB port and not all of them can be connected to the computer without special software.
Certainly the music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few memory players are able to do it without adapter for minicards that are not used in mobile phones.
Readers, except for a few exceptions (Ipod) do not need any special software.
Just fill the device with music via USB from your computer.
Most mobile phones and readers create themselves a multimedia library sorted by the names of the performers, album name, genre or by user classification.
Some devices only reproduce the folder tree structure, similar to the Explorer tool in Windows, and some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobile phones can do more.
When choosing a particular device you are especially interested in battery strength, memory capacity, quality and type of audio outputs and clearly ease of use.
If you mainly need music as a background and if you listen to it every day only briefly on the tram you just need a mobile phone that reads MP3.
This now succeeds, clearly to any cell phone.
You don't have to worry too much about what formats the cell phone or reader recognizes.
MP3 players all support them, the global majority of the music that comes to you will be in this format.
In addition to this format that belongs to the most popular ones, the total majority of devices support music in WMA format.
It is less the AAC (format used by the Apple company and its iPods).
The best mobile phones also allow, for example, to buy music online.
Just visit, through the mobile internet network, the corresponding pages of the operator (or another provider) and buy the song or album.
This same service already could be a valid argument for buying a mobile-reader.
Unfortunately, the offer of the operators is poor and is limited, usually, only to hits of the moment of the radio.
Prices aren't exactly low.
But it is generally assumed that this very mode of music sales (whether via GSM, internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their cell phone behind them.
Anyone who wants to listen to a little something goes through their pocket while the MP3 player is forgotten at home.
However, it also depends on this, if you always carry the headphones or at least the wireless headset.
If not, you can use the built-in player that almost every cell phone, but only a small part of MP3 players, has.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of mobile-readers will, for many, be the price.
Cheaper ones normally cost less than 3,000 kroner.
For 3 and 4 thousand crowns you will already buy a very dignified walkman.
Usually, however, you will be limited by the absence of an input for the common headphones.
The best and most technically equipped mobile phones and even with the 3.5 mm socket for common headphones, cost up to 15 thousand crowns.
On the other hand, the advantage of the readers is, besides others, the easy handling.
Simpler ones not necessarily cheaper (see our choice) really make it anyone to handle them.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of handling once with the common stereo or perhaps the turntable, is obvious.
There is no danger of accidentally bumping the start of the mobile internet network and consequently of a giant bill for data transmission.
What appliance to take
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (of the M2 type, microSD etc.).
Also with regard to the purchase of the respective card, which fell within the 2 000 kroner.
But be careful
The basic models support only cards with the maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones make it even with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy an inexpensive MP3 player, take Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to spend more than 1 100 kroner.
If you are one of the most demanding listeners take preferably specialized mobile phones - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have individual keys for MP3 and the convenience of service so it comes close to the same MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson has come a long way in this regard, whose smartphones in the walkman line have the same scale of use as MP3 players sold separately.
MP3 players of the above brands provide you with the same service and price category up to 4 000 kroner, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery strength (commonly 15 hours, in principle up to 35 hours).
The first virtual operator will reach the Czech Republic as early as this year.
Maybe
Perhaps the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is quite mature and our operators offer virtually all services like their partners in Western Europe.
Something is still missing here – a virtual operator that forces traditional ones to lower the price.
Maybe he won't miss it for a long time.
The fact that Czech operators belong to the most expensive in Europe we have already written many times on Mobil.cz.
At the end of the day, it was also confirmed by T, who pointed out that the price of SMS is higher than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regularisation of roaming charges, perhaps a paradoxical situation will be created - for some customers of Czech mobile operators SMS will cost less from abroad than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high against Europe?
The answer is simple, it lacks the competition that would really like to start the fight.
Maybe it sounds absurd, even here we have three mobile networks and coverage highly above 100%.
On the other hand, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this sense, he also often emphasizes the head of the Czech Telecommunications Council, Pavel Dvosek, who in the past has sometimes expressed that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is perhaps true that the traditional operator with his own network no longer likely has many possibilities. (Of the rest it would perhaps be difficult now to find other frequencies).
But there is still another possibility -the virtual operator.
The very entry of virtual operators into the market has led to a considerable drop in prices, to which traditional operators would then have to react.
At the same time, even before sharks such as Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile entered the market, similar voices sounded in Britain as we do.
It has proved, however, that the place for such operators is there and that they can be truly successful.
At the end of the day, we don't have to go very far.
In February of this year we informed you of the arrival of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year this operator has managed to acquire more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest local operator.
At the same time, behind Mobilking is the Penta financial group to which U:fon belongs in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more concrete target group.
In order to actually work, he needs many fewer customers than a traditional operator.
They do not carry with them, i.e., relatively high expenses for the creation, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
Thus in the world virtual operators usually present themselves at low cost, offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often in balance with the more restricted service offer
So for example Tesco Mobile in Britain offers SMS that cost at least half as much as its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows it can be a pretty good move even betting on a group-target no small.
This operator is specifically targeting men, so to speak.
"Real men choose Mobilking operator that they like and can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company that produces this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether we can also affirm a similar concept as in Poland.
The press spokesman for Vodafone Miroslav Epick doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a fragmented approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
Plus from a service point of view it's relatively saturated."
In the Czech Republic no possibility, mobile network operators say
But it seems almost certain that if there is ever an operator in the Czech Republic it will not be Mobilking.
"There is talk of the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic negotiations do not have much expectation.
The ignition of Mobilking will take place rather in the other countries in our area," said in a telephone dialogue for Mobile.cz Jana Studnickov, the press spokesman for the financial group Penta.
So he indirectly confirmed that the current operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not very supportive of this thought.
Rather on the contrary, they try to do everything so that no potential competitor is created.
For some time now, he has not been hiding his interest in starting a virtual operator, the GTS Novera group, which would like to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefanika O2 in the field of corporate customers.
"We have a great interest in being able to offer our customers not only fixed services but also mobile telecommunications.
And the sooner the better.
We have negotiated repeatedly on this possibility with all Czech operators of the mobile network.
We have already been able to progress in negotiations with some of them," said Group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
So maybe better times will come.
Unofficial information shows that the first virtual operator will have to have it perhaps by the end of the year.
For now, however, around its creation stands an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At this time we do not believe that there is room in the Czech market for the creation of a fully-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very specific.
Until now no subject with a complex and serious project has addressed us," he mentioned in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sr.e. of the press section of Telefònika O2.
The specificity of the Czech market is also used by the other operators.
T-Mobil press spokesman Martina Kemrov, added in a rare agreement with the O2 statement: "For now we have not noticed any vital and beneficial commercial project for both of us, on which it is possible to continue to build."
He adds: "A virtual operator will hardly appear in the T-Mobil network by the end of the year.
At this time we will have already had to have a concrete agreement on the table, so that it would be possible to consider it on the horizon."
Vodafone focuses its attention rather on achieving its own 3G license requests.
He adds Miroslav Epick: "We are open to the negotiations of potential virtual operators and this is especially in the context of sharing expenses and infrastructure.
We consider this, from the point of view of the customers, the most productive.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a common network for fast mobile internet."
The competent authorities -with the complicit operators
The attitude of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, it would lead to lower prices and thereby a decrease in profit.
Why then facilitate the rise of such a competitor?
The annoyances around U:fon creation testify that when operators care about a thing they know how to row on the same side.
Perhaps the great pressure was pressing against T in the period of U:fon's creation towards T-Mobile's company.
This testifies to the public access information from the web pages of ?T?.
But right now U:fon serves as an argument for which to not accept the virtual operator.
Martina Kemrov? remarked: "The competition environment of the mobile phone market has been little enhanced beyond that with the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
Regarding the type of mobile market in the Czech Republic it is obvious that the entry of another competitor would place on him and especially on his high-demand services."
However, the complete disinterest on the part of the Czech regulatory bodies is quite surprising.
This is not just about the attitude of the T, which unfortunately in the Czech Republic – unlike Britain and other developed countries – has no competence to interfere in economic competition.
That belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (OHS).
This, however, has taken its typical position towards the whole problem.
"The entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market would be possible after the conclusion of the contract for the rental of the necessary infrastructure between the mobile operator and the virtual operator.
No such contract has been concluded so far because the offer of potential buyers has probably not been interesting enough for traditional operators," said Kristi , of the .OHS external relations section, in the answer to our question.
Such a statement by the representatives of the operators is perhaps not surprising.
Instead by the office that has to defend the interest of consumers and also deal with the fact that no one takes advantage of its position in the market, it is more than a delicate business.
Especially when Kristi?n Chalupa adds: " Abroad where virtual operators commonly work, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile services."
But obviously the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the lowering of prices do not belong to the interests of OHS.
Truly shocking throughout the situation is the almost exciting harmony of these three operators resulting from their reactions.
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence, arises on its own.
Just as the identical price of gasoline for all petrol stations is without doubt the result of coincidence and competitive struggle.
"The section found no signs of anti-competitive behavior regarding this fact and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
No operator has a dominant position, so it does not have a corresponding greater responsibility for its behaviour in the market.
The necessary tools for opening the mobile network market for virtual operators may also be missing from the telecom regulator," Chalupa mentioned in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many controversial points.
Of course, there is the analysis of the relevant markets developed by _________, according to which telecommunications are the only market from the point of view of economic competition.
On such a market, of course, no Czech operator has a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer another approach - for the creation of a virtual operator the agreement of the network operator is always necessary.
And the mobile operator has – in the end logically – the monopoly of its network.
So for a certain portion it has to be dominant by force.
But even if we don't admit this argument, for OHS it should be a minimum alert that three mobile operators proceed in such a strangely similar way.
At the same time complaints from interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that during negotiations with all operators they encounter very similar obstacles.
Unloading responsibility to T in telecommunications is a fairly frequent trick by which OHS keeps itself out of the whole thing.
We have already found this in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it has not been possible to promote the expansion of the rights to telecommunications in the field of economic competition until the recently approved update of the telecommunications law, despite the fact that, from this many experts expected the situation to improve.
This is something the representatives of OHS need to know more than well, but perhaps their interests lie elsewhere.
It can be done, when no one looks
While without us noticing it, the operation of such pseudo-virtual operators remains, some of which even exist in Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that publish their price lists of mobile services but are only partially public.
These are usually the companies that deal with multilevel marketing.
So for example Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their own mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only pre-established people.
The magic lies in the fact that the company towards the operator appears as a classic corporate customer, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As a major customer then receives special pricing offers (and more).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit a similar presale.
"If the cases mentioned are presented, of which we will be interested, it could be a breach of the contractual conditions, and could result in the conclusion of the cooperation with that company", answered the question in question Martina Kemrov.
But it is quite unlikely that such an activity would not reach the ears of those responsible for mobile operators.
Especially in the cases of the 3 companies mentioned it can be thousands of customers.
No operator defends itself at the same time from such an attitude.
From the activity of these companies they derive a not indifferent profit and at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - they are not damaged in any way with their official marketing.
Miroslav ?epick? warns about possible problems: "The law allows for similar speculation, however only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
These also have to accept that the SIM card in their phone is not registered in their name, therefore they cannot dispose in full of it as the regular customers of mobile operators "
But that's exactly what should be a weird little bit at the "T".
In addition, another issue opens up for OHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to such an attitude, why do they block the creation of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that OHS has strong enough rights to expose similar activities and if it does not want it will not have to be satisfied with the explanation of the operators who have no idea of all this and that their commercial conditions prohibit it.
When we're no longer expensive
As has already been said in the text several times, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile phone market has led to a considerable drop in prices for services.
At the same time, in virtually all countries where operators were born, traditional operators tried more or less to prevent their creation.
The arguments they used were virtually identical - too small market, too saturated limit, problems with the quality of services etc.
But in developed countries, regulatory bodies have intervened to defend not mobile operators but their customers.
Both with formal measures and non-formal pressure, then came the creation of the first virtual operator and others joined him.
Unfortunately, Czech regulators throw the whole case from one to the other like a hot potato.
In our experience we cannot get rid of the feeling that the lack of clarity of skills in these cases is more than comfortable for him.
But let's not throw in the towel.
If the background information is right and the virtual operator will appear to us really soon, the Czech mobile phone market will start up again.
If one of the operators had consented to the creation of a virtual mobile operator only it would be difficult for OHS to remain impassive to the rejection (discrimination) of the other interested parties.
And we may stop calling at higher prices than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolzhnek on the occasion of the day of recognition of the Czech state presented in a solemn way the new recordings of the national anthem "Kde domov m?j".
The new recording of the anthem was made by the National Theatre orchestra under the direction of Ji-B-lohl-vek.
There are four versions available – solo with male or female voice, chorus pitch and instrumental edition.
Singing is under the direction of Kateshina Knyonkova and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the anthem's revisions are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Kr?ek.
On the iHNed.cz website you can listen to all four versions.
The Czech national song is considered to be one of the most beautiful hymns.
Already earlier he told on the radio that he chose specifically to sing the variants to solo, the singers with the most representative young voices, which are expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I have tried to take care that both and even the choir have the clear diction, that the text is well understood, that they are in harmony," he reported.
Then the national anthem will celebrate the 175th anniversary next year.
The song "Kde domov m?j" was first played in 1834 on the stage of the Stamovskéh divadlo in the original opera Fidlova?ka by Josef Kajet?n Tyl accompanied by the music of Franti?ek?kroupa.
It gained popularity and people spontaneously made it their own.
The first verse of the song after the founding of Czechoslovakia in 1918 then became the natural part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the birth of the autonomous Czech Republic.
How the "new" hymn sounds
On Wednesday MHD Prague will also accompany you for the first time with an electronic card
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be written in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when in the metro, tramway and bus will go up the first passengers who will have an electronic card in their pocket instead of the paper ticket.
At this time about one hundred thousand people who own their Opencard card can get it.
Passengers can buy the 30- and 90-day and annual one (which will be worth from January 1, 2009) and at the same time get their card recharged in the Infopoints and offices of the Transport Company and at the metro stop Muzeum, M?stek, N?dra? Hole?ovice, And?l, Roztyly, Let?any, Kobylisy, Rajsk? Zahrada, Ka?erov and Luka.
Coupons can be bought already yesterday on the internet at the page of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred customers took advantage of the service before the afternoon.
Those who will start using the service via the internet can completely forget the counters in the subway stops where they had to make long lines for paper tickets so far.
The coupon is bought via the internet and on the Opencard they recharge it on one of the twelve branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places, passengers have a desk with trained staff that will help those interested in purchasing on the internet and record the credit they have acquired on their card as well," said project spokesman Martin Opatrn.
In addition to libraries it will be possible to load electronic coupons on Opencards in ATMs and self-service that are installed at the metro entrances.
How are these ATMs?
They are red, resembling ticket obliterators and passengers have already noticed them at the Roztyly, Budsjovicki, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavski metro stops.
"Now there are five of them all over the city but by the end of the year there should be eighty of them," concluded Opatrn.
The coupon will be checked instead of by the driver from the ATM.
The ATM service that will work from tomorrow is very simple.
Just insert the Opencard card and upon payment of the coupon, it will load on top.
Electronic cards are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, in the urban lines of trains and buses from the number 300 to 499, which the inhabitants of the municipalities of Central Bohemia take to reach the capital.
"In trains added to Prague's integrated transports there are controllers equipped with card readers with whom they verify time and zonal validity," explained the Filip ticket control mode by the Ropid organization, which fine-tunes Prague's collective transport schedules.
Urban buses have card readers integrated into the driver's crate.
During the climb it is therefore necessary not only to show the magnetic card to the driver, but in addition you have to place the Opencard at the point determined next to the cash register.
Thus the driver verifies the validity of the loaded coupons.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the loaded coupons, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this kind of information," added Dr.pal.
Passengers who take city buses and will not remember, when the coupon expires, can again go to self-service ATMs, where coupons are loaded on the card.
Here you will see information on the validity of their documents on the device screen.
Sudeten Germans wanted a referendum from the US
The Germans of the Sudetenland in 1945 asked to include Umanava to the United States.
This results from the letter deposited in the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States.
With this wish, some groups of Sudeten Germans reportedly addressed the President of the United States in 1945.
This is further evidenced by the letter kept in a private archive and now deposited in the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans of Cheskh Krumlov ask in the letter to the American president not to allow the return of the "district of Chemava" – occupied by Hitler under the Munich agreement – to Czechoslovakia again.
"We have understood the situation and we want to be sure of the promises that American units will arrive at German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," the letter signed with the words "People who care about the fate of Umanava with all their heart."
Since, they say, the annexation to Czechoslovakia – knowing the Czech national character – gives the Germans of the Sudeten only hope of brutality, lack of regard, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter pray the American president to assume the protectorate on sumava now and always.
"We cannot believe that without regard for the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you would recognize this territory as a state alien to us, which oppresses and eradicates ethnic minorities and has contributed nothing, at all, to the victory of the Allies," the letter writes.
The reason why the authors cannot sign it is the alleged fear of revenge by the "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States were to doubt the Germans' conviction of Umava, it would be enough to organize a referendum in the district on the will of its inhabitants to become part of the United States or live under the mastery of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem naive with our knowledge of the post-war history, according to some witnesses it appropriately describes the then-expectations of the Germans of the Sudetenland.
Although the Czech Germans were to have any idea that it would be their move from the republic, only a few of them admitted such a possibility altogether.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate some sort of autonomy for the peoples of the Sudetenland.
Others believed that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who was born in Cheske Budjovice.
He was mobilized during the war as a German of Budojovice in the maritime power of the Baltic Sea.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the British and put in the prison camp in Holt , the dozens of other Czech Germans went to visit him for him to teach him Czech.
"They believed that once they got home the Czech would make it convenient for them," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners, who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war, according to him counted on the fact that on the basis of the decrees of Benech they would be moved from the Republic.
You don't think--you'll pay!
Emotional campaigning will attack drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
Even so it could be called the emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport plans to start on Wednesday.
The office of the Minister Alec Chebchek, expects that this will discourage drivers from dangerous behavior behind the wheel.
The 150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, the internet but also on flyers.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and under the influence of alcohol at the wheel.
And also remind him to put on his belt before leaving.
He wants to touch on the conscience especially young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and not least professional drivers.
What is it that will appear in the commercials?
Especially people's stories that will affect emotions.
And this is also borne out by the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign:
You don't think--you'll pay!
The word "don't think" is capitalized on the plaque.
And in a pool of blood is the word "you'll pay."
This must symbolize that a person can in a moment of distraction pay with his own life.
The commercials will "fear" viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where images with drastic scenes of accident victims can commonly be seen.
It thus promises to lower the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Carrot and stick to drivers
"With drivers the carrot and stick system works.
The carrot for them is for example when they pass with red and so save time.
The stick is the danger of the fine or accident.
You have to remind the drivers of the risk," says the psychologist of the Ministry of Transport Martin Koen of the Na Homolce hospital.
And therefore we need information campaigns in the press and above all negative advertising, the psychologist believes.
According to him, the panels that warn drivers of the danger are already less effective.
"If the fixed panel warning of the danger has been installed, it will probably soon become confused with the environment and drivers will not pay any more attention to it," warns Koon.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
Israeli interim government premier Ehud Olmert has spoken out for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, namely the borders of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace between Palestinians and Syrians.
So he said in the dialogue that he published Monday, the newspaper Jediot Achronot.
"We have to come to an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) areas, if not all of them," Olmert told the newspaper.
"We will keep a certain percentage of these territories but the Palestinians will have to leave the same percentage (of the Israeli zones), because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that the eventual restitution will also include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and above all does not want the bulldozers to pass on him, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in the reference to the two July attacks in the city, during which some people were killed and dozens of people injured.
According to the premier it will be necessary to find "a particular solution for the Temple Mountain, the sacred and historical places," which stand within the Old City. .
"He who will want to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the whole city will have to integrate 270 000 Arabs.
That won't work," he also pointed out.
The Retreat from the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke out for Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he felt was an essential condition for concluding this peaceful agreement with Syria.
But that would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose the conclusion of peace with Syria solely on the basis of withdrawal from Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to give up to get the Golan Heights.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah (Shia movement); they will have to give up the permanent support, which they offer to Hamas terrorism, (Shia movement) Al-Qaida (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the holy war) in Iraq," the premier said.
Questions after the accident: Are stewards illegal in buses?
The law doesn't recognize them, you can't walk on the bus that makes long distance routes
In the context of the tragic accident near the Italian city of Padua of the company Student Agency coach came out the question of whether stewards and passengers can move on board the bus during the ride.
"If we want to comply with the laws strictly and formally, the steward's activity conflicts with the law of road traffic," says Ministry of Transport spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
Last week's incident in which a 22-year-old stewardess lost her life was caused by a truck cutting off the bus.
The girl was unfortunately sitting at that time next to the driver on the less secure spot of the bus, despite there still being two more seats allocated.
But the bus can make an accident or brake sharply even when distributing coffee or newspapers.
It depends on whether the bus is equipped with standing seats according to the registration.
If not approved, passengers must be seated.
The Student Agency buses have no standing seats, the director of the company Radim Januura confirmed at the Aktu-ln-.cz website.
"We evaluated this with the Ministry and at the beginning it did not allow the movement of passengers on the bus.
After it was revoked and we concluded that passengers can use the bathroom during the ride if they have the assigned seat," he expressed his point of view.
The law does not recognize the steward.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the steward's role – no law deals with the regularization of this role."
However, no regulation prohibits the transporter from carrying out the services.
The law of road traffic recognizes only the accompanying term of the vehicle, its rights and duties are not defined," adds spokesman Hanzelka less clearly.
The director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorna, on the other hand, believes that the law cures this problem quite.
It depends if the bus has the approved standing seats.
That's all," he says.
It categorises buses in urban areas where there are standing seats and maximum speed limited, intercity with standing seats with highest and longest-distance mast speed without standing seats with maximum speed allowed and seats equipped with seat belts.
Like on a plane, says the expert.
The BESIP expert on road safety Jaroslav Hoon does not find the underlying problem in the movement of stewards on board the bus.
"During a quiet run there are not so many dangers, the situation can be compared to service on airplanes.
Not even there is sure when a turbulence comes and the flight attendant can bang his head."
"If the bus makes an abrupt brake, of course the laws of physics apply.
Same as in the urban bus or on the tram.
The shipping company must resolve the safety of stewards with an internal regulation," he also says and means that, from the point of view of the law, the issue is not resolved.
Janura is willing to suspend services.
Student Agency is the only transport company that offers steward services..
This takes about two hundred.
Even after the accident, the director considers their trade dangerous.
"As soon as I feel I have to consider the steward's profession as a dangerous job, I will abolish it.
Passengers can receive coffee and newspapers on their way up.
It would also decrease expenses," he says.
Asiana director Alexej Litvin, who runs a fraction of the lines compared to Student Agency, motivated the absence of stewards on his means as an interest in security.
"We have no stewardess, we are already opposed from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in a fatal accident," he said less than a year ago to Toden.cz.
An immense tragedy has happened.
In the accident of the line to Naples, a young hostess from the Plzec region died, who had worked for the company for two years.
A Slovenian truck probably came out of the emergency lane without using the arrow and blocked the way to the bus.
The bus driver tried to avoid it with an abrupt maneuver, but bumped it with the right front.
Janura rejects the fact that the two seats reserved for the rest of the stewarts had been occupied.
"It is not possible to reserve these seats in long-distance coaches, they are incedible."
The company plans to report the truck driver.
The agency will not wait for the Court's ruling to pay damages to the girl's family, but expects financial compensation from the perpetrator.
The revision of the law?
Not in sight
The revision of the law, on which a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for more than a year, could lead to the precise movement of stewarts on board buses.
"They have not achieved any concrete results, however.
They do not consider them so much the buses, they deal more with the scoring system, maximum speed on the highway and use of the mobile phone while driving," says the expert Hoon.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the stewarts as a major threat to passenger safety," this concludes spokesman Havelka, that the control of bus safety is the responsibility of the police and security offices.
The hopes of D'sseldorf point to Frankfurt
There is no shortage of words in the WestLB director's letter addressed to the house's co-workers.
In the letter published on Monday that "the capital market center of the savings bank financial group" could be formed through the unit meeting of the bank in Dusseldorf with the Deka-Bank in Frankfurt.
The West LB would launch "a competent block" with lasting profits in such a venture.
Moreover, such a whole union could be a decisive push for further ties in the L'nder banking sector.
So it is read, when a board of directors in difficult times wants to demonstrate the capacity for action.
Because the afflicted WestLB is still under heavy pressure.
Not only by the EU commission, but also through the National Financial Supervisory Authority, having long ago pointed out to the North Rhine-Westphalian regional government that time is running out in search of a future solution.
The links between Deka-Bank, which the same clients of the Savings Banks because of their investment funds already know, and the WestLB certainly has been talking about it for quite a while, even from Frankfurt.
The head of Deka-Bank Franz Waas reported in late August at the presentation of the turnover of the first half of the year that a merger of the house at Mainz Street with a national bank such as Helaba or West LB does not make sense.
However, the Deka board of directors who are half-carried by regional banks and savings bank consortia, has delegated the board of directors to conduct talks with the West LB on common bargaining.
It could be market negotiations or parts of them.
The conversations, however, have, as they say in the business square, just begun.
Of Deka-Bank, with its 3000 employees it is one of the ones that count most in the business square in Frankfurt, there is no mention of it the first time when it comes to consolidating the savings bank sector.
In 2003 for a short time it seemed that Deka-Bank could merge with Rhineland-Palatinate regional bank and Helaba.
Nothing was done about this three-way association.
As soon as the projects were published, the Hesse regional bank was opposed to Helaba's participation.
The remaining two institutes also proved unable to reach an agreement.
The regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate instead went to the regional bank of Baden-Wurttemberg in Stuttgart.
Yet they have often thought about it for a merger of Deka-Bank with regional banks.
However, in the end, the Helaba's chairman of the governing council, Mr. Merl, spoke out against design games to reunite with his home.
Apart from that, it seems that cognition is created, that the different public sector houses need to be approached.
Since the election of the Bavarian Parliament has passed, a meeting of the Bavarian Landesbank with that of Baden-Wurttemberg could occur at first.
This is not entirely good news for Helaba.
If the pressure for more mergers increases, the partners will gradually fail.
In the South now there would be the junior partner, although so far he has overcome the financial crisis much better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
The Hessen-Turingia savings bank association which participates with 85 percent of Helaba, put the deadlock at the meeting with WestLB.
Only the NordLB would remain
These geo-strategic reasonings are just one account.
On the other hand there is also the question of how the different business models of individual houses fit together.
In June Merl pointed out that the decisive question, by which business model the future of regional banks would be secured, would not yet be answered by the association of German savings banks.
In the end the division of the West LB could also come out, which by that of course is not desired.
Thus the letter of the board of directors expresses the will to aspire in any case to a "general solution".
We will see how the reunification of the individual parts with the Deka-Bank will work.
THE second weekend of the beer festival is dedicated to Italians
For Elena it is the first time while for Luca it is the third or fourth.
This time Elena is present at the party as a companion, and so she says everything is different.
Behind them next to the 5l. barrel of the Kaiser brand stands a massive bearded man and shows the approximately 200 travelers what deep tones he can produce from his throat.
Elena first gives Luca a pat and after a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here to the bus parking lot next to Porta Nuova station, four couriers leave tonight at 23.45 with destination Munich, Beer Festival" , arrival scheduled at 6.30.
Three couriers are reserved especially for Italians, in another they travel only Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking lot the South Americans are singing with the flag in their hand, having already celebrated during the night.
It is so noisy, says Marco, that it is not a thing for Italians.
Marco wearing a long coat with false fur lining and a pair of glasses with silver wide splints belong to him buses.
For 5 years they have been going to Oktoberfest, this year they are 3 tours.
The night trip, day trip to the party, back at 10:30 p.m.
Overnight would only create unnecessary expenses, Marco says.
THE cost of 45 Euro includes the trip, the welcome of the toast with Kaiser beer, made according to Bavarian genuineness standards, the sickness fund and the German guide – Marco attended a German course in Frankfurt.
And so at night the buses leave for the Brenner.
There's still no beer.
Suddenly the silence falls in the bus, the travelers sleep.
Better so, they will still need their strength.
They stop at Bressanone and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian plates on the A9 motorway before Munich take a short break.
When, as expected, Marco's group arrives at 6.30 a.m. at the parking lot near the Theresienwiese, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others regroup, Marco explains for the last time the attack program.
First, put on the yellow hat.
On it on the left there is written "Oktoberfest" next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency: "Conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When they open the doors of the beer tent it means running!", Marco quotes early in the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats at the bottom of the tent.
"Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all the yellow caps sitting on the same benches, divide into the adjacent space!"
The mug costs 8.25 Euro, Marco screams.
And don't forget to tip.
"Demonstrate to the security service, that we behave ourselves!
As soon as you leave the seats, they disappear!"
Third: "Tonight at 10:30 p.m. we meet again here! Do you understand?"
We're already leaving for the party.
On the street one attacks as you follow off the yellow caps to the trees, to the road signs and even to a billboard of a large Bavarian popular party.
You want to be ready to beat the retreat.
It is the second weekend of the festival, known as the "Italians' weekend".
Exact data do not exist, we speak of 50 thousand, who leave to cross the Alps and invade the tents, it is claimed that 10% of visitors come specifically from Italy.
The Munich police are being strengthened with 7 agents from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers supporting the Bavarian Red Cross, which makes a statistics on nationalities, where the Italians are in first place with 200 medical treatments in front of the British (about 60 medical treatments) and the Austrians (about 80).
Especially loved by Italians is the marquee of the Hofbr?uhaus.
1. Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
Germany's banking system is relatively stable, Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck confirmed last week..
It is good that the politician used the word "relative" and also mentioned, that the German banking sector is not spared from critical developments.
Because the crisis started on the weekend.
Real estate lender Hypo Real Estate, noted in the DAX, gets a billion-dollar credit from a consortium of German banks, in order to protect itself from market turmoil.
One person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday, support credits would reach up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest for the requested part.
Money comes from both private and public banks.
At the bottom are the losses of the Depfa affiliate.
The state financier according to a newspaper article has refinanced in the very short term – which is no longer possible due to market distrust.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's reserves had shrunk by 95% to €2.37 million, even its share of equity fell from 1.6 to 1.45.
Current income and net income from financial affairs had fallen to 0 compared to last year, profits from increases in both applications and certain shares as well as the liquidation of provisions in credits have fallen more than 70% to 5 million Euros.
Only thanks to higher incomes from the restitution of subordinated compensation costs that come from both the restructuring of the former Depfa group and the repayment of interest according to the single text of the tax laws and the management of business for business consortia, the negative profit was quite moderate with about 16%.
The former public financier after being privatized in 1990 had been lost in speculation with commercial real estate credits, which were spun off into the Aareal Bank.
Given that the income in classic state funding was too low, Depfa has engaged more in infrastructure projects and in financing joint projects of private and state investors (PPPs) and has diversified internationally.
The Hypo Real Estate now has to depreciate the value of the affiliate, which will have a fundamental material effect on the profit and loss account of the group.
The fact is that the dividends have been cancelled.
Already in 2007 they had been reduced by 2/3.
The Hypo Real Estate after the absorption of the Depfa is a major financier of the state and infrastructure.
It is more dependent on refinancing on the market among banks than other institutions, because it does not have customer trust deposits.
Due to the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago the granting of credits between banks largely dried up, because banks accumulate liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate annually needs for a part of Depfa's credit portfolio – about 50 billion – in the short term the means of refinancing.
According to the Hypo Real Estate notice the financial needs of the group were covered by the credit for a certain period and the company protected from the influence of mostly non-functioning international monetary markets.
From other sources it is heard, that thanks to the money the refinancing is secured until the end of 2009.
HRE Steering Committee Chairman Georg Funke on the contrary said that the HRE group will not need money markets in a short time.
The Bundesbank and the National Financial Supervisory Service Authority (BaFin) are based on the fact that the marketability of the HRE group is still assured.
This is hopefully for the bank's shareholders and creditors.
In view of the dynamics and imponderability of the crisis there will be no guarantee.
It is possible that the funding will not be used fully.
But the opposite is also not to be excluded.
After the bank learned on Sunday night that it was about to fail, the momentary bailout failed to calm the spirits.
The stock price falls by 75% to 3.30 Euros.
They hold up mortgage courses pretty well.
While earlier grade debts are almost unmoved, they yield the courses of the credits shown off.
The mortgages of the subsidiary W-rttemberg-Hypo are most striking, understandably due to expire after 2009.
Before the HRE mortgages seemed an alternative speculative investment, now their value must, after the strengthening of the crisis of the banks and the institute itself, that with the relief of the Depfa the crisis has happened, will have to be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
Until central banks, governments, and the least damaged banks are still ready, you can count on an amortization of the annuities within the deadline.
Or it comes into operation, what no one dares to hope – that the financial crisis will be overcome within the next 15 months.
But regarding information overturned due to partial statizations the near-certain probability has become a justified hope.
It will especially create for long-term investors some sleepless nights with the decision whether to split from their commitments.
Short-term investors may conclude the carry-over of losses for future payments of the capital gains compensation tax.
Sylvana and the Bento-Box Secrets
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, on the first day of school is supposed to show up at Tachibana Highschool, the girls start giggling: The German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas-in the new Log exchange tells about Japan.
The first day of school in Japan
How excited I was.
I also had a great time going to school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and I need 40 minutes by train to get to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find my own way, and thankfully I didn't get lost.
The beginning of the first hour of class does not seem to have been fixed as by us in Lower Saxony.
The schoolchildren arrive slowly from 8 am onwards, until a brief interview with the professor, the so-called "home room", begins at 8.40 am.
But before she started class, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I'm not the kind of guy who's willing to talk in front of people, plus in front of a class of 40 schoolchildren.
Since I didn't have my school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt from my host mother, along with a shirt, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Dressed like this, I sat in front of the chair and tried to say well: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..."- my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and I celebrate my birthday in a week.
At that moment I was very happy that I had already begun to learn the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class whispered, giggled, and made a sign and all the time I heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew this one from my Mangas.
It belongs to the essential lexicon of Japanese girls to survive and means "cute, sweet".
Then I quickly ran to my place.
The girl next to me grinned, for her it was an honor to sit next to an exchange pupil
The rest of the class had continued quietly, but when he played the gong, I was assaulted in the true sense of the word.
Everything was talking disorderly and giggled and annoyed me with questions – then it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
In the break everyone opened their Bento.
My host mother also made me a sandwich for Lunch- it's different from the boring German sandwiches.
I had risotto with spices, sausages, cucumber salad and seaweed, fruit and a kind of rolls with meat and tofu..
Actually, I don't even know what exactly I eat in Japan.
Things seem strange and have a whole new flavor.
Fact is, everything is really good.
Maybe except for the plums put in salt, brrr!
The Bentos are not just lunches at Japanese schools.
It happens sometimes that a girl gives a self-made Bento, prepared quite artistically, with the hope then to make the acquaintance of the boy during recreation.
I read it in my Manga comics.
I'm really curious, if I can find out.
"Why Japan?" my friends asked me when I told them, that I wanted to go to school in Japan for a year.
I've always said:
"Because it fascinates me "
Finally, I have been reading the Mangas fervently for years.
And in order to better understand the comics and the culture they contain, sooner or later I started to learn a little bit of the Japanese language.
I was completely convinced that I was going there once.
I am also fascinated by tradition, customs and customs.
They care a lot here.
On the one hand Japan is a place of technologies and latest trends -on the other side: strict, disciplined and traditional.
Since everything is organized well, I've never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen in my life."
1. Rats also have feelings
A rat or a cockroach flees when they feel the danger.
Neurologist Joseph Le Doux is convinced of this: many animals also have feelings.
4. But how could it be verified if, when they behave in the same way as us, they have the same feelings as us?
In the Internet newspaper "Edge" articles by well-known scientists have been published for some years.
6. SPIEGEL ONLINE in a series presents chosen answers to the question: "What do you think is true, without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings or other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else being able to prove it so far, since we can't even prove that other men have consciousness.
But in this case we must at least hope, that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
9. As soon as we turn to other species and ask questions about feeling or consciousness in general, we enter unworkable territory, because the reference base does not match.
When a rat is in a dangerous situation, it does the same things as other animals do, that is, it pretends to be dead, flees or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from where some scientists understand that there is a comparable subjective feeling.
I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make it difficult for us to convey our feelings towards animals.
On the one hand, it often connects the lateral prefrontal cortex with human awareness, the associated circuits (this is due to its direct participation in short memory and executive and control functions).
In humans this large area is much more developed than in other primates and it seems that among other creatures it is completely lacking.
At least in those aspects of our awareness dependent on the prefrontal cortex, including knowledge, who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, the foundation is thus admitted on the assumption that man differs even from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity should present itself in man's way of speaking: since a large part of life is connected to language, it is often said to be linked to consciousness.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
Although awareness does not depend on language, it would affect it so that awareness of the animal, as it is made, certainly differs greatly from the circumstances of our consciousness.
That is why it is difficult to find out how consciousness can be seen in other animals.
If it is not possible to measure it as an internal and subjective thing, in analyzing it through one's own experience because of the special hardware, their research will pose great problems for us.
Most interpretations refer to the content of conscious experience, but apart from that there is another aspect of consciousness that science would find easier to access.
One could analyze the processes of animal consciousness without regard to their contents, and this is precisely what happens in studies of the short memory of primates, particularly the example of visualization.
So for this principle, which Christof Koch und Francis Crick follow, we move first to the neural correlates of consciousness rather than the causal mechanisms: both could be identical but not necessarily.
Interestingly this principle also highlights the value of the prefrontal cortex for the implementation of visualization.
What, then, is outlined for feelings?
I blame them on the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in one of its conscious activities of the brain.
What we refer to as "fear" is therefore the state of mind in which we find ourselves when the activity of the localized defense system in the brain (or its consequences, such as body reactions) occupies working memory.
In this way, feelings are closely related to the regions of the cortex, which characterize primates and in particular the human being.
With the speaking nature subtle nuances of feeling are created, because we with the help of words and grammar can distinguish and categorize situations, to describe them to others.
Compared to this Antonio Damasio for example believes that feelings result from more primitive activities of the body regions of the sensations of the cortex and the cephalus paleo, similar to Jack Pankseep, who however focused more on the paleocephalus.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, this could absolutely be part of the feelings extended to the species.
On a purely theoretical level I cannot contradict it, however I consider it unprovable.
Pankseep points to arguments that what appears to rats and humans as fear, is probably felt this way with the senses in both cases: but how could it occur, if rats and humans feel the same thing when they behave in a similar way?
A cockroach in case of danger flees as if he too felt fear?
In my eyes the mere likeness of behavior cannot yet prove any vital likeness.
And that is neural comparison continues to help: rats and humans have similar paleoencephalons, cockroaches not even a brain.
But is the paleoencephalon responsible for feelings?
And even if you could prove it for humans : how is it that you would want to prove it on rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even insects (who knows?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on specific circuits and language), I prefer to study emotional behavior rather than the emotional feelings of rats.
In any case, there are neural advances here, as long as you give up the same procedure on rats and men.
Just as I don't do research on language and consciousness in rats, so I don't do it on their emotions, I don't even know if they exist.
This may be considered short-sighted, but I prefer to take steps forward, rather than continually slamming into a wall.
I'm a practical emotional.
UEFA President Platini: postponement for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik said preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the president and prime minister.
"The government sees Uefa's decision in Bordeaux as a show of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize Europeans with Poland," Wasjunik said.
"This, however, is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still much to be done in both countries"
Both host countries limp into the roadmap for building or rebuilding stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
Eventually the number of stadiums to be used by Europeans will even be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
Now we have to work with maximum speed," said the president of the Ukrainian association Grigory Surkis.
"UEFA will keep a constant eye on us"
An even more radical step was taken in Poland.
After numerous scandals the management of the Polish association PZPN was suspended by the national Olympic committee and replaced with the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of Sports Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "a serious danger that the PZPN will not be able to operate according to the rules," Drzewiecki told Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we assured UEFA President Michel Platini that preparation for EM 2012 will not suffer."
Several members of the first division only last season were convicted of manipulation, in the end it even had to postpone the start of the League at the last moment.
Dennis Quaid retorts outraged
He wanted to promote a new film, in an interview he talked about the private and now he has trouble with the former: the Hollywood star Meg Ryan has declared adulterous his former Dennis Quaid.
He foams with anger and retorts.
Late-burst Roses War for former married couple Meg Ryan und Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their separation the two Hollywood actors now quarrel with each other - in public.
Meg Ryan in an interview with the American magazine InStyle last week for the first time spoke about the reasons for the failure of the marriage: "Dennis has long been unfaithful to me, and this has been very painful."
The extent of the betrayals she would come to know her only after the separation.
The occasion for the "soul stripper" was Ryan's work with the press for her new film "The Women" – it tells the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his being publicly declared an adulterous husband was clear: it would be "unprecedented," the fifty-four-year-old told the "New York Daily News," which "Meg repeats and reworks the story of our relationship once again."
It would also be "deplorable" that Jack, the 16-year-old son they had together, again "may be publicly reminded of the pain and subversion, which a separation means to every child."
While Ryan from the separation lives alone, Quaid is married again and will soon become the father of twins.
And therefore his judgments close with the arrow: "My life in any case goes on.
I consider myself lucky to have a wonderful family to whom everything goes for the best."
Prices for airline tickets and hotels drop
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights would be up to 50% cheaper, according to a current study
Flights and hotel overnight stays have become cheaper again - this is the result of a study by financial and travel provider American Express.
The company analyzed its booking data for the first half of the year of 2008 and after a price increase in the first quarter observed a noticeable decline in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have risen for years, overnight stays in many places have already fallen in price.
From January to March prices rise in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed still on average around 6.9 compared to 2007
However, from April to June prices were already 3.6 % lower than in the previous year.
The most obvious trend would have been in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 up to 37% less than a year earlier..
The American Express sees as the reason for this the weak price of the dollar, which would have led to a "warm desire to travel of American tourists"
Financial centres such as Frankfurt and London would also be affected by the recession in hotel prices more strongly than industrial centres such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger
In the Norwegian city the prices of hotels with an increase of 26.3 % even hold the record in Europe
Also with regard to flight prices the trend in the first quarter still marks up:
Due to the kerosene price increase Economy Class passengers had to pay an average of 7.1% compared to 2007, long-haul fuel intensive flights would even be up to 29.2% more expensive
From April to June, Economy Class airline ticket prices fell by an average of 12.5% compared to the previous quarter, but price changes were far weaker in the first class and Business.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more strongly than in other European countries:
From January to March prices had risen by 11.9 %, in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 %.
As for domestic German flights according to the study prices have even halved.
Reason for the price crash would be on the one hand the downward economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market has crumbled.
On the other hand, there would be the agreement on open skies, which liberalizes air traffic between the US and Europe, an increased pressure of competition.
A sign of the critical situation would be the suppression of unprofitable routes at Airlines, as well as the high figure of airlines that in the first half of 2008 would declare bankruptcy – only in Europe were they 24 airlines.
HSV beat Gladbach 1-0
With a goal and simple methods the SV Hamburg becomes a leader.
At Borussia Luhukay still can't find a group of 11 that works.
Here Kristoffer Klein worsens the makeshift landing for national team player Marko Marin.
Gladbach player first came in late in the game and failed with a shot on the crossbar
His message was precisely formulated, it passed on his lips convincingly.
He knew he was absolutely right
"We need the second goal," Hermann Rieger exclaimed in the Hamburg arena booth corridor.
Not much had happened in the catacombs, the game break was over and most sat back in place.
Rieger has been HSV's physiotherapist for nearly 3 decades, enjoying an even greater esteem than certain old players.
And so his admonition also found heed in the high spheres.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumb as a sign of approval.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
His order must have sounded similar: here is the second goal!
The change of position did not occur.
"Today not everything was good to see here," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt would also "want to be more relaxed".
For the 1 to zero, those in Hamburg have to thank the header scored by Mladen Petric (11) and the fact that the very weak players in Gladbach could not hurt the weak players in Hamburg.
"It was a dirty win," Martin Jol summarized.
The SV Hamburg this Monday will turn 121 years old.
The spectators celebrated already before, on the afternoon of Saturday, themselves, the blue sky on the arena and the flashing ranking on the video screen, which legitimized their sports club as before the class.
It's going to be a birthday without a real party.
"We're able to make it right," Marcell Jansen said.
He has the feeling, that the provisional certificate from the table is more indicative of the unpredictability of the championship than of the dominance of his HSV.
The team with its new arrivals hired late – Brazilians Neves und Silva, the goalkeeper Petric as well as Jansen blown to FC Bayern – finds herself slowly, but has not yet managed to shine.
"We need more atmosphere and more Dribbling," Jol forcefully re-launches.
After the defeat of the vote
Fear circulates on Wall Street.
Early reports of the failure of the bailout package temporarily brought down the Dow Jones by 700 points.
This was the biggest loss of points in the one-day space of its history.
Later the Down got a little better again.
At around 20:30 the world's most important stock exchange barometer listed/received with a good 5% in shortfall on 10,579 payers.
Nasdaq Tech Stock Exchange was firm with a deficit of more than 7% out of 1548 points
The biggest loser at that time was the Dow American Express, it put just 14% back, and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12%.
No title could make it.
The shares of the Goldman Sachs bank have divested by just 10 %.
Just a few days earlier, the great investor Warren Buffett had taken part in the venture.
Under the rescue plan, financial funds were to be allocated for the hoarding of so-called mortgage documents.
The sum must be paid, however, not in one stroke, but by degrees.
On the other hand, the State had to maintain the Aktienoptionscheine of financial companies, which could be redeemed with an adequate trend of the quotations, to reduce the charge for the State's coffers.
The stock price in Europe and the US in the downward spiral
The billions of aid for banks in Europe and the US do not erase investors' doubts.
The stock price of the big German bank Hypo Real Estate plummets and tears the index of the German stock exchange down

The shares of the Monaco real estate lender have lost despite the rescue action of the federal government and private banks temporarily 3 quarters of their value, the Commercial Bank has yielded more than 20%.
The German DAX stock exchange index slipped sharply below the psychologically important 6000 points and is listed with a deficit of 3.7% out of 5,839 points.
World stock markets fall to their knees.
In New York Wall Street opened with a clear deficit.
Investors have feared that the US government's $700 billion bailout package may not be enough to bring financial markets back to growth.
The Dow lost in the first hour of business 334 points or 3.3% out of 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the bailout plan, the Senate vote could follow on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges could only one direction: in London for the time being the FTSE index fell by 3.2%, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9%.
In Asia the Nikkei benchmark index after the initial profits had a shortfall of 1.26 % on 11,743.61 payers.

Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has created perplexity among scientists: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during the so-called Swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einsteins' general theory of relativity may not be entirely accurate.
The Ulysses spacecraft has been flying through space for nearly 18 years.
Because of the fast-freezing fuel pipes, death by freezing now looms over her.
Among scientists for years a mysterious phenomenon creates havoc – the Swing-by anomaly
Swing-by is a space probe flight maneuver, by which they obtain additional momentum/push/oscillation in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example of the Earth.
So probes can save a lot of fuel.
The Euro-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical gimmick as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
What amazes scholars already for years: rockets do not behave quite as one would expect under the law on gravitation.
In fact, there are irregularities in speed.
Probes suddenly become faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
The year renamed the Swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction force of matter with a curvature of space, might not be entirely accurate.
American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study firmly believes as before Einstein was not mistaken, and attempts to explain the Swing-by anomaly by means of the so-called dark matter that astronomers have spotted in the cosmos.
"Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter that could also be very close to Earth," he writes.
Space scholars have only known about the existence of dark matter for about 10 years.
A force of attraction evidently emerges from her, the effect of which on the other celestial bodies is shown.
Instead, she herself is completely invisible, that is to say, she does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation whatsoever, especially just any visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, dark matter constitutes at least a good fifth of the entire mass of the cosmos.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After 10 days in the hands of their kidnappers tourists kidnapped in Egypt would be free again, as confirmed by the Italian foreign minister.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros in ransom.
In a shooting before the release 6 kidnappers were reported to have been killed.
Five Germans were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Negotiations for the ransom are already underway.
The Germans are always in the crosshairs of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are undoubtedly free.
This was reported in agreement by Egyptian state television, the Arab broadcaster Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the news of the Italian television station Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released
We are examining their state of health," Frattini said.
The 5 Germans, 5 Italians and one Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian chaperones would be in good health and safe, Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 components of a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The background of a shooting that took place before the hostages were released remains unclear: therefore, the kidnappers after the indications of an Egyptian public security agent would have been ready for the conclusion of the kidnapping, before the Sudanese army killed 6 of them by surprise.
"The problem had been solved.
They agreed to a ransom," the official said.
It would be "still only a matter of taking over the hostages", when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt had shot dead 6 of the kidnappers and captured 2 of them.
The kidnappers had demanded from Germany a ransom of the amount of 6 million euros; the money should have been delivered by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported in reference to a German intermediary, the release of the hostages would be delayed, because the kidnappers feared for their own safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers wanted to release the women as hostages after the ransom was paid.
The men were supposed to be held until the kidnappers had a safe escape.
The German embassy in Cairo declined a position on the report.
Father's abuse "led to suicide"
Years of abuse by her stepfather led to a woman killing herself, a court said.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, was in prison for 6 years after admitting eight cases of sexual assault.
Truro Crown Court learned that he regularly harassed his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle, when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession note, "I feel responsible for his death."
The court learned that Miss Randle had killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a child and lived in Coventry, Trerise harassed and blindfolded her before having sex, while her mother was out working in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
But the court learned that Mrs. Randle, who had spent a lot of time volunteering at the National Trust, was tormented by the abuses that had caused her.
In 2006, Public Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that Ms. Randle's friends, who had been a very good surfer and cyclist, were "excitingly dead", and that she had "tied with life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
She is thought to have killed herself by choking herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle comforted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession that ended: "I bound and blindfolded her."
"I didn't sexually harass her.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise, "You are an extremely strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been terrifying, especially when you were only seven years old.
"This unpleasant saga ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even harder is the fact that if he did not, it would have been difficult for the facts to have ended before the court."
I notice the effects Stephanie's father and mother describe having had on their daughter in these years.
"Otherwise it was clearly likely that she had been a promising and happy successful young woman."
The officer who lost the data will be punished.
The Cabinet Office officer who left the top-secret documents on a train in June must be charged by the Official Secrets Act, the BBC has learned.
The man was away from the Ministry of Defence when he left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It is the least delicate of the charges made under this law and there is nothing to suggest criminal intent.
BBC defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the movement would come as a surprise to many in the administration.
"They must have thought this was being dealt with internally at the Mod and the Cabinet Office," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is about to be charged under section 8.1 of the act, the clause concerning the safeguarding of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service recommended that the officer must be charged by the Metropolitan Police because of the highly sensitive nature of his work.
The documents he lost contained assessments of al-Qaaeda and the capabilities of Iraq's security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken away from his home and taken to a hidden location.
Construction companies face the bill of B&B
The UK construction companies could face an account of over $80,000 after the Bradford & Bingley bank was bailed out.
The Government has given 14 billion pounds to protect the deposits of 2.6 million Bradford & Bingley savers.
Interest on that loan will be paid by all companies that take the money of savers, including the 59 construction companies.
Building Societies Association (BSA) general manager Adrian Coles said it is "irritating" that companies and their members have to pay.
The 14-billion pound loan will eventually be repaid when Bradford & Bingley's mortgages are redeemed.
But the interest that will accrue in the meantime will be charged each year to the 700 financial companies that take deposits. But the interest that will accrue in the meantime will be charged each year to the 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies would be included in that number.
It is irritating that those institutions that have behaved prudently... are now called upon to pay part of the bill of those institutions that have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company had to pay in proportion to the deposits it had, and that companies among them had to pay 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest on the loan will amount to 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find 81 million pounds to pay the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, general manager of the construction company association, told the BBC that he believes it is unfair.
"It is irritating that those institutions that have behaved prudently in the recovering home market are now being called upon to pay part of the bill of those institutions that have been much less prudent."
According to the BSA, no company has failed since documentation began in 1945.
"We need to examine all aspects in the coming weeks to see what options there are to protect construction companies and their members from what could be a significant account," added Mr. Cole.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010 the interest of an entire year will be due and this could be almost twice as high.
Since construction companies are mutual organizations with no shareholders, their members end up paying the bill through higher rates or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Milk rises to 5 pence per liter
People in Jersey are facing the fact that they have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that there will be an increase in the wholesale prices of its milk for an extra five pence per liter from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a twopence increase in February, and comes after a search carried out by a consulting company.
Retailers have to decide for themselves if they want to dump the price increase on their customers.
(DANILO) Before the February increase, the wholesale price changed for the last time in 2002.
Bail denied to former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A Bangladeshi court refused a bail request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, meaning that she could be arrested when she returns to the country.
Her lawyers said the court refused to grant her bail for extorting 50 million taka ($729,700) from a businessman when she was a member of parliament
The case is one of many corruption charges hanging against her.
Sheikh Hasina's longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, had been released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina's return to Bangladesh is scheduled for the next few weeks but his party, Awami League, has called for the temporary government of the military-backed country to give her total freedom first.
Correspondents say that while she was going abroad for medical treatment on her word, it is unclear under the terms of her release, if she can remain at large when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say he will appeal to the Supreme Court against the High Court order.
"The high court refused the bail request for Sheikh Hasina claiming that she cannot have bail since she is already abroad on the floor for medical treatment," says her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will file an appeal against the order of the High Court."
His lawyers explain that he needs bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
He expects Sheikh Hasina to return home after October 17, a senior leader of the Awami League party said Sunday.
She was detained last year after the government flanked by the military force seized power, but was released in June, to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fear for the Afghan anti-polio campaign
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan are missing from the recent immunization campaign due to Taliban-related violence, the UN says.
The UN carried out a vaccination program in six provinces last week.
But it is said that he cannot reach the children in the parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for safety reasons.
A UN spokesman said this was despite promises from the Taliban that they would not attack or hinder thousands of staff carrying vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal battle with ITV
BSkyB lost its legal battle with the Competition Commission's decision to force the company to reduce its stake in rival TV station ITV.
BSkyB was told by the competition's appellate court to cut its shares in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the commission had said that BSkyB's participation hindered competition and allowed unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought the stake in 2006 in a deal that effectively blocked NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that the acquisition of BSkyB stake in ITV sows doubts about ITV's independence, causing the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
Virgin's chief, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom's regulator opposed the purchase.
BSkyB argued that forcing it to reduce its ITV stake was unreasonable and a disproportionate remedy - particularly as BSkyB had said it would surrender its voting rights.
New investigation into U.S. prosecutor's case
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special Public Prosecutor to examine the dismissal of nine American lawyers in 2006.
The operation occurred when a report on the case by the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticized the actions of administrative officers.
The report was critical of the White House, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was triggered by fear that prosecutors had been removed for political reasons.
Special prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers questioned during the investigation lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
"Serie allegations regarding potentially criminal behavior have not been fully investigated or established," Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The assignment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of the main recommendations.
The dispute began when nine American prosecutors were removed from their positions by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the department said the lawyers had been fired for poor performance.
But later it emerged that the dismissed lawyers had not been rated poorer than so many other colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the dismissal had been motivated by politics.
Some of the prosecutors had been involved in the prosecution of high-profile Republican members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate charges of fraud against Democratic voters.
U.S. prosecutors investigate and bring lawsuits to court on behalf of the government.
They can be fired at any time, but they cannot be fired for political reasons.
The then head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, found himself in the storm over layoffs, and eventually resigned his position.
A number of other Justice Department officers quit.
(The Inspector General's report was very critical of Mr. Gonzales' role in the case, saying that he held a primary responsibility in the dismissals, that he had abdicated his role as leader and had been extraordinarily detached during the trial.
Other officials, including Bush's former senior assistant Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The Meat Loaf epic will be celebrated
Rock star Meat Loaf is about to be honored at the Q Awards for her epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will withdraw his special gold award at next week's ceremony in London, said he was "honored" to earn recognition.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 album hit.
Coldplay will lead the nominations for this year's awards, being on the list of nominees in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said, "There are some songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is undoubtedly one of them."
The song, composed by Jim Steinman, required a strong vocals that was provided by Meat Loaf.
It opened with an instrumental section that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released as a UK single in 1979 and reached 15th place.
But Meat Loaf's album Bat Out Of Hell remained almost nine years on the chart and went on to sell more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, including surgery for an irregular heartbeat in 2003 after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
It emerged later that he had a cyst on a vocal cord.
Dark city streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other cross roads, some famous, others merely of use.
But even many longtime veteran and resident taxi drivers find it difficult to give the location of Extra Place, mostly because they have never heard of it.
The tiny street is in the East Village and goes north from the First Street – without making the Second Street – between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, it looks more like a dusty alley than an active busy route.
There are no road signs.
It is virtually impossible to see her on a normal atlas.
The road must, however, have admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the luxury building real estate company recently built on First Street.
You want to reopen Extra Place and create a cleaner passage for shops and boutiques that should open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include longtime neighbors who say they were hit by the truncated road simply because it was one of the last remnants of the stately quarter of the past.
But the city's preservation and development department, which has control of the streets, has no interest in keeping it.
During a meeting of the land use committee of the municipal district commission some representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay outlined a proposal for the real estate company to buy the way.
But the committee prefers the road to remain in the hands of the city, and has called for a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, the district director of Community Board 3.
"There is very little space left to the city property, and we would like the city to continue to own Extra Place," he said.
"There could be proposals to fix and manage it, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to ensure public access."
Avalon Bay many months ago announced that it would reopen the small street and install seating, including some to use for a café to which the real estate company hopes to lease space.
The idea of Avalon Bay buying the road was first made public at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the road, it does not necessarily mean that it wants to own it.
"Avalon Bay's main concern is to renew this derelict alley and turn it into a public amenity," he said, adding that the city suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a Preservation Housing spokesman, said that in fact it was the city's desire to sell the street and pointed out that the agency's purpose was to develop the property rather than administer it.
In comparison to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight historical imprint.
Some believe that it was named in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among his many children and the narrow strip of land was not claimed.
The back door of CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened on Extra Place, and the street is perhaps best known as the set for the cover photo of the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia."
"The terrain was gorgeous," said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the picture in November 1976.
"He was full of garbage, shreds of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including some bloggers who write about East Village's "gentrification", have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, claiming that the piece of public property, modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have lauded Extra Place as a rarity – a town fragment almost not at all changed that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who has a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Lamentations: A Little Nostalgic Look at the Endangered City"), published part of a Discourse in the History of the City that appeared in The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a cramped, dead-end alleyway, dark even in the daytime and bounded doors of rusty iron warehouses and windows with shutters, with weeks-old newspapers fluttering down the slums."
With a few exceptions, the road looked almost the same as on a recent evening.
A rat ran smoothly across the back of the road near a door leading into the CBGB, which is now the site of an aristocratic clothing store.
On the walls were graffiti and an empty 22-ounce beer bottle lying next to a group of fresh abandoned newspapers.
Few passers-by have said that they rarely thought of Extra Place but suggest that it would need to be a little embellished.
Mr. Fields, for his part, said that he also thinks some people underestimate the attraction of the road in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said "were in black, dirty, and disgusting places."
The Bilingual Debate: Immersion in English
In this episode of Educational Look, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a senior member in California studies and the senior director of educational studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs to Pick a School."
To truly attract Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's educational projects are a significant example.
Mr. Obama's campaign notes that, "African-American and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students," which is true.
To combat these shortcomings in achieving goals, Obama's education plan specifically supports, among other things, "transient bilingual education" for English students.
Yet, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes classroom teaching of languages other than English, does not take into account his interest in bridging learning gaps.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
Students at the school are mostly Hispanic and low-income.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived, are studying English.
But, among fourth graders, an astonishing 100 percent of students took the higher level test in the 2008 maths state exam.
An equally surprising 93 percent of fourth graders took the expert-level test on art-of-language-English.
This incredible achievement was achieved using a different ingredient from Mr. Obama's preferred one.
Sixth Street emphasizes review and exercise, constant assessment of skills and an attitude of the "no excuses" kind.
Also, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school's obstructive approach to English students is "full immersion."
The use of English emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in the context of education.
Mrs. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, "We had a fantastic success with a student who just came from Mexico and if you had entered the class 12 months later you wouldn't have been able to pinpoint which one it was."
"It works," he remarked "for us it works."
Would Obama model a school like Sixth Street Prep to replicate it in other Hispanic-majority schools and with English students?
The school's achievements make the answer to that question very easy, but educational policy in its own party (the National Education Associations is a long-standing advocate of bilingual education) and its own continued support for bilingual education prevent it from predicting Mr. Obama's response.
While he agrees that immigrants should study English, Obama recently made the subject trivial when he said that people should stop worrying about "English-only" legislation.
Instead, he said, "you have to be sure that your children are capable of speaking Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close these gaps in achievement, he should carefully consider the educational models that work rather than despise or trivialize them.
Oil falls sharply and renews economic fear
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday due to concerns that even the US bailout plan for financial markets may not be able to raise the economy.
Crude futures fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel on the New York merchant exchange in morning operations.
Prices have lost more than $20 a barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been rocked by Wall Street's financial turmoil, and by a pair of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.26 a barrel in June, prices had plummeted to nearly $90 a barrel earlier this month, before rising again, against the backdrop of tremendous uncertainty in financial markets.
Anxiety influenced investors again on Monday even after congressional leaders said they had reached a weekend deal about the bailout, the largest in history.
The news was overshadowed by fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the latest episode of the progressive merger, Citigroup will buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, the government said on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said the hectic weekend negotiations had led to a bailout deal "seem to have failed to revive market sentiment.
As the economic situation worsens, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to calm down.
"The outlook for global equity, interest rates and exchange rate markets has become uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape contagion.
From a raw material perspective our most pressing concern is to what extent the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China."
Bank analysts have lowered their expectations for the coming year while home oil consumption due to the slowdown in economic growth, reducing oil and gas price forecasts by about 20 percent for 2009.
The exploit in the second quarter marks a team record.
After spending more time than anyone in the Jets uniform in the last eight and more seasons, defender Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all.
Then he watched the second quarter of Sunday, when the Jets turned a pointless game into a comeback.
"Never seen such a thing," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals had matched the grayness of the menacing clouds over them with a sluggish game.
Then quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, providing the perfect signal for an afternoon when their growing tuning took a giant step forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns in the fourth, including one when one cornerback fell and another with 10 seconds remaining at the end of the first half.
"I didn't get off my path," Favre said of all the passes that came to Coles.
He's a great player.
Our communication has been great, despite what people may think."
While Favre and Coles played catch games, the defense hit Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner heavily.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a stray launch and re-launched it for 32 yards in a touchdown.
Security Eric Smith predicted another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens forces a Warner fumble.
The last turnover, the fumble forced by Bowens, may have been the most notable.
The Cardinals took the lead on that ball possession, with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets had picked up the ball with 10 minutes left, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard goal, for a 34-to-0 lead.
It was more than the Jets ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe his insanity, Jets coach Eric Mangini said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When both were told - the Jets conceded 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said, "I can tell you that I liked the second quarter a lot more than the third."
There were a lot of points in a small amount of time."
Gebrselassie rested surpasses his world record
Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia showed again why many consider him the best marathon runner ever, breaking his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to run a 26.2-mile run under 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a win over the race favorably flat in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie shattered his previous score of 2:03:26 for 27 seconds, run last year in Berlin.
At 35, Gebrselassie sets the 26th world record of such a stunning career that he has produced a world championship or world record at every distance from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect - that air pollution would worsen his asthma problems.
Instead, he decided to run to Berlin.
In near perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees on arrival - Gebrselassie won on Sunday with a hot average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As soon as half a cross-country skier like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya went to long distances, the marathon record fell by more than two minutes in the past decades, since Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil won in Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago he had calf cramps and missed a week of training.
Clearly, the rest left it cool, not rusty.
"I'm so happy," Gebrselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and I had some doubts today, but in the end everything went well."
He has been somewhat criticized - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's East African rival - for over-orchestrating his races, generally avoiding many of the world's best marathon stars, counting on openers as if it were a mid-bottom race, and setting world records above the sense of competition.
But these criticisms rarely diminish the magnitude of Gebrselassie's skills as a marathon runner.
With the pace cadenced by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie reached the halfway point in 1:02:04.
Two elite Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, held Gebrselassie in competition after the openers vanished.
A little over three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie made a final surge to separate from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his personal best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan who is now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year by winning in 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time ever.
Britain's Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko was a surprise winner of the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the Beijing Games with what is described as a bad accident, but she recovered to win in Berlin, making her personal best time of almost five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
She ran a race doing the calculations well, letting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners start with a big gap, taking them back after about 18 and a half miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia finished second in 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a city apart, pride and processes of a black life
Hidden in the extended theme park on the outskirts of Orlando, a few miles from the splendor, the noise, the huge, lies the quiet city where pride and the complications of the African-American experience enter life.
Eatonville, the country's first all-black incorporated town and home of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, plenty of guava, two schools and no prison."
It is now a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to show their respect to Hurston, Harlem Renaissance's most famous writer.
Yet in many ways, the city he described - and which makes tourists stop by understanding it in the Florida tour guide produced by the Depression-era Federal Writers' Project - remains a separate place.
He is as independent, dignified and private as he was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their thoughts with the white man, who "knowing so little about us, does not know what is being lost."
Even now, in a year when a black presidential nominee, Senator Barack Obama, has been called for an opening speech on race, many here remain wary of the outsider's gaze.
"We are very cautious about how our story is told," said Hortense Jones, 59, a lifelong resident and member of the city's oldest church.
"It must be right."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and difficulty.
It is both a historical model of black takeover and a community of nearly 2,400 where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a literary center but also an example in the shade of the oak trees of the rural culture of southern blacks - sometimes disdained, sometimes rewarded - born of American slavery.
Not surprisingly, the residents here are both proud and protective.
And concern for Eatonville's imagination really began with Zora, whom everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented the world to her hometown through sincere, dialect-rich books, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of the Florida guide transformed the city, just off Rout 17, a road running through the often forgotten center of Florida into a scenario of black history and human drama
Low as a bass in both life and literature, Hurston took readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then diverted to more private areas.
"Out of the street to the left," he wrote "is the modern public school, brown with white finishes, with its well-kept gardens and courtyards, which Howard Miller always looked after, thinking he could just read and write."
She also mentioned the widow's new husband Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and whatever suits the passing rooms".
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government but also illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Clearly this wasn't Fodor's.
In fact, it was not a portrait that everyone appreciated.
"Zora said it as it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of Johnson's girls who Hurston immortalizes by quoting men who sing coarse songs about their beauty.
He adds, "Some people don't like it."
Hurston is still remembered here as a vibrant eccentric who frequently returned to her family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembers that when Hurston swooped into the city, he habitually arrived unannounced in a triumphant Chevrolt, smoking and wearing trousers in a city that even today boasts of dignified clothing.
Many inhabitants were fascinated, says Mr. Franklin, while others sneered.
"People were always very happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But, he added, rocking in his chair on the back patio overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "she never stayed long."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and his books had gone out of print.
Along with the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unplated grave in Fort Pierce, Fla., where she had lived.
In Eatonville, there were no major memorial ceremonies, and no major conference.
"I don't think they understand his contribution to the world or his legacy to everyone," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A change occurred in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to place a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the two-lane main road.
Orlando's expansion has already pushed La Interstate 4 across the western edge of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, in addition to other things, had ended its idyllic isolation of the community
In the 1950s, the battle over racial mixing brought hatred to the community's doorstep.
"During that time, a group of white boys, they came and threw oranges and things at people sitting on one side," says Mr. Franklin.
"In fact we had a girl who was killed by that one time.
They threw a watermelon out of a car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston made a request to the Supreme Court for forced integration, calling his decision in Brown against the school office "an insult rather than an honor to my race".
Residents now say that the desegregation of schools, despite having been positive in some respects, dilutes the cohesion of Eatonville and jeopardizes the confidence of its young people.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember this - you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, the daughter of Ella Dinkins and the executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
This lasted, he added, until the teachers and students came from the same place.
"You didn't hug your white teacher because your white teacher...- I mean, there's a cultural divide there," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped and created room for many other Zora Neale Hurstons - black writer, actress and artist who overcame prejudices, as he did, with cheerful self-confidence and lines such as: "How can some deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
I just can't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker began a long journey to Hurston's license-free grave and began to fight for the resurrection of her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway hit bookstore shelves, reintroducing it into the American canon.
The highway project came just as his most famous daughter had drawn the limelight again.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community began planning in 1988 a festival dedicated to Hurston to show what could ruin the state with its highway.
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the commemoration.
Many years later, the state backed out of its project on the street.
"The five lanes of the resurrected highway, they brought what would be said to be high speed, a real pride to the city," Ms. Nathiri said.
Mrs. Boyd puts it more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the highway project helped to change the city's image of itself.
Those from out of town like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began coming to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to reevaluate the past.
Eatonville was added to the public historical record in 1998.
A new single-story bookstore (called Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a repaved and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly in Florida: only six miles from downtown Orlando, it can give the feeling of a secondary road in the summer rain, as small as when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1800s.
(It's 90 percent black today.)
Outsiders who come to search for Eatonville's story, by its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A permit requested in advance is required for most interviews, some things - such as murals on Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man, showing black men in the fields - are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Ms. Jones, a plump teacher, with a penchant for bright red, still fear that their island community will be misunderstood.
Yet, as soon as the Hurston festival expanded, a high level of city pride also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville with Hurston saw his entire race: beautiful, problems and everything, neither better, nor worse and proud, creative, great worker, foolish and confused like other races and ethnic groups in America.
It is sincere civic affection that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or for the Police Department, which he said may need help.
And even those who are younger, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"A lot of people, if they just came in here, they'll think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,'" said Alondra Kenon after Mass on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at history, it's really a pretty city."
Here in New York we all speak fluently of finance
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newspaper stalls and huge TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't notice being in the eye of the cyclone.
They would never guess that the glass, honeycomb offices above their heads the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York are living every day on the worst "bad day in the office" since the 1929 crash.
The deliverymen shake metal carts for the tea across the sidewalks, carrying trays of muffins for breakfast meetings.
Latino Americans drag their feet between apartment buildings carrying, like human mules, 50 and broken stretched shirts hanging from a stick on their shoulders.
The employees are still waiting in line for their morning bagel to the food carts on the sidewalks, and it is still impossible to take a yellow taxi between 4pm and 7pm on a working day.
It didn't seem like there was a real crisis, until, with all the talk of ruin and sadness, I decided to open a new savings booklet Thursday afternoon.
Although I had planned the matter so that it would coincide with the late afternoon break at my JP Morgan Chase branch, a tail of about twenty was already waiting in line.
Not in front of the cashier's counter, to withdraw money or make deposits, but in front of the customer service counter, where old customers order checkbooks, tourists ask directions to the Macy department store and new customers open accounts.
Many of those in front of me, I would then learn from Starr, my "trust banker," were in line for the same reason as me.
Unlike me, however, they have already taken savings from smaller banks from the places they commute, such as those from New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They have taken money from so-called thrifts (a bit like a construction company), credit cooperatives and types of city savings banks whose branches operate only within a state, and say they treat customers as family members.
In past years, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, has been subject to controlled administration, and, as New Yorkers headed home for the weekend on a Friday afternoon, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a buyer to save it.
The clerks and clerks standing in front of me, afraid of another collapse, were moving their money to a bank perceived as a safe haven, the bank that is demanding more bail on Wall Street.
Common New Yorkers in recent weeks have become proficient in finance.
A woman at my trusted Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bankrupt bank, and its emaciated general manager Dick Fuld in all familiarity, as if complaining about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed doorkeeper, almost 50 years old of my apartment building, changed the subject of our normal conversation about Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my groceries.
She told me, after my visit to the bank, "Now I have all my savings in market funds!.
I've changed, I'm not taking any chances."
Muslim tombs desecrated as Austria turns right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, to the left of the Austrian right wing of the Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right-wing party Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization "City against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry signs such as road signs representing mosques with a red line passing in between.
Police blamed right-wing extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same week that far-right political parties gained a lot in the national general election.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged at Traun Cemetery, near Linz, in a few hours between Friday night and this morning, in what police believe was organized action.
The culprits sprayed Jewish symbols such as the Star of David over some graves, but detectives believe it may have been an attempt to mask extremist motivations driven by a hatred for Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident is related to the election in any way.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the desecration, which took place towards the end of Ramadan, a month of religious significance for Muslims.
Austria meanwhile embarked on a spiritual quest trip following its right turn in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that took almost 30 percent of the vote, the Austrian Freedom Party and the Alliance for Austria's Future, campaigned with vehement anti-immigration tickets and some of their slogans were defined by xenophobic critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against veils and burkas and also expressed his opposition to foods that are perceived to be connected to Islam.
At the final rally in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties appear to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, alleging that they are political symbols of a continued Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses made immediately after the election, which established the far right as the strongest political bloc in the nation, indicating that the change was brought into predominance by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Travel abroad forbidden to Gary Glitter.
Gary Glitter, the glamorous rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, has been banned from travelling to France and Spain by the court.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the authorities controlling him that he wanted to go to Spain via France.
The ban on foreign travel was granted to Kent police last Thursday after it had provided the magistrates with evidence of Glitter's previous arrests for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadi, was not present at Ashford's court hearing in Kent but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: "On Thursday 25 September at the Ashford court, Kent police filed a request to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from travelling abroad to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd wasn't there in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed authorities that he wanted to travel abroad as required by the sex offenders' registry.
He must notify the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He is also required to give the police seven days' notice of his scheduled departure date.
Failure to notify the authority may lead to a sentence of five years in prison.
Kent police said they did not want to discuss individual cases or possible Glitter movements in the country.
A Kent police spokesman said: "Kent police will do whatever it takes to protect children in this country or abroad.
"From our point of view, it is easier to control someone who remains in the UK because we have suitable comprehensive systems to manage every potential risk more effectively.
"Protecting Kent residents is the main concern of Kent police and we work closely to monitor the behaviour of those convicted of registered sex crimes in the country to minimize any possible risk to the public.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls aged 10 and 11.
When Glitter came he flew to Bangkok where he was to board a flight to London.
But he said he felt sick and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities would not let him pass passport control and eventually took a flight to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also did not let him in and returned to Bangkok where Thai police and immigration officers insisted he return to England.
He eventually arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge courthouse, west of London, since Scotland Yard had successfully applied for an order to put him on the sex offenders' register.
Glitter had previously been incarcerated in the UK in 1999 for possessing images of child abuse.
A source from the Interior Ministry said that Jacqui Smith, the Interior Secretary felt reassured and happy that Glitter had been stopped from traveling to France and Spain.
"Photographer the master away from the scene to extract his character" G. Bauer, photographer
Neither heels nor ruffles nor clothes from before.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration that characterizes the interpretation, to look at the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other, the person.
Two inseparable faces, except in private, in those moments away from the audience, when the intimacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of the hands, are natural because they do not have to go on stage.
The German G?nther Bauer in "Flamenco-People" alternates the theatricality of some shots with singers, dancers and guitarists on stage with the lesser-known side of these masters.
With this goal, the photographer offers an original iconography of flamenco, seizing it from different visual angles.
The exhibition, included in the programming of the Month of Flamenco Photography, reflects the international importance of this dance, every day increasing," explains the artist and makes it clear that in "Flamenco-People" could also be ordinary people, but seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists, performers or performers on the scene.
These people portrayed "on the street" are "artists who can convey passion, sadness, joy when they are on stage ... and capture the audience.
To capture the personality of these greats it is not necessary to portray them on stage,
because their personality and character are internal.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the greats of flamenco."
With a passion for the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer began in 1997 a long journey aimed at portraying singers, guitarists or dancers using a plate camera.
They are portraits that, because of the type of machine and the material, are reminiscent of classical photography.
The application of different stylistic techniques breaks with the traditional principles of the image, giving the photo modernity, according to an idea that reflects Bauer's own conception of flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and is able to surprise every day."
Not dancing, singing or playing in itself, but the artist's personality, his character, able to conquer the audience with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essential elements, with magic that becomes visible in a certain way of feeling and being, are and have been the constant of this work, on display these days at the El Fotomata gallery.
Famous flamenco artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are included in this selection of about seventy artists portrayed.
The project has become a sort of flamenco anthology, and will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited on the occasion of the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of veteran athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although in "Flamenco-People" the concept is different, the photographer admits "I love portraying people, knowing them and being able to penetrate for a moment in their lives, whether this is a long or short instant.
I think portraiture is the most difficult genre in photography.
You meet or compare with people, characters you sometimes don't even know or who only give you a few minutes to take the picture.
Beyond these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas."
The collection of portraits of contemporary flamenco, entitled "Flamenco-people" is set up at the gallery El Fotomata, at number 20 Via de la Mata, parallel to Via Alameda de Hercules, and will be open to the public until next October 16.
Vargas Llosa reveals that the novel he is writing is a "gamble"
It is set in places he does not yet know and deals with unknown topics: despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is struggling with a new project he is working on, a novel whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and crossed the Amazon.
Always favored for the Nobel Prize in Literature, the writer confessed yesterday at the Hay Festival in Segovia, that the project he is dealing with today "is a gamble" and that "everything indicates that I should not write it."
"If I had common sense, I wouldn't write it, but I will anyway and I hope to finish it as soon as possible," he concluded his speech at the festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days saw a hundred writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people pass through the city of the Aqueduct.
The author of "La ciudad y los perros" was, as expected, the leading figure at the third edition of the festival of the word.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award for being the most voted writer by participants – an ancient edition of Dickens' book "Our mutual friend", filled the seats of the Juan Bravo theatre.
Presented by Félix Romeo, the writer found himself in front of an audience to which time has flown when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with large doses of humor, recalled how the literary vocation was born in him, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of "pleasant to read" and "to live beyond what I lived"; as he writes in "disciplined way" to make up for his "lack of inspiration",
The Spanish-American novelist, acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know whether books can change people's lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," Vargas Llosa pointed out, arguing that, on the contrary, "it has effects" and that "it makes people more unconformist." That's why he invited writers to "not give in to the frivolous vocation."
Time hinders the Pozoblanco Festival, depriving it of bullfights
The bullfighting celebration that was supposed to seal the days of the Pozoblanco Festival was suspended yesterday morning, after the bullfighters selected for the bullfights had verified that the ground conditions of the square were not adequate.
Therefore, the company, in agreement with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, decided to suspend the celebration of bullfighting.
The weather has raged against this Festival preventing it from celebrating two days out of three.
On Saturday, rain prevented the second bullfight from taking place.
The billboard featured Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista, who were to face a bull of Castilblanco.
Therefore, the Festival was held regularly only on Fridays.
On this occasion it was Daniel Luque who triumphed, cutting three ears and being taken out in triumph, after tore with taste and aesthetics.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante completed his two bullfights by collecting greetings and an ear, granted more by the public than by the bullfight itself.
The worst of all was El Juli, passing by the arena of Los Llanos without glory and without pain.
With the second bull, after a tremendous mule, he earned the whistles of most of the audience.
A van with two thousand kilos of hashish crosses the checkpoint in Alava
Five minus ten in the morning.
The officers order the alt to the two occupants of a van who instead of stopping give themselves to escape.
The officers ordered the alt to the two occupants of a van who instead of stopping gave themselves to escape.
Their cargo, more than two tons of hashish, is a good reason not to stop.
The officers, after pursuing them, manage to arrest one of the two occupants, a man of about 28 years, identified as A. A. J., according to a statement from the Basque government's Department of the Interior.
The arrested individual is charged with drug trafficking and falsification of public documents.
The incident occurred when some Alava road officials were carrying out a transport check on the N-1, at the point where it crosses the municipal district of Armin.
They were about to stop a van for inspection when the driver, violating orders, sped up abruptly and passed the checkpoint.
The officers set out in pursuit until the vehicle, after a couple of kilometers, stopped at the edge of the road and its two occupants fled to a wooded area.
The Ertzaintza agents then managed to arrest one of the fugitives and seize the 2,178 kilograms of hash they were carrying and took note once they inspected the van, an Iveco Daily.
Hashish panets, which were located at the rear of the vehicle, were later placed in police custody for a thorough investigation and weight detection.
In addition, since officials found that the freshman had been "duplicated" because it did not coincide with the one reported in the documentation of the van, the arrest was also charged with the crime of falsifying public documents.
Ertzaintza is continuing the investigation to arrest the second suspect, who managed to escape as already mentioned, and to determine the provenance of the seized drug.
Detainee A. A. J., aged 28, was taken to the police station to perform appropriate procedures and be available to the judge in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, the Amanda of the popular Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the influence of drugs.
A witness saw her perform risky maneuvers while trying to get out of the car park in Montecito, according to a spokesman for the California road company.
The witness specified that around 4:30 p.m. Locklear "crushed the accelerator thoroughly, making a lot of noise, and trying to get the car out of the parking lot with abrupt back-and-forth maneuvers. Backwards, it passed several times in front of its sunglasses."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who apparently did not recognize the actress at first glance, saw that Locklear had stopped in a nearby road and exited the vehicle.
It was this person who alerted the emergency services, because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"She seemed confused," and that's why officers took her to a drug and alcohol use specialist center to test her.
According to a police spokesman, the actress proved to be cooperative and the excess alcohol hypothesis was discarded from the beginning, although "according to what was observed by the officers at first, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some drug."
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of some unspecified substance and was locked up in the local prison around 7 p.m., to be released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear had come out of a specialist clinic in Arizona after being hospitalized following an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian federation of the IU to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The general coordinator of the UI and member of the Izquierda Unida party, Gaspar Llamazares, confirmed today that it will be up to the regional federation of training to make a decision on the case of the former councillor for Youth and Sport of the City of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week following the accusation of clientelism.
"In these cases I am particularly federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its responsibilities," said Llamazares regarding the resolution that the party will have to adopt against what has hitherto been an alderman on the Sevillian council.
However, the UI leader stressed the need for "transparency" in all possible investigations with regard to irregularities that Silva would commit. "The UI has always wanted this type of investigation to have maximum transparency."
He similarly pointed out that training is regulated by "very strict ethical codes for all public offices."
"Sangre de mayo", Garci's epic bet
Inspired by Episodes Nacionales by Benito Pérez Galdas, Jose Luis Garci re-proposes in Sangre de mayo the famous Spanish revolt against the French, in what is the most ambitious film of his filmography, with almost 15 million euros in budget.
With this film, the director attempted to "illustrate the torrent of characters and at the same time the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarra at the head of a large cast of performers.
Sangre de mayo, more than two and a half hours long, debuts this Friday in cinemas, to become in the future a television miniseries of more than four hours on TeleMadrid.
A great admirer of Galdas's literature, Jose Luis Garci claims to have realized with this shot "a dream of his childhood", and believes he must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid had commissioned him three years before filming a commemorative film for the second centenary of May 2nd medrilegno. The director had agreed as long as the story was based on the novel Episodes Nacionales.
The 15 million budget allocated in full by the Community of Madrid represented for Garci a "unique opportunity" to recreate the appropriate sets and costumes to portray a "studded Spain that mistaken the choice of leader to fight for and the fact that the struggle for independence brought the people a huge delay in development under the reign of Ferdinand VII" Garci noted.
However, the director regrets that he did not receive funding equal to those of Alatriste or Los phantasmos de Goya - more than twice as much as Sangre de mayo, so it was not possible to shoot some scenes provided by the set design that he himself had signed with Horacio Valcarcel, a collaborator of almost his entire career.
This, for the director of Volver a empezar, influenced what is his usual work practice, the staging with the actors, with whom he often uses to try before shooting together with those who will not be part of the cast, because he considers it "humiliating," considering that "part of the director's work lies in going to the theater and the cinema to know what is happening in the sector in which he works."
Many of the performers, part of whom are cast in Sangre de mayo, try out in front of his car, as in the case of Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Nominated for the Oscar four times - winning one - Garci believes that none of the three films nominated to represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy - his Sangre de mayo, Siete mesas de billar francés and, the last selected Los sunflowers ciegos -, do not represent the younger generation of Spanish cinema "which should instead be known."
Garci does not expect any awards from this film.
"At first you think you're working for posterity, then you realize you're only working for prosperity, and at some point you conform to simply shooting an extra film," Garci explains after more than 30 years of career.
Isabel Bayon rediscovers the Sevillian essence of dancer Tortola Valencia
A Sevillian dancer pays tribute to another dancer equally from Seville.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, Catalan father (Florence Tortola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the neighbourhood of Triana, and at the age of three moved with his family to London.
She was a free dance dancer and a specialist in Oriental dances.
She led a fascinating life and was a pioneer of female emancipation, the likes of Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was a Buddhist and vegetarian, and defended the cause for the abolition of corset that prevented women from moving freely.
This woman's life, which marked a revolution in dance and aesthetics in Europe between the two wars, has always fascinated Isabel Bayon.
"I would have liked to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me. It seemed incredible to me."
She said: "We don't pretend to tell her whole life, but to gather the spirit of it.
The titles of his dances suggested some basic elements of flamenco.
Thus, "la danza de la mariposa" suggested to me a guajira, or "la danza de la serpiente" some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and I was told that my dancing style also fits into this aesthetic," she explains.
The staging includes two exceptional contributions: that of Miguel Poveda, who will sing Isabel again in one of her shows, as a face in "La puerta abierta"; and that of the teacher Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with what had been a student of hers.
"Matilde plays Tortola as an adult, the character of maturity.
I am happy because he has agreed to work in my work and for this I feel very honored."
The set-up also includes the musical composition and guitarists such as Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the singing of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga y Moi of Moran; the percussions of El Pajaro, as well as the viola of Rafa La Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfran Juarez "who plays the role of eternal accompanist of these artists who have been all-round divas, and who have always had many."
In the work there is also in some form the life of this woman who takes place in distant places, particularly for that era, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then all of Europe, since, habitually, she resided in London.
"I wanted to remember her, because I think she's one of the women who's had a huge influence in a given historical period and now no one remembers her and much less considers her work as something of value," Bayon says.
The show will begin today, at 8.30 p.m. at the theater of Lope de Vega.
With the publication of the "Diario de un poeta recién casado" the Triennium also closes
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado" at the church of Saint Stephen (New York), where Juan Ramon Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities scheduled by the Department of Culture of the Junta of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Nobel Prize and the award.
Thus, the "Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" ends with the re-edition of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the house-museum of the Nobel and with the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramon Jiménez: Aquel chopo de luz", which was inaugurated last May and which, after touching the various provinces of Andalusia, will arrive in New York.
In addition, the Council of Andalusia's Department of Culture has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado", edited by Pietro Tabernero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, to continue the spread of the figure and work of one of the highest value Andalusian poets.
America likes it a little less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
The phrase is by actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "Ausencia de malicia" and gives the idea of the impotence of American cinema, and of all of America, in the face of the upsetting idea that Newman is gone.
Yet it cost him a lot to give him an Oscar.
And since 2007 he was retired.
And it was also known that he was very ill.
Despite this, it was a very hard blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels goes beyond any expression, and I have now lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country have been better because of its existence."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
A father of cinema and country died at a particularly dark time, for fear of terrorists and markets, with self-esteem from the American people on the ground, desperate for new motivations to feel worthy.
When times are so difficult, men so without virtue and remain well people to admire, you don't need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all he embodied the Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and a defender of lost and won causes, from the drug-fighting foundation created in honor of the firstborn who died of an overdose to the creation of the home and organic food brand.
All gifts to a country that has cost a lot to go beyond a suicidal food culture.
The wave of admiration went beyond Hollywood, regardless of nationality or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, remarked that no man has died, an era has ended.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said working with Newman constituted nothing less than the height of his career.
The bad boy who arrived from Australia, Russell Crowe, ventured to call Paul Newman his greatest inspiration.
"He left an example of the highest level for all of us," notes George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today tries to live as Paul Newman did: keeping in high regard the need for rectitude and to have a serious and distant private life on the cameras.
This is not always easy or possible in today's media jungle.
However, some try and Paul Newman is a good example for these.
He divorced once but remained married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he remained faithful while certainly not missing the opportunities not to be.
"Why am I going out to eat burgers today, if I have a steak in the house?" he used to joke.
In the sky he is accompanied by the pride that his daughters on earth are also his admirers, which is not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he played, no one was as proud as a devoted husband, loving father, solicitous grandfather and passionate philanthropist," they say.
The Imperfect Race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that sooner or later the Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed attempt for 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I would say no!
They called it the "perfect race," but in my opinion it was by far the worst I've witnessed.
A bunch of nonsense, that if they were later taken into account at the time of the evaluation and I had to examine them, the response would be absolutely negative.
But let's go by order and start at the beginning.
The nonsense began with the withdrawal of the ridge, which assumed that you went first.
It didn't seem like a wrong idea, but if they force you to go, it's to pick up everything (including the chip to avoid queues during the race).
No, you don't.
You had to go just to get the ridge (first nonsense, go just for this) and (after its tail), surprise! they had only 'S' size T-shirts (second nonsense, because I need an XL size).
What world do we live in?
Is it the fault of the crisis if they decided to buy only small T-shirts, made with less fabric and therefore less expensive?
Well, such things are trifles compared to the day of the race itself.
In addition to having to go very early to get the chip, the waiting queue was 15 minutes and, moreover, you had to deposit the backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race that more than 11,000 people expect.
So, as was predictable, the race started that we hadn't even deposited our backpack yet, although, once we were successful in the venture, the recovery turned out to be even worse.
In addition, the rain threatened to wait more than 40 minutes, to which were added attempts at popular rebellion and assault on the stand.
In at least 500 people tomorrow we will surely have pneumonia, and some, like me, will not even result in the ranking in the correct order because of the chip that, I suppose, did not register the arrival correctly.
In the future, if they ask me about the perfect race, it will certainly not enter my thoughts.
So I think we will continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft Search Receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT conference on emerging technologies, Microsoft previewed a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a sort of artificial intelligence, but without much intelligence, able to perform some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or, in the case illustrated by Microsoft, a shuttle service to move around the company's campus) assisting the telephone user.
Thanks to a camera and a system for recognizing shapes and faces, this "receptionist" is able to know how many people are in a room, who they are - including remembering their position in the company - and to listen to and understand keywords in a conversation with them.
It can also group those present into conversation groups.
In the example video the receptionist detects a third person, but understands that he does not belong to the group he is talking to and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks her if she is there to visit someone and tells her that she will be at her disposal shortly.
All without blue screen.
Impressive.
But this, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better to focus on, for example on the next version of its Windows operating system.
There has been a lot of talk this week about a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and won't have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers were equipped with the essential functions and less loaded with commercial garbage, they would have to be five times faster – hey! Steve, it will be for "the least".
All a discovery, if you take into account that Microsoft, version after version has continuously added to Windows features and "extras".
The change of direction is appreciable.
Microsoft is right: the operating system is increasingly losing importance, and with it the software.
When Google launched Chrome into the network, I was one of those who supported the theory that it was Google's first step to competing with Windows.
Many rightly point out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is an essential element for hardware and software to communicate.
It performs the same function as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
That's true.
It will never disappear, but perhaps it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but relative.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system, and more and more to the Web browser.
You take your computer just to launch Explorer or Firefox - or Chrome - and daily we spend more time surfing the net than in a remote windowed environment.
What are half the applications of the operating system for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less overloaded, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services so that they are a viable alternative to Google.
They are in desperate need of it, in fact, and I'm bringing back a little example here.
I took the photograph included in this post at one of Microsoft's employee recreation locations in Redmond earlier this month.
On the soda machine a sign prompts them to use their own research tool - "Your research. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees use Google to perform a search on the network.
Last week, however, the delay in the development of the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
It will not be put on the market in early 2009, but probably at the end of the year, if not even in 2010.
Microsoft will definitely try to jointly launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The mobile phone, after all, is becoming more and more a computer.
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already on the market, is penalizing.
The Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso took her to the French Riviera, Leonardo di Caprio shining in Edward Zwick's 'Diamante de sangre', as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' as well as being part of the typical uniform of the muscular gay parish.
And if we try to enumerate the appearances of the stars, we can recall the image of the force with the pointed mustache lifting the weights in the walking circus.
It is, in essence, the typical men's T-shirt, with the inside of cotton, tight and sleeveless.
It is the 'tank', as the English-speaking call it, though, the Belgian Fabuleux Marcel stands out above all.
The "Marcel" excels compared to the others for the high quality of the cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive coat of arms and for the small Belgian flag (just recognizable), which the most emblematic models of the T-shirt carry as a detail on the neck.
The "Marcel" excels compared to the others for the high quality of the cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive coat of arms and for the small Belgian flag (just recognizable), which the most emblematic T-shirt models carry as a detail on the neck.
And be careful, because the Belgian company's production is not just about the famous "tanks".
It also includes college sweatshirts, retro boxer, cashmere cardigan, cotton pants, navy t-shirts, baby-dolls, mini shorts...
Intimate clothing designed to be comfortable.
And it's a shame to use them as underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mom, the candidate doesn't worry me"
The great resemblance to her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is small, but full of vitality.
Currently, the Cruz sisters have taken their new fashion business very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful girls and celebrities who lend their name.
She was in Paris for the promotion that the Mango signature made of its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important awards that the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Warm and shy, it wins you over quickly.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I conceived for the autumn-winter season of Mango, as well as to participate in the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentino.
Let's say, a very intense day, but at the same time, exciting.
From what elements does your new collection for Mango start in this fourth season of work for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I like the cinema of the '50s and '60s, hence we get various inspirations.
Then, I love getting lost in the city and observing how women dress, how they combine and mix their clothes. I do this frequently.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, although in the end, everything flows and there are many elements in common.
I, since I was a child, liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to browse my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was a bomb, even better than going to the playground.
Then, once a dancer, I always paid close attention to dress.
It is known that dancers really like to have their own style to go to class and essays, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress, when they hand you the wardrobe is the time when you really meet the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for stylists and professionalism.
Not long ago, you turned 30, you went into crisis?
But no.
Never heard better, I like the idea of 30 years.
I find that at that age women are mature and have a good experience to savor life by making fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I have done the things I wanted since I was a child and that has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, do you think you're going to be a mother, or not?
Of course, I know that I will be a mother because my own body asks me and also I want to be a young mom, this I do not want to miss.
As for the candidate, I don't worry too much.
What I'm going to do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with a lot of love.
As for the cinema, you are waiting for some films shot last year to come out in different theaters.
That's right, and I really want them out.
Being a woman who comes from the theater, I am very impatient and restless, I would like everything immediately and clearly, but it can not always be that way.
I want you to come out with "La Ultima Hora" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo".
Let's see if you like them.
A few days ago you made your runway debut with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I was on the runway as a model.
Simply Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a long time, called me to go to London to participate in a charity show for her organization "Women for a Better World" and the clothes we exhibited – I brought two pieces from our collection for Mango – were auctioned off to raise money for this Naomi NGO.
People don't know this tender side of Naomi.
So much is said about her, that I who have known her for a long time can confirm to you that they are not so true.
Besides, I'm with this good part that you're involved in.
He asked me to parade for a noble cause, but if he had asked me to make pine, I would have done it anyway.
If it's to help third world women, you can't back down.
Repeated drivers of alcoholism will have to install the "alcoholock"
The Ministry of the Interior requires that drivers with three administrative penalties for excessive blood alcohol, install in his car the system that prevents the driving of the vehicle in a state of intoxication or if you do not blow in the appropriate device.
The measure was announced last June and is already included in the annual report of the State Attorney General, according to which it will be a pilot project lasting one year.
The purpose of this project is the reintegration of the driver, since this will have to attend a rehabilitation course at the road.
This initiative, in addition to the General Public Prosecutor's Office for Road Safety, will be attended by the Directorate General of Traffic (DGT) and the Technological Institute Foundation for Automobile Safety (FITSA).
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists reported more than once per drunk driving then return to driving the car.
Alcoholock would avoid this, because it is a vehicle-connected system that measures the rate of alcohol in the exhaled air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not blow, or when a higher concentration of alcohol is detected than allowed.
The cost is more than 1000 euros and would be borne by the sanctioned.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with such devices allow to reduce up to 65% of infringements committed during the first year of introduction.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people a year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to curb these behaviours before they become criminal offences.
And to facilitate its development, since legal reform can be carried out on an ordinary basis, and, no doubt the necessary reform for criminal procedure would require an organic law.
However, the device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, although it has already been introduced experimentally in some industrial and public vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on a PSOE initiative in which it is proposed to install this system in school buses, as has already been done in France.
In Mexico, and without "peep-toes"
With British punctuality, at 5.40 p.m., according to schedule, the Spanish plane in which the princes of Asturias were traveling landed in the presidential hangar at Benito Juarez Airport in Mexico City.
The sun was setting but the rays still forced to use the hand as a visor to see the royal couple get off the plane.
At the foot of the ladder, the Spanish ambassador and the other authorities.
A few hours earlier I had asked a taxi driver, on the way, if he knew that the Spanish princes were going to visit the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very well, so you won't be able to go to the airport to load people at that time ... She's from here or ...
No, no sir, you're Spanish, but you lived here for a couple of years.
- Ah, very well ...
The Mexican press, on the other hand, is very familiar with the principles of Asturias and the importance of travel.
There are many waiting in the airport hangar crushed to the red carpet and military cordon composed of 27 Navy soldiers offering the salute of honor.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the princess, hair in the wind, very sober, does not use her usual "peep-toes," perhaps they told her that in Mexico City she was threatening bad weather.
They give the photographers a smile and a short stop before passing in the hall where the official group awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest in the city, a witty reporter from Mexican television awaits them.
The best award offered by fashion
There is probably no more appropriate place in the world to present a fashion prize, than Paris and probably there is no more exquisite designer and Valentino bont vivan.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Bot?n-Mango Fashion Awards, to foster the international promotion of new talents in the field of fashion.
It offers a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her drawings in Mango's showcase at 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried from emotion.
Moreover, it is the company's second largest store in Europe and has just been opened with 1,335 square meters of extension.
The first is in London.
The many events, combined with the desire to please the designer Valentino who presided over the jury of the competition, began with a luxury dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
With the proximity of Chagal's most exquisite canvases, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango, was even more spectacular.
Born, with his heart broken and making virtue of necessity, due to the recent death of his brother, he wore a dress of the House and some complements of ELAH to take his breath away and on the arm of his son Luis - a big guy almost two meters tall - he accompanied Valentino to the presidency of the complimentary dinner.
Andik, the owner and lord of Mango, did the honours of home and knighthood as he is finished, together with Baron Rotchil, without a jacket, because both had yielded them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who ran the shop in trousers and shirt – drawn by her own hand – transformed for dinner, wearing a long, very sensual black dress and got excited during the night walk accompanied by Goya Toledo inside the opera, when they showed us the hall for ballet essays and she, remembering other times, grabbed a bar and sketched out a "grand plie".
Inés Sastre did not stop for the walk in the premises of the palace, but had shown us before pictures of her son on his mobile phone.
The following day we rejoiced at the presence of Olivier Martinez – another big guy who moves in a motorcycle – and John Travolta, who had arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, with his sheets, towels and having made sure earlier, that there were no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, there's the way.
1001, the antistress number
There are not 1,000 but 1,000 and a way to forget about the chaotic and hectic daily life.
And as if that were not enough, they are all collected in a book that will bring relaxation to bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock is almost a punishment when it rings every morning at 7am, but it is even worse to imagine oneself involved in the hectic pace dictated by modern life.
The office is called tension and the computer back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
However, there are not one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and fatigue in breaking away from the world of work.
No, this number amounts to nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Beyond yoga positions, classic massage or "spa" treatments, Susannah Marriott collects in the pages of her book, all a "menu" of options tailored to each one's taste and time.
The anti-stress work is entitled "1001 ways to relax" and its calm will reach the bookstores thanks to the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to gain calm in areas such as work or personal relationships, this "manual" disproves that belief.
In addition, it suggests alternative solutions, such as being in touch with nature, or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline doesn't already flow into your veins to regain your body balance and stress has become a problem, it's time to sit on the couch, turn off your mind and focus on reading.
Talking in Sleep
Some children talk during the night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very agitated to tell us something that happened to them the previous day, but to those children who talk by staying asleep.
The first time it happens, at most you take a scare, but it doesn't really matter much.
It is a benign alteration of sleep termed somniloquy.
It manifests with a certain frequency, especially in children and adolescents.
Surely, most of you have been told that you had spoken in your sleep.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (once in life, for example associated with an episode of high fever) or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once in the month ...), the next day the child no longer remembers anything.
There is no single reason for this phenomenon.
Sometimes they are episodes related to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night fears, nocturnal enuresis (wetting in bed), or sleepwalking, but that is not necessarily the case.
As already mentioned above it can be associated with stages of very high fever, situations of stress or overexcitement.
In any case, it is a phenomenon not yet studied.
The intensity with which it appears is also extremely variable.
It can happen that the person speaks in a very quiet tone of voice, with loose words, almost in a whisper or that the opposite happens (screams, cries, long speeches ...).
In cases where the event is particularly intense, it would be advisable to observe the child and possibly consult a specialist to check if there is any issue that is generating an abnormal state of anxiety as an outlet to the situation.
We said that this is a benign alteration therefore there is no treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders that can be treated (for example, when coupled with insomnia or stress situation).
What can be done, on the other hand, is to consider a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to overexcite the baby before it goes to sleep.
Propose quiet games and avoid programs or television series that arouse fear or suggest violence.
With very nervous children for whom it is tiring to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them gain some inner calm.
This will allow the child to sleep more quietly.
Once the sleeping pills appear try to keep calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will remember nothing that happened.
Useful tips
Don't wake him.
It is useless, because he is not aware of what is happening, and you would interrupt his sleep.
Although he's talking, he's asleep and so he's resting.
Remember that if it appears very distressed and episodes have a certain frequency it is better to consult a doctor or check where such great anxiety in the child comes from.
If you understand what he says (which is not the most common situation), do not fall into the temptation to question him for information.
You will get nothing, because he is asleep and therefore not conscious to organize his thought.
In addition, you are able to hear what he says but not see what he is dreaming to say it, so you have to pay close attention to the interpretation of the information and the conclusions to which it could lead.
Never tell the child that you could ask him questions overnight to learn about his secrets.
Not even as a joke.
Such a thing causes enormous distress.
In short, don't worry, it's nothing serious, it's an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern has finally found their way home to victory after a long unsuccessful period.
Without playing a formidable game, the Black-Yellows created the most opportunities from the net turning one into the game's victory.
The pace was not very sustained during this meeting in which the attackers voiced themselves with difficulty.
After a first attempt by the captain of the host team Kauffmann who touched the seven with a shot from a distance, the Illhaeusern began to get the upper hand and one after another provoked the defense of Dannemarie, Founderflick from a distance, then Hirn alto, Romain tip and Diebold again.
The Dannemarie responded with a center-of-field block, leaving only the unleashed Riahi at the tip of the attack.
The start of the second half was decisive with two initial chances signed Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and soon after Marais's first goal for Illhaeusern, well placed, he resumed a rejected ball on a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But the Illhaeusern gunboat will not be able to taste his happiness for long and will be expelled a dozen minutes later thus leaving his teammates outnumbered.
But the Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not pose great problems to the Eleven of the Illhaeusern, retreated just to "strengthen" the defense, except in the last few minutes of the game when, after a daring action, the ball touched the crossbar.
Sarkozy meets fishermen in anger
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will stop in Brittany.
Faced with the demonstration of the fishermen who on Monday brutally prevented access to several Breton and Norman ports, the president of the Republic has decided to go Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the department of Finistère, to enchant the representatives.
The latter have promised to welcome him "with constructive spirit" and hope that "he will present himself with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that takes place at the same time as the general assembly of the "crisis committee", created by the Breton fishermen in order to take measures to cope with the spike in the price of diesel fuel, which reached its record with an average of more than 1.14 euros per liter.
According to Elysée spokesman David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them possible solutions to help businesses regain competitiveness and to secure the working conditions and remuneration of sailors".
Fishermen await Nicolas Sarkozy at his feet.
Tuesday morning, they conducted "snail operations" in Morbihan and Calvados, causing nearly 10 km of traffic jams.
The port of Quiberon has also been blocked, but connections to Belle-Ele have not been interrupted.
A roadblock has been implemented on the Quiberon Peninsula.
On Monday, sailors have already demonstrated their determination by burning tyres and vanes in front of fuel depots at the ports of Brest and Lorient, as demonstrations took hold in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement has extended to the ports of the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as Sables d'Olonne, in the Vendée, where the fishing boats have remained at the pier, or in Havre, where about twenty boats have prevented the movement of the trading ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe et del Croisic, near the Loire-Atlantique, interrupted in the evening the blockade of the well-known Total refinery in Donges.
In Boulogne-sur-Mer they decided to wait for the meeting to be held on Wednesday at the ministry to decide on any actions.
In the Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will decide on Tuesday the future actions of the movement and the possible participation in the meeting scheduled for the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by those in charge of the National Fisheries Committee, which did not support the movement.
"The strike will continue" as "fishers will not give in" and "they are not going to move to Paris," Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee, for example, announced.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel fuel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre, but estimate that the yield limit of a boat is reached only with a diesel fuel of less than 0.30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
The unforgettable interpreter of "Butch Cassidy" died of cancer, aged 83, at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary et Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and more Sam Mendes greeted film legend and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains delivery forecast in 2008
The aircraft manufacturer has 215 deliveries this year, despite recessionary threats to the world economy.
Embraer, the world's fourth-largest company in the industry, maintains delivery forecasts for 2008 with the delivery of 215 aircraft, confirmed its president Frederico Fleury Curado.
During the first semester, it delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian company relies heavily on the Chinese market, particularly for aircraft in the range of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would divest more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group insurance company, re-established by American monetary authorities, would divest more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion loan, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
The AIG is prepared to consider the sale of much of its assets, in addition to the sale of life insurance branches to the international market and the United States, the paper specifies on the basis of more than authoritative sources.
The IGA Board met on Sunday evening to consider possible divestitures, according to the FT.
No confirmation was obtained at AIG.
The assets that AIG plans to divest include the aircraft leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, adds the FT.
No final decision has been taken regarding such disposals, the FT continues.
The AIG must quickly find liquidity in order to repay the $85 billion loan granted to it by the Federal Reserve, at the cost of seeing the American authorities take over 80% of its capital.
Paris: Morning Meeting chronicle
The New York Stock Exchange blamed a historic slump on Monday, after the House of Representatives spoke out against the Paulson plan to bail out financial institutions: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a drop never seen, approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Media (DJIA) finished at 10.365.45, down 777.68 points.
In terms of points, the worst loss in its history (684.81 points) higher than on September 17, 2001, the day of the reopening of the Stock Exchanges following the terrorist attacks of September 11.
The Nasdaq, the leading technology securities index, lost 199.61 points to close at 1.983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 8.81% (or 106.85 points) to close at 1.106.55, according to the final closing figures.
Demoralized early in the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection of the bank bailout plan, designed to restore stability to markets.
With 228 votes against the plan and 205 in favor, the representatives rejected the funding requested by Treasury Minister Trésor Henry Paulson.
About two out of three Republicans have rejected the plan.
"It's a negative signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza, of FTN Financial.
"This all signals how much the market counted on the project," he added, fearing that in a few days it might already be "too late" to adopt one.
"If the project was actually dying (...) then the witness would be passed quickly to the Fed – Federal Reserve – and other central banks to solve the crisis, which would further limit credit conditions," Brian Bethune, head of finance and economics at Global Insight, warned.
And again highlighting its state of emergency," each passing day leads to the collapse of a financial institution" in the United States, Piegza pointed out.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia's banking assets by rival Citygroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, urging emergency intervention in favour of UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany banks, a sign that markets "are not just facing an American crisis, but a world crisis," added FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has risen strongly.
The yield on 10-year Treasury Bonds fell to 3.632 percent, compared to 3.827% on Friday night, while the 30-year yield fell to 4.161 percent, compared to 4.357% on the previous day.
Obama ahead of first TV duel
After Friday's first debate between the two candidates for the White House, here's a second to know who, between John McCain and Barack Obama, was the winner.
Unsurprisingly, the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their respective TV duel victory, followed by a third of American families.
Political scientist David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, while deserving, was not brilliant enough to allow him to curb the decline in polls five weeks into the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, of which an opinion poll published on Saturday gives Obama a five-point lead (49% vs. 44% for McCain), shows that the Democrat got the better of him.
An instant poll conducted by CBSNews on a sample of undecided voters, found that 39% of them consider Obama the winner, while 25% point to McCain.
An excellent performance by his listmate Joe Biden, expected during the first and only debate with rival Sarah Palin, is expected to confirm Obama's lead on Thursday.
"Underestimating it would be a mistake.
He has a good intuition," however, Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
Seventy-year-old McCain has never stopped promoting his unquestionable foreign policy experience, emphasizing the opponent's "naiveness" about the topics he faced during the first face-to-face.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that." he has often stated on multiple occasions.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and skills to become president," he assured.
What has been a constant target for the Republican television campaign since yesterday.
Obama, for his part, emphasized how his election would represent a new future.
Without lengthening, he proved concise and precise.
He promoted his predisposition to right decisions and his intention to restore the image of the United States on the world stage.
"McCain never understood, as opposed to Obama," he retorted, this weekend, a Democratic commercial, berating the Republican for not taking the necessary steps to cope with the impact of the financial crisis on the American people.
During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had much to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama denounced yesterday, in front of 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina, in a pouring rain, for an election meeting.
He didn't even say the words "middle class" or "workers." The financial crisis goes in favor of Obama, considered by Americans to be the person best suited to save the economy on the brink.
"Next week could be a turning point," said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's economic insight to that shown by Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current collapse "is the final verdict after eight years of bad economic policy adopted by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain."
Reiterating the intention to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite the Wall Street gasps, the Illinois senator also mentioned among his priorities the achievement of eventual energy independence of the country thanks to the promotion of renewable energy and the implementation of a health insurance system.
McCain, for his part, would build a park of 45 nuclear centers by 2030.
With caution, the two candidates dodged questions centered on the $700 billion ($470 billion) financial rescue plan adopted last night by Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "Did you notice there were elections?"
Young people and opponents protested Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to contest the results of the legislation in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians met on Sunday evening just after polling stations were closed in Minsk's central square to protest the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While the results were still expected, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "the dictator, resignation".
Some confess that they haven't even voted "What's the point? They'll do what they want, about my vote," says one guy.
They do not believe that the regime that has made a good impression before foreign observers with the aim of resuming in dialogue with the European Union is ready to take a democratic turn.
Sanctions, including visa bans for 40 Belarusian leaders and asset freezes, could be lifted if these elections were deemed legitimate by observers.
They weren't, according to the opposition.
"We have been removed from the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to participate in the voting process," lamented Iouri Potemkine, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous alliance of twelve parties.
"It's a change of front, underlines Alexandre Milinkievitch, former candidate of the opposition to the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, since the important thing is who counts the ballots and in this case is the executive.
If members of the opposition enter Parliament, it is because they have been appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into parliament can involve a television space, regional meetings and bills."
The opposition therefore has a duty to enter the political game since "needs to initiate dialogue with the European Union.
For if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, goes into crisis, and we do not provide for any reform, we risk becoming a Russian protectorate.
Now we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the organisation for security and cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process will recognize the validity of the ballot.
He stressed that participation quotas seemed too high, and that the generalisation of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) started all kinds of manipulation.
"Have you noticed that there were elections? Asks social-democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released this year, in August.
There was no one at the polling stations.
And there will have been at most five opposition MPs in parliament, the most convenient ones in power."
Night silence falls on the October square.
On television, President Loukachenko and members of the Central Election Commission are pleased with their success.
The meeting - Blood is safe again
The Héma-Québec celebrated the tenth anniversary of its foundation yesterday, and its president, Dr. FrancineDécary, had every reason to rejoice, as the Héma-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And most of all, it regained public confidence, seriously shaken by the infected blood scandal in the years between 1980 and 1990.
As we know, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were infected with the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C in the 1980s.
In the face of such a drama and population protests, the Government of Canada conducted a public investigation in February 1994, directed by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to spread recommendations to prevent the recurrence of such a disaster.
While Judge Krever was late in drawing up a report, some provinces set up a committee with the aim of devising a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this mandate was carried out by the Gélineau Committee.
Following the Gélineau et Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to supply Quebec and the Société canadienne du sang (Canadian Society of Blood) for all other provinces and two territories.
In 1998, when Héma-Québec started its own business, just 38% of people said they still had faith in the donation system in Quebec, Dr Décary recalls.
The situation was mortifying.
Thanks to continued efforts to improve the safety of blood draws and field research over the following years, we have regained public confidence," he explains before proudly stating that by the beginning of 2008, about 94% of Quebec's population had confidence in Héma-Québec by now.
Dr. Décary, however, is convinced that "trust is something extremely fragile."
Since its creation on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At the time, there were numerous cases in Europe of the human variant of the mad cow, a new manifestation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, tells the one who has been president since 1998, the year of the foundation.
"And we absolutely did not know if that disease could be transmitted by infected blood.
There is therefore based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélinau reports, according to which when there are doubts and a serious disease could result, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease which manifests with a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, exclusion measures are taken.
In April 1999, the blood of those who had spent more than a month in the UK since 1980 was rejected.
Now, for some years now, it has been shown that without any doubt this disease is transmitted by infected blood.
This episode has thus shown us that it made sense to apply the precautionary principle."
In 1999, a much more efficient technique for the detection of HIV appeared on the market: nucleic acid (TAN) tests that allow the presence of the virus to be directly recognized in the blood of donors and not that of antibodies against the same, on which the tests used until then were based.
The TANs made it possible to reduce the window period, i.e. from the time the person contracted the disease to the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood thanks to our techniques, explains the specialist.
It was possible to reduce that period to a duration of less than a week.
The risk of ignoring the presence of infected donors and thus not being able to detect them has thus greatly decreased.
These improvements have considerably decreased the risk of contracting AIDS with a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving blood infected with the HIV virus.
"In other words, this means that it will be necessary to distribute 12 million blood samples before someone is infected with the HIV virus.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400 000 and 500 000 blood samples each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmitted with a transfusion is detected.
I believe that today one can feel calm about receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover health, says the head of the Héma-Québec management.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen will emerge in the system.
No later than a year ago the Chikungunya virus appeared on Réunion Island which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted in the blood by an insect.
You have to be constantly vigilant," continues Dr. Décary before pointing out that in addition to having safe resources, the Héma-Québec must also provide enough.
"Necessities increase as the population ages.
As cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need a supply of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population also has consequences for the number of donors which on average makes up only 3% of Quebecers acceptable as donors."
However, all healthy people who are 18 years of age and meet the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who offer themselves as donors are not accepted, because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where the latter is widespread, they will be refused for a period of one year.
"With this 3% we are able to maintain an inventory capable of responding to the needs of hospitals.
Cases of shortages are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this group of donors as they get older and can no longer make donations.
Now it is difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all to hold them back and incite them to become regular donors.
Nowadays life is so hectic that you hardly find an hour to donate blood," says desolate Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec distributes not only blood samples, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart valves eyeballs and skin that is used almost exclusively for severe burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being deposited with the Héma-Québec which manages the only public umbilical cord blood bank in Quebec.
In the umbilical cord, which was once considered a biomedical waste, there is an abundance of stem cell-rich blood that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the insertion into the bank of our thousandth sample of cord blood and we plan to take more than a thousand each year.
You should start proposing them for transplants early next year," points out Dr. Décary who describes this practice of cord blood sampling as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that they cannot access it", as Héma-Québec does not have the necessary means to propose this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Football - The Impact in the semifinals
Impact Montréal qualified for the semi-final of the Serie A eliminations, winning 3-1 against the Sounders of Seattle, yesterday, during a second decisive game of the quarterfinals, at Saputo Stadium.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro, scored the decisive goal in 90'.
After a first half with no goal on both sides, David Testo and Rocco Placentino scored the next goals for Montreal.
For the Sounders, Roger Levesque was ready to score Matt Jordan.
Recall that at the first game of the round-trip on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, on the outskirts of Seattle.
The Impact will face the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, Thundler finished a first 3-1 in the return game by winning 4-3, but the Whitecaps will still participate in the semi-final.
The Impact will face the Whitecaps on both Friday and Sunday, but further details will be confirmed on the day.
In Brief - Kovalev's Decisive Network
The Canadien and his aces are ready to start the season again.
The trio consisting of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the offensive phase of the game by winning 3-2 against the Panthers, Florida, last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the star of the first match, scored a goal, made two passes, and picked up a pass for victory, in the fourth of the Hab's preparatory games.
The only goal signed by Kovalev was decisive for the win.
"I'm not ready yet, the Russian warned.
I need another game to feel comfortable."
"He tried to overdo it in the first period, Guy Carbonneau noted.
But I think he appreciated the outcome of the game.
There was a nice ovation."
Charest points to the North
The Prime Minister does not rule out the start of elections before the end of the year.
At the conclusion of the general council of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest went yesterday to Jean-Talon, Quebec where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc, (left), attempts to be elected on the occasion of today's partial elections.
"Enlarge the borders of our last great northern frontier": this is the long-term ambition of Jean Charest, presented yesterday in Levis, by means of instruments with a strong visual impact, on the occasion of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec.
Behind him, during his speech, the projection of a sort of "image mill".
On three maxi screens, they were confused by the spectacular negatives of hydroelectric dams, mining crops, images of Quebec seen with "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Large means like in the middle of the election campaign.
During the press conference, the Prime Minister refused to rule out the start of the autumn elections, although he pointed out that he was very busy.
The "North Plan" is the fourth point of a "project" that the prime minister claims has for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a first agreement with France on labour, a second agreement between Canada and Europe and other agreements with Ontario.
Often named in the Prime Minister's most recent speeches, the opening of the North-the northern territory to the 49th parallel-had never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister limited himself to explaining why the North would be "a jewel of immense potential", but he did not comment on timing or investment quotas, nor did he explain what the precise priorities will be in implementing future projects.
At most he merely pointed out what he felt deserved a priority position: hydro-electricity, forests, but above all the mining sector, which has experienced several improvements as a result of the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
According to Charest's list, the North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titan, and even diamonds".
That "territory twice the size of France", is here, is Quebec.
Not only is it here, but it is inherent in us," he insisted, as if to urge a national founding myth.
Quebec's foundations are rooted in its relationship with the North, he pointed out: gold fever in Abitibi, national engineering, James Bay.
"It's up to us, it's our future," he added, after a theatrical pause to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a part of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister said during the press conference.
"It is a position traditionally held by all governments.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a long time and, when the opportunity arises, I will reiterate that position in the name of the government," he indicated.
After all," considering climate change, the North needs to be reassessed," he said of the Northwest Passage, which will be open year-round due to melting ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister estimates that occupying the territory is a duty."
What about the locals, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The prime minister said that the Quebec government would be very careful in this regard and that the project would meet their interests, especially those of young people.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former MP of the PQ d'Ungava), have already started the consultation of about thirty communities.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benost Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) holds an important position, has started work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a major meeting," not necessarily a summit," but a time when "common visions will be provided."
The development of the North would also adhere to the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be" concerted, ordered and will respect the environment," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "project" as a continuum with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
"Like the liberals who preceded us, we know how to stand out to transform challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was on the other hand one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began Friday with a big cocktail in honor of the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival as party leader.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes renaming the Beauharnois Power Station to Adélard-Godbout Dam.
"From Godbout, creator of Hydro-Québec, to Lesage nationalizing hydro-electricity, to Bourassa, creator of James Bay, our party has always known how to forge the future," said Jean Charest.
During the press conference, he resorted to another reference, conservative this time, the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Facing the project related to the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam, Charest has specified that its commissioning would be scheduled for 2012.
"All this remains between us, but I feel we will succeed," he confessed to his militants, eliciting heartfelt applause.
Indeed, the prime minister, who in April claimed there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not even in 2009, did not dismiss the possibility of starting a poll in the fall, which could happen in accordance with the law.
He stresses that he is certainly very busy, particularly on a Federal Council mission to China and at the Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend General Council provided the Liberal leader with a platform of nationalist resolutions, in particular "constitutional aspirations" that have passed as smooth as oil: the PLQ demands above all recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also hoped that Quebec would appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that the latter would have a veto right over decisions made in Quebec.
As for the opposition, the sketch of the North Plan was received in a sceptical manner.
PQ leader Pauline Marois dusted off the Northern Quebec Development Policy launched by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal government, which came to power in 2003, would not have respected its application.
If he had done so, "we would have progressed today" commented Marois alongside the candidate of the Jean-Talon (scrutiny that took place today), Francoise Mercure.
The ADQ said it supported the government's adoption of the North Plan.
"What we hope for, is that all this is not simply perceived as a show," commented Sébastien Proulx, Mario Dumont's replacement, on his way back from vacation today.
Letters - A disgraced country
It was Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (ironically) of the Harper Cabinet, who afforded to declare, last summer, that Louise Arbor was a "shame" for Canada.
To dishonor in this way a woman who has fought incessantly for justice and who deserves all our admiration says much about both the Prime Minister's entourage and Stephen Harper himself.
Here we are in front of a government that is the only one, of all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated one of its citizens detained in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a mere teenager at the time the facts accused him took place.
The only government that, despite signing the Geneva Convention, denies its word and leaves a child-soldier to rot in inhumane conditions.
The only one who confides in a parody of justice to establish the guilt of the accused.
Recall, for information, that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, call for the repatriation of Omar Khadraffin so that he can be subjected to a regular trial in Canada.
It is precisely that same government that closes its eyes to torture: it cares little that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps forever, after so many years of abuse.
We still don't realize it, but we're witnessing a insidious erosion of our rights, freedom and "democracy," a word Harper doesn't stop flaunting and that sounds so senseless on his lips.
Here we are at the moment when there is no longer any morals: one can abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the discretion of a hitherto minority head of government (to see what will happen after October 14...).
Numerous voters believe that a party that preaches Virtue, Respect of the Law and Order represents salvation: they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
Shame lies right here, Mr. Toews, in giving up all this, and nowhere else.
Free opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian speech
In the September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from M. Patrick J. Garver, vice-president director of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Pursuing an Orwellian logic, the latter states that the world's largest gold company has filed a six-million libel lawsuit against three authors and a small, penniless publishing house with the intention of starting a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of a libel lawsuit, but the law.
Without any surprise, this substantial difference is completely hidden by Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to bring to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to hers.
No matter the outcome of the trial, the writers and publisher of the book Black Canada will have to spend a substantial amount of money in order to organize their defense and fight, with decidedly unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers financed by the practically bottomless pockets of the mining company.
Moreover, in these unequal arms struggles, the tactic is often to ruin the defendant in order to impose a consensual regulation that gags the opposition as well as frightening anyone who dares to speak out again on the matter.
If Barrick Gold had really wanted a public debate, it is before the public that she should have presented her own view of the facts.
Contrary to what happens in many countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada normally take place by exchange of views and not by baton strokes.
It would therefore have been enough for society to open its books, its documents, and establish a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications and the funding of teams of independent researchers who could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold doesn't seem to have too much faith in public opinion and badly rejects petitions and letters in support of Black Canada's authors.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can ask for a "public" debate when his contempt for that same audience is clearly evident?
In the vice-presidential world, it seems that this word only indicates the handsomely paid lawyers and not the Canadians as a whole; here is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democratic system, even disparagers have the right to speak.
What Barrack Gold doesn't understand – or doesn't want to understand – is that the public supporting the authors and publishers of Black Canada does so primarily because they reject the brutal means adopted by the mining company.
This audience is ready to listen to Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of opinion, and not in the light of what many perceive as some sort of gait (searching for the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just given the authors of Black Canada an ultimatum instructing them to suspend the use of that word...)
Beyond Garver's surreal discourse, the Barrack Gold lawsuit constitutes a direct attack on university research freedom and the pursuit of truth, indispensable in every democratic society.
It denies en bloc the right to citation of authentic sources and debate on facts and interpretations, which represent the very basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to study and discuss inconvenient topics for the world's richest companies, under penalty of multiple lawsuits, who can do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following scientific standards as the authors of Black Canada do.
You have the right to reply.
For a long time, the university environment, of which we are a part, has been able to handle debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's excessive measures clearly show that, contrary to its claims, it does not seek a transparent debate at all.
This is to the detriment of the university world, as is the public debate in Canada itself, and it is time for governments to take measures to limit abusive lawsuits.
Operation - Wall Street bailout – Dialogue between Republicans and Democrats
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, representatives of the Republican and Democratic side, finally came to an agreement yesterday on the biggest financial-saving plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the US$700 billion plan, which aims to curb the financial crisis that has been on Wall Street for months, has yet to be ratified by the two houses of Congress.
It provides in particular: checks on its actual implementation by elected leaders, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public money, new provisions to contain the number of homes foreclosed for non-payments, as well as a right of inspection on remuneration paid to managers of protected companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, and Republican Representative at the negotiating table Senator Judd Gregg announced the good news minutes after midnight yesterday at the end of a two-day marathon of negotiations.
"We have made great progress towards an effective agreement on the markets," Bush administration representative Henry Paulson said.
"Every decision was made in such a way as to safeguard the American economy and people from the crisis currently taking place on Wall Street," the Democrat explained.
"It's the crucial point: if we hadn't acted this way, priceless confoundings and upsets would have spilled over into the daily lives of Americans," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The conclusion of the negotiations was marked by concerns about the impact of a new bankruptcy on investors.
The cut-off time was the opening of the markets this morning.
Joined later in the negotiation, the two candidates for the US presidential election were quite supportive of the agreement, without however avoiding expressing their discontent with the adoption of extreme solutions.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama deserves credit for adding some provisions to the agreement, particularly that which will allow owners to maintain their domicile and that inherent in wages intended for executives of businesses covered by the state.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of others, there is nothing to rejoice in.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the American TV screen.
Interviewed on another channel to find out if he will vote in favor of the plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I would like to analyze the details of it, but I hope so."
"According to what I've read, this is something that we all need to digest and that will allow us to move forward"
The option of a non-intervention is simply unacceptable," he said.
The $700 billion plan aims to buy back the dubious, risky, and unsellable claims of American financial institutions with taxpayer money.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis due to the bursting of a housing bubble that led firstly to the collapse of risky mortgage loans (mortgages), then to extend to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAAs) and result in the freezing of liquidity and the disbandment of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of incumbent Republicans who blew up the first draft of a deal last week.
It seems to have come out of that dead end since Democrats agreed that the active "toxic" of some struggling companies is only being protected by the government, rather than bought.
In order to meet everyone in Congress, a provision has been added that if the government were to face losses over the next five years because of such a program, it could impose new taxes in order to maintain its balance.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion to which 100 billion more can be added if the president deems it necessary.
The payment of 350 billion should be ratified by a further vote of Congress.
In exchange for his help, Washington will get stakes in the protected companies that will be worth the dividends in case of profit and that he can resell when the waters have calmed down.
According to the plan, the federal government will have the opportunity to delay foreclosure procedures relating to real estate loans and to set limits on remuneration and starting allowances paid to the managers of the companies involved.
As of today, the plan's architects would like to submit it to the House of Representatives vote, and to the Senate vote on Wednesday.
Despite all efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will be given the go-ahead.
In fact, there were several votes against the project yesterday, both at the Republican and Democratic sides.
"Clearly, Washington doesn't hear you," Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told his constituents.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But don't take advantage of the taxpayers..
Leader of a small group in Congress dubbed "the caucus of skeptics", Democratic Representative Brad Sherman presents the situation differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred eminent professors of economics, including three Nobel Laureates, have written to us to say : we ask Congress not to draw hasty conclusions and to examine carefully the way forward," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, there was once again a test of the world nature of the crisis.
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for €11.2 billion (US$16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary when the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would give up the purchase of its competitor, in full bankruptcy after the loss of 2 billion euros (2.9 billion dollars) for the crisis of risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis has 85 000 employees and is part of the twenty largest banks in Europe and the ten largest insurers.
"It's not money lost," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
In return, influence and voting rights are collected in banking matters.
It's certainly something that savers and families appreciate now that times are announcing uncertain."
During this period, at the other end of the English Channel, the British government seems to be on the verge of nationalizing another bank poised for the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take charge of all the loans currently under way at Bradford and Bringley bank, of which more than 41 billion (75.5 billion dollars) of real estate loans.
Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it will be buying the UK bank's branches and customer accounts.
Since the beginning of the economic crisis Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to undergo a process of nationalization by the British government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a Busy Icon
Blue-eyed beauty was for a long time his ace in the sleeve, for others his weak point.
Did he get rid of the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with a bewitching smile?
Yes and no.
His discretion, sensitivity and evident talent would expel him from that circle of powerful consecrated to real sacred monsters.
What a constancy!
Paul Newman, who passed away on Friday at the age of 83, at his Connecticut ranch, following lung cancer, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the gloomy years.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and of which he was for a long time a sort of rival on the screen, more prudent in his play, certainly more fragile, but also a spokesman for freedom and the development of dramatic convictions.
Magical children are often born from mixed couples.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, to a German Jewish father and mother of Hungarian origin.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
A humble ego, the ultimate mark of quality.
Because he recognized himself as a country enamored with the safe made man, the Pacific war fighter, proud in combat, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art at Yale, he subsequently attended the Actor Studio in New York, before triumphing at the theatre, on television and soon at the cinema.
That same militant civil rights man was also the racing driver who ranked second at the 24 Hours of Mans in 1979, as well as sex symbol, though part of a model pairing since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The shadow zones of a reserved, discreet, committed star, allergic to the scandals of show-business, of which it will never be possible to completely reveal the mystery, go away with him.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the term.
This weekend Paul Newman's disappearance was a heart-pounding blast for cinephiles, while his great characters populate the black screen of memories.
Over half a century of American cinema in full transformation is re-proposed through its interpretations.
They are confused in memory by Butch Cassidy's charming cow-boy (1969) and that boy unable to desire his fiery wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Hot Roof Cat adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
More recently, we remember him as the sensitive Mr. Bridge (1990), troubled by a marriage that did not keep what was promised.
So many other Paul Newmans have gone down in history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Up there someone loves me, by Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean and revived after his death, which officially launched Newman in 1956.
That cute villain in the excellent Stangata, Oscar for Best Picture in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful billiards player in Robert Rossen's The Sweep, a magnificent film (1961), Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which earned him the only Oscar out of 9 nominations in 1987.
That face through the years, it was his.
Him again.
The epochs succeed each other through its path.
Young people know him best for George Roy Hill's cult movie Slap Shot (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in Mr. Hula Hoop, of the Coen brothers.
The circle had ended with one last role as the godfather of the Irish Mafia in Era my father, in 2003.
Unlike the more graded film legends who soon abandoned the trade, Newman will remain in theaters for a long time, denouncing Hollywood in all its pomp, parties and concessions.
Bertrand Tavernier, a French filmmaker, called him, with a hint of irony, "a living challenge to underplaying", judging his performance exaggerated.
The profession was not always a game for the handsome Paul Newman, to whom the roles seemed to fall like manna from the sky.
However, he often preferred the role of the marginalized to that of the young actor: neurotic, alcoholic carrion or desperate characters, of which he expressed disarray and rebellion with his perfect traits.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown nuances of his true, modest sensibility.
Jennifer's first time, in 1968 (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with her wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a subtle female portrait of melancholia.
He, who lost his son Scott to an overdose, dedicated to him in 1984 the film Harry and Son, a discreet and sad film.
Among the countless tributes rained on Newman yesterday, his great friend and old comrade in arms Robert Redford (they had acted together in La Stangata and Butch Cassidy) stated with infinite sadness "His presence has made my life and this country better".
Generosity and love of life, two great characteristics of the missing actor.
Beyond a career as a legend, a great militant for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protester of the Hollywood drift, is thus extinguished.
We will have seen her face stand out on bottles of vinegar, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging her a bad taste choice, although born as a gag.
The revenue from those sales was, however, earmarked for his Foundation for Children in Trouble.
Newman, instead of resting on his myth, chose to commit himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter saying "Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful to his good star .
Being there was a privilege."
And just as privileged it was for us to follow the path of such a clear and generous American artist.
Citizen model, then, and much more.
What was produced in the invoice factory of Zuschlag & associates?
Soon, on October 8, the hearing of the criminal trial against Mr. and partners will be discussed.
The politician and his associates are charged with repeated commercial fraud committed as part of a criminal association that has caused considerable damage, and other crimes, including forgery of documents.
According to the Prosecutor's Office the money obtained from calls for competition, was used by them for private purposes, and they have often certified the carrying out of activities through false invoices.
The state and municipal money, a total of 65 million guilders, ended up partly in the coffers of the Fiatal Baloldal organization, partly in the pockets of some people.
According to the method, made known by the investigating authorities, they have withdrawn the money obtained from calls for competition on the basis of invoices for non-existent transactions and the associations have never fulfilled their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the bills were false.
To make them, the blocks of invoices were purchased at the market of J?zsefv?ros, the circular stamps instead were manufactured in Kiskunhalas.
And to decide on behalf of which firms to issue invoices, it was established among other things during the outing in the hills above the Balaton where Janos Zuschlag had sent Istvan Lados.
According to the latter's confession he had to choose pensions and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for the consummations, on the model of these then the invoices were prepared to be forwarded to the calls for competition, among others, to those of the Ministry for Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Municipality of Budapest.
A large part of these are the work of Istvain Lados and Andrsari, who, according to our information, has drawn up mainly the reports necessary to obtain the funding.
One of the choices of Lados' "journey studies" was a brewery.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and partners in 2003, the restaurant has provided meals for a group of 90 people of the Biztos Pont Egypte Association.
So many people, however, according to the restaurateur, would not all go into the club together.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Foundation J.V.E.R.T., hereinafter referred to as Egy?tt a Armadik ?vezredért, is teeming with formal errors and content.
A guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj has only three rooms, more than 10 people could not stay overnight, however 130 guests were included in the bill.
But the compilers of the fancy invoices exaggerated when they reported the Pigal Kft., this too deals with catering, in whose accounting - according to the information released to the judicial authorities - did not even include the documents on behalf of the companies Jobb J.v.ért and Hopp.
The company's administrator, Gyuzi Farkas, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to the public prosecutor's office and they showed him the invoices, he immediately realized that they were fake documents.
"On the stamp the name and VAT number of our enterprise were at a wrong point."
He added: in addition to the formal reasons not even the fact that according to the bill were accommodated a hundred people, when in total they have eleven rooms and there are not so many beds.
In addition, the bill was catering and their restaurant has not been in operation for a long time.
The regular invoice compilers did not bother to inform themselves that the Budapest travel agency of their choice, only organizes trips abroad, so they foolishly indicated on the invoice with cash payment trips to Hungary, which did not agree with the practice of issuing invoices of the company.
In addition, as demonstrated during the investigation, the invoice also included VAT, while the activity of travel to countries outside the European Union is exempt from VAT.
Among other things, the amount of the VAT was also incorrect on the four documents issued by the Hotel Révf?l?p Kft. in favor of the Jobb J?v?ért foundation, in fact on the services offered by the company it is necessary to apply the VAT to 15% and not 25% as indicated on the invoices, in addition the hotel employees issued only printed invoices, while the manufactured invoice was written by hand.
In addition to this, the "issuers" have ruined other invoices, in the case of a firm they have indicated as carried out the activity of the transport of goods by road, as is known from the procedure of the Public Prosecutor's Office, activity that was not carried out by the company originally founded for investment advice.
Also for formal defects - cause non-compliant invoice format, false stamp - it has been found that the invoices issued in favor of Egypt to Armadik svezredért Alap?tv?ny, of XXI. Sz?zadi Kultur?lis Egyes?let and Biztos Pont are false.
The same happened in the case of the Ravenna Bt. or the Sports Camp of Kunfehért, whose representatives denied having issued the invoices in question.
The falsifiers also paid no attention to the fact that the HIB Kft. of Nyaregyh?za was in liquidation when (2001) a group of Fiatal V?rosért Egypt?let lunched there, precisely for this reason the liquidator of the liquidation of the company, according to our information, denied that he had issued that invoice.
They have issued invoices knowingly
Another group of bill issuers consists of those who were aware that they had to issue fictitious bills.
The foundation Esély Budapestért Alapitovny has issued an invoice at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifj? Szocialist?k in favour of the foundation Egy?tt in Armadik ?vezredért of almost 4 million guilders.
Ludovic Gymerfi, one of the defendants, according to the accusatory act, persuaded the director of Collab Kft. to issue fictitious invoices.
He collaborated with Zuschlag and partners also the Biogate Kft currently in liquidation, which in 2003 provided invoices issued for a value of about 5 million guilders to the foundation Jobb Jovért Alapovny, the Atlasz Egyeslet association and the association Vorsfeny Egyeslet, behind which there was no real economic activity.
Not even movement of money because prepared invoices were then reversed, but associations forgot to make this aspect appear in their own documents.
In the following group of companies issuing invoices belong those who are connectable with the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov, who is authorized to address the general manager of the Budapest-based but not available there, fuel and motor vehicle trade.
The company issued various invoices in October, November and December 2005 relating to the sale of computer media, worth about 18 million guilders.
According to the investigation data the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas under liquidation since 14 September 2005 purchased these invoices.
The general manager of this company was a Romanian to whom between 2002 and 2005 Ivan Kubatov would forward the documents concerning the company.
As far as we know Kubatov, during the investigation, acknowledged that he had issued invoices in the name of the company to Atlasz, Hoppo and to Egyatt in Armadik Alapetvny and the equivalent value was taken from him.
At the express request of Ivan Kubatov Romanian masons founded the Fa-Bani companies Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
However, none of the firms were operational, because according to the defendant they had not received work.
However, the companies were useful to him because at the request of the co-defendant lawyer Zsolt Szente, editor of the founding documents of the companies, invoices were issued in the name of the companies to the associations linked to Zuschlag: to Atlasz and to Y-Gener?ci?.
On behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Tri, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade Kubatov issued 15 invoices to the various institutions for a total value of 14.2 million guilders.
The Prosecutor considers that Kubatov has pocketed 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices, as well as VAT.
The man also used Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictitious invoices, manufactured for the Biztos Pont competition notice.
In January 2006, Y-Genersic and Szavetség in Modern Magyarorsz-gért submitted a call for applications for the Socialist Party's public utility body, Tuncsics Mih?ly Alap?tv?ny (TMA).
They also won 500,000 guilders each but the sums were not used for the purposes indicated in the notice.
In order for this not to surface, they presented TMA with five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft.
These invoices were found during the search of the office of ?rp?d Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing a part of the defendants, as they have already done in the prosecutor's office, will probably report on the progress of the production of the invoices.
However, the most interesting thing might be if the number one defendant, J.O.S. Zuschlag, decides to lift the veil on everything.
His confession so far has not been very detailed and although he has promised several times to talk about everything in an extensive manner, he has not yet done so.
It is necessary to see if it is in his interest, it could also be that the socialists have made agreements with Zusi, who - in exchange for compensation of 50 million florins, much of the damage - would be willing to scapegoat.
Zuschlag could have been offended for now since his demands to ease his conditions of imprisonment, that is, the granting of house arrest, have so far not been met.
While the perpetrators of non-compensable commercial offenses and causing much larger damages can freely walk or at least wait at home for the end of the proceedings against them, which is not granted to him.
The Psychology of Excess Litigation: Why Spend More Money?
At auctions, buyers are likely to spend more, overestimate the goods.
Neurologists and economists researchers at the University of New York have managed to discover the neuro-economic basis of this known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to their study appearing in the journal Science men do not want to fall behind in a race such as the eBay auction, so they are available to pay even a higher price.
The research sought to trace the nervous pattern of this "game" at the level of the nervous system through experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played the lotto, the other group of players participated in an auction while with the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) method they examined the active areas of the brain of the people participating in the experiment.
In both games the participants could win money, but in the auction game, in which the substantial element is to licit more than the other, the striated body under the cerebral cortex enters intensively into operation when losing to the game.
This brain area, in addition to other functions, plays a role in the "self-gratification" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to the researchers, the price rise is explained by avoiding the vehement reaction of the striated body.
To support their theory, the economists of the research group carried out a financial pursuit investigation.
In this investigation, three groups litigated against one partner under different conditions.
The control group reported what the real value of the product in question was and they made their bet.
To another group besides this they have promised that in the case of winning they will receive another prize of $15.
The third group would receive $15 before the auction, but the members of the group would lose the money in the event of an auction loss.
The difference between the two groups consisted in the fact that for one of them the winning was emphasized, while for the other the loss.
Comproving the neurologists hypothesis the members of the group that played "against loss" were willing to make higher stakes of the control group or "winning".
"These results are not deductible from any of the previously existing economic theories.
These in fact so far explained the phenomena found at auctions with the joy of winning and with the avoidance of risk.
Only the methods of creating the neurological image have helped to resolve the contradiction between the two theories, so that we have come to a third explanation" - said Andrew Schotter, professor of the Faculty of Economics of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When to seek medical attention?
Nearly half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while chronic liver disease is mentioned among the top causes of death in Hungary.
In Hungary the number of hepatitis patients amounts to one hundred thousand, of which only 7000 are treated: the reason is that many sufferers do not know that they are infected.
The definition of hepatitis is the collective name of contagious liver disease caused by several viruses.
There are many similarities between the symptoms, typical are hepatitis and jaundice, but their pathogens and diseases caused differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses spread in two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E via the food channel (e.g. water and infected foods), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal discharge, saliva).
For travelers it is useful to vaccinate against virus A and B, against C there is no vaccine.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating infected foods, accompanied by general malaise, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After yellowish spots are formed on the skin and on the white of the eyes, the feces become clear and the urine dark, healing takes place within two to three weeks.
One million people die each year worldwide from hepatitis B, the most severe variant of the disease, which causes liver cancer and cirrhosis of the liver.
The main reason is, according to estimates, that only one in ten people receive drug treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if it is not treated it can cause cirrhosis of the liver and liver tumors.
Most infected people do not know that they have contracted the disease because pathogens subtly destroy liver cells, in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, the prevention and carrying out of regular medical analyses is very important.
This disease is much more frequent than average in three groups: those who had a blood transfusion before 1991, addicts and tattooed.
Worldwide, the number of people infected with chronic hepatitis C virus amounts to 200 million.
Since a routine laboratory examination also reveals the disease it is worth contacting your family doctor when you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
Recognized in time the disease is curable, the virus can be eliminated from the body, so the infectious power ceases and the formation of tumors can be prevented.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, first organized in 2004 worldwide by disease associations.
The aim is to draw attention to chronic viral hepatitis, the causes of its development and the early recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God feels less pain?
According to the result of a recent investigation, religious faith functions as a kind of analgesic that has made the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
Scientists at Oxford University performed an interesting experiment, examining how faith in god affects the sensation of pain, the British Telegraph reported.
As part of the somewhat bizarre investigation, an electroshock was carried out to 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists, while everyone watched a painting depicting the virgin Mary.
Based on the results, Catholic believers were able to fend off much of the pain.
Thanks to the exploratory technique of the human brain it was discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for pain control.
The test is the first of a series of researches in which scientists, philosophers and theologians of the University take part in addition to academics.
The test took place exactly like this: an instrument that emits discharges and passes the electroshock was connected to the left hand of the subject of the experiment.
The researchers asked the participants to focus on two paintings, the virgin Mary painted in the 17th century by Sassoferrato and the Lady with the ermine by Leonardo da Vinci painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the examination hoped that the image of the virgin Mary would give rise to a sort of religious state among believers, while Leonardo's picture was chosen because it did not differ too much from the other and they considered it to have a tranquilizing effect.
The subjects of the experiment spent half an hour in front of the MRI scanner and in this time aro received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive series, while observing either the religious-themed painting or the other.
Catholics have reported that the vision of the virgin Mary made them feel "safe", as if "someone took care" of them and "they became tranquilized and were pervaded by peace".
Looking at the religious-themed image they accounted for 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo's work before them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who took part in the test himself, believes that such a result can be achieved with any image with a strong effect even for atheists, but one must find the suitable image.
"We have to look for an image towards which they have very positive feelings, like a mother or a father" - said the psychologist.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright was pleased with the result of the search.
"The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it manages to change our personality." - added Wright.
After the excellent results only the question remains whether the painting of a Madonna by Leonardo or another painter of similar caliber is presented to believers, what effect could it have on pain control?
Would the vision of a quality virgin Mary bring better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On their 10th birthday, Google can claim to be in people's pockets as well as in the sky above their heads; it knows where they spent their holidays, what clinic they attend and what they care about.
However, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's directors, this is still not enough.
What is concerned with skeptics who make a comparison with the Orwellian nightmare, they just don't see the substance of web 2.0.
Recently Eric Schmidt told the Financial Times that Google's main purpose is to collect as much personal data as its users and this is necessary to stick to the original goal of Google's founders that was: "we put all the information in the world into a system!".
According to the director of Google interviewed the company, after 10 years of revolutionary work, it is still at the beginning of being able to manage all the information.
When asked what will happen in five years, Schmidt replied: he would love it if Google could answer questions like "what do I do tomorrow?" or "what would be the right job for me?", but software can't answer seemingly simple questions because they don't know enough about users.
Not all internet users are aware that during their searches on the internet exactly the words searched are recorded, from which IP address they are searched and on which page the interested parties stop after the search.
Through the Personalized Search started two years ago users can store their browsing history, they can relate to what they have searched and clicked, these then in the long run will generate much better tailored results; on this same logic it is based Recommendations with which the system offers us products and services based on our previously stated and recorded preferences.
What happens if my data is used against me, if they look at what I'm dealing with? - they ask concerned users of Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, Internet users' counter-reactions are provoked by the fear of the size of the potential power represented by the company, and not by guilt, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or even rebellion to power.
However, a fact is confirmed that all the expressions sought are not only recorded but in justified cases can also be provided to third parties, in such legal cases nothing defends the personal rights of internet users.
The most striking example of this in recent times has perhaps been the coordinated action against Brazil's pedophiles, in which Google forwarded to the Brazilian government the information that made it possible to identify pedophiles from the Orkut community page maintained by Google.
Internet users worried about personal rights instead sighed for relief in May when the firm - in agreement with the electronic legal protection association EFF - successfully demonstrated the truth in court against the FBI: even later you cannot force Google with any point in the constitution to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time the federal government successfully ripped off nearly 50,000 web addresses and a thousand search expressions obtained in reference to the confirmation of the child protection law passed years earlier, but still failed to get the search lists of individual users and the entire list of web pages and keywords dating back two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore rather contradictory: those who fear to provide their personal data lash out at Google because they believe that in this way their intimate sphere and private life is affected by starting to use its services and rise with the rebellion due to the multinationals that stand out for the conservative image.
Meanwhile, American geek culture and the proliferation of enthusiasts, activists and computer users appearing in numerous countries see in them the future generation of big companies, the "cool corporation", as opposed to their rival, Microsoft liquidated as conqueror of the world because of Windows, as much as they both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for an identification code, does not ask for money for its services, the source code kept up to date and the package of programs is much more accessible, youthful and cool than the official practice of the software giant.
But it can also happen because geeks see exactly the problematic relationship between personal rights and the internet, which implies just one of the most often repeated keywords in recent years, web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is all about collaboration, intentionally leaving traces behind us and exploiting the communication channels at our disposal and while the size of these changes for each individual, the substance is the same: to show ourselves.
An average young person can create profiles on multiple community pages, from Facebook to Xanga, can link them with other services such as Twitter or last.fm that lists his musical tastes, all of these can insert them into systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, he can also write blogs on which his most recent photo galleries stored on Flickr or Picasa automatically appear.
Meanwhile, we read of numerous exemplary cases from which it is clear that the girl, seeing the series of photos taken in the morning by the common tour of friends, easily learns with whom she spent the night her treacherous boyfriend or a company can fire one of her employees because she wrote a sincere opinion on the top of the company: one thing is sure, the concept of private life has now completely reconsidered.
Those who live an online life make sure to show themselves and so we can formulate the fundamental thesis that is hidden behind the behavior of young people.
Those who want to hide something or just want to avoid Google's monopoly can do so (starting with Scroogle using Google's search system but at the same time not voluntarily leaving traces).
Not a few people who don't purposely sign up for community pages not to be found, Google's online applications, from word processing to image management and news gathering, can be replaced with alternative versions not tied to huge server parks and that don't make up our best profile so far.
Public opinion waits not so long in secret for the moment when Google will pull out its claws.
Currently the company with its $156 billion worth is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising spaces threaten advertising agency revenue, services introduced in record time instead cause major ailments not only to Microsoft but also to numerous software development firms.
However, critical observers alongside this find alarming points: the company summit, for example, has completely rejected the protest of employees after doubling the tuition of the company's kindergarten, considered it too expensive the repeated daily catering of employees, all this however diminishes in the face of the fact that in 2006 Google bowed its head to the Chinese government and under their agreement the company will filter all the results that offend the good taste and interests of the Chinese regime.
An internal rule of the company seems to be not to advertise a new service in advance but only when it will be usable, one thing is sure, however, that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will move the world at one point: while some believe that the project of scanning and storing Google books and magazines will take on such proportions that the company will soon be faced with the American Supreme Court, others are afraid of the Health system, in fact in this we can create our own health profile.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database can offer good material to the next generation of science fiction writers, the Scroogled account of the famous Cory Doctorow describes the future with Orwellian accents, in which a man with Google data can be approached alarmingly.
Two underage boys helped the double murderer of Zd to make the tracks disappear
Police have questioned two juveniles about the double murder of Azd, suspected with good reason of helping to make the traces of the crime disappear - said on Tuesday the spokesman of the Police Police Headquarters of the Borsod region.
Young people have acknowledged the crime to their accused, they are currently accused of aiding.
The two minors, two girls according to MTI information, defend themselves on the loose.
Aiding is punishable by up to 5 years imprisonment.
The suspect in the two-man murder of a 23-year-old local man was placed in pre-trial detention on Sunday.
He's suspected of multiple premeditated murder for profit.
The investigation showed that the 23-year-old had a large debt to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay off the debt, which is why last Wednesday he lured his creditor with a deception to a construction site in Zd where he killed him and his 9-year-old daughter.
According to the information of the MTI the young man had prepared to commit the crime, a signal is the fact that he committed the murder with a weapon hidden on the spot.
Police are examining the weapon and the circumstances of the use with the involvement of an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has made an offer to purchase the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered 200 million euros, about 5 billion Czech kronor, for the purchase of 100% of the stock list of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles despite the fact that the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange as a possible buyer of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for the exclusion is the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is owned by the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state which intends to sell more than 60% of its securities within a few months.
The Czech financial newspaper E15 states that the Polish offer represents the highest figure so far advanced for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have so far made an offer.
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that of all those concerned the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst owner and did not rule out that this could lead in the future to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5-10 billion kronor.
According to the shareholders' agreement almost 90% of the shares would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance with a share of almost 25%, followed by Bank ske Spoitelna with 14.7% and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5%
The economic crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
Major European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday devoted to the international economic crisis already speak of "a second 9/11".
The global financial disaster happened thanks to the American president - La Repubblica accuses - who was not able to compact his party behind a law crumpled in haste, the purpose of which is to remedy a desperate situation.
Instead of a second Pearl Harbour, as billionaire superfinancer Warren Buffett put it, it would be more accurate to talk about a second 9/11.
Even part of the Madrid press sees Washington as the scapegoat.
According to El Mundo, the lack of American political leadership has plunged the world economy to the brink.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is growing more and more, and the whole world will suffer from it later.
Bush's plan was not perfect but as a result of the congress vote there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political means to manage the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air, just as the greatest transformation in the history of capitalism is taking place.
It is no longer possible to leave out the threat - the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva mentions.
Some states today can still offer a life-saving doughnut to staggered financial institutions and with taxpayer money can save them from failure.
But if more and more banks collapse as in a domino effect then neither the financial means nor new improvised solutions will be enough.
In the long term it is necessary for the member states of the European Union to overcome their national egoism and concentrate control on dismembered financial markets.
Only on Monday the weakened financial institutions have obtained more than 100 billion euros - recalls the Viennese Der Standard, according to which the anxieties that even European taxpayers, similar to those in America, will have to put their hand to their portfolio to remedy the crisis seem more and more real.
The EU has so far not been very concerned about the crisis that has crossed the old continent like a tsunami.
The "saviors" do not have to wave immediately the 100 billion euros, however it would be better if they established in which case it is appropriate to touch the taxpayers' money to prevent bigger damage.
The intelligent machine mimics the flight of the bumblebee
What could be the best method to develop anti-collision technologies other than mimicking the obstacle sensors found in nature?
For example, bees.
In the surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan the hornets gave the initial strategic cue to Nissan engineers on how to build the next generation of anti-collision systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the biomimetic robot BR23C, a robotic minicar equipped with the properties of bees, with the ultimate aim of creating a system capable of avoiding all collisions.
Flying bees form their own personal oval space that really looks a lot like our protective shield - explained Kazuhiro Doi, director of PR and R&D technology at the exhibition.
Important is the role of the bee's view, capable of a 300 degree view in each direction.
Engineers drew on the telemetric laser idea to copy the function of the bee's view.
The BR23C detects obstacles up to two meters away within a 180-degree radius, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the onboard microprocessor that immediately turns it into a command to avoid collision.
In a fraction of a second the robot perceives the obstacle and then, imitating the bee's movements, immediately changes direction by turning the wheels of the measure necessary to avoid the accident.
This avoidance maneuver, differently from the current system, takes place in a completely instinctive manner.
"If not, the robot car would not be able to react quickly to avoid collisions" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robot car project.
It must react instinctively and immediately because this technology corresponds to the damaging and innermost layer of the protective shield, within which the collision is considered currently inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a bee does to avoid other bees.
This process must take place in the blink of an eye.
But unlike bees the deviation cannot go up or down or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and in the direction of steering of the wheels.
In this way instead of the infinite possibilities available to bees to scavenge other bees, the robot, as a possibility available, can rotate on itself, accelerate and slow down.
The BR23C is powered by lighter, high-energy-density lithium-polymer batteries, which means that their life span is longer than lithium-ion batteries.
According to Andoh, the instantaneousity of the intelligent reaction is important, not the processing of data or even less the ability to store it.
This robot has to process some inputs in seconds and react.
There is no need to store them and react with intuitive logic based on previous maneuver data, so it only uses a memory of a few tens of Kb.
You don't need a memory of gigabytes or megabytes.
This is the first step towards the development of a technology for the immediate avoidance of collisions that, they predict at Nissan, within 10 years can be installed on standard vehicles.
Further possibilities of application can be represented by the unification with the GPS satellite navigation system that avoiding the obstacles present on the road leads to the destination.

The written version of the $700 billion economic bailout law has been drafted for the purchase of disproportionate claims, to be applied in several parts.
In the first step half of the sum is spent.
In the new agreements that lasted until midnight on Saturday according to the East Coast timetable, congressional leaders decided on the $700 billion bailout plan after a debate that had lasted for days - Reuters reported.
We have made some serious progress - said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic president of the American House of Representatives who said that it was only left to put the agreement on paper.
Both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the compromise of the plan.
Treasury Minister Henry Paulson speaking of the outcome of the compromise stated: the program will work and be effective, but there is still much to be done. According to Pelosi it is not the Wall Street rescue but the reversal of the economic wagon.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of Asian markets at 8 a.m. according to Washington time (2 a.m. on Monday according to Central European time), but it did not bring large stock exchange growth.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will first vote on the bill called the 2008 Economic Stabilization Act regarding the program, after which it will be the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, then welcomed news of the deal to the White House.
We are pleased with the progress achieved tonight and greatly appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial markets and defend the economy," said Tony Fratto, White House spokesman.
The program, however, differs from the Bush administration's original proposal, which predicted that the $700 billion would all be spent on the purchase of securities with disproportionate credits behind them.
Now as a first step you can spend at most half of the sum of 700 billion dollars, 250 billion immediately after the vote of Monday of Congress, with these the Treasury will buy securities with disproportionate credits behind them, of the fate of the remaining 100 billion dollars will decide the president.
A special college will control the program in which the president of the Federal Reserve also takes part.
The spending of the other half of the $700 billion depends on a new congressional decree.
Under the law, the Treasury may apply a combined tactic: it may purchase credits, mortgages, and securities with mortgages and other types of "poisoned" credits at the same time.
The purchase can take place through auctions and in a direct way - they announced competent of the ministry.
The legal norm makes it possible for the companies concerned to take part in an insurance program where the Treasury guarantees the means that give concern, for which the companies will pay an appropriate price to the probable damages.
Henrz Paulson said: The law gives the necessary means for $700 billion to arrive for the urgent needs of the American monetary system, whether it is the purchase of the wrong financial means, or their insurance or to avoid the risk of a large financial institution collapsing.
We will take all necessary steps to make ourselves ready to introduce the newly signed law - he added.
The directors of the banks in crisis and waiting for state aid think instead that the government will limit their goodwill, defined by the overseas slang simply as a golden parachute.
The limitations of the payments will only occur in some cases, also the limitations depend on how the Treasury Ministry will offer the help.
In essence the limitation means that if the ministry buys under an auction, it will impose a surcharge on the gold parachute, if they do not retire the fallen bank manager.
At the time of the direct purchase of the disproportionate claims the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the directors' money is not exaggerated.
To this it must be added that the already existing contracts of the golden parachute will not change, the limitation is valid only for new ones to incentivize participation in the programme.
This is the first case in American history of the entry into force of a legal limitation regarding the remuneration of general administrators - commented the measure the Democrat Barney Frank president of the commission in charge of financial services of the House of Representatives.
In addition, the state has the right to appropriate a share of the banks participating in the program, decreasing the risk of taxpayers, since they can also gain if the economy, and along with it the saved bank, get back on their feet.
The bill includes that in the next five years the president must submit to Congress a proposal that has how to return to taxpayers the expected losses from the financial sector.
Of course on both sides there were those who expressed their doubts about the project.
That's not what American citizens asked us not to defend taxpayer dollars," said California Republican Congressman Darrell Issa.
His Ohio Democratic colleague Mary Kaptur believes that the measures were taken by the same ones who are responsible for the Wall Street collapse.

In the other sectors of the processing industry, prices rose by between 0.2 and 0.9%.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector, prices increased in August by 0.3% in domestic industrial sales, primarily as a result of the dominant effect of the gas price increase made by the authorities since 1 July.
Compared in 12 months, considering the domestic sales of the processing industry sectors, the largest increases were in the oil product processing sector (32.4%).
In the manufacture of products from metalworking, the price increase was 13.2%, 11% in the production of food, drink and tobacco, representing a decisive weight.
Prices fell in the textile sector (2.5%) and in the production of electrical tools and machinery (0.3%).

Next year in the United States without a visa?
Kinga Goncz sees the possibility that the US-Hungarian visa waiver agreement could enter into force around January 12 - the Foreign Minister spoke about this in Chicago with the local Hungarian representatives.
In his opinion "now everything depends on the fact that overseas is built in time the electronic entry and control system".
However, it drew attention to the fact that the new system will no longer allow entry, however, before departure tourists will have to register.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will continue negotiations in Washington as of today.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleeza Rice, to whom he will deliver the Medal of the Cross of the Order of the Hungarian Republic with the Star and will engage in talks with foreign policy advisers of Democratic candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and John McCain also sided with the bank bailout plan
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major American parties, guaranteed their support for the $700 billion government plan to bail out the banks on Sunday, but there are politicians demanding the resignation of the Treasury Minister.
Representatives of Congress and administration after marathon negotiations lasted for days, Sunday night announced they had concluded a principled agreement on the bank bailout plan.
The Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market release financial package have become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain want to be more suited than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls with the foreground of economic issues Obama has again recovered a bit of an advantage, while McCain's advantage, obtained after the Republican convention with the appointment as vice president of Sarah Palin, has dispersed.
Obama in a speech in Detroit expressed hope that Congress would quickly pass the bill on the $700 billion plan.
He stressed that the proposal contains those consumer protection steps that were also supported by him.
"Now we must act responsibly (...), the danger threatens your work, your savings, all industrial sectors, complete economic stability" - he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not let go of calling McCain's economic ideas outdated.
McCain explained in an interview with ABC that "we're all going to put this down with difficulty (...) but doing nothing is not a viable path."
The Republican senator reported that the proposal included the creation of a finance minister's control committee and the limitation of top managers' good exits, which he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not have a merit role in the deals, but he was in daily contact with the minister.
President Nancy Pelosi on Sunday reported that the House of Representatives is likely to vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking world
The pole of the right is intact, only within the pole voters have become more self-aware - thus analyzes Der Spiegel the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider's party is ready to rule Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
Franz Walter, in the internet edition of the German left-wing magazine, in the article The Bavaria Revolution devours one's parents analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the noted political scientist the erosion of CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber couple took office.
The Christian-socialists have been modernizing Bavaria for decades and right now these modern citizens are moving away from them.
The change of era is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, so also of Angela Merker.
The defeat was not a big surprise for the CSU, but Sunday ended a process that exactly ten years ago had been achievable: the indisputable hegemony of a party-state ended.
Already 10 years ago, in 1998, CSU had plummeted to 47.7%, for the first time below the 50% threshold since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago at the Bundestag elections in 2005 again in the period of the much-mentioned Stoiber.
Because of this is the modernization carried out in a consequent manner in the region, which devours the parents.
Sociologists predicted it 40 years ago, but they missed the weather a lot. But secularization, the results of education, the settlement of East and North Germans in the developed Bavarian region could not remain without consequences on the loyalty of voters to the CSU.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increasing possibilities and the political consequences are evident.
The pole of the right is intact, only within the pole have voters become more self-aware, critical, obstinate.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks the classic bourgeois groups have moved away from the CSU: the freelancers, the artisans, the graduates and the graduates.
Here CSU support has fallen below 40%.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The Viennese conservative newspaper "Who with whom?" In the article "Party presidents are stuck in coalition issues" deals with the confused Austrian domestic political situation created as a result of the elections.
The SPO intends to deal with the ?VP.
The "VP" prohibits the intervention of the "SP" in its internal affairs.
The BZA is open to negotiations in all directions, the Greens still don't want to discuss coalition.
Elections were made, now it all revolves around the coalition; in the discussion broadcast on public TV party leaders just showed the cards.
Werner Faymann, president of the SPO, has confirmed that he wants to deal with the SVP.
The SP_____ wants to show that collaboration between the two parties is possible, in some regions and in the social partnership already exists.
Faymann left open the question of whether he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ?VP, as vice-chancellor.
As he stated, the Sch-ssel-Melterer course was in any case rejected.
The repetition of this direction is not considered.
Molterer cautiously reacted to the red bids.
As he said, the collaboration will surely not succeed if Faymann attempts to meddle in the VP's internal affairs.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition is still an open thing in the party, the issues must be discussed in any case within the ?VP.
The BZA's leader, Mr. Haider, repeated that he was open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition, we are ready to take on the responsibility of governing," Haider said.
Jarika: We need to break the vicious cycle of poverty and segregation
Today in Paris began the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, organized this year by France having the rotating presidency of the European Union.
Ms. Livia Jarika, a Fidesz Member of the European People's Party in the message addressed to the plenum as the main speaker of the congress, drew attention to school segregation because it is the most serious legal violation that affects Roma children and also the most serious obstacle to their affirmation.
Xavier Bertrand, the French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and the European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, Mr Vladimar Pidla, opened the conference at the highest level.
Among those invited to the conference were governments, European social partners and representatives of major European civil and rights organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the Fidesz EP parliamentary group, in addition to the discrimination in recruitment, the Roma are expelled from the labour market in the first place because of their low schooling.
"Most young Roma have no middle-level qualification and as a result of poor elementary education only a small number of them can achieve a higher qualification."
He also stressed, as a fundamental human right, the key role of education in upholding human rights.
Investing in education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of the member states of the European Union.
According to the congresswoman it is necessary to make these links aware in the wider context between Roma and non-Roma.
In fact, the sooner a Roma school starts, the more his chances of becoming a productive member of the labor market grow; through taxes paid for income and consumption he contributes to the nation's budget.
"The right of European citizenship of Roma people must guarantee their right to quality education and the elimination of low-level and segregated schools" - stressed Mr. L-via J-r-ka.
According to the congresswoman, the union of purpose and action of the European Union is necessary to accelerate the processes of desegregation of schools and for this reason it is of fundamental importance to respect the existing and designed anti-discrimination directives.
"The vicious cycle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be interrupted, Roma children must be given the opportunities granted by the democratic space so that they can contribute as full citizens of Europe's future" - asked the Juroka.
In the sign of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities" to be guaranteed for all, the aim of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities organized every year, since last year's Berlin meeting is to ensure a single forum to foster the objectives of anti-discrimination and equal opportunities set at the state and European level.
CSU: pity for a transitional period
At the end of October, the fate of the impassed Huber-Beckstein couple will be decided.
Despite the bad electoral defeat the heads have not yet fallen, for the moment the discussion of personal issues has been postponed at the top of the Bavarian CSU.
Party President Erwin Huber and Regional Governor G?nther Beckstein still remain in place, the question is as long as piety lasts.
Of the fate of the tandem that suffered a catastrophic 17% loss of votes will decide the party's extraordinary congress in the last weekend of October.
The two highly criticized politicians have made it clear in any case that they are not being attacked with all their might in the chair.
They have thus attempted to soften the angry members of the parliamentary group and the base that a day later the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded the personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
5 years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber then at the height of his career, the Christian-Social Union gained 60.7%, now instead after the coup against Stoiber they have fallen to 43.4%.
The CSU for 46 years was "absolute monarch" in Bavaria which gives 18% of German GDP.
However, conservatives in the southern region of fundamental importance to the Hungarian economy always count, in the future they will be forced to join forces anyway.
As the first sign of the reorganization within the party Vice President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, considered possible heir to Huber, gets a place in the narrow exploratory group that will begin negotiations with the liberals of the FDP and with the Free Electors exponents of right-wing values for an eventual government coalition in Munich.
For a strange joke of fate on the list of Free Electors enters the legislature that Gabriele Pauli whose attitude against Stoiber had been exploited as an opportunity for coup by the Huber-Beckstein couple and then treat without regard the woman with great ambitions.
CSU executives now concentrate all their forces to somehow stabilize Beckstein.
Meanwhile, Stoiber, who had been plotting in the shadows so far, will also take an active role. The former regional governor and former president of CSU called September 28 the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some statements to the gall toward the CSU, according to which they deserved more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Merkel will not be chancellor after the Bundestag elections set for September 2009 unless the CSU, which played a decisive role in the 2005 national victory, is re-established with common forces.
According to Merkel, who does not hide the disappointment over the fiasco, the CSU's loss of ground will not have a negative impact on the Berlin grand coalition.
Which is certainly relative: it will not be easy to manage the wounded CSU, but the crisis of the Social Democrats still lasts.
The SPD achieved its lowest result since 1946 in Bavaria with 18.6%.
Lukashenko-opposition: 110-0
Not even an opposition representative entered the Belarusian Parliament after Sunday's election.
According to Russian observers it is the sign of the well-being and stability ensured in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) instead it is explained by the frauds committed in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the legislation of 110 people from a country of 10 million inhabitants has been without opposition for more than a decade, before yesterday's elections the opposition gathered under the name United Democratic Forces (ODS) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, with the presidential mandate renewed for the fourth time following the constitutional amendment in the 2006 elections held under discussed circumstances, "granted" some seats in Parliament to representatives of the opposition.
The ODS has thus renounced a previously assessed boycott.
Behind the opposition's expectations was that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, which demanded credit to reduce the import of increasingly expensive Russian natural gas and agreed to give Russians the pipelines in Beltransgaz's possession crossing the country, intended to improve the relationship with the EU where Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians cannot enter due to the Belarusian political situation considered undemocratic.
It referred to a détente that the OSCE assessed the election campaign with emphasis on positive movements and not shortcomings, such as a ban on presenting itself for one-third of opposition candidates.
The OSCE's quick Monday report, however, also criticized the campaign, during which opposition candidates in practice could not appear in the press, and in particular that the opposition could not be present at the vote count.
Despite this, according to the opposition there is an improvement in the political climate: political prisoners have been released, Minsk is also willing to a small confrontation with Moscow continuing to deny recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, although Russia, with which Belarus forms a federal state on paper, considers the two countries independent already for a month.
We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun - Aleksandr Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition presidential candidate of the 2006 election it is desirable that it remain despite the fact that "power was afraid to let even one opponent into a weightless Parliament".
The opposition does not foresee actions to protest the results but rather tries to get the message to the voters of the need for economic reforms.
Obviously we have many problems, we have to print the opposition newspapers in Russia, for distribution the local authorities raise difficulties, but even so I see that more and more people support change, even among the elderly - said Milinkevich referring to the fact that not even the officially most helped class, that of pensioners, considers adequate Lukashenko's regime which considers its main result the creation of social security.
Due to the country's indebtedness and increased economic deficit it is only a matter of time the disintegration of social security "remembering burial silence" - believes Milinkevich.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers judged the elections to be democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, president of the Independent States Community, told the Russian news agency RIA Novosti: "men believe not in words but in deeds", so the lack of opposition is nothing more than the proof of maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast before work"
It has never happened in the history of Palazzo Chigi that there were revolving doors for the entry and exit of employees.
But as of today, this new measure starts against the smarties, against those who stamp and then goes for a coffee at the bar during work hours.
The novelty antifannulloni was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The revolving doors - Brunetta says - are a tool to work better, with more productivity, more presences and more services" specifies the minister.
"Now a new season of accountability and transparency opens.
This is reformism," Brunetta again points out.
With Palazzo Chigi the installation is completed in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of revolving doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There was no resistance from the employees, the secretary-general assures: "It was a process shared by the workers and there was everyone's cooperation".
I mean, no more breakfast on business hours; no more coffee and cornetto.
Brunetta's word, which suggests, smiling, "a nice cappuccino at 7 a.m. is a holy hand."
During a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
of Rome, the minister then makes it known that "in three months the absences from illness of civil servants have reduced by 50%, that is to say 60,000 more people at work in a year".
And he adds that it is necessary to make the Public Administration more efficient
Italian, "whose wage dynamics - the minister explains - in the last 8-10 years have been double compared to the private sector and well above inflation rates".
Meanwhile, thousands of civil servants have joined together to challenge the rules of the Brunetta decree by adhering to the appeal supported by the Codacons.
"While the minister of the Public Service flagged today numbers about the least absenteeism at work for causes of illness - writes the consumer association - the people of the 'industrious fanulloni' are constantly growing.
In fact, thousands in Italy are the correct and productive civil servants who have joined together to declare war on the illegitimate rules contained in the decree".
In particular, the Tar will contest the exclusion of additional economic treatments for infirmities dependent on cause of service; the extension of the time slots of availability of the sick worker, within which check-ups are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions wanted by the minister.
Accidents work, Napolitano: "Critical prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 remain permanently disabled.
For 2007, Inail data confirm that there were about 1,200 white deaths.
Figures that testify to the severity of a phenomenon that remains a major cause of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as murders.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic issue, today Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th National Day for the victims of accidents at work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data released by the Anmil and the tragic chronicles of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is", says the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the president of the Anmil, National Association of Mutilated and Invalid Labour, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expressed his "strong appreciation for the continued commitment to prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, the care of victims' families and the raising of public awareness".
"There has, of course, been an outraged 'enough', sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, due to their size, arouse the clamour of the media and the involvement of public opinion but the daily reality re-proposes dramatic, even repetitive cases in their dynamics".
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly also a problem of resources: it is decisive to invest in training and information.
Particular significance is given to the numerous initiatives promoted in the school for a more direct awareness by young people who face the world of work.
It is necessary to keep the attention to the phenomenon alive, not to give up the alarm about its social gravity, to apply and improve legislation.
For his part, the Speaker of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini stressed "how the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes on all institutions a determined commitment aimed at urgently ending it".
"The data on accidents at work seem to signal a slight positive trend, but this does not mean that the number of white deaths is still impressive", remarked the president of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We would not want, in fact, that this "trend to the bottom" translates into less attention, because it is precisely when the attention relaxes that tragedy explodes.
"We believe that at the general level too little is still being done to counter the phenomenon of injuries and the contrast can be exercised through multiple actions.
It is necessary, in our judgment - Mercandelli has emphasized - greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of the workers, and this starting from the world of the school".
"A further effort is needed - he added - regarding communication and public awareness.
But above all, there needs to be a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the levels of indemnity protection provided for the victims of work" and the "benefit drift towards which the system is pushing itself in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to give back to the worker the insurance guarantee - he added - because the fate of those injured should not depend on spontaneity or donations from time to time arranged by the legislator".
Mp3 Readers Under Accusation, Put Hearing at Risk
Listening to loud music over an extended period of time using portable music devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing injuries.
This is what the European Commission reports, which in a statement released in Brussels quotes the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (Crsseri) of the EU, published today.
"From this scientific opinion, it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than an hour a day holding the apparatus at high volume risk a permanent loss of hearing ability."
"I'm concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable musical devices and mobile phones at high acoustic levels can unconsciously damage their hearing beyond repair," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From the scientific findings - continues the EU manager - a clear risk emerges and we must react quickly.
Most importantly, we need to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
We also need to review existing control systems, in the light of this scientific opinion, to ensure that they are fully effective and keep up with the new technology."
Brussels had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the large use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise they originated.
"Scientists - concludes the EU executive - confirm that there is cause for concern and the European Commission will now examine together with Member States and stakeholders what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical devices and related equipment".
At present, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music equipment to 100 dB, but concerns are growing as to the auditory damage that may result from excessive exposure to such sources of noise.
You can greatly limit this damage by resorting to solutions such as reducing noise levels and duration of exposure.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee points out that users of portable music equipment if they listen to loud music (more than 89 decibels) for only 5 hours a week exceed the limits currently in force concerning the maximum noise allowed in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk permanent loss of hearing ability after a period of 5 years.
This would affect 5-10% of the users of such devices and their number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno kicks off the Commission for the future of the capital
Today it begins, in March it closes, in June the sums will be raised.
This is the calendar set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the future of Rome Capitale", which settled this morning in its new headquarters behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will finalise the guidelines for Rome.
Once its doors are closed in March, the Junta and the City Council will evaluate analyses and projects, so as to be able to present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official bulletin" of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural ideas are represented there - Alemanno points out - It will have to provide proposals for an idea of Rome's development which the political decision-makers, who remain the Junta and the City Council, will then be able to make use of.
There is no overlap of roles but only the will to have a place to work out a great project for Rome.
In March he will finish his work and then dissolve, because this experience must have a precise time limit.
In June - the mayor announces - we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of Roma Capitale".
To those who accuse the Commission of futility, since its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work the Commission will be able to do and the quality of its proposals.
If there will be quality, as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure also in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is crushed over the management of the daily and the emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look longer and farther, in a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future."
In addition, the mayor of Rome wishes to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless body nor a carriage: it is absolutely free, it will not cost a euro to Roman citizens and will serve to reason and to involve the best intelligences that the Capital expresses".
For Alemanno, in fact, "it is necessary to have a strategic reference design, not closed or immobile, to allow our city to make an authentic leap of level, which it absolutely needs, thinking in a unitary spirit about its future".
A future that, the mayor of Rome specifies "will not be limited to the current municipal boundaries only but will look far beyond" not only from the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital but "also in view of the role that Rome can and must play as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president. That's why
He wrote a well-known American politician who wants us to go as an independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions decimated the U.S. economy and had relations (as he also does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam".
Attacks against Obama are increasing just as the election date approaches.
A Miami lady wrote in a web page: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a big nerve: he believes he will win the highest office in a nation that has had two governors and five black senators in all!"
They're actually attacks that don't say much; they're clearly racial attacks and they don't answer the voters' question: Will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; they all say Obama will win and with a good gap.
Also in this case there are those who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the bowels of the southern United States, wrote an editorial: once in the voting booth we know well to whom the American patriot will give his vote.
One side of the U.S. mentality is kept covered to the last.
"Say what you want, then we'll take care of where to put the cross, whether it's Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we'll get out of America.
Things never said before, that the success of the black candidate appears almost certain.
However, despite all this reasoning, the winning weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: what were the mistakes Bush made during his term? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was kicked home in the butt.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack their bags.
Yet, Iraq for the majority was Bush's weak point.
Whoever takes George W's place will have a huge job to do.
US, the economic meltdown is also felt on journalists: in the newspapers it is time for cuts. And many blame the internet, "assassin" of the printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mind control regarding the future.
Well, today journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, newsmen have not openly stated that they feel less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel as isolated as they used to be.
The problem for U.S. journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a destroyed economic model crisis.
Moreover, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work to put the newspapers together, is a big problem.
It is a problem that needs to be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if one does not want traditional journalism as the general public intends it to be reduced substantially.
A clear but complex pessimism pervades the American journalist today.
Six out of ten newspapermen and senior executives are convinced that the national newspaper is on the wrong track.
In the local field the executive group is 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the web goes.
The major publishing houses open a gap to the internet, for many seen as the "killer" of printed paper.
The "economic pressure" that journalists warn has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope that it will "do something good" for their journalism.
The biggest gap in American journalism today is between those who run the newsrooms – that is, the directors – and the reporters who work for them.
56% of executives nationwide are confident that their reporters share their values, while at the local level the percentage falls to 23%.
For some this has to do with "work security."
Executives who think they will lose their jobs within 3 years are at 47% nationwide.
For staff reporters it goes to 30%.
That of "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, ed) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work on a contract.
In an immense nation like the US, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and internet employers often offer what they want and so it becomes a matter of "take it or leave it", take it or leave it.
Directors almost always receive large wages, while the editor can earn as much as $10,000 a month, in addition to retirement and insurance payments.
For holidays, then, the reasoning gets complicated: tot days after the first year, tot after the third to arrive at 15 days overall after a number of years.
But American journalists, by their admission, "get sick" often during the year.
It's all about climate.
UNIPOL: TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPPOLA STAYS IN GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the tribunal of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the petition of the real estate developer Danilo Coppola who had asked to be able to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a house in the city of Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy as part of the investigation into the Unipol-Bnl climb.
During the trial against him, last week, he obtained release from the domiciles transformed into an obligation of residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate developer could travel the way from the provincial town to a home in the capital.
According to the court, however, these movements (to which the PM gave the contrary opinion) would allow him to influence his company and access the evidence that accuses him.
The Endangered Elites
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the $700 billion bailout plan launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
The New York Times confirmed this yesterday by informing us that the ongoing crisis is splitting the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old soul East Coast, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, instead, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington" and the world of finance, strong especially in the States of Central and South.
The soul, in fact, that has made itself overwhelmingly alive with the vote I said at the beginning.
This just mentioned is, however, only an example of the changes, of the great changes, that the ongoing economic earthquake perhaps heralds or already lets us see: not only in the United States but throughout the West and perhaps not even here alone.
In both the US and Europe, the crisis seems to be functioning as an accelerant of long-incubation phenomena and in the new climate they solidify and finally come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary revival, of the dual state-sovereignty category in relation to a sort of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions that have, yes, close ties with foreign countries, but that first of all see the budgets of people and families living in one country, in one state, involved to a very large extent.
Which immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and families who, among other things, are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically worldwide but politically it is almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems essentially out of the question or not to have much to say: the glaring evidence is given by the European Union which, divided as usual between different interests and between different state strategies, fails to decide any common political line.
And so it is from the government of each individual state that everyone expects interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all the disbursement of funds: since when you get to the corner it is only the states that possess the economic resources, the mass of financial resources able to try to put things back together.
And they also possess the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of immeasurable value, in certain circumstances, of which probably no market and no international organization will ever be able to dispose to a similar extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis places on the state-national element is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the increasing importance that the most recent developments in the economy tend to attribute to a factor very closely connected to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had now entered the realm of the network, of increasingly sophisticated technology, of the immaterial, while we were convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we suddenly realized that our future will instead have to deal increasingly with those very immaterial things that are water, crops, oil.
All things that, look a little, can certainly be transported from one place of the earth to another but are still absolutely linked to a circumscribed space, to a territory.
So that those who find themselves to be sovereign, certainly possess several more cards than those who are not, to those who have the misfortune of living in a place without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novelty which, however, foreshadows a fracture.
Those who say Territory, State, Government, inevitably say Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, awareness of the objective need for authoritative leadership, the demand for someone who can take matters into their own hands.
On the other hand, a wave of disrepute for existing leaderships, especially economic ones, turned out to be so inadequate and full of shadowy areas.
And at the same time something even deeper and somewhat disturbing: a discredit, an intolerance, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class in an increasing number of countries in the West.
That is to say, the belief seems to be growing, in vast sectors of the population, that before their actions are the same ideas as the social elites so far in vogue, their way of feeling and being, their culture in the overall sense of the term, to have made their own time and to be increasingly alien to the opinions of the majorities.
The demand for leadership, in short, subterraneanly feeds a branched but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, which is manifested in the sudden electoral "revolts" or in the sudden turns of the collective moods of these last and very last times, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavaria to the collapse of Labour consensus in Britain, to the rebellion of American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps even the victory of Italy).
One gets the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their formats would say someone, are increasingly struggling to understand, and therefore to represent, what is not taking shape in the deep layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis invigorates, increases, and potentially shakes beyond measure.
In the face of all this talking about a "rebellion of the masses" on the agenda would be frankly exaggerated.
But keeping your eyes wide open certainly isn't at all.
The superglue for walking on walls
Defeat the laws of gravity with super glue and in the future walk on the walls like Spiderman.
It is the goal of several American research centers and now a team of four institutes has gone very close to it.
With a sticker of only 2.5 square centimetres the scholars managed to glue a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical wall.
THE STUDY – The American journal Science has published the findings of researchers from Dayton University, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of scholars is an evolution of existing ones using a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
"The glue principle can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a pile of spaghetti," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that manage to ensure perfect adherence to the animal.
Tests conducted on different materials, such as glass, Teflon and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles and at the same time "it easily detaches from the wall" explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the Engineering faculty of the University of Dayton.
WALKING ON THE WALLS? -"This material could be useful as a transient adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on the walls just like Spiderman? Maybe so, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications could relate to aerospace engineering.
For the time being, no superheroes.
OTHER RESEARCH – The University of Berkeley, California, is also researching a new sticker.
In an article in the journal of the American Chemical Society, Californian scholars presented an adhesive formed of microfibers like hair that self-cleans itself from dust during movement on a surface to always maintain perfect adherence.
Drugs: Never with fruit juices
Beware of grapefruit juice, orange juice, and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in summer because they are thirst-quenching and rich in vitamins, when taken at the same time as some life-saving drugs alter their absorption by amplifying or decreasing their effectiveness depending on the case, with even serious consequences for health.
Reiterating the risks of both packaged and fresh fruit juices associated with taking certain medicines David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who from the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society underway in Philadelphia launches a new alarm: a glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice is enough to reduce the absorption of some life-saving drugs, nullifying their beneficial effects and putting patients' health at risk.
Grapefruit juice was already under indictment because it was held responsible for increasing the effects of certain antiarrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antihistamine and neurological medicines to levels deemed toxic.
FARMACI A RISK - The Italian Medicines Agency itself had given notice of this in an information bulletin two years ago alerting doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger resulting from this mix and to be careful what they drink in case they take drugs such as Diazepam or Methadone.
NOT ONLY POMPELM - According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
Along the list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Hence the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology of the State University of Milan:"These discoveries are generally immediately reported to the various international and national drug agencies that possibly provide to change the information notes of the drugs.
So always read the illustrative leaflets of the medicines you take and if there is anything that is not clear to us, do not be impressed but ask the doctor or pharmacist for clarification," the expert pointed out to the Ansa agency.
Paul Krugman's Nobel Prize in Economics
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his studies of business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a Neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a noted columnist for The New York Times.
Krugman is one of the Bush administration's major critics of economic and foreign policy choices.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, in the days Enron failed, Krugman predicted in an editorial published in the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on U.S. history.
A prediction that triggered not a few controversies and that for years was reproached to the economist, but that has now turned out to be correct.
"I'm surprised and also a little shocked at the speed at which the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom disappeared from public attention," Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an "economist of great value", but also a popularizer with a "very aggressive style, particularly critical against the excesses of liberalism of the Bush administration".
Open Office, here is the third edition of the package"anti-Microsoft"
It is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source personal productivity suite that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the better known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year of work by volunteer developers, behind whom SUN Microsystem watches, the new Open Office shows itself to the general public with several new features: at the welcome screen and at the interface revised and made less Spartan, more substantial ones are added such as native compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, the latest ISO standard version.
Attention also placed on interoperability with the 2007 Office suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific features of some modules such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example to send them via email, or the ability to import PDF files into the graphics processing module, preserving the original appearance of the page.
Also on this front, you can create "Hybrid PDFs", which aggregate the graphics typical of Adobe's format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received several improvements within applications: in the spreadsheet you can intervene in several hands between different users, avoiding conflicts over changes, in the word processor, each collaborator is assigned a color in the comments for better recognizability during revision.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice features to the web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they are expected to release the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://en.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and has been added to the English version that was on the mirrors since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request the installation CD can also be sent home or to the workplace.
And if the theme of gratuity can be a tow for diffusion in homes, it is precisely in the business field that Open Office the suite attempts the big bet, already being able to count on several projects carried out in the public administration and in schools.
And there are also companies that offer training, consulting and assistance services that are ideal for small and medium-sized companies, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for Word equivalent videowriting; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for Powerpoint emulation presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the most famous Access is the program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, is finally the graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that to date we are at almost 3,600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that you can also exceed the expected figure.
Kohl also tested positive for fourth case of doping
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: this is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the Gerolsteiner team, third place and winner of the best climber jersey.
The news is reported on the website of the newspaper L'Equipe.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth positive runner at Cera, the third generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also of Gerolsteiner.
The tests on Kohl's blood samples are among those carried out in recent weeks by laboratories in Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-analysis confirms the positivity to Cera, the Austrian will lose the third place at the Tour and will face the two years of canonical disqualification.
Confirming the news of Kohl's positivity at the third generation EPO is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who told the Associated Press that he had notified the Austrian authorities of the positivity.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed on the final podium behind Spaniard Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, also winning the polka dot jersey of best climber.
IMMIGRATI:NEW YORK TIMES ASKED, IS ITALY RAZZIST?
Italy "from a country of emigrants has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" reluctantly welcomed.
This is turning the Belpaese into a nation of racists? It is what is asked in a long article in the New York Times that has dedicated a long article to the debate on racism in Italy starting from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of biscuits.
This case highlights what the Nyt calls the "northern paradox": the northern regions are at the same time those where there is "more integration and more work" but also the "highest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the highest support for the Northern League".
In confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Nyt also cited episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only that.
The new legislation wanted by the League that tightens the brakes on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegals is also cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
A trend emphasized by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano meeting Benedict XVI at the Quirinale asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism".
Students victims of the dear-rents up to 900 euros for a room
The rent market for college students knows no crisis.
According to the latest Sunia survey, the tenants' union, taking a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now taken on very serious characters to the point of excluding entire groups of young people from the right to study for the very high overall costs that families of origin should bear - explains the head of the Sunia studies office, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand from students has so deformed the market that it has triggered a process of generalized increase even for residents".
In most cases, the rent offers then contain a number of violations: free, unregistered, no-rent contracts, linked sub-rents.
Extraordinary interventions are needed for Sunia that, through the tax review, can calm prices.
Looking at the detail of the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room you go from a minimum of 650 (Black Bands area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate area, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 (Victoria area).
In Florence a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in the areas close to the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a bed in a double, from 370 to 500 for a single.
In Rome in areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) are asked about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a bed in a double.
Values only slightly lower (550 euros for a single room) in areas close to the other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You save only if you move to outlying areas: 300 euros for a bed and 450 a single one in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar areas.
In Naples for a bed you need 300/450 euros, for a room you spend from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
Bari needs 250/350 euros for a bed, at least 350 for a single one.
In smaller cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a greater weight in the city economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of rents to non-EU students is more frequent, as in Perugia, there is finally a further anomaly: the increase of about 25/30% of the fee asked to foreign students compared to that applied to Italians.
Goodbye old cinema Paradiso, the cities cancel the historic halls
Historical movie theaters close in favor of the Multiplex.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes."
The image offered by director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively photographs what is happening in the great Italian urban centers but also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth in the suburbs of large multi-salts and the consequent death by consumption of mono-salts in the central areas of the cities, is one of those events that appear to us inescapable and incontrovertible but also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
To disappear are often historical and memory-laden places,"it is as if a friend, an acquaintance with whom we shared a piece of road and many emotions", observes the director of Nuovo cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago earned Tornatore the Oscar and the Grand Prix of the Cannes jury, and that told the poetry of a provincial hall and nostalgia for a way of living cinema lost perhaps forever.
The figures provided by the Anec, the main association of exhibitors, are clear: in the last five years 316 cinemas of traditional type have closed, and to pay the highest price are mainly cinemas in the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures is Emilia-Romagna with 82 cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And to show that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of multiplex, these are the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multiplex cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian exercise has developed irrationally", observes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, "it is useful that new structures are built but the survival of those already existing should be guaranteed, because when a city hall closes, not all its visitors are willing to move into multiplexes.
Not to mention the lack of allocation for the fund in favour of the operators: the previous debt of the state is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful, from an ethical and moral point of view, that the Government does not comply with existing laws.
To support the sector would serve between 16 and 18 million euros per year".
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, worried about the closures, has decided to run to the shelters with the signing of a protocol between the Municipality and Anec, the first of this type in Italy, to protect and promote the cinemas monosala both in the historic center and in the suburbs.
Among the rules are tax relief measures in favour of managers and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic area and will have special rates for parking and in some parking lots.
«It is an initiative that I like» remarks Giuseppe Tornatore"and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna putting in place other measures.
It is certain, however, that in order to counter the overwhelming power of multiplexes traditional halls must also improve the quality of sound and image, because the public today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New Cinema Paradiso", which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass in front of the Rialto or Quirinale of Via Nazionale now closed, there where I have experienced so many shared emotions, not to see the billboards blackened by the dust I turn to the other side".
Ties between politics and 'ndrangheta arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to standardize the choices of the Municipality to the interests of the Piromalli cosca".
The charges are heavy that the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria address to the mayor and deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and to the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition in mafia association.
In handcuffs also Gioacchino Piromalli, the elderly mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his nephew lawyer, namesake of the boss, already convicted of association for mafia crimes, sentenced to compensate 10 million euros.
"In defiance of any legal and moral norms, as well as common sense", the prosecutors write, the two local administrations had expressed a willingness to pay advice to the lawyer Piromalli.
"It would have been thus granted to the cosca - write the judges - to officially enter the municipalities facilitating the possibilities, already large, of control and direction of the public administration".
The president of the Calabrian regional junta Agazio Loiero does not hide that "collusions between local authorities and organized underworld there are several" in his region: "There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressures of 'Ndrangheta, heroes who keep themselves clean."
The arrests this morning follow those of last July with which the police announced that they had beheaded the Piromalli gang.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro was dissolved but already in 1991, and again due to alleged conditionings between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been relieved of the task of administering the Municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of the dissolution, had been elected to head a centre-right coalition, after the May 2006 ballot.
He shouted at the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the city council.
He called in the then Deputy Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti, accusing him of having planned the whole thing for a political issue, but the judges, in the arrest order signed this morning, explain that the Piromalli cosca had even come to ask for the variation of the project of the A3.
From the environmental interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, the PMs write, it emerged "the willingness to marry the needs of an entrepreneur, representative of a larger group known to be close to the Piromalli, uniforming the choices of the public administration to the interests of the cosca".
When the energy is born from the waves now the big ones come into the field
It is an exterminated field, occupying over 70% of the planet's surface and now the world's major energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources they've got their eyes on, and now they're trying to get their hands on, giants like Chevron.
The possibility of deriving energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for a hundred years now and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now environmentalist demands and the new increase in oil give impetus to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15 percent of the world's electricity needs could be covered by sea swell exploitation facilities.
This amount would be twice that currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And then there would be currents and tides.
Colossi on the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a plant in Northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced it seemed a revolutionary step.
Two years on from betting on marine energy are more and more and among these companies always devoted to traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technologies," a spokesman for a company associated with the U.S. oil giant told the economic newspaper Wall Street Journal, "and is considering cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question concerns obtaining a permit from the U.S. Energy Commission, necessary to start a marine energy exploitation project in Alaska.
It is a signal not small, especially considering that in Alaska the US continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has started a plan for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron there are New York's Verdant Power Inc. and New Jersey's Ocean Power to go down the road of energy coming from the sea and the sums invested so far, though not known in detail, indicate a rising interest according to observers.
Technology to be developed.
Experts talk about a technology still in its infancy, also because marine energy does not dispel all doubts about the environmental impact.
For now, plants such as the Portuguese one or some in Scotland are small and do not seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, however, technologies with a greater environmental impact must be used.
And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other.
The thrust of the waves, which causes the buoys to move up and down is converted into hydraulic pressure by pistons and cylinders within the floats.
The pressure spins a turbine which in turn powers a generator.
Electricity is sent ashore through submarine cables.
For now there are four such plants being designed, pending only federal approval and some of the energy could serve for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces power for a shopping mall and a parking lot using six underwater turbines in New York's East River.
The movement of water when there are tides causes the turbine blades to spin, creating a rotating motion that powers a generator.
Verdant said it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to take advantage of the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say at the Institute for Electricity Research, deserves the potential of the tides at this time.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is precisely on tidal energy that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others bordering the coast, have already invested $7.5 million in 2008 and planned investments of up to $35 million for 2009.
