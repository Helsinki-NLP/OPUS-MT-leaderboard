Looks like there's no way out.
We fell asleep.
I was very annoyed by him.
Why should we help you?
I put the plan into practice.
He made a list.
For a while I was really addicted to Coca-Cola, and I drank it every day.
I think Tom's circling it.
Africa is exporting beef to Europe.
Did he tell Tom why he wants to go to Boston?

Tom is pleased with his success.
You're trustworthy.
I didn't even consider it.

You can only smoke on the terrace.
I agree 100%.
These flowers besides being beautiful also have a good scent.
He's in college now, isn't he?
We should call him.
It's interesting how it happened.
You should remember.
Tom said he likes to teach French.
He pulled a coin out of his pocket.
Are you related to her?
Who broke this window?
I'll go tell them.
If you heard him speak French, you'd trade him for a Frenchman.
He came ten minutes later.
We waited for him yesterday.
Tom said Mary was low.
Where's the exit?
If I remember correctly, Tom sold his car to Mary for just $500.
I'll call you after lunch.
We didn't agree on anything!
It's very unlikely.
No doctor can explain it.
I have to try it.
You're depressed.
You're wasting my time.
Aren't you Mary's husband?
It was all your imagination.

If actions are stronger than words, why is the pen more powerful than the sword?
She bought a tea service.
We're all gonna die.
Tom kept crying.
I can't do that yet.
George was out of his temper!
You misled me.
Are you willing to learn?

You smell so good.
I forgot everything about them.
He doesn't use it.
I'm messy.

I got home late last night.
We ran out of gas in the middle of the desert.
Don't worry, I'll be home safely.

He was often up late.
I don't eat bananas often.
Get them out of here.

I don't like fish with bones.
I feel protected.
You're the tallest.
Isn't that funny, Tom?

It's a beautiful photograph.
I'll leave her alone.
Tom won't even look at me.
We humiliated them.
He's already here.
I know who my enemy is.
Tom has to sleep now.
Tom's not honest.
Tom's father is a cop.
Does Tom work here?
That's what Tom was looking for.
What did you do to her?
Tom wanted to send a message.
I wasn't happy to see them.
Don't break my heart.
I have no plans for tonight.
Stop being sarcastic all the time!
She was crying.
I wish I could be as rich as you.
We had fun.
It's dishonest.
I read books a lot.
Tom and I want to talk to her about something.
I can meet you at 2:30.
Tom got annoyed.
I'm already old.
I have a criminal record.
Good night, my friends.
He bought a book in English in a bookstore.
I'm going to the bookstore tomorrow to buy some books.
What would the world be without women?
They tell us funny stories.
Can you hear what Tom is saying?
What is your favorite historical film?
We can't see her.
Tom and I still love each other.
Tom needs to eat.
Everybody leave.
Giant pandas only live in China.
I'm being followed.
Don't say things like that.
From bad to worse!
Jim is Canadian.
You did well here.
Where did all the others go?
I'm relaxed.

He meddled in his private life.
Can I borrow your knife?
I'm late for a date.
Tom is still absent.
I ate the whole apple.
Roast the bhakri while the pot is heated.
Is the park open today?
We only prepare Uyghur food.
We're leaving Boston tomorrow morning.
We can't leave you there.
Tom was playing football.
Stop stuttering.
I know her.
The real heroes are us.
We're waiting for Tom.
Unfortunately, my birthday is only once a year.
Put your bike away.
I meant it as a compliment.
They called President Roosevelt a pirate.
I could go to the movies.
It's not a date.
It makes me nervous.
Who do you think told them?
Why did Tom give it to Mary?
Listen to her!
He's good at this game, isn't he?
Take care of them.
I live in Fiji.
You want to eat with us?
She doesn't seem too surprised.
I don't go to school on Saturdays.
It's my job to protect you.
Tom is treacherous, isn't he?
Is this cage meant to protect against sharks?
Tom wants to get to know Mary better.
I'm very disappointed.
Tom wants more coffee.
Who do you think is the author of this novel?
I wish you'd called me.
Don't you want a job?
I played trombone when I was younger.
I am faithful.
Can you write in braille?
I don't know what happened to him.
I'm free today.
Why do you want to kill us?
He ate an apple.
I caught him.
He adopted the orphan.
I guess they speak French.
Take a step forward.
You need to become more active.
Are Tom and Mary kidding?
Smoke broke.
I have no alternative.
I think Tom knows who lives in that house.
He's smarter than he is.
What are you going to do this summer?
He became irritated.
Can you speak Shanghainese?
It shrunk because I washed it.
Tom was wearing an old pair of shoes.
Tom wondered what happened to Mary.
Something bad happened to them.
How much was paid?
They didn't touch anything.
Do you like horror movies?
I know a lot about animals.
Don't hold your breath.
Am I in London?
He's still there with her, isn't he?
This will make a big difference.
Tom didn't have much money with him.
Tom doesn't have a big appetite.
Were you with them that night?
I was running.
The village was dead after sunset.
What's your favorite female rapper?
Say hello to Tom for me.
It's good to see you so happy.
I usually swim in the summer.
Why is he leaving soon?
I'm pretty proud of it.
I smell gas.
I'll tell them it's not true.
Here's a picture of him.
I can depend on my friends.
The experiment confirmed his theory.
Tom's lucky.
Pass me the ketchup, please.
It happened that I sat next to her at a convention.
There is no furniture left in the room.
Tom showed up early for class.
He's a little overweight, isn't he?
Who's the man who's playing the piano?
I decided not to do it again.
No, I haven't written it yet.
You have to listen to Tom.
He slept in the car.
Tom and I are going to Boston with Mary.
He spent all his income drinking.
Search harder on Google!
It's not the only problem with your idea.
You talk like you're the boss.
You want me to leave with you?
I came to see her.
Does it look familiar?
I'll check your game tomorrow.
So, what am I supposed to tell him?
It's starting to rain.
Do you play any instruments?
Will they die?
I really like it.
Are you guys coming in?
Tom stabbed her.
I have no feelings.
She's incredibly stupid.
We landed on a lonely island.
It takes patience.
He convinced the teacher.
When is your new novel coming out?
I would never betray her.
Are you aware of any problems?
The mystery remains unsolved.
I will never forget Germany.
Why didn't you call a doctor?
You're good.
How would you like to change it?
It's snowing today.
He made a promise to write to me every week.
I wasn't born deaf.
We should leave you alone.
I can't raise our son alone.
Go get some milk.
Tom seemed surprised.
I love being right.
Tom married a rich girl from Boston.
I forgot whether he drinks wine or not.
Who warned them?
Have faith in God.
"I will give 50 thousand for this statue. "Who will offer more?"
Why would anyone want to kiss her?
He should have bought a used car.
I'm going to stay at the hotel.
I didn't grow up like that.
You can park here.
Please tell him to hurry.
Tom hated them.
I shave almost every day.
I won't apologize.
We really like picnics.
I haven't talked to him yet.
It was a warm summer night.
I always walk.
It's decisive.
You're not much fun at parties, are you?
He searched his bag for the car keys.
I really don't feel like talking.
So it must be Argentine.
I really like my job.
I would suggest you be more cautious.
She's shaken.
He should have done it yesterday.
I'm a big fan of American cuisine.
Tom is dancing with Mary.
Your fate is in my hands.
No, you don't have to go now.
No one wants to help you.
It will clear up in the afternoon.

Tom loves fly fishing.
We have no choice but to risk it.
I don't want to play chess.
Mary is jealous.
I should have changed the oil.
Do you have a calculator?
I asked him to stay.
If you really want to know, all you have to do is ask.
We need to inform Tom.
Tom's still asleep.
Tom's a little impulsive, isn't he?
You agree with Tom, right?
Tom didn't take much money.
Tom calculated his expenses.
It's not my idea of fun, but whatever.
Could you ask Tom to stop after work?
He plays the drum.
Must be hot.

It was published in 1969.

Look, I'll show you.
I said he was innocent.
Fear of failure is one of the most widespread fears in the world.
Why are you so jealous?
You think Tom killed Mary?
How come you have nothing to say?
Scandalosis!
Come on, Tom, aren't you curious?
Keep your tongue at bay.
I drank the wine.
He's more popular than me.
When can I get out of here?
You're early again.
We left this.
All I want is to go fishing.
Do you want to take this?
Tom didn't want to go back to the orphanage.
Gold is heavier than iron.
I'll find one later.
At least I'm older than you.

Tom says he kissed Mary.
You can choose whatever you want.
I'm in the hospital, I was struck by lightning.
Did you call them?

It was a really scary story.
It's in the van.
I don't introduce them.
Do you like golf?
Forgive me for interrupting the other day.
Can you believe it?
I waited for a bus to arrive.
He found the bug.

On the table are some books.
Come at least six o'clock.

After dinner stroll on the beach.

He changed his diet.
He's a man of his word.

You are a brave man.
Aren't you surprised?

Tom told us why.
Nothing Tom said was true.
You should have stayed with her.
I haven't received any warning that she's coming.
"He'd like to have a coffee after work." "I'd like to, too."

It's mean.
Who are the others?

I want to give up.
I spent my holidays in Tunisia.
Why did you buy a car like this?
She killed herself yesterday.
How long will you stay?
I have some great news.

We didn't see anything.
I'm mixing mayonnaise with ketchup.
His children have grown up.
We don't ask for much space.
He's going to jail, isn't he?

We have the same problems.
I met him when I was a student.
I was angry and confused.
Who hurt you?
The boy began to shout.
We all laughed at seeing her pink evening dress.
Don't talk to me about religion!
How'd you spend your vacation?
They're not that nice, are they?
What else did he tell you?
I thought you were mad at me.
I came up with a good idea.
I think it's really bad.
He is so aggressive that others avoid him.
He has a sense of humor.
Which club do you belong to?
I wish everyone would go home.
Go back to work.
They won't find her.
I admire Tom's dedication.
We've been on it three times already.
There's not even an orange on the table.
Are you still jealous?
She followed me into the kitchen and took a knife and then started cutting vegetables.
He suffered quite a trauma.
Tom left something on the table for you.
I've never been to my uncle's house.
I love Alex Marcelo.
It was nice chatting with you.
I should just tell Tom the truth.
Where were you in 1979?
Tom decided to risk everything for love.
We heard him go down the stairs.
I'm better.
We haven't seen much Tom since his divorce.
We ignored Tom.
You can't compete with them.
When did you ask them?
I don't want to go bald when I'm still young.
We weren't lucky.
He has a crush on Justin Bieber.
Have you seen him yet?
What is the easiest way to learn English?
The first edition was published ten years ago.
Tom fell into the pool.

I'd like to cross the United States of America with a convertible.
I saw them walk into the bank.
I helped my mother cook.
Tom says he's never too busy to listen.
A closed fist can indicate stress.
Did you call Tom this morning?
Tom asked me to talk to her.
You asked your professor for advice.
I appreciate your trust in me.
You must know him.
Laura, are you a teacher?
It belonged to them.
Why didn't you bring an umbrella?
How long was he gone?
How do you assume he eats?
I'm surprised Tom can't speak French.
He was playing the piano.
I can take her home.
I'll call you tomorrow.
I think they were wrong.
The supreme treasure is knowledge, the central treasure is children, and the lowest treasure is material wealth.
That would be risky.
We got up at four in the morning.
I have one.
We're shy.
I know your mom doesn't want you to talk to me.
It ruined my life.
It's not very likely that Tom wants to do this.
You're really good.
Tom kept trying to call Mary, but she never answered the phone.
Get ready.
Some orypterops manage to live up to ten years.
What kind of work do you do?
I'll write it on the board.
You're brave.
You are not sick.
We adopted him.
We'll play a game.
Say 'ahhh'.
Tom is dead, not Mary.
You'd better go.
Which club do you want to join?
Mary will protect you.
Did you buy anything for Tom?
He said he wasn't going.
The city is two miles from the coast.
Let the tricks begin!
Go help them.
Shouldn't we be helping them?
Tom's in his 30s.
You guys are sophisticated.
I think I've been in love with her.
Tom said his house wasn't locked.
You are part of me.
She took her brother to the zoo.
You look perfect.
I'm actually a bastard.
I don't want to sit next to her.
Look at that!
They know who he is.
Let's open it.
It's disease to be obsessed with winning, it's disease to be obsessed with using martial arts, and it's disease to be obsessed with presenting everything you've learned. It's disease to be obsessed with attacking, and it's disease to also be obsessed with defending. It's disease to also be obsessed with getting rid of the disease. Obsessively fixating your mind on anything that's considered disease.
We booked seats for the play.
These are Tom's books.
I learned the lotus position at the yoga class.
Just follow them.
He introduced me to his roommate.
Sami called Layla six months later.

Do you have a large family?
You have to create problems to create profit.
I got lost in Boston.
Tom decided to sell his house.
Do you have anything else?
Tom should let me help Mary.
I'm just listening.
We eat apples.
It's a cross with him, he always comes too soon.
That's the reason I didn't want to date Tom.
I hope Tom knows how to fix this.
Are you making friends here?
What would you like for dinner?
Tom didn't expect Mary to be so kind.
