Members of the Assembly of Wales are concerned about "being a clown"
There is dismay among some members of the Assembly over the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Parliament of Wales).
This proposal arose as a result of the programmes to change the name of the assembly in the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly of the entire political arena are concerned that this may sound ridiculous.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly said that his party is concerned that it "may rhyme with Twp and Pwp."
For readers not living in Wales: In Welsh, twp means jerk and pwp means poop.
A member of the Plaid Assembly said that the group as a whole "was not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative party claimed to be "open" towards changing the name, but pointed out that only a small verbal step separates MWP from Muppet (cowardly).
In this context, the letter W in Welsh is pronounced in a manner similar to Yorkshire's English pronunciation of the letter U.
The assembly committee, which is currently in the process of drafting for the introduction of name changes, said: "The final decision regarding any descriptors of what the members of the assembly will be called will obviously be a topic of debate for the members themselves."
The Law of the Government of Wales of 2017 granted the Welsh assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which noted broad support for the possibility of calling the Parliament of Wales assembly.
With regard to the title of Members of the Assembly, the Commission expressed its preference in favour of Welsh Parliament Members or WMP (Members of the Welsh Parliament), but the MWP option received more support in a public consultation.
AMs are apparently proposing alternative options, but the difficulties in reaching consensus could prove a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a legislative proposal regarding the changes within a few weeks.
The Reform Act will include further changes to the functioning of the assembly, including regulations on the exclusion of AMs and the design of the committee system.
AMs will get the final vote on their name during the discussion of the legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls for referendum on changing the country's name
On Sunday, voters will decide whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to end a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which owns a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim on its territories and has repeatedly opposed its applications for EU and NATO membership.
The President of Macedonia Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite for changing the name, said that he will not take into account the result of the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the name change is simply the price to pay in order to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells shut up while Harlem churches are struggling
"The elders I spoke to say that in the past there was a bar and a church on every corner," Adams said.
"Today there is neither."
He explained that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People socialize differently today," he explained.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood parlors that people regularly hang out in."
As for the churches, he worries that the money from the sale of the assets will not last as long as the leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will return to where they started."
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartment buildings filled with the type of people who won't help the neighborhood's remaining shrines.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings are white," he says "and for that reason they will hasten the time when these churches will close altogether because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by sororities before Harlem became a black neighborhood - Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St Martin's a decade later.
The initial white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A black congregation praying in a nearby church took possession of the building.
St. Martin's was acquired by a black congregation headed by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott against retailers on 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, who denied hiring or promoting black people.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's parishioners planned its reconstruction, they also ordered the music box.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the music box "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the music box in July called it differently: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the first music box in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who switched to a larger music box at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather claimed that St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has been staged in St. Martin's in recent months has been a complicated plot of architects and entrepreneurs, some presented by the lay leaders of the church, others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish assembly, the parish's governing body, made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July about its concerns that the diocese "was trying to unload costs" on the parish assembly although the latter had not been involved in hiring architects and entrepreneurs sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners have complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures a 13-year-old diver in lobster fishing in California
Official sources state that on Saturday a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while diving in search of lobsters in California, during the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming and swam up to him along with a group of people to get him out of the water.
Hammel thought at first that it was only enthusiasm due to the capture of a lobster but then "he realized that the boy was shouting 'I was bitten!
I was bitten!'
His entire collarbone was torn," he said he noticed Hammel once he reached the boy.
"I shouted at everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was hospitalized in critical condition.
The shark species responsible for the attack is not known.
Spy-watcher Captain Larry Giles stated during a news release that a few weeks earlier a shark had been spotted in the area, but that it had been declared not to belong to any dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper chest area.
Authorities have banned access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security purposes.
Giles has reported that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans a boost to the UK beauty products industry
Sainsbury's is challenging Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with aisles dedicated to department store beauty products assigned to specialized assistants
As part of the important drive towards the UK's 2.8 billion pound beauty product market, which continues to grow as sales in the fashion and household goods sectors decline, the largest lanes dedicated to beauty products will be tested in 11 stores in the country and adopted in multiple stores next year if successful.
The investment in beauty comes at a time when supermarkets are looking for new ways to use shelf space once dedicated to televisions, microwave ovens and household items.
Sainsbury's said it would double the size of its beauty product offering to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will occupy a larger space with branded areas similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its range of Boutique tricks so that most products are vegan - a quality increasingly demanded by younger shoppers.
In addition, perfume retailer The Fragrance Shop will experience clearances in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, South London while a second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later in the year.
Online shopping and a shift toward buying small amounts of food daily at small neighborhood stores have forced supermarkets to commit more to getting people to buy from them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said the stores will look more and more like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to resist discounters like Aldi and Lidl by proposing more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos stores in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several Habitats since purchasing the two chains about two years ago, and such a strategy has boosted grocery sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to restore enamel to its beauty and pharmaceutical departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s but the synergy ended in a dispute over the breakdown of revenue from pharmaceutical outlets in supermarkets.
The new strategy was adopted after Sainsbury's sold its 281-point-of-sale pharmaceutical business three years ago to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds.
Lloyds was expected to play a role in the program, with the addition in four stores of an extensive range of luxury brands of skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, sales manager at Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the appearance of our beauty product departments to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands has been developed to meet every need and the inviting environment and comfortable locations make us an interesting destination for beauty products, as opposed to the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "furious" after Holly Willoughby steps away from an 11 million pound deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones is furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from an 11 million pound contract with her trend brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby no longer has time for his own brand of housewares and accessories Truly.
The couple's activity had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The presenter of This Morning, 37, used Instagram to announce her abandonment.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den star Peter Jones furious after retiring from their lucrative last-minute trending brand business to focus on his new outstanding contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources state that Jones was "furious" when the golden girl on TV admitted during a tense meeting at the headquarters of her trading empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts - worth 1.5 million pounds - did not leave her enough time to devote herself to their brand of housewives and accessories Truly.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand Goop and it had been calculated that it would double Willoughby's assets, estimated at around 11 million pounds.
As soon as Willoughby, 37, chose Instagram to announce his abandonment of Truly, Jones left Britain to head to one of his vacation residences.
According to one source: "Truly was undoubtedly Holly's top priority.
It was to be her long-term future that would engage her for the next twenty years.
His decision to abandon left all those involved absolutely speechless.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, they were so close to launching.
There is a warehouse full of products at Marlow HQ, ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the abandonment of the presenter of This Morning, one of the most profitable stars in the UK, could cost the company millions due to strong investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and due to possible delays at the launch of the brand.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin were friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby conceived Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined the company as president in March.
The couples spent the holidays together and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the ambassador of the M&S brand and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's "I'm A Celebrity" program.
A source close to Jones said last night that he "does not wish to comment on his business affairs."
Hard words and "then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media to make a comment that some would judge "non-presidential" and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in his voice in imitation of the "news anchor".
"I gave up nothing."
He pointed out that Kim is interested in a second meeting after the first one in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a huge step towards denuclearizing North Korea.
But the negotiations for denuclearization are at a standstill.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho addressed world leaders during the UN General Assembly on Saturday, that North Korea did not observe an "equivalent response" from the US to North Korea's first disarmament operations.
Instead, he pointed out, the US is continuing to impose sanctions aimed at keeping pressure high.
Trump gave a much more optimistic view of this speech.
"With North Korea we are achieving very good results," he said.
"We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: the end of missile tests, the contribution to the release of hostages and the repatriation of the last American military.
And he defended his unusual strategy by describing his dealings with Kim.
"It's simple to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this crowded field, we would have about 200 people right here in front of us," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, resulting in hundreds of casualties
Following the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organizations had been notified that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population had been displaced, no national emergency had been declared, an essential requirement for activating international aid.
"In numerous cases, unfortunately, they've been very clear about not wanting international assistance, so it's a bit complicated," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain that the foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute aid.
Given the earthquakes Indonesia is continually subjected to, the country continues to be terribly unprepared in the face of the fury of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, it is not a common facility on other coasts.
The obvious lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although the alarm had been given, probably contributed to the loss of life.
In the best conditions, moving between the numerous islands of Indonesia is complicated.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship anchored in Lombok to assist earthquake victims is heading towards Palu but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new calamity.
President Joko Widodo put the improvement of Indonesia's shredded infrastructure at the heart of his campaign and poured money onto roads and railways.
But lack of funds hit Joko's administration as he prepares for re-election next year.
Joko also faces pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted the most conservative branch of the religion.
Over 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands removed from their homes due to street clashes between Christian and Muslim gangs, who fight using machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool draws against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with a point in the 89th minute on Saturday, at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 25 metres from Chelsea's door, with his team down 1-0.
He touched the left ball before pulling on the second pole.
The attempt passed high above the frame of the door as it veered to the upper right corner of the net.
The ball finally fell behind Kepa Arrizabalaga by bagging into the net.
"It was enough to try to get in position, to get to the ball and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible, so I tried to create as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and I gave it a touch and I didn't think too much about it and I pulled."
Chelsea won 1-0 in the first half after the 25th minute goal scored by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
Blue's midfielder went from heel to heel at Mateo Kovacic before splashing away near the midfield and shooting in the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick midfield pass.
So he performed a beautiful pass that brought Hazard into the area.
Hazard overcame the defence and finished on the second pole with a left goal over Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has reached 832, the agency in charge of disaster management in the country said on Sunday morning.
Numerous people were reported trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings following the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that struck the country on Friday and generated waves up to 6 meters high, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, has been littered with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after woman is stabbed to death
A murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 a.m. with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called on people who may have seen or heard something in the area to make contact.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is just beginning but I would like to appeal to anyone in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard something suspicious and invite them to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, particularly taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on dashcam, to contact us because they may have very important information for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found is a resident of Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, some friends claiming to know the woman arrived at the crime scene to ask questions about the location of the discovery this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and police have stated that they are currently informing the family members of the victim.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment but was told by police that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents have been told it will take hours before they are allowed to return.
A police officer told a man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene in tears.
He keeps saying "it's terrible."
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were inside the demarcated area and another van was just outside.
Several agents were within the demarcated area controlling the apartment building.
Anyone who has information about it is invited to contact the company, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 indicating register 247 of September 30.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell becomes the last monument hit by the wave of "history rewrite"
His estrangement would be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects of England performed by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Crick's proposal a "crazy" and an "attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in light of the current debate over the removal of the statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster became a target.
Iconoclasm during the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor conducted by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Cromwell's magnificent portrayal of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe should still be celebrated.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, a defender of parliament from outside pressures, in his case of course of the monarchy.
Whether this is an extremely accurate representation is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-17th century conflict has defined the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable figure representing a part of that fracture.
His achievements as Lord Protector must be celebrated and commemorated."
Pig killer rips off a Chinese farmer by killing him
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China according to local media reports.
The man, identified only with the surname "Yuan", was found dead with a severed artery, covered in blood near a pigsty at Liupanshui Market in Guizhou Province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines to pigs on a farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining in Qinghai Province, China.
He is reported to have traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found that the door of a nearby pigsty was open.
He claimed that there was a large male pig in the pigsty with blood on its snout.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the 250 kg pig had torn up the breeder, according to the statements.
"My cousin's legs were covered in blood and mauled," said the cousin identified with the surname "Wu," as reported in the Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance videos showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking other people, while police gather evidence at the crime scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating a refund for the farmer's death.
Although they are rare, cases of attacks on humans by pigs have already been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300 kg pig nailed a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife managed to drive the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a breeder from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as a "catalyst."
"They just want to play.
They are playful, very curious .... they do not want to do harm.
Just show them the right amount of respect," he explained.
The aftermath of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy heavy rains to the southwest of the US
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is losing strength as it moves on the coldest waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains to northern Mexico and the U.S. southwest coast in the coming days.
Rosa recorded winds of up to 138 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane, at 5 ET on Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a bagging is forming on the Pacific Ocean and moving east toward the west coast of the US. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm, she will begin to push strong tropical moisture northwards, into the southwestern part of the US.
Rosa will bring up to 25 cm of rain to some areas of Mexico during the day on Monday.
Hence, tropical moisture in contact with the approaching bagging will create heavy and vast rainfall in the southwestern area in the coming days.
At the local level, 2 to 10 cm of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates to reach 2.5 to 7.5 cm per hour at some points, particularly in the areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of 2.5 to 10 cm is expected in some areas of the southwest, particularly over much of Arizona.
Sudden flooding with rapidly worsening conditions is possible due to the widespread nature of tropical rains.
It is strongly advised not to venture into the desert on foot in the presence of the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains could make river canyons full and thunderstorms will bring wind to puffs and lift dust.
The approaching looting will cause heavy rain locally on part of the southern California coast.
Precipitation of more than 1 cm will be possible, which could cause limited debris flows and slippery roadways.
This would be the region's first precipitation in the wet season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona in late Sunday and early Monday, before the rains become more extensive late Monday and early Tuesday.
Heavy rains will drop on the Four Corners on Tuesday to last until Wednesday.
In October, there will be strong fluctuations in temperatures over the US as the Arctic cools, but the tropics will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to major temperature changes over short distances.
An outstanding example of significant temperature differences in the central US will be recorded on Sunday.
There will be a nearly 20-degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the residual heat of the summer will try to increase and expand again.
A warm start to October is expected for much of the central and eastern USA, with 26 °C from the Southern Plains to areas in the northeast.
New York will be able to reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecasts indicate strong odds of above-average temperatures for the eastern US through the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
Over 20 million people followed on Thursday on six television networks the compelling deposition by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault that would take place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continues, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming for a last-minute turnaround Friday: an agreement devised by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford informed the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is 100% certain that Kavanaugh grazed her intoxicated and tried to strip her during a high school party.
Kavanaugh, during an inflamed deposition, claimed to be 100% certain that this did not happen.
More than 20.4 million people indicated by Nielsen on Friday are likely to have followed the deposition.
The company was calculating the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for the other networks that broadcast it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has a hard time counting viewers who follow programs in offices.
To put it all in perspective, it is an audience similar to that for a football playoff game or Oscar awards.
Fox News Channel, whose pundits strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, led all networks, averaging 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was the second network with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has recorded 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement stating that it would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, Flake was picked up by CNN and CBS operators on Friday morning while being insulted by demonstrators while trying to take an elevator to a Justice Commission hearing.
He remained with his eyes down for several minutes while being reprimanded and broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told "She has the power while a lot of women are powerless."
Flake claimed that his office had issued the statement and stated, before the elevator closed, that he would have other things to say during the committee hearing.
All cable networks and broadcasters broadcast live a few hours later, when the Justice Commission voted to present Kavanaugh's nomination to the entire senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the certainty that the FBI would analyze the allegations against the candidate over the next week, as requested by minority Democrats.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Following a conversation with Coons and other senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was important, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "making policy" on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her programs of letting the European Union "face politics" with Britain's future and jeopardize the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, 29 September 2018.
In another interview alongside the one with the prime minister on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson launched his attack on his so-called Chequers Brexit deal, stating that a proposal that Britain and the EU must collect their respective duties is "absolutely ridiculous"
Wayde Sims Murder: Police Arrest Suspect of LSU Player Dyteon Simpson's Death
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and taken to prison on second-degree murder charges, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Authorities released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the crime scene and claimed to have detected Simpson's DNA on them, reports CBS-affiliated WAFB television station.
After questioning Simpson, police claimed that the suspect admitted to accidentally shooting Wayde.
The bail was set at $350,000, the defense attorney said.
The East Baton Rouge coroner's office issued a preliminary report on Friday, stating that the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the neck.
The department acknowledged the merit of the Louisiana State Police fugitive task force, the police forensics lab, Southern University police, and the area's citizens who assisted in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The LSU athletic director thanked the area law enforcement agencies for their commitment and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20.
The 198 cm striker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
Last season the player averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade stated that the team is "shocked" and "in shock" at Wayde's death.
"That's what you worry about at all times," Wade said.
Volcano sprinkles with ash Mexico City
Ash escaping from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans Saturday to keep away from the volcano, after activity had increased in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash had been recorded in 24 hours.
The center was controlling the different rhombuses and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of cars in Mexico City's headquarters such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in activity at the volcano located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists on the eve of the independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with police riot squads and thousands joined opposition demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the controversial Catalan vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists thwarted by riot police targeted policemen with eggs and threw powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets that usually overflow with tourists.
There were further fights over the course of the day with policemen who resorted to batons to contain the fight.
For several hours the groups of independentists who sang "We will not forget, we will not forgive" confronted the Unionist demonstrators who shouted "Long live Spain."
The local press reported that fourteen people had to receive treatment for minor injuries received during the demonstrations.
Tension remains high in the independence region a year after the October 1 referendum considered illegal by the Madrid government but recognized by Catalan separatists.
Voters had voted with an overwhelming majority for independence, although turnout was low, and Catalans opposed to secession had largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the referendum that was taking place at polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
The independence groups had camped on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to follow an alternative route.
Narcis Termes, 68, is an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife and claimed that he no longer had any hope of Catalonia becoming independent.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents weeping with joy over the chance to vote, but now everything is blocked," he explained.
Despite having achieved a fundamental though measurable victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many of the movement's best-known leaders finding themselves in voluntary exile or jail awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and in the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded with her phone the protest in support of the police, said the conflict was fueled by politicians from the two factions.
"The situation is getting more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison awaiting trial since the end of last year, announced that he will run for the European Parliament elections next year.
"Presenting myself as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the involution of democratic values and repression by the Spanish government," he explained.
Londonderry: men arrested after ramming a house with car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after they repeatedly slammed into a Londonderry house with a car.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday, at approximately 7:30 p.m. BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused to the gates and the building itself.
It is also possible that the machine was hit with a crossbow at some point.
Menga's attack marks Livingston's 1-0 victory against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingston marked the win
Livingston already promoted left the Rangers stunned by relegating Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 games as Ibrox club manager.
Dolly Menga's goal made a difference as Gary Holt's team moved to the second division with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team is therefore without a win away from home in the Premiership this season and will have to face next Sunday the first in the Hearts standings, from which they separate 8 points.
On Thursday, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues his series of wins in the division by remaining undefeated for six games, with Coach Holt yet to see a defeat since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston wastes opportunity on incisive guests
Holt's team should have been ahead well before the goal, with their immediacy causing the Rangers many problems.
Scott Robinson broke through but dragged his action in front of the door mirror and Alan Lithgow could only kick out the door after entering to meet Craig Halkett's header on the other side of the door.
The guests were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could have put visitors in trouble with placed kicks.
And that was how the crucial goal was achieved.
Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston found an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson managed to switch to Menga, who could score from the center of the area.
Until that time, Rangers had dominated ball possession but the host team's defense had proved impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had not had to worry too much,
This pattern was maintained during the second half, although Alfredo Morelos engaged Kelly in a parade.
Scott Pittman saw his goal attempt stopped by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor's feet and Lithgow made a shot out of another Livingston game scheme.
Crosses followed each other in the Livingston area and were continuously neutralized, while two penalty requests, after Halkett's contrast with substitute Glenn Middleton and one for foul play, were rejected.
A "phenomenal" performance from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
Until the last player, they were exceptional, continuing to exceed expectations along this exceptional trajectory.
Their style of play and collaborators have changed very little since their return to the top flight, but Holt must be given a lot of credit for the way he has been able to spur the team since his arrival.
He's had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, leading a masterfully organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in trouble throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, were uninspired.
Despite the excellent performance at times with Gerrard, in this case they fell well below those standards.
The last pass was missed - only once they managed to penetrate the opponent's area - and it can be considered a wake-up call for Rangers, who are in the middle of the standings.
Erdogan received with mixed reactions in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (September 29) during the breakfast meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at extending relations between NATO allies.
They clashed over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's access to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne for the inauguration of a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population group outside of Turkey.
Police reasoned with security reasons for the intervention to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from meeting in front of the mosque, but many supporters showed up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, including numerous Kurds, made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The protests mirror the dissent provoked by a visitor considered a hero by some Turks of Germany and called a despot by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The incident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the southeastern area of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived at the scene, but the man died instantly.
The incident occurred months after another cyclist died, hit by a road pirate on Childers Street, about a mile from where the incident occurred on Saturday.
Metropolitan Police said that authorities are working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roads were blocked and buses diverted and motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Guards Wounded During a Disorder
Six prison guards were injured during a disorder at the men's maximum security prison, the prison office said.
The riot broke out at Long Lartin men's maximum security prison in Worcestershire at about 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
The specialized agents "Tornado" were employed to handle the riot, which involves eight inmates and which is confined to a wing of the prison.
Officers were treated on site for minor injuries to the face.
A prison service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed to contain an incident currently underway at Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate the presence of violence in our prisons and all those responsible will be reported to the police and could be sentenced to a longer sentence in prison."
Long Lartin Prison is home to over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous delinquents in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had to receive hospital treatment following the attack of a convict.
And in October of last year, riot agents were called in to intervene in the prison to quell a violent riot during which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (which could benefit drought-affected areas)
It is rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but it is exactly what is likely to happen early next week when the last energies of Hurricane Rosa will cross the southwest desert, creating risks of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued sudden flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southwestern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching Monday in the evening with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service said in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or tropical depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border."
The most recent models of the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall between 5 and 10 cm, with isolated peaks of up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas in the southwestern area, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin will receive 2.5 to 5 cm of rainfall, with isolated peaks of up to 10 cm.
For areas unrelated to the risk of sudden flooding, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of this rainfall is likely to be positive as the southwestern area is currently experiencing a period of drought.
According to the Drought Monitoring Center, just over 40% of Arizona is going through a period of extreme drought, the second highest category," reported weather.com.
Initially the route of Hurricane Rosa will be able to land on land across the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, who still maintained hurricane strength on Sunday morning with winds at a top speed of 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is moving northward at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will collide with the coldest waters in the Pacific, thus losing power.
So it is expected to arrive in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or on the evening of Monday.
Rainfall on parts of Mexico could be intense, creating a high risk of flooding.
"We expect rainfall of between 7.5 cm and 15 cm from Baja California to the northwestern area of Sonora, with a maximum of 25 cm," reported weather.com.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday with a tropical depression state, to then head through Arizona and toward southern Utah late on Tuesday evening.
"The main risk that can be caused by Rosa or her drags are heavy rainfall in Baja California, in the northwestern area of Sonora and in the southwestern desert area of the US," the National Hurricane Center reported.
Such rains are expected to generate potentially lethal flash floods and debris flows in deserts, as well as landslides on mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton assault: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys at a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at about 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was transferred to the hospital, where he remains in "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds, and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police reported.
The authorities appealed to anyone who could have taken up what happened with their mobile phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffered for the badness and anger" of the Democratic party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic party," Trump said during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh "suffered for the badness and anger" of the Democratic party during the entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh deposed before Congress on Thursday, passionately and decisively denying Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual assault on her decades ago, when she was still a teenager.
Ford also deposed at the hearing defending himself from prosecution.
The President stated on Saturday that "the American people were able to observe Kavanaugh's extraordinary quality and courage" on that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most experienced law minds of our time, a jurist with unquestionable record in public service," he said in front of a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment by talking about the importance of Republican turnout in midterm elections.
"Five weeks from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I'm really busy," he said.
"For this lot strenuously for outstanding candidates."
Trump has stated that Democrats are committed to "resisting and hindering."
The first key procedural vote in the Senate for Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior assistant to GOP management told CNN.
Hundreds of people killed by Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, and death toll figures continue to rise
At least 384 people were killed, many wiped out by giant waves that fell on the beaches, when a large magnitude earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu on Friday, when waves as high as 6 metres (18 feet) fell on the beach at dusk, wiping out numerous people by killing them and destroying anything in their path.
The tsunami followed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still busy with their beach activities and did not run away immediately, thus turning into victims," Indonesian disaster control agency BNPB spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't just come, it dragged cars, logs, houses, hit anything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved offshore at a speed of 800 km/hour (497 miles/hour) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he explained.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster agency showed numerous buildings and shops destroyed, bridges twisted and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Evaluation and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the strong earthquake on Friday was nearly 200 times the power of the atomic bomb launched on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have boosted the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho stated that the casualties and damage could be greater along the coast of 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications "were totally paralyzed, with no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are over 300,000 people living in the area," the Red Cross said, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading for the areas involved.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could become even more serious," he said.
The agency was widely criticized Saturday for failing to inform that a tsunami had hit Palu, although authorities said the waves came at the time the alarm was sounded.
In an amateur video shared on social media, you hear a man on an upper floor of a building shouting agitated way to warn of the incoming tsunami people in the street below.
A few minutes later a wall of water fell on the beach, wiping out buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to authenticate the video immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a huge blackout that disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate relief interventions.
According to the authorities, the army has started sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but the displaced still need food and other necessities.
The city's airport was reopened only for relief and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo scheduled a visit to the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rises to over 800.
It's terrible.
Although Donggala's World Vision staff managed to safely reach the city of Palu, where employees took refuge under tarpaulin shelters in the courtyard of their office, on the way they encountered scenes of devastation, Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed," he said.
It's terrible.
Even as relief groups began the difficult operations of starting relief gears, there were some complaints that foreign relief workers with extensive knowledge were prevented from traveling to Palu.
Indonesian regulations state that funding, supplies and staff from abroad can only begin to arrive if the site of a calamity has been declared a national disaster area.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, "O.K., this is a national disaster," we can accept international assistance, but status has not yet been defined."
On the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, the friends and family of the missing still held hope that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that alleviate the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday a child was pulled out of a drain.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been stuck under the rubble for two days with her mother's body next door.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained for the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia two of the paragliding pilots missing.
Others among the people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
"As a veteran in the paragliding industry, I'm carrying my emotional load," he said.
Gendon recounted how, in the hours following the spread of news related to the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel within the paragliding community, he had desperately sent messages via WhatsApp to Palu's competitors, who were participating in the beach festival.
His messages, however, stopped at a single grey checkmark instead of two blue marks.
"I think it means the messages weren't delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during ATM refueling in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink operator who was restocking an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
The driver of the vehicle was emptying an ATM in the amusement center and preparing to deliver more money, said investigator Dennis McCarthy in the statement.
While busy, another man "came out behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag with the money for delivery.
Some witnesses identified several suspects fleeing the scene of the crime, according to the communiqué, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information regarding the identities of delinquents is invited to contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
On Saturday's announcement of the name change on Twitter, he wrote, "The person formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has long been nicknamed Ye and used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change took place before his participation on Saturday Night Live, where he will present his new album, Yandhi.
She replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her participation for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West previously stated that the word contains religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most widely used word in the Bible, and it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, talking about the title of his album with radio presenter Big Boy.
"So it's you, it's us, it's about us.
We went from Kanye, which means the only one, to simply Ye - the reflection of our goodness, our badness, our confusion, everything.
The album is more than the reflection of who we are."
He is just one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, also changed the name with or without hyphens and capital letters.
Mexico's President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed not to use the army against the civilian population
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use military force against the civilian population, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelolco Square to "never use the army to repress the Mexican people."
Soldiers had fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were taking hold across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by expanding monthly student subsidies and opening more public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training opportunities push young people towards criminal gangs.
US should double funding for AI
As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double its dedicated research funds in this field, says IA investor and operator Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow the announcements of several U.S. government groups regarding AI, although a formal AI strategy is generally lacking in the U.S.
Meanwhile, China presented its program last year: it aims to be the No. 1 country in AI innovation by 2030.
"Double the budget in AI research would be a good start considering that all other countries are far behind the US and we need a new revolution in AI," Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the chances of the next big success in the AI industry being achieved in the US, Lee told CNBC during an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the leading AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University worked on an AI system that beat the American Othello player with the highest score and later served as executive at Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese section of Google.
Lee recalled previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one will be held, in order to identify new visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get funding from the government, Lee said.
"It's not China that's taking away leaders in academia, it's multinationals," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired luminaries from universities to work on AI projects.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could help the U.S. boost its AI efforts.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to PhD students in AI," he explained.
The Chinese State Council published its program for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Foundation of Natural Sciences provides funding to those working in academic institutions, similar to how the National Foundation for Sciences and other government organizations distribute funds to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee explained.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, aimed at engaging industry partners and universities, and the White House announced the formation of a Special Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. system aimed at creating a National Commission for Security on Artificial Intelligence has not recorded activity for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on the possible change of the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve the decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked its applications for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which owns a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its neighbours del constitutes a claim on its territory and has vetoed Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments struck an agreement in June under the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe the change would harm the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic Macedonia population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has stated that he will not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign has generated doubts about the possibility that the turnout will reach the minimum of 50% necessary for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the referendum card is as follows: "It agrees with NATO and EU membership and with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is the price to be paid for Macedonia to be admitted to institutions such as the EU and NATO, one of the countries emerging from the collapse of the former Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the aegis of the European Union because that means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of members of parliament have stated that they will respect the result of the vote to make it final.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in vestment.
The state election commission stated that there were no reports of irregularities until 1:00 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16% compared to 34% at the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66% of registered voters had cast their vote.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe" said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted for the referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country that would open the door to NATO and European Union membership in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Parade in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and arranging the chairs in front of the tents mounted by those who want to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to go in head-on, not for the service door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have a dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China or Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He stated that a "yes" would be the "confirmation of our future."
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Analysis reported that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum - a percentage below the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Telma TV of Macedonia, indicated that 57% of respondents expected to go to vote on Sunday.
Of this 57%, 70% said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be valid, turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to pro-Western government policy since it took office in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero scores a goal avoiding Brighton's entire defence
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took care of Brighton's defence during the 2-0 win from Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his mark in the 65th minute look extremely easy.
The Argentine striker received a midfield pass at the start of the action.
He moved between three Brighton defenders before catapulting himself onto the free field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four green jerseys.
He humiliated a defender before overcoming several others on the edge of the Brighton area.
He then made a pass to the left, where he found Sterling.
The English striker used the first touch in the area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a right-hand shot into the net.
"Aguero is having foot problems," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about making him play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he managed to score at that moment."
But it was Sterling who initially led the Sky Blues in the fight for the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep on the Brighton field.
He sent a nice filter ball down his left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few steps before driving Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues striker threw the ball into the net just before leaving the field.
City will fight Hoffenheim in the Champions League group at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play dirty against the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to force another start.
But as always competitive Scherzer hopes he can pitch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, who retain an advantage of a game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies won at least one draw with a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday night, but still hope to get their first division title.
"Even if we play without goal, at least we can be able to throw knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team that will play will probably be at the highest level of all this year.
And why wouldn't I want to compete?"
The Nationals have yet to announce a first pitcher for Sunday, but are said to be inclined to let Scherzer pitch in similar situations.
Scherzer, who would be first pitcher for the 34th time, performed a launch session on Thursday and would be first pitcher on his normal Sunday off.
Washington's pitcher is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings for this season.
Trump at a rally in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of Republican turnout at the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is put on the line in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
It's one of the big, big ones -- I'm not a candidate but I'm really working hard for it and I'm fighting for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say, "Let's see this horrible group of radical Democrats, it's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power using whatever means necessary, you can see the meanness, the meanness.
They don't care who they can hit, who they have to overwhelm in order to get power and control back, because that's what they want, power and control and we're not going to give it to them."
Democrats, he said, have given themselves the mission of "resisting and obstructing."
"And it was possible to see him in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angry, mean, mean and liars."
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee with Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, setting off loud whistles in the audience.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did he leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, erm no, I'm waiting for a -- that was bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer very tolerant.
He doesn't tolerate people who say what they think.
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, it was no big surprise.
After all, they are the latest in a series of Labour members of parliament who have been told that they are not welcome, and all because they have said what they thought.
My fellow MP Joan Ryan received similar treatment because he resolutely opposed antisemitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for expressing my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically all topics similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday states that "we wish the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as a member of the parliament of the local Labour Party, Friday night meetings were exactly like this.
However, today this is not the tone of numerous meetings and the promise of a "kinder and courteous" policy has long been forgotten, if ever been remembered.
It has become increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and every opinion is judged on whether or not it is acceptable for party leadership.
All of this began shortly after Jeremy became the party leader, and colleagues with whom I previously thought I shared a similar political vision began to expect a turnaround on my part and that I would take positions that I would never accept, whether it was national security or the European single market.
When I speak in public - and it doesn't really matter what I say - they follow invectives of insults on social media calling for my withdrawal, denouncing the politics of the centre and telling me that I shouldn't be part of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I certainly know that I am luckier than other colleagues of mine since the comments directed at me tend to be political in nature.
I am admired by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a torrent of insults with a sexist or racist background every day but who do not allow themselves to be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of insult levels.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer in a tolerant environment and with every motion of no confidence or change in the rules of selection, the party shrinks.
In the last two years I have been given a lot of advice, inviting me to lower my head, not to express my views so openly and everything "would have gone well".
But that's not how I got into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as an alumnus, provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government that had left my secondary school class literally falling apart, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need it most, as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I never hid my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way bewildered by my political positions and points of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who promoted the motion on Friday, I would like to say that when the country is rushing towards a Brexit that will damage our households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy talking about my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But in reality the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of exclusion or political opportunity will stop me from acting in defense of what I believe to be your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: an undefeated Ayr climbs the leaderboard
Two late attempts may have somewhat unbalanced the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the triumph in this exceptionally fun game of Tennent's championship day.
They are now at the top of the standings, the only undefeated team out of ten.
In the end it was their superior defense, as well as their audacity, that drove the home team and coach Peter Murchied had every reason to be satisfied.
"We've been put to the test in our games so far and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy," the coach said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "You have to acknowledge Ayr's merit, they've made better use of the opportunities we have."
Grant Anderson's goal in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, but brought the Ayr to the lead, but a yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, released by the Warriors for the game, allowed Melrose to get the numbers to speak and Jason Baggot grabbed an unconverted goal.
Climo increased the Ayr's distance with a penalty before, right at half time, scoring and then converting a goal by himself to bring the Ayr to 17-5 at halftime.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's goal, converted by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
There was therefore a long interruption due to a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who was made to lie down, and upon restart, the Ayr jumped back to the lead thanks to a goal of Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
Ayr Blair Macpherson's replacement captain then received a yellow card and Melrose charged the extra man with an unconverted goal by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a moment of strong pressure.
However, the home team is back and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for a contrast to Climo without a ball, from the penalty touch, MacPherson scored a touch down behind the advancing melee of Ayr.
Climo converted, as he had already done almost since restarting, after Rowe had picked up football from the David Armstrong area and sent flanker Gregor Henry to look for the fifth goal of the home team.
Still Game star seeks new career in restaurant business
Ford Kieran, star of Still Game, decided to move to the hotel industry after the discovery that he had been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, which he writes and plays with long-time partner Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the next ninth series will also be the show's final one and it seems Kiernan is thinking about a life after Craiglang.
According to lists of official reports, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to make statements, though a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kiernan wished to get involved in Glasgow's "prosperous restaurant trade."
'"The sea is ours": landlocked Bolivia hopes a court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol a rigging-clad naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings display an ocean blue flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are decorated with the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
Recovering it is a duty."
Throughout landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the coast lost and now in Chile's hands after a bloody conflict over 19th-century resources is still alive, as is the desire to once again sail the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes have perhaps reached the highest level in decades, while Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and is obviously waiting for the result with a positive attitude," explained Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the International Court of Justice's ruling on large screens across the country, in the hope that the Hague court will welcome Bolivia's claim that - after decades of intermittent dialogue - Chile is obliged to negotiate, guaranteeing Bolivia an outlet to the sea of state competence.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president - who is facing a controversial re-election battle next year - has a lot at stake with Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to our return to the Pacific Ocean," he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly decide in favor of Bolivia and that little would change if it did.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no power to assign Chilean territory and has specified that it will not determine the result of possible negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice's ruling comes just six months after the final arguments indicates that the case ‘wasn't complicated,'" said Paz Z-rate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from advancing the Bolivian cause, the past four years may have delayed it.
"The problem of access to the sea has been monopolized by the current Bolivian administration," said Zarate.
Morale's belligerent rhetoric has sapped any remaining good intentions of Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be very difficult to maintain discussions following what has happened.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr?guez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was particularly quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will be able to "enjoy extraordinary opportunity in relations with Chile" and will have the opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual advantage," he explained.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - one of Latin America's most popular presidents - is using the maritime issue as a political escamotage.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The ruling is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea Says Nuclear Disarmament Won't Happen Without Confidence in US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that his nation will never carry out disarmament from nuclear weapons unless it can first trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to live up to the promises made during the Singapore summit between the two rival leaders.
His comments come at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be intent on restarting stalemate diplomatic negotiations after the Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri explains that it is an "illusion" that continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to an end to the Korean War can ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is wary of issuing the declaration without Pyongyang first carrying out major disarmament actions.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is willing to give up an arsenal that the country probably considers the only way to ensure its own security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows feature the latest trend in huge headdresses that will soon be in a high fashion store near you
If you want to expand your headgear collection or block the sun's rays completely, look no further.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a series of crazy oversized headdresses for their spring-summer 2019 collection that impressed the fashion world at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats made a furore on Instagram this summer and these designers sent their eye-catching creations to the catwalk.
Valentino's main piece was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with a broad feather-like edge that submerged the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jeweled watermelons, a witch's hat and even a pineapple - but they were not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of these colorful masks feature sewn lips and look more like a representation of Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation resembled a diving suit with a mask and goggles, while another looked like a loose ice cream cone.
And if you go on with the huge style statements, you're in luck.
Observatories of the style predict that the huge caps could reach all the way to you in the streets of high fashion.
The outsized hats come in the wake of "The Bomb", the straw hat with a more than a meter wide brim that has been seen on anyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat that invaded social media sent another huge creation to the catwalk: a straw beach bag almost as big as the costume model that carries it.
The burnt orange raffia bag, finished with raffia fringes and a white leather handle was the highlight of Jacquemus' La Riviera 2019 spring-summer collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I predict these big hats and beach bags will arrive in luxury stores next summer, as the stylist has made such a big impact that it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scottish independent schools maintain a curriculum of academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding exam results, reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other collective endeavors.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare pupils for later higher education, their chosen career and their place in the world as global citizens.
As an education sector capable of developing and adopting a personalized school curriculum, we observe that modern languages continue to be a popular and in demand subject within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message will reach his brain.
If you speak to him in his native language, the message will reach the heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone if we want to build trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's exams, we can observe that languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest success rates within independent schools.
68% of pupils who studied foreign languages got top marks.
The data, collected by the 74 member schools of the SCIS, showed that 72% of students got the highest grade with honors in Chinese, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish got the highest grade.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as core skills for children and young people, who will undoubtedly need them in the future.
Currently languages, as a choice of subject, are considered at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, technique and mathematics) in the study plans of independent institutes and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 found that the reasons employees indicated for the difficulty in filling jobs are attributable in 17% of cases to a lack of language skills.
For this reason language skills are becoming increasingly essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more job opportunities requiring knowledge of languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of your chosen career, if you are learning a second language, you will have an actual advantage in the future with a lifetime competence like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically lead a multilingual person to the front of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language at a sufficient level to maintain a conversation and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%.
That is why investing in language teaching is so important for today's children.
Knowledge of multiple languages, particularly those of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a viable job.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages taught.
Several schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK by looking to 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be several languages to choose from in independent schools, with the teaching staff specializing in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary for success, whatever their future.
It is not possible to deny at this time, in a global trading system, that languages continue to be fundamental to the country's future, and this must be reflected in teaching.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
The faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron to make Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans waiting for LeBron James to make his first entry with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in Sunday's pre-season opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it still has to be established for how many minutes he will play.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play for a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier in the week, James was asked what his plans were for the Lakers' six-game pre-season schedule.
"At this point in my career I don't need friendly matches to prepare for," he said.
The moment of the rally a West Virginia of Trump, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia at a barrage of rallies.
This is the first gathering of five planned for Trump in the coming week, including stops at friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote outstanding over his choice to fill the vacancy at the Supreme Court, Trump will seek to create support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress in the November elections.
What time will Trump's rally be and how can you follow him online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow Trump's rally in West Virginia online to via live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump will likely speak about this week's hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who have become tense due to allegations of sexual assault with an early Senate confirmation vote pending for a week as the FBI conducts the investigation.
But the main purpose of this series of rallies is to help the Republicans facing the November elections get some push.
So, President Trump's campaign said that these five rallies over the next week are aimed at "giving energy to volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they hold in the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies," according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so crucial to his program that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the campaign's busiest season," a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, asking to remain anonymous.
Scheduled for Wheeling's Wesbanco Arena, tonight's rally could draw supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract Pittsburgh media coverage," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, the state in which he had won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is trailing in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come and try to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: US team demonstrates courage to fight to keep hopes alive until Sunday's singles
After three one-way sessions, Saturday afternoon quartets may have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The motion of the swinging pendulum is a totally invented sporting concept in which players believe firmly and never as in races like these.
So where would the bike be now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so I'd say we're saving a bit of the bike," said Jordan Spieth as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe is ahead, of course, four points ahead with twelve others at stake.
The Americans feel they have a bit of wind in favor, as Spieth put it, and they have a lot to be hopeful about, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who have played together all day and each has three out of four points.
Spieth has been ruthless from tee to green and is setting an example.
The guttural screams of celebration became louder as the game continued, sinking a crucial putt to even the score at game four, when he and Thomas were down two points after two.
His putt that made them win the game at the 15 hole was greeted with a similar scream, the one that tells you that he believes the American team is not yet out of the race.
"You really have to go to great lengths to worry about your game," said Spieth.
That's all each of these players can do now.
18 holes to make a point.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the irrefutable version of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange but lovely couple is four by four and can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" were the only couple not to pull a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the ninth hole on Friday morning.
That path, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from the rowdy crowd consolidates the certainty that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and there would be no player more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari to seal an eventual European victory as the sun sets on Le Golf National.
Preferably both simultaneously on different holes.
However, European speeches of glory are still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson soon caught up with Sergio Garcia, the morning four-ball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogets on the first nine holes knocked the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole from which they could not even remotely climb up.
However, on Sunday there is no one to help you get out of your hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to observe closely because of the interactions between couples, the advice they give and do not give and the way the strategy can change at a time.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has gained an important advantage in the final day but this foursome session has shown that the USA team has the courage to fight, something some, particularly Stateside, have doubted.
Europe with a 10-6 lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a solid lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after finishing Saturday's fourball and foursome games with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired pair consisting of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a struggling Tiger Woods to bring the score so far to Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, in an attempt to retain the trophy lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated over an irregular American team in the morning fourballs, winning 3-1.
The USA held out most in the foursome, winning two games, but failed to make up for the disadvantage.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 singles games to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European starter to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend are the second pair to win four points from the opening four games in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they worked superbly to beat a downed Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even sharper 5&4.
Woods, who trailed for two games on Saturday, showed occasional flashes of brilliance but lost 19 of his 29 games in fourball and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursome to beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - number one and three on the world rankings.
However, Europe has not achieved all the results hoped for on a pleasant and breezy day southwest of Paris.
Three-time big winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a gritty 2&1 win over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the fourballs and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursomes, having lost the two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history did a team return from a four-point gap to the singles, though as a starter, Furyk's team only needs a draw to defend the trophy.
After being the second best for two days, however, a counterattack on Sunday appears to be out of their reach.
North Korea absolutely refuses to unilateral disarmament without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that maintaining sanctions was escalating the country's mistrust of the US, which in such circumstances would absolutely refuse to give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho said at the General Assembly of the world body that North Korea has taken "important goodwill measures" during the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any compliant response from the US," he said.
"Without trust in the US there will be no security in our national security and in such circumstances we absolutely refuse to disarm ourselves unilaterally first."
Although Ri re-used the well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" denuclearization with which North Korea would be rewarded on the basis of gradual actions, his statement was important because it did not reject unilateral denuclearization in full as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first-ever meeting between an incumbent U.S. president and a North Korean leader, held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work towards the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised North Korean security guarantees.
North Korea sought a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States said Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also opposed appeals to ease the strict international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The US insists on the need to 'have denuclearization first' and to increase the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve their purpose coercively and even oppose the 'declaration of the end of the war,'" Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an illusion of those who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions is increasing our distrust."
Ri did not refer to plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the US leader had announced at the UN earlier this week.
The minister stressed the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past 5 months and added: "If the counterpart to this denuclearization issue were South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not be dead at this point."
But even so, the tone of Ri's speech was noticeably different from last year's speech to the UN General Assembly, when he stated that it was inevitable to target U.S. territory with North Korea's missiles after "the president of evil" Trump had called Kim a "missile man" engaged in a suicide mission.
Before the United Nations Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, poured praise on Kim for his courage in embarking on the path of disarmament, but stated that much still needs to be done and that the sanctions will remain in place until North Korea is denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no deadline, stating that "if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
Cine and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for actions taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stated Thursday to the UN Security Council that: "Respect for the Security Council sanctions must continue forcefully and without exception until complete, final and proven denuclearization is achieved."
The Security Council unanimously supported sanctions against North Korea in 2006 in an effort to stifle funding for nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later stated that he would visit Pyongyang again the following month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but the last trip did not go well.
He departed Pyongyang in July stating that progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea had accused him of submitting "gangster demands."
North Korea had pledged during a meeting this month with Moon to dismantle a missile site and nuclear complex if the US adopted "compliant measures."
He stated that Kim had explained to him that the "conforming measures" he desired were security guarantees that Trump had committed himself to in Singapore and actions in the direction of normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has prompted all of its students to sleep more in an effort to counter the growing manly culture of studying for whole nights fed by caffeine.
One university scholar has found that students at the world's number one university often have no idea of the basic concepts of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he believes to be the first of its kind in the US.
He got the idea to start the course after a lecture he had given on the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
"In the end, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why am I only being told this now, when I am in my senior year?'
She said that no one had ever told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me very much," she told The Telegraph.
The course, first given this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep-related habits can help academic and athletic performance as well as improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director general of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students suffered from a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course involves a number of interactive activities.
In one section there is the image of a dormitory room, where students can select cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, and the importance of an evening routine.
In another section, participants are explained how long-term lack of sleep can increase the risks of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride linked to the "night off to study" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students lead to lack of sleep being a growing problem.
Sleep enough and with good quality sleep should be the students' "secret weapon" to combat stress, fatigue, anxiety, explained and even should serve to avoid fattening since lack of sleep brings the brain into starvation mode, making people constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student enrolled in the faculty of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, after taking one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He explained that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course aimed at the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to ask all graduate students to follow a similar study program before enrolling in this competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to set an alarm clock for when they need to go to bed, as well as for when they need to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can tilt the circadian rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal shoots down Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another bout of depression from outside the home with Dolly Menga's goal relegating Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
Ibrox's team were looking for the first away win since the February 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted Gerrard's second defeat in 18 coaching games by leaving his team eight points behind the runaway leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership, Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before halftime and a short-of-inspired Rangers line-up never seemed able to equalize.
As Ranger now drops to sixth, Livingston climbs to third, and only behind Hibernian for goal difference.
And there may be more problems coming for the Rangers after the lineman Calum Spence was treated for a head injury due to an object apparently thrown from the outside side.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which quickly overtook Ayr in the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, chose the usual line-up that tore a point at Hearts last week and would have been satisfied with the way his well-prepared team choked their opponents on each lap.
Rangers may have dominated by possession of the ball but Livingston has made better use of the balls at his disposal.
They could have scored just after two minutes when Menga's filter pass in the first half sent Scott Pittman forward to Allan McGregor's door but the midfielder wasted the opportunity.
A penalty kick deep in Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only pull to the side on the second pole.
Rangers took control but there seemed to be more hope than conviction in their game in the penalty area.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should be given a penalty at the end of the fifteenth following a clash with Steven Lawless but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's demands.
Rangers were only able to shoot twice at goal in the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not concerned by Lassana Coulibaly's header and a bland shot by Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's opening goal in the 34th minute may have been unexpected, no one can deny that he deserved it even just for his commitment.
Rangers again failed to handle a deep-seated Jacobs kick.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher filtered the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool in choosing Menga for a clean conclusion.
Gerrard acted during the interval replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the change had an almost immediate impact as the wing shoved a ball into Morelos, but the exceptional Kelly threw himself from the goal line to block it.
But Livingston continued to drag visitors exactly into the kind of game they love, with Lithgow and Halkett picking up one long ball after another.
Holt's team may have increased the gap in the final stages, but McGregor opposed to stopping Jacobs before Lithgow pulled out of the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton filed a final penalty claim after an intersection with Jacobs but Thomson denied it again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today and the CONTEGGIO continues... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that made the device known as the Geiger counter.
A staple of science ever since, the Geiger counter has also become a pillar of pop culture, when in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," played by those uncredible cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put on these earphones you can really feel the effects of atoms released by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Say it's just bursting now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, and altering them in the laboratory
They can then "see" a protein common to numerous types of cancer and are then reinjected
An experimental trial of this vaccine is yielding promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine who teaches her immune system to recognize malignant cells has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to numerous types of cancer, called HER2, and then such cells are injected again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
The HER2 protein "promotes the growth of different types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar process of extracting immune cells from patients to "teach" them how to target cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West throws himself into a pro-Trump diatribe wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) cap after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio during an episode of Saturday Night Live after a disconcerting performance during which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After playing her third song of the evening, called Ghost Town, during which she wore a MAGA cap, she started a slur against the Democrats and reiterated her support for Trump.
"A lot of times I talk to white people and they say, "How do you like Trump, he's a racist!"
Well, if I was worried about racism I would have left America a long time ago," he explained.
The SNL began the show with a scene starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee against allegations of sexual assault filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of West's Filipino was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to tease West with the release.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had a bad time backstage because of his headdress.
"They bullied me backstage.
I was told ‘don't go out in that cap on.'
They bullied me!
And so they told me I was an outcast," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, "Do you want to see the submerged place?" and said, "I would wear the Superman cloak because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go on?
Try love."
His comments generated whistles at least twice from the audience and the SNL cast members seemed embarrassed, Variety said, with one person telling the journal, "A deadly silence has fallen on the studio."
West had been invited as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West baffled many with a performance of the song I Love it, disguised as Perrier's bottle.
West received support from the head of the TPUSA conservative group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR KEEPING HEAD TO THE MASS."
But show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "what she is and this is just wonderful."
"But I have chosen NOT to reward someone (buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art") who I believe is embracing a vomitable ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so are we," he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he is now "the person formerly known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and is following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper friend, Snoop Dogg called himself Snoop Lion and of course the missing music legend Prince, who had changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Throne of Swords.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, stating that such on-screen soils often make the kids believe they must be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he felt that "something went wrong" and reflected on how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the era of the "MeToo".
Kit, who recently married 31-year-old Game of Thrones co-star, has admitted to worrying a lot about this issue.
'Personally I'm worried, a lot at the moment - what was our mistake with masculinity?' he said.
'What have we taught men as they grew up in terms of the problem we observe now?'
Kit believes that television may be partially responsible for increasing toxic masculinity due to its extremely masculine characters.
He continued: 'What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the streets, that makes kids think they have to be in this certain way of being a man?
I think this is one of the great dilemmas of our time - how can we change things?
Because obviously something went wrong for the young people.'
During the interview he also admitted that he will not play any prequels or sequels to Game of Thrones once the series ends next summer, stating that he "has finished with battlefields and horses".
Starting in November, Kit will play the lead role in Sam Shepard's True West revival, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he considers the meeting with his wife Rose the best thing that happened with Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife during this series, so she gave me in this sense my future family, and my life from now on," he explained.
Rose played Ygritte, the object of Jon Snow's love, the character of Kit, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens affected by HIV and AIDS.
Over 820,000 people are affected by these diseases, according to health authorities sources.
About 40,000 new cases were reported as early as the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases are due to sexual transmission, which marks a change from the past.
In some regions of China, HIV has spread in the past as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has shrunk to almost zero, according to Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an urgent issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
Because of the country's traditional values, some studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are caused by inadequate protections during sexual intercourse within such relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to anti-HIV drugs as part of its commitment to managing the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked GOP senators' data, and speaks of "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
On Saturday, the U.S. Congresswoman denounced allegations directed at a member of her staff regarding the publication of personal information of three U.S. Republican senators in legislators' Wikipedia pages.
The Democratic congresswoman in Los Angeles said the statements were fomented by opinionists and "ultra-right wing" websites.
"Lies, lies and still despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information would include the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was posted online on Thursday, released by an anonymous Capitol judge during a hearing of a panel of experts on allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office and released information about a Waters staff member.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been jeopardized as a result of these false and biased allegations, was in no way responsible for the escape of that information.
This baseless accusation is totally false and an absolute lie."
Waters' claim quickly generated online criticism from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is furious," Fleischer wrote.
"This implies that he does not have the character to be a Member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven't done, they don't have to get angry.
It doesn't have to be provocative.
You must not question the accuser's reasons.
It must remain calm and serene."
Fleischer seemed to liken Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by detractors of sounding too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to dismiss Waters in the midterm election, voiced his views on Twitter.
"Enormous if confirmed," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office alerted "the competent authorities and law enforcement agencies to these tendentious claims.
"We will see to it that those responsible are exposed," he continued, "and that they have to answer for all their dangerous and harmful actions for all members of my staff."
Johnny English review strikes again - spy parody with an undersized Rowan Atkinson
It has now become customary to search for references to Brexit in every new film with a British twist and this seems applicable to this revival of Johnny English's action comedy, which began in 2003 and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English - The Rebirth.
The veiled self-irony on the subject of how crappy we do will be the nation's new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with a rubber face and eyes out of orbit got his license to mess things up for the second time - and his name indicates more than anything that it is a comic creation developed for countries of non-English-speaking movie viewers.
Obviously it is the silly secret agent who despite his strange claims to glamour has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr Bean and a pinch of that guy who contributed a single note to the theme moments of Glory of the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
It is a character based initially on the mysterious international traveler and man Atkinson once played in Barclaycard's now-forgotten television ads, which left chaos behind.
There are one or two nice moments in this latest release of Johnny English.
I liked Johnny English approaching the helicopter wearing medieval armor and the propellers briefly lashing out at his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is evident, but humor seems quite undersized and oddly superfluous, particularly now that brands of "serious" films like 007 and Mission Impossible now offer comedy as an ingredient.
Humour seems to be directed at children instead of adults and for me Johnny English's crazy misadventures are not as original and targeted as the gags of Atkinson's silent films when he plays Mr Bean.
The unchanging topical premise now is the fact that Britain is in serious danger.
A computer hacker has infiltrated the supersecret web network of British spies, revealing the identities of all British agents in the field, to the dismay of the agent in charge, a unfortunately very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that makes the pot overflow for a presumptuous and tormented prime minister, who is already suffering a meltdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her best with this Teresa-like character May but there is not much to work on in the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that every single active spy has been compromised and that she will have to recall someone who has already retired.
And this means that clumsy Johnny English, who now works as a school manager in a chic establishment, but who also gives off-the-books lessons on how to be an undercover agent: here you can appreciate some nice gags, when English offers a School of Rock spying course.
English is beaten back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunites with his former suffering partner Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, married to a submarine commander, a high society girl role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So the Batman and Robin of the disasters for Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, to meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling dangerously into the network of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous adventures: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they unleash hell by sneaking underground onto Volta's luxury yacht and English creates pure anarchy while trying to use a virtual reality mask to become familiar with the interior of Volta's house.
All the scenes are certainly designed for the last sequence, but however graceful and exuberant, there is quite a bit of children's TV throughout the story.
The whole thing is quite modest.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: couldn't the British film industry assign Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is drawing up a plan so that the British can work four days a week but be paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical program that would allow British citizens to work four days a week, while being paid for five.
The party would like the main companies to transfer the savings obtained with the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to the workers by offering them an extra day's rest.
In this way employees could enjoy a three-day weekend, keeping the same pay.
Some sources have stated that the idea would be compatible with the party's economic program and plans to tilt the country in favor of workers.
The move to a four-day day was endorsed by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party member told The Sunday Times: "By the end of the year, a policy review is expected to be announced."
"It won't happen overnight, but a four-day work week is an aspiration in line with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of workers, as well as its overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to endorse such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week as part of the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration does not enjoy the unanimous support of the Labour Party at the time.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day work week is not part of the party's political line and is not currently the subject of discussion."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economic field.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "faceless managers" and "speculators" in businesses for public services.
The shadow chancellor's plans also imply that the current shareholders of the water distribution companies may not recover their entire stock package, since the Labour government could implement "deductions" on the basis of behaviour considered unlawful.
It also confirmed plans to place employees on corporate boards and create inclusive participation funds, so as to transfer 10 percent of private sector companies' net worth to employees, who end up pocketing annual dividends of up to $500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote for his appointment to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and raises questions as to whether or not the government agency's findings can influence any of the Republican senators in providing their support.
In an interview that airs Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it was possible for the FBI to bring to light something that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said it on my way to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after what had happened, that that charge had come up, I said, ‘Did you do that?'
He was resolute, determined, unequivocal."
Graham's vote, however, seems carved into the rock.
"I have clear ideas about Brett Kavanaugh and they could resist a bomb-proof charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett energetically denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And whoever you nominate couldn't prove it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features a remarkable roster of stars and has an equally remarkable mission: to end poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to Central Park's Great Lawn not only to enjoy performances such as those by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the real purpose of the event, to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert audience had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or any other significant way that would help raise awareness about their purpose of eradicating poverty.
But, exactly, how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been now that there are 12 years left to achieve its intended purpose?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really a genuine way of persuading people to call for action, or is it just another example of the so-called "clicktivism"- people who feel like they really make a difference by simply signing an online petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, used for a bunch of different purposes.
He states that these actions have helped urge world leaders to announce commitments and policies amounting to more than $37 billion, intended to influence, by 2030, the lives of more than 2.25 billion people.
In the early 2018 years, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from their actions, of which they have already been shelled out or used as funds at least $10 billion.
The group estimates that so far protected capital funds have had a direct impact on some 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based investor and performer partnership committed to "helping children grow to their full potential", with a promise to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens just like you, we can make social injustice or malnutrition a footnote in history," said The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions have been put in place appealing to the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government has announced the grant of funds for a project, the Power of Nutrition, that will reach 5 million women and children through interventions in favor of nutrition.
In response to one of the FAQs on their website, which asked, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded: "It will be a long and arduous path - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon?e are some of those who will perform at this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use Navy to implement "a blockade" and hamper Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
Washington may, "if necessary," use its Navy to prevent Russian energy sources from being available on the market, including that of the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke has alleged that Russian involvement in Syria - particularly, where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East lies in the fact that they want to negotiate for energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern hub of Europe," he said.
And, according to officials, there are means and ways to cope with it.
"The United States has the opportunity, thanks to the Navy, to ensure that the nautical routes remain open and, if necessary, to implement a naval blockade, so that their energy is not placed on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed attendees at the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization calling itself the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to negotiations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are, in fact, the same thing.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to leverage and replace fuels," he said, referring to Russia as "little versatile," with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
The statements were made because the Trump administration was involved in a mission to boost the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe, and replace Russia, an option that is by far the cheapest for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, try to convince Germany to pull out of Nord Stream 2, an "inappropriate" pipeline project that, according to Trump, has made Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly pointed out that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, designed to double the capacity of the existing one to 110 billion cubic meters, is a project of a purely economic nature.
The Kremlin objects that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is driven simply by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak, following a meeting in September in Moscow with Rick Perry, U.S. Secretary of Energy.
The US stance sparked Germany's negative reaction, which reconfirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's flagship organization for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to stay out of the European Union's energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I see as a big problem the fact that a third state interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take "serious consideration" of running for President in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she will "seriously consider" running for president following the midterm elections.
At a city assembly in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was contemplating running for office.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and put our battered government right, and that implies having a woman at the top," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president."
During the city assembly Warren said his about President Donald Trump, declaring that he was "bringing this country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren was explicit in criticizing Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, whom he appointed to the Supreme Court.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, "It's only natural that we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
A poll published Thursday, however, showed that a majority of Warren's own voters do not believe he should run in 2020.
58 percent of "likely" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
32% supported such a candidacy.
The poll yielded greater support for a candidacy by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential candidacy and 48 percent opposing it.
Other names of high-profile Democrats that were discussed regarding a potential candidacy in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he will make an official decision by January, as reported by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September
He was arrested and charged with a domestic violence case on Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he's going through after he's back, I can relate to other families experiencing the consequences of post-traumatic stress disorders and some of the injuries our soldiers are returning with," he told the public at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said, of his son and other war veterans, "they come back a little different, hardened, wondering if there is that respect for which their fellow soldiers and pilots, and every other member of the army, have consecrated themselves to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assault and domestic violence on a woman, which interferes with a report of domestic violence and possession of a firearm under narcotics, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States and the District of Columbia support challenge for new asylum policies
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal battle against a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the District of Columbia on Friday filed an amicus curiae memoir in Washington to support an asylum seeker who disputed that policy, as reported by NBC News.
The plaintiff's full name in the Grace v. Sessions appeal that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She stated that her partner "and her violent gang member children" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was placed in detention in Texas.
Prosecutors supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum candidates in the United States, as nations facing rampant gang and domestic violence problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a decision made in 2014 by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed an asylum application to undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence.
On Friday, District Attorney General Karl Racine stated that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal, and international law."
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be judged on the basis of particular events and circumstances of the request, and such a ban violates that principle," the amicus curiae memo states.
Within the memory, prosecutors also objected that the policy banning immigrants from entering harms the U.S. economy, stating the clear likelihood that they will become entrepreneurs and "provide needed labor".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
"Asylum is accessible to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality, membership of certain social groups or for political opinion," Sessions said on June 11, as part of the policy announcement.
Kindergarten was never meant to alleviate every problem -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate recovery attempts in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation became increasingly desperate.
"There's a lot of tension," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she comforted her feverish little baby at an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"At any moment there is an ambulance carrying bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, rummaging through their soaking personal belongings, in an attempt to recover anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were overflowing.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a shoulder and back fracture, rested outside at the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outside due to continuous strong aftershocks.
His eyes filled with tears as he recounted the feeling of the violent earthquake shaking the room he shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor of a hotel.
"There was no time to save us.
"I was crushed in the rubble of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that her family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
US ambassador accuses China of "doing bullies" with "advertising propaganda"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper, advertising the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to propagandize.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the announcement paid for by the China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the highest-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. congressional election on November 6, an accusation China rejects.
Trump's allegation that Beijing was trying to meddle in the U.S. election underscored what U.S. officials reported to Reuters was a new phase of an escalating campaign by Washington to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in an escalating trade war that has seen them adjust their duties to their respective imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to target exporters to states like Iowa, who supported Trump's Republican Party, as Chinese and US experts stated.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and formerly longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion article in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now augments those bullying by publishing advertising in our free newspapers."
"In disseminating its propaganda, the Chinese government is using America's beloved tradition of free speech and press, placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"Viceversa, in the newsstand on the street here in Beijing you will find few dissenting voices and you will not see any real reflection of the disparate views that the Chinese population could have on China's problematic economic trajectory, since the media are under the firm fist of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most distinguished newspapers has eluded the offer to publish" his article, though he did not state what newspaper it is.
Republicans are alienating female electorate before midterm elections with Kavanaugh case, analysts warn
Given that many top Republicans defend the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court and stand on his side in facing various allegations of sexual harassment, analysts have reported that a negative reaction will be seen, especially by women, during future midterm elections.
The agitation in this regard has been extremely high, and many Republicans have already officially shown that they want to continue with a vote.
"You can't withdraw these things," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute insistence on an FBI investigation would be enough to appease angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it either tomorrow or November," said on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper, Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokesperson for the MoveOn progressive group.
On Friday morning, protesters repeated the slogan "November is coming!" during their protest in the Senate room, when Republicans controlling the Judicial Commission chose to continue with Kavanaugh's candidacy despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by Mic.
"Democrats' enthusiasm and motivation are skyrocketing," Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
"People say they were already tall; it's true.
But they could be higher, especially among the undecided electricians in the suburbs and the young voters, between the ages of 18 and 29, who often do not vote despite not liking the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony, which provided details of his sexual harassment allegations against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts had speculated that a negative reaction could have occurred if the Republicans continued with the confirmation.
"For the GOP it has become a confusing whole," Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about voting for the committee, the final committee, or whether Kavanaugh will be benched, it's also about how the Republicans handled the situation and how they treated it," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told news channel.
In any case, Americans seem to be somewhat divided between the person to believe in as a result of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a lower percentage in favor of the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents surely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say they certainly or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh likely or definitely lied in the course of his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently conducting investigations into Ford's allegations, as well as at least one of the other accusers, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Last week Ford testified under oath, before the Senate Judiciary Committee, that Kavanaugh assaulted her in a state of intoxication when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate exposed her genitalia at a party during her studies at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that seeks to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project by the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that draws its origins from Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what people will have access to and what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is "dominating the world".
"We have to do it now," he said of the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "online personal data storage" or a POD.
It can include contact lists, to-dos, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It's as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available on one browser and at the same time.
The uniqueness of the online personal data warehouse is that it is completely up to the user who can have access to what type of information.
The company calls it "personal enhancement through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to John Bruce, CEO of the company, is to bring in adequate resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, some developers on the staff hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology programmers around the world will be able to bring their decentralized apps to life using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team will not tell "Facebook and Google whether or not to introduce a full change where their business models are completely undone overnight.
"We're not asking their permission."
In a Medium post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to procure commercial energy and an ecosystem that help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built from Solid."
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has represented an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even after the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Manager of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Commemorated the clergyman of the Great War with Victoria Cross
The only Church of England clergyman to be awarded a Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter was commemorated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel, Reverend Bernard Vann, gained recognition on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew he had achieved the highest level of British military honor.
On Saturday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandchildren inaugurated a memorial plate.
One of his nephews, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" that the stone would be inaugurated exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning prowess.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a very thick fog, under the heavy fire of the camp and the war machines".
He then hurried to the line of fire and with the "greatest gallantry" advanced the line before running with a single-handed cannon and landing three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never live up to and something that makes me more humble."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid down a wreath of flowers after the parade, conducted by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "felt really honored to play a role in the parade" and added "the value of a true hero is shown by the support that will be given to him by a lot of people."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead caught Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stayed up all night to watch the famous Bellator 206 only to see yourself denied the vision of the main event.
The program from San Jose included 13 fights, including the six on the main card, and was to be broadcast in the UK overnight, live on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to clash, viewers in the UK were stunned when Peppa Pig appeared on screen.
Some remained grounded after staying awake until the early hours of the morning specifically for combat.
On Twitter a fan described the move to the children's cartoon as "a kind of bad-tasting joke".
"The government's regulation provides that at six o'clock in the morning that content was no longer appropriate, so it had to move to children's programming," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communication, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig," "yes."
"The president of Bellator company, Scott Coker, has stated that they will work on programming to include viewers from the UK in the future.
"I feel that when I think about replay, I think we can probably find a solution," Coker said.
"But there's six o'clock in the morning on Sunday and we won't be able to find a solution before Sunday of our time zone, Monday for theirs.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it changed program a lot of messages came and nobody was friendly.
We were trying to solve the problem, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise you it won't happen next time.
We're going to limit it to five fights instead of six - as we normally do - and we've tried to get so much for the fans, and we've just discussed it.
It's an unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" because of sexuality
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to anyone because of his sexuality - but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he did not realize, until he got to secondary school, that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking on the first episode of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he had made his voice heard about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also stated that being a parent meant that he cared less about winning the Olympics.
The usual presenter of the longtime program, Kirsty Young, took a series of months off due to illness.
Presenting himself as an outcast in Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less than" anyone else as he grew up because "it wasn't socially acceptable that he liked both boys and girls."
He said, "Nowadays, the feeling of feeling less than, and feeling different, was the things that really gave me the strength and energy to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he wouldn't let anyone down if they happened to find out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze medalist at the Olympics has become a high-profile LGBT activist and used his face in this year's Australian Commonwealth Games to appeal to multiple countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he made his voice heard because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man - American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013- "took me by surprise".
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you pass so many at a young age" - he went to his first Olympics when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The two became parents in June, of a child named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was all about the fact that 'I had to win a gold medal,'" he said.
"You know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medalist is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father had not accepted the fact that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you're not going to be around here so you can be in the front row, Dad,'" he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and until he actually stopped and died, I hadn't yet realized he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics, winning bronze.
"I just knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life - swimming in front of a home audience in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song - Heather Small's Proud - which had a particular significance to him in preparing for the Olympics and still gives him goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Out of shape Mickelson benched in Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but will have to get back in shape to prevent it from becoming an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, playing in the two-year event for a record 12th time, was benched by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as was often the case with the United States, the five-time champion spent the day between being a cheerleader and working on his own game in the range, in hopes of correcting what torments him.
Having never been the strongest driver even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the difficult Le Golf National, where the uneven course regularly punishes the wrong shots.
And if the course itself isn't discouraging enough, Mickelson, in Sunday's ninth match, is up against the accurate British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, four points below the start of their 12 singles matches, start with a hot start, Mickelson's match could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his own man, not that he could say much else.
"He fully understood the role he had today, patted me on the shoulder, put his arm around me and said it will be ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of self-confidence.
He is a Hall of Famer and has added so much to teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't imagine playing two games.
I had imagined more, but this is the way it went and this is the way we thought it should go.
He wants to participate, just like anyone else."
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most games played in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never even remotely reflected the heights of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 games won, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk said his presence brought intangible assets to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to make fun of people, and he's a great guy to have in the boardroom," he explained.
"I also believe that the younger players enjoyed trying their hand at him this week, something that was fun to watch.
He's done a lot more than play."
The captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, knows that a good advantage may soon fade away
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows from experience that a considerable advantage in the individual matches of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable chase.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama in which the team, captained by Seve Ballesteros, despite a five-point gap from the Americans, came to the finish line with a minimal advantage, winning 141-2-131-2.
"I keep telling myself that we had a good lead at Valderrama, we had it at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama where we won, but by little," Bjorn said (pictured) after seeing the 2018 class win, Friday 5 to 3 and yesterday 10 to 6, at Le Golf National.
"So history will prove to me and my team that it's not over.
Tomorrow we have to give it our all.
You have to go out there and do everything the right way.
It's not over until the points are scored on the board.
Our goal is to try and win the trophy, and that's what we need to focus on.
I always focus on the 12 players on my team, but I know who's on the other side: the best golfers in the world."
Happy with the way his team competed in that difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never have outdone myself.
Tomorrow's is a different challenge.
Tomorrow is the turn of individual performances, which is something else.
It's nice to be there with a teammate when things go well, but when you're just your golfing skills are put to the test.
This is the message you need to convey to the players: tomorrow, you have to bring out the best of yourself.
Then, you forget about your partner because he too has to go there and bring out the best in himself."
Unlike Bjorn, counterpart Jim Furyk will look to his players for the best individual rather than team performance, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who collected three out of four points.
Furyk himself found himself on both sides in those great matches of the last day, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before losing to the European "Miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every single word," he commented in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, led his players in the lead on the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but we want to start immediately on the right foot as we did in Brookline and Medinah.
When the game starts to take a certain turn, the pressure increases in the intermediate games.
So we organize our training accordingly and classify the kids the way it seems appropriate, because tomorrow we will try to do a magic.
Thomas was given the task of leading the counteroffensive and facing Rory McIlroy in the top match with, in order, the other Europeans, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, in the first half.
"I chose this order because I think it covers the path to the end," Bjorn said of his selection for individual meetings.
Germany's new military ship has been postponed again
According to local media, the last frigate of the German Navy should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old military ships of the Cold War times, but there will not be at least until next year due to faulty systems and a surge in costs.
The Rheinland-Pfalz commission, the flagship of the new Baden-Wurttemberg-class frigates, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit which quotes a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but troubling issues following the delivery have plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wurttemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old ships of the Bremen class.
They will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer retention periods, in fact it should be possible to employ the new frigates up to two years away from national ports.
However, the constant delays imply that the innovative warships, which are said to allow Germany to project its power overseas, will already become obsolete when they enter service, notes the Die Zeit.
The unfortunate Type F-125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the builder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the restitution, but the German media noted a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that made the ship useless if employed on a combat mission.
The shortcomings in the software were particularly important as the Baden-Wurttemberg-class ships will be managed by a crew of about 120 sailors, just half of the staff of the older Bremen-class ships.
In addition, it has emerged that the ship weighs far too much, and this reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future updates.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice as heavy as the ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
Aside from faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project (including crew training) is also becoming an important issue.
It appears to have reached €3.1 billion (US$3.6 billion) from the initial €2.2 billion.
The problems involving the new frigates become of particular importance in the light of recent alarms concerning the reduction of German naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces, admitted that the Navy actually "scarces ships capable of being employed".
The official stated that the matter has worsened considerably over time, since the old unarmed ships have not been replaced by new ships.
His regret is that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wurttemberg class were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
New research at an estate in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use their eyesight to obtain food.
It is confided that the discoveries can shed light on the behavior of the only existing flying mammals and guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common bats and soprano, as well as brown mumps and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens, Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations using portable detectors.
Analysis of recorded sounds by an expert will determine the frequency of calls of bats and the way each species behaves.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed scaled-up picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to bats and how these are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of lawns, and how to best maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined considerably in the last century.
Bats are at risk due to construction and development work affecting trespoli and ruining habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a threat, as can flypaper and some chemical treatments of building materials, in addition to domestic cat attacks.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, due to their night-hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to grabbing a prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to detect insects and obstacles on their trajectory.
The NTS, responsible for taking care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
Ten qualified experts regularly conduct investigations, inspect the trespoles, and sometimes carry out rescues.
The organisation has even established Scotland's first bat reserve at the Threave estate, in the Dumfries and Galloway region, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The head of the estate, David Thompson, states that ownership is the ideal territory.
"Here in Threave we have a large area for bats," he said.
"We have the ancient buildings, many centuries-old trees and a good habitat.
But there's a lot about bats that we don't know yet, so the work we do here and in the other properties will help us understand more about their growth needs."
It stresses the importance of controlling bats before conducting maintenance within the properties as it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single maternal trestle could kill up to 400 females and young, perhaps wiping out an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass them, disturb them or destroy their trespoles.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
He stated, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations fare."
Ronaldo rejects rape allegations as lawyers sue German weekly
Cristiano Ronaldo labeled the rape allegations against him as "fake news", stating that people "want to advertise themselves" under his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel who published the allegations.
The Portuguese Juventus striker was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
Der Spiegel also made known Friday the charge of paying $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident.
In an Instagram video directed at his 142 million followers, in the hours following the allegations, Ronaldo, 33, cut off statements as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false," says the five-time Golden Ballon facing the camera.
"They want to advertise themselves through my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by making my name, but that's part of the game.
I am happy and everything is fine," added the footballer smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they call "unacceptable reporting of suspects on the private sphere."
Lawyer Christian Schertz stated that the footballer will seek compensation for "moral damages to the extent corresponding to the severity of the breach of privacy, considered, probably, one of the most serious of personal rights in recent years".
The fact would have taken place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga would return to the footballer's room, where he subjected her to anal violence, according to statements filed with the Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo would have gotten down on his knees after the incident by saying that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" disappointed by the "one percent".
The documents show that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sexual intercourse, but that this was consensual.
Mayorga also states that she went to the police and to the hospital, where her injuries were photographed, but later agreed to a conciliation agreement as she felt "terrorized by retaliation" and worried about the prospect of "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old now tries to overturn the deal, claiming she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the incident, and this summer he will join Italian Juventus on a €100 million contract.
Brexit: UK will forever regret car manufacturers' loss
The UK "could regret forever" the loss of its status as a world leader in car construction following Brexit, Industry Minister Greg Clark said.
He also added that he was "concerned" about Toyota UK's statements to the BBC about Britain's possible exit from the EU without an agreement and the resulting temporary shutdown of production at the Burnaston factory near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Minister Clark.
The Japanese automaker claims that border delays, in the case of a no-deal Brexit, could affect jobs.
The Burnaston factory, in which the Toyota Auris and Avensis are built, produced around 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% was exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will stop," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's General Manager in Burnaston.
It raises concerns in other British car manufacturers about leaving the EU without an agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, claims that after Brexit it will close its Mini plants in Oxford for a month.
The main concern concerns the risks in the supply chain encountered by manufacturers in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is operated on the basis of the "just in time" concept, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from British and European suppliers for custom cars.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement, border disruptions could occur that would cause delays and shortages of parties.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than a day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would be halted.
Minister Clark argues that Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely designed to avoid these border disruptions".
"We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that will allow us to not only enjoy the current success but to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The proof, not only from Toyota but also from other car manufacturers, is that we absolutely need to be able to continue what has been a very successful supply chain."
Toyota has not been able to say how long production could stop but, in the long run, warns that additional costs could reduce plant competitiveness and potentially jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is responsible for the plant's union delegates, declares that the workers are strongly concerned: "In my experience, once jobs are reduced, they are not reinstated anymore."
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, the White House says.
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be "one week late," as the dispute over Judge Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller who investigates Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump's advisers and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The possibility that Trump could fire the Deputy Minister of Justice, thus putting Mueller's independence at risk, fueled Washington's gossip for months.
Over the course of the month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about wearing a bug to record conversations with Trump and trying to remove the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House and was rumored to be stepping down.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at that time at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Wednesday.
Trump said he "would rather not" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid an overlap with the Senate Justice Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation of questions by the FBI against Kavanaugh, further delaying the final Senate vote.
On Sunday, Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "No date has been set, it could be this week, I guess he'll postpone another week considering everything that's going on with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and continue to update the press."
Some journalists may dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
Conductor Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the shortage of briefings was not due to an aversion to TV journalists "showing off", although he said, "I don't disagree with the fact that they show off."
He therefore suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press might be more frequent.
"The president holds more Questions and Answers sessions than any president before him," he said, adding without citing the evidence: "We checked the figures."
The briefings will still be there, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the questions directly to the president of the United States, it's much better than talking to me.
We try to do that, as in recent weeks, and this will replace briefings with the press and you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences are rare.
This week in New York the president perhaps proved the reason, making a free-wheeling, and at the same time bizarre, speech in front of a group of journalists.
Health Minister writes to Scottish NHS European workers to voice his Brexit concerns
The Health Minister wrote to EU staff working at the NHS of Scotland to express the country's gratitude and wish them to stay after Brexit.
Scottish Member of Parliament Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months in advance of the UK's exit from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to meet the costs of settled status applications for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Minister Freeman writes: "Throughout the summer there have been continued negotiations between the UK and the EU on Brexit, which will lead to the autumn decisions.
But the British Government has also prepared itself in the event of a no-deal scenario.
I know this is a time of great concern to all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate today my appreciation for the contribution made by all staff members, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and enhance the work of health services, benefitting the patients and communities to which we offer a service.
Scotland is certainly your home and we strongly desire you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie was rushed into surgery following a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers defender, Christion Abercrombie, underwent an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's game against the Vanderbilt Commodores in which the team lost 31 to 27, as reported by Mike Organ of The Tennessean newspaper.
Technical Manager Rod Reed told reporters that the incident that caused the injury occurred just before the interval.
"He approached the sidelines and passed out," Reed said.
First aid workers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen at the edge of the field, before placing him in a stretcher and taking him away for further investigation.
A Tennessee State executive reported to Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie underwent surgery at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no word yet on the type and extent of the damage" and that the Tennessee State is trying to figure out when he was injured.
Abercrombie, a sophomore, is in his first season with the Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had made a total of five tackles before leaving the game, which brought his season total to 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp duty for the purchase of property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp duty for the purchase of property in the UK and additional cash flow will be used to help the homeless, according to Labour's new plans
The maneuver will neutralise the success of Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters
The increase in stamp duty will be applied to taxpayers who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury plans to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp duty to purchase property in the UK and the additional cash flow will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The maneuver will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters with the promise of providing more affordable housing and higher incomes.
The increase in stamp duty will be applied to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and additional resources will be in support of the Government's initiative to combat the phenomenon of homelessness.
The surcharge, which adds to the current stamp duty, including the high levels introduced two years ago on second homes and buy-to-let properties (bought to be leased), could amount to more than 3%.
The Treasury Department expects the maneuver to raise up to 120 million pounds a year.
An estimated 13% of new construction in London is purchased by non-UK residents, raising prices and making it difficult for buyers of a first home to enter the real estate market.
Many of the richest areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost towns" due to the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the state.
The new policy comes a few weeks after Boris Johnson had requested a stamp duty cut to help younger people with the purchase of the first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping property prices high by hoarding land without using it and encouraged Prime Minister May to give up affordable housing quotas to settle British "real estate disgrace".
Congressman Corbyn has announced a slew of housing market reform proposals, including rent controls and the elimination of blameless evictions.
He also wants to give the council more power over the construction of the new properties.
Prime Minister May said: "Last year I said that I would be committed to re-establishing the British dream, and that is that life should be better for the new generations.
And that means restoring the real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it would not be fair if the purchase of a house were equally easy for people who do not reside in the UK and for foreign companies, as it is for British resident workers.
For so many people the dream of owning a home has become too distant and the dignity of the homeless remains a reality."
Jack Ross: "My highest aspiration is to lead Scotland"
Sunderland's Technical Director, Jack Ross, says that his "maximum aspiration" is to become Scotland's manager sooner or later.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is attracted by the challenge to raise the Northeast team which currently ranks third in League One, three points from the top.
He made it to the Stadium of Light this summer after being at the helm of St. Mirren during last season's Scottish Premiership.
"I wanted to play for my country as a footballer.
I've been in Serie B and that's it," Ross told the BBC Scottish programme Sportsound.
I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child and it's something I'll always remember.
However, this will only be possible if I succeed as a team manager."
Ross' predecessors at the helm of Sunderland were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach claims he feels no anxiety in following such important names, in an equally important team, having previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town's proposals.
"Success for me right now is measured by the ability to bring the team back to the Premier League."
Considering the structure and facilities of the club, we can say that it undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task, but I think I'll only succeed if I can get the team back up."
Ross's career as a manager started three years ago, after a stint as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and 15 months as a substitute Hearts coach.
He then helped Alloa save himself from relegation to the third level and brought St. Mirren from the brink of relegation to the title of champions of the Championship, the following season.
Ross claims he feels much more comfortable now than during his football career in the Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical teams.
"It was probably a real turning point," he recalls about the Alloa's direction.
"I really believed that the role of manager was meant for me, more than that of a player.
It seems strange because I worked well, made a living and had some good results.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things you have to deal with weekly.
I still face them in terms of stress and work pressure but management looks good.
I've always wanted to direct and now I do, I feel a lot quieter than I've ever been in my life."

According to one study, the right time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday
The summer heat wave brought more receipts to struggling English pubs and more concern to catering services.
Data shows that pubs and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, while restaurant receipts dropped 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of commercial consulting firm CGA, put the data together and commented: "The persistence of the sun and England's long stay at the World Cup meant that the month of July followed a similar path to that of June, when pubs were above 2.8 percent, while restaurants were hit harder.
The 1.8 percent slump in catering in June worsened in July.
The pubs and bars in which most people drink were the most solid, with a homogeneous increase higher than the decline in restaurants.
Pubs in which one eats have also suffered from the heat, though not in an excessive way like restaurateurs.
It seems that people simply wanted to go outside for a drink.
In managed pubs and bars, beverage sales rose 6.6 percent in the month, while food consumption dropped three percent."
Paul Newman, RSM's recreational and receptive industry analyst, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sporting events remains the main factor when it comes to selling in the retail market.
Unsurprisingly, restaurants continue to struggle, although a decline in annual sales of 4.8 percent will be particularly burdensome in addition to continued cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for restaurateurs and only time will tell if the more moderate temperatures, which we enjoyed in August, will give us a necessary truce."
Global sales growth across pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the decline in brand roll-outs.
The sales monitoring company Coffer Peach Tracker for British pubs, bars and restaurants brings together and analyzes performance data through 47 operating groups, with combined sales of over 9 billion pounds, and is the industry's leading company.
One in five children own secret social network accounts that they hide from their parents
A survey reveals that one in five children, some only 11 years old, have secret social network accounts that they hide from parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in "fake on Instagram" pages
The news has reinforced the fear that sexual content will be posted
20 percent of students said they have a "main" account to show to parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, create social network accounts that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in "fake on Instagram" accounts, a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has reinforced fears that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of students said they ran a "main" cleanup account to show their parents, while keeping a private one.
A mother who accidentally discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret site found a teenager urging others to "rape me".
The research, by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of private schools, showed that 40 percent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, and half of them admitted to keeping private accounts.
HMC Director Mike Buchanan said, "It's alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "voice for the athletes" at the board of Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle was elected a non-executive member of the board of Scottish Athletics during the national general assembly of the administrative body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated athlete in athletics and President Ian Beattie described the appointment as a great opportunity for those who manage the sport to take advantage of his extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys deep respect with the Scottish, British and world athletics community and we are confident that in Scotland athletics could gain a huge advantage by bringing it within the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I look forward to acting as the voice of the athletes and hope to be able to contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, winner of the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games and four Olympic Gold Medals, as well as currently a BBC columnist, found herself unable to walk following a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to the doctors only time could have told if I would recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work but I recovered completely, learned to walk again and today I move with agility!
I thank you for the messages of encouragement!".
A breast pump advertisement compares mothers and cows and divides opinion online
A breast pump company has split opinion online with an advertisement comparing nursing mothers and milking cows.
To mark the launch of what is termed the "world's first silent and wearable breast pump", consumer technology company Elvie launched an advertisement in the form of a playful music video to show the freedom to express themselves as mothers given by the new breast pump.
Four real mothers dance in a barn of cows on a track that includes songs like, "Yeah, I'm milking myself but I don't have a thing" and "If I hadn't noticed, these aren't breasts but my tits."
The chorus continues, "Get it out, get it out, feed the kids, get it out, get it out, milk my ladies."
However, the advertising, posted on the company's Facebook pages, caused controversy on the network.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video elicited different reactions among viewers, many of whom claimed that it highlighted the "horror" of the dairy industry.
"An unhappy decision is to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they also have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them within days of birth," someone wrote.
The Elvie breast pump is discreetly worn under a bra for moms
Someone else commented, "Understandably traumatic for both mother and baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for moms who will continue to keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "It's really a meaningless advertisement."
Others defended her and one woman even admitted to finding the song "fun".
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I'd like to have one.
When I used breast pump, I felt just like a cow.
Advertising is a bit irreverent but doesn't stray far from reality.
This is a brilliant product," someone wrote.
Another person commented, "It's a fun advertisement for moms who use breast pump (often in the workplace or in the bathroom) and feel like "cows."
Its purpose is not to praise or judge the dairy industry."
In the end, the protagonists of the video show that they danced with the discreet breast pump tucked into their bra.
The concept that the campaign is inspired by is based on the idea that many women who use breast pump feel like cows.
The Elvie breast pump is however completely silent, has no wires or tubes and can be tucked into a nursing bra giving women the freedom to move, hold children and even come out while pulling milk.
Ana Balarin, Mother's partner and ECD commented, "The Elvie breast pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
Comparing women who use breast pump to cows we wanted to highlight all the challenges of this practice by demonstrating in a fun and easily recognizable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new breast pump is able to ensure."
This isn't the first time the Elvie breast pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children showed up on the runway of fashion designer Marta Jakubowski wearing this product.
Hundreds of migrant children have quietly moved to a tent city on the Texas border
The number of migrant children has increased exponentially even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policy line of the Trump administration has made it harder for these children to be fostered.
Most of those who took them into foster care were generally illegal immigrants who now fear jeopardizing their chance to stay in the country by offering to do so.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their families would be fingerprinted and that the data would be passed on to immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said before Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who had offered to take care of single children.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
"Nearly 80% of the people who offer to take into custody children or belong to the families of these people are in the country illegally and most of them are foreign criminals.
We are therefore continuing to hunt down these people," Albence said.
To try to process children more quickly, officials introduced new rules whereby some of them will have to appear on trial within a month of being detained, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard period, according to those working at reception points.
Many will appear on videoconferencing rather than in person, to plead their case of legal status with an immigration judge.
Those who are deemed unfit to receive help will be expelled quickly.
The longer children remain in foster care, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety and depression that cause violent anger attacks or escape attempts, according to those working at reception points and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Those who support this position say that the probability of this occurring is even higher in a large structure such as that of Tornillo in which, precisely because of its size, it is easier for children's signs of discomfort to be ignored.
They add that moving children into the tent city without giving them time to prepare emotionally or greet friends could aggravate the trauma that many are already facing.
Syria urges US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
In his speech to the United Nations General Assembly Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home even though the war has now reached its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces illegally occupy Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "will be treated accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately without placing any conditions," he said before the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where since 2011 there have been more than 360,000 deaths and millions of people had to leave their homes.
He reiterated that Damascus will continue to "fight this holy war until it has liberated all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who mainly train and support Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this war-torn country.
On the refugee problem, Moualem said conditions were favorable for their return and accused "some Western countries" of "inciting unfounded fears" that push refugees to stay away from their homeland.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to intervene to facilitate their return," he reiterated.
"What should only be a humanitarian problem is politicized."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be allocated in Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold, has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has avoided an extensive attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, pointed out that the agreement has "precise deadlines" and expressed hope that military action will target jihadists, including al-Nusra Front fighters linked to Al-Qaeda, which "will be eradicated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene a new committee of government and opposition members to draft a constitution for post-war Syria and prepare the way for the elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee by stating that the group's work must be limited to "revising the articles of the current constitution" without any interference.
Why Trump will win the second term
Under this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers may hope, his presidency has to end prematurely due to impeachment or scandal.
In what will no doubt be "the most dramatic presidential final ever!"
At the moment, there are no signs of spectators bending.
Since 2014, prime-time percentages have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" program exceeded the network's percentages by reaching 3.5 million viewers on nights with the most important news.
"It's a fire that people are attracted to because it's not something that can be explained," says Neal Baer, showrunner of the ABC television series "Designated Survivor" who tells the story of a cabinet member who suddenly becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an expert writer of brilliant comedies and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
He remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
She asked him why.
He said, "Because it makes me laugh."
Chaos is therefore a source of fun.
Of course, unlike any other television program, the plot of Washington's events can determine the future of the Roe vs. Wade ruling, whether immigrant families can come together or not and the health of the global economy.
To stop following the news, however, is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes far beyond one's duty as informed citizens to find oneself following for the sixth consecutive hour a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's in-depth research for his book "Fear," Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather jacket ("a garment full of hubris," The Washington Post commented) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' disgusting descriptions of Trump's anatomical parts.
I, for example, will never be able to watch Super Mario again without thinking about it.
"Part of why what he does looks like a reality show is that every night there's news," says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of "Pawn Stars," about the turnaround of the actors and daily developments in the plot of Trump's show (in contrast to N.F.L. praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss an episode, otherwise you stay back.
This week I went to visit Mike Fleiss on the north coast of Kauai and despite it being a sunny day with almost 30 degrees, he was locked in the house watching MSNBC and meanwhile he was recording CNN.
He failed to break away from TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh was facing the Senate Judiciary Committee and facing the uncertain future of the Supreme Court.
Fleiss commented, "I remember when we used to do all those crazy programs and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization.'
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

Inflow of outside money in race for tightest midterm elections
It is no surprise that an influx of money is occurring in the 17th district thanks to the realignment of a congressional district that has caused two incumbent members to now be running for the same post.
The recent redefinition of Pittsburg's suburban district brings Democratic Representative Conor Lamb on stage, who won his place in another district during a special election held last spring.
Lamb is in a race against another incumbent member, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania that overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January ruled that in the old districts constituencies had been manipulated unconstitutionally in favor of Republicans.
The run to the 17th district sparked a campaign characterized by fierce opposition between the financial branches of the two major parties, namely the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a measure victory in the March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
That post had been occupied by a Republican for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political pundits gave the Democrats a slight advantage.
US thought to penalize El Salvador because it supports China, then they changed their mind
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
In June 2017, a rather cordial meeting took place between Panama President Juan Carlos Varela and President Trump who also had a hotel in Panama until the partners forced the Trump Organization leadership group to leave.
State Department officials have decided to re-enter the heads of American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama following the "recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan," said department spokeswoman Heather Nauert in a statement released earlier this month.
But the decision to apply sanctions was made only against El Salvador, which in 2017 received from the Americans about $140 million in aid for drug trafficking control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial aid and visa restrictions, would have been worrisome for the Central American country with a high percentage of unemployed and murders.
After a series of internal meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in an attempt to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But in mid-September senior management officials made it clear that they intended to continue with the conference thus definitively renouncing any sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence was assigned to chair the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, demonstrating the importance the administration attaches to this meeting, diplomats say.
And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without receiving any further reprimands or punishments from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton in the White House declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials and two diplomats who agreed to speak, anonymously, about the internal decisions.
What they said was confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration who still wanted to maintain anonymity.
Study History
In the report that he will publish, Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller could accuse Trump of obstruction of justice, a fact of which sufficient evidence now seems to exist.
Mueller's investigation reportedly aims to shed light on Trump's possible collusion with Russia during the presidential campaign.
If Congress passes on to the Democrats, Trump should answer these charges before voters and perhaps a jury of his peers just as he prepares for a new candidacy.
The unknowns are many and I do not intend to say that the fall of Trump is inevitable, as is not that of his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic we will have to make choices that will determine how long the fight could last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to organize a coup against Hitler if the Western powers stopped him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
On that occasion we failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points where the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans right now have to deal with several of them.
What if Trump decides to fire Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's position has become complicated since this very newspaper reported that last year he secretly suggested that Trump be subjected to wiretaps questioning his ability to serve as president.
Rosenstein argues that the news released in The Times newspaper is not true.
"How will we react if the FBI's new investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or impartial or if it is upheld in the Supreme Court despite reliable allegations of attempted rape and perjury?
And above all, in the midterm elections will we vote for a Congress that will ask Trump to respond to his actions?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will have to prepare for a long winter.
But the lesson I learned in Prague makes me think we'll make it.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, moved to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles with the swastika.
With such an inheritance, I can only be optimistic about the future."

Graham Dorrans of Rangers is optimistic about meeting Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after a convincing draw against Villarreal in Spain, would give them excellent opportunities to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
Although due to a knee injury midfielder Graham Dorrans played his first game of the season just on the occasion of the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, he believes that this result can allow the Rangers to do great things.
"For us it was a positive result because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We faced the game convinced that we were doing well and brought home a point.
Maybe we could have won in extremes but, all in all, the tie is a fair result.
They were better in the first half, while in the second we played better.
As for Thursday, it will be another great European evening.
We hope to win the three points but it will be a difficult match because our opponents have achieved a good result in the last game, but I am sure that, thanks to the support of the public, we will manage not to disappoint.
Last year was definitely difficult because of my injuries and the changes at the level of the club itself but now the feelings are positive.
The team is in shape, the boys have fun and the preparation proceeds well.
We can therefore forget about the problems of last season and think about the future."
Women are concerned about the costs of long-term care
Although those who took part in the survey have clear ideas about the type of care they would like to receive, few have addressed the topic in the family.
About half of those surveyed by Nationwide say they talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% say they have spoken to their children about it.
According to Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide, "people want a member of their family to take care of them, but they don't face this conversation."
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children about it: you cannot prepare your family to assist you if you do not communicate in time what you want.
If you have a counselor, decide with him and your family where and how you want to receive assistance, because these factors can be determinant for costs.
Involve a financial advisor: he can advise you how to pay the expenses you will face.
Choosing a long-term care loan may include a traditional insurance policy or a hybrid life insurance policy with redemption value to cover these expenses or continue to pay money for insurance as long as you are able to do so.
Prepare all necessary documents to avoid legal battles at your death.
Appoint a health care attorney so that a person you trust can supervise medical care and make sure that professionals meet your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Also consider the possibility of a proxy for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure your accounts are paid in case you are unable to do so.
Don't forget the details: imagine your elderly parent being rushed to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write this information down in detail so that you are always ready.
"It's not just a matter of finances, but who are the doctors?" asks Martin.
"What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Prepare for any eventuality."
Man shot several times with a compressed air rifle at Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle as he walked home after spending the evening outside.
The victim, a 40-year-old man, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as "random action".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
He is not in any danger of life, however, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official sources, at least 384 people died as a result of a very strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday. The death toll is set to rise.
Communications are disrupted and rescue workers have failed to get any information from the regency of Donggala, an area north of Palu that is close to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some essential data about Palu and Donggala in the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island and with a population of about 379,800 in 2017.
When it was hit by the earthquake and tsunami, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a regency that stretches more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the north west of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, an administrative region dependent on a province, had about 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of livelihood of the economy of the Central Sulawesi province and especially of the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also an important activity in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit several times by tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
Another tsunami hit the western area of Donggala in 1996 killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic zone called the Pacific Fire Belt and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the strongest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a very strong earthquake on the west coast of Aceh province north of Sumatra caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries killing, along the coast of the Indian Ocean, 226,000 people, including over half of Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra between late March and early April.
Hundreds of people have died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that lashed out at the southern coast killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of the Western Sumatra province.
There were more than 1,100 victims.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, causing a 10-metre tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake struck regency Pidie Jaya in Aceh causing destruction and panic in people who remembered the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
In this case there was no tsunami but more than 100 people died under the rubble.
2018: A strong earthquake struck the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia killing more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaskan governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report issued Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers, Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, for obstructing the complaint and resisting arrest.
According to the report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, she tore her phone out of hand.
Palin was transferred to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility center and his bail was set at $500, according to KTUU.
According to the television network, he appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "definitely innocent".
Palin is likely to be charged with three first-degree offenses, namely imprisonment for up to a year and a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a second-degree offense punishable by a day's imprisonment and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with criminal acts.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently under review by Veteran's Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, obstructing the report of the crime and possession of a weapon while drunk in connection with the incident.
His fiancée accused him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress syndrome following her time in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people died after the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The power grid and communications grid are not working and the death toll is set to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck off Central Sulawesi which lies northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
On social media there are videos showing the moment of impact.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people had gathered for a beach party in the town of Palu.
Federal prosecutors demand extraordinary capital punishment for suspects of terrorist attacks in NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking capital punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the author of the terrorist attack that caused the death of eight people: a rare sentence that since 1953 has never been committed for a federal crime.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a Home Depot rental van to pounce on a cycle path along the West Side Highway in the Lower Manhattan area by investing pedestrians and cyclists in October.
Under the conditions for capital punishment in the Southern District of New York, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and just as "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily injury.
According to the court document, both of these counts can lead to the death sentence.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury issued 22 indictments against Saipov that included eight counts of murder with criminal association, typically used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "real planning and premeditation," prosecutors said describing the way Saipov carried it out as "atrocious, cruel and depraved."
The preliminary notification states that "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused damage, offenses and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco".
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
Ten years have passed since the Southern District of New York prosecuted the last capital punishment case.
The man sued, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug traffickers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The death sentence was last carried out in New York in 1953 for the federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, husband and wife accused of conspiracy through espionage and indicted for passing information to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs both died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no sign of repentance in the days and months following the attack.
Police say they said they were proud of what he did in front of the investigators.
According to the prosecution, Saipov told authorities that he decided to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked the police to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
As for the 22 counts, he pleaded not guilty.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea and a life sentence without any possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov's group of defenders had previously begged prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Member of parliament Tory says NIGEL FARAGE must lead Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today vowed to "mobilize the people's army" during a protest at the Tory conference.
When one of Theresa May's party parliament members suggested that he should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union, the former leader of the UK Independence Party said that politicians must "feel the pressure" of Eurosceptics.
In March, Conservative MP Peter Bone said in Birmingham that the UK "would already be out of Europe" if Farage were the Brexit Secretary.
But the challenges May faces in attempting to reconcile her deeply divided party's positions were underscored by Tories in favor of staying in Europe who participated in a separate protest against Brexit in London.
The prime minister is attempting to enforce the Chequers Plan amid attacks by Brexit supporters, those who want to remain in Europe and the European Union.
The Allies insist on continuing the attempt to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the strong collective reaction, and forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between what May proposes and "chaos".
At the Leave Means Leave organization rally held in Solihull, Bone said he wanted to abandon the Chequers Plan.
He suggested that the task of conducting negotiations with Brussels should be entrusted to Farage.
"We would already be out of Europe by now," he said.
Member of Parliament Wellingborough added: "I am for Brexit but we must abandon the Chequers Plan."
Explaining the reasons for his opposition to the European Union, he said: "We have not fought world wars to be servile.
We want to be able to enforce our laws in our country."
Bone rejected views that public opinion would change since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in Europe is completely false."
Tory MP Andrea Jenkyns, a supporter of Brexit, also attended the procession and told reporters: "I simply tell the prime minister to listen to people.
The Chequers Plan is not appreciated by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it and does not enjoy the favors of our party and our activists who go around the streets looking for votes to allow us to be elected.
Forget the Chequers Plan and start listening."
In an incisive message for May, she added: "Prime ministers can keep their place when they keep their promises."
At the rally, Farage said that politicians should be able to "feel the pressure" if they intended to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them that we won't let them."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd he added: "I want you to feel the pressure on our political class that is on the verge of betraying Brexit.
We intend to mobilize the people's army of this country that voted for Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, those in favor of staying in Europe marched through the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists pushed the Tories against Brexit flags after the group formed this weekend.
The Labour Party mocked the Conservatives for the security issues they had with a party app at the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who say they can install IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus deal, for frictionless borders and for borderless trade in Ireland," he added.
It's all a farce.
A good Brexit does not exist," he concluded.
Warren is seriously considering running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November election she will seriously consider running for president.
According to the Boston Globe, Massachusetts Democratic Senator on Saturday spoke about her future during a city assembly in western Massachusetts.
Warren, often critical of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
The assumption that he could challenge Trump in 2020 has been in the air for a long time.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in the form of a city assembly since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she intends to run for president.
Warren responded that it is time for "women to go to Washington to settle the government and that implies that a woman holds the highest office."
Arrest for murder of LSU Sims player
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Saturday said they had arrested a suspect in the murder of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11:00 a.m. on ETNews.
On Friday, he released a video of the murder asking for help identifying a visible man in the sequences.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims sustained a gunshot wound to the head that caused his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul said on 247Sports.
Wayde stepped in to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was at the crime scene holding a weapon and that he had hit Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and held in detention at the Parish Police Department in East Baton Rouge.
A nearly two-meter junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 matches last season, including 10 as a starter with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after victory over Sebastian Vettel thanks to team orders
When Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of teammate Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was immediately apparent that Mercedes team orders would heavily condition the race.
From the pole, Bottas starts well leaving Hamilton to defend himself against Vettel's attacks in the first two laps.
Vettel stops first at the pits leaving Hamilton in the group's tail traffic, a move that could be decisive.
The Mercedes makes the stop the next lap returning to the track behind Vettel. Hamilton, however, overtakes him after some wheel-to-wheel actions in which the Ferrari driver tries to prevent his passage inside risking to finish out after a double shift to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen starts from the last row of the grid but at the end of the first lap he is already seventh on his 21st birthday.
He then led the race for much of the race without stopping at the pits for the tyre change and tried to finish quickly to overtake Kimi Raikkonen by taking fourth place.
In the end, however, he had to make the pit stop on the 44th lap and in the remaining 8 laps he was unable to increase the pace and overtake Raikkonen, who finished fourth.
"It's a difficult day because Valtteri worked really well all weekend and he was really nice to let me through.
The team did an outstanding job to win the first and second positions," Hamilton said.
A Bad Example of Body Language
At a rally on Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein for her insistence that she did not disclose the contents of Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of attempted rape.
During a rally in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what's going on in the Senate shows that people are "measuring, mean and lying."
"What can happen and what is happening in the last few days in the Senate where people are angry, mean, mean and lying," he said.
"When there are obvious signs that the news is being leaked and those responsible say "oh no, it wasn't me.
I could never do that."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you break the news?
Remember his answer... did you reveal the contents of the document? - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't."
Wait a minute.
We revealed it...No, we didn't," she added imitating the senator.
The letter in which Ford accused Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July and the content was leaked in early September, but Feinstein denies that the indiscretion was leaked from her office.
"I didn't hide Professor Ford's allegations, but I didn't reveal her story," Feinstein told the committee, according to reports from The Hill.
"He asked me to keep the information confidential and I did."
But his denial is not credible for the president, who during Saturday night's rally commented: "I tell you, this is just a bad example of body language.
Maybe he didn't, but this is the worst example of body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate, who has been charged with attempted sexual offense by three women, the president has suggested that Democrats are using these charges for their own purposes.
"They are trying to regain power by any means necessary.
You see the meanness, the meanness. They don't care who they hurt, who they have to pass over to regain power and control," the president said, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars recovered after Friday's defeat in the Elite League game against the Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 return game on Saturday at Dundee.
The Giants immediately took the lead by two goals on shots from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie led the home team to a tie before Dwyer took the Giants back to the lead.
Francois Bouchard scored the tie for the Dundees before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen decreed their victory.
It was the third defeat of the Elite League season for Adam Keefe's men who had come back to Belfast on Friday night and won the game with the Dundees 2-1.
The two teams have already met four times this season and the Giants have won the first three games.
Dwyer scored the first goal at 3:35 on assists from Kendall McFaull, while Beauvillier doubled after four minutes on assists from David Rutherford.
In what was a fairly animated first half, Sullivan brought the home team back to the game at minute 13:10 before Matt Marquardt provided Cownie with the assist of the draw at minute 15:16.
Dwyer decreed the lead for the Giants by scoring the second goal of the evening at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard regained the tie after a 27:37 minute strategic maneuver.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran contributed to Nielsen's action which led the Dundee to the lead for the first time in the match at the end of the second half and decreed his team's victory by scoring the fifth goal in the middle of the last half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five matches, will play their next home game at Milton Keynes on Friday.
Flight controller dies to allow hundreds of passengers to escape earthquake
In Indonesia a flight controller will be hailed as a hero after he dies to allow a plane carrying hundreds of people to take off and rescue them.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing due to a very strong earthquake that hit Sulawesi Island on Friday causing a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to affect the area and many are trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing to save his life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung remained in his place in the control tower of Palu's Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport, which wobbled fearfully.
He wanted to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway, was able to take off safely.
He then jumped off the control tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
He died later at the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian broadcaster ABC News.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"It's really sad news for us," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll may reach the thousands and the National Disaster Countermeasures Agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The calculation of the dead is set to increase because many bodies are still under the rubble and it has been impossible to reach many others," explains agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to 6 meters high have devastated Palu, where a mass burial will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are carrying aid and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mom, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance carries bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Minimarkets are being looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is doing everything it can to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find.
The situation is already tragic, but it could be much worse."
Indonesia's president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's army men: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all activities related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" according to CNN.
During the year Indonesia had already been hit by earthquakes in Lombok, where 550 people had died.
Air disaster in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims that there is a missing after the lagoon accident
The airline of the flight that fell in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, after claiming that all 47 people on board between passengers and crew members had managed to save themselves, now claims that there is a missing.
According to Air Niugini news, updated to Saturday afternoon, a passenger is missing the appeal.
The airline confirmed that it is in contact with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats allowed other passengers and crew to be rescued after the accident while the plane was attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
According to official sources, seven people were transported to the hospital on Friday.
The airline claims that six passengers were admitted to the hospital on Saturday and are all in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the exact sequence of events is still unclear.
The U.S. airline and navy claim that the plane crashed into the lagoon because it did not reach the runway.
Some witnesses claim that the plane crossed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes has stated that the plane has arrived at a very low altitude.
"And it was really a fortune," Jaynes said.
Jaynes then explained that he and others, walking in the water that came to life, managed to reach the plane's emergency exits.
He added that the flight attendants panicked and screamed and that he was hit slightly in the head.
According to the U.S. Navy, even some sailors who were working nearby to fix a wharf helped by using a dinghy to transport people to the shore before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicate that in the last two decades 111 people have died in airline accidents registered with PNG but none of these involved Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs night of burned woman alive
On Saturday, the presentation of the prosecution's evidence in the new trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
She explained to the jury how she used her cell phone data to reconstruct the movements of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett claimed to have recovered location data from several cell phones that show that, contrary to her claims, Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claims to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford appeared in court on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked him if Tellis was telling the truth stating that he was in the Sanford truck that night, the latter confirmed that he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency is that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for two weeks when she died.
On the other hand, cell phone data indicates that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from her phone.
"He erased her from his life," Hale said.
The defense will begin its closing argument on Sunday.
The judge expects the trial to pass to the jury later on the same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by inserting positive messages into their tracks.
The group The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip-hop strayed from its origins when spreading political messages and denouncing social problems.
Instead, they want to go back to their origins and do a conscious hip-hop genre again.
Artists such as the Fugees and Common have recently returned to the UK thanks to characters such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
A New York nanny sues a couple for firing her with a "racist" lyrics
In New York City, a nanny sued a couple for firing her in a discriminatory manner after accidentally receiving a text in which her mother complained that she was "another black".
The couple denies being racist by comparing the request to a real "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, expressed her disappointment when she found out that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, who arrived for her first day of work in 2016, was black.
"NOOOOOOOOOOO ONE OTHER BLACK", wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a message for her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice twice.
According to The New York Post, after realizing the mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman "embarrassed" she fired Ms. Maurice saying that she had not been happy with their previous nanny, an African American, and that she expected a Filipino.
She paid for Miss Maurice's day's work and sent her home in a taxi.
Maurice sued the couple and, for being fired, seeks compensation for the beauty of $350 a day for the six months of full-time work she was initially hired for, though without a contract.
"I want them to understand that they can't behave like that," he told the Post on Friday adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to the accusation of racism by stating that Maurice's dismissal was the only thing to do as they feared they could not trust her after offending her.
"My wife sent her a message saying something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist people," her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"Would you entrust your children to a person with whom you have been rude, even if by mistake?
Your baby?
I don't think so."
Comparing the request to a real "extortion", Plasco said that his wife has been giving birth for just two months and is in a "very difficult situation".
"You can't get mad at a person like that.
It's not very kind behavior," added the financial advisor.
While the lawsuit is still ongoing, the court of public opinion immediately denounced the spouses on social media criticizing them harshly for their behavior and the logic followed.
A letter reveals that Paddington's editor feared readers would not appreciate a talking bear
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was accepted, comments on the letter as follows: "It's not easy to put yourself in the shoes of someone who first read the book before it was published.
It's fun now that we know Paddington's great success."
Claiming that his father, who worked as a cameraman at the BBC before writing the children's book inspired by a toy bear, would not react well to the rejection of his work, he adds that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was somewhat "sad" after his death last year.
About Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family" she adds that her father was modestly proud of his success.
"He was a fairly quiet man, not a conceited person," he says.
"But Paddington was so real to him that he behaved like when you have a son who reaches a goal: you're proud of it even if it's not because of you.
I think he interpreted Paddington's success this way.
Even though it was a creation of his imagination, he attributed the credit to Paddington himself."
I had to say goodbye on the phone to my daughter who was dying
Upon landing, her daughter was rushed to the hospital in Nice Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called me several times to tell me that the situation was really serious and that our daughter would not make it," says Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then she called me to tell me that she was going to die in a few minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said to her, "Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The effect of the drugs the doctors had given her to allow her heart to continue pumping was slowly fading.
She died a while earlier and it was the end.
I had to sit around and wait knowing all this was going on.
I couldn't complain, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold back."
Eventually, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, saddened by the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers unaware of what was happening to her.
"Nobody knew," he says.
"All the time I've been crying with my head down.
It's hard to explain, but while I was on the plane I felt an incredible sense of solidarity with Nad.
I thought he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Tickets of two women grieving to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women whose loved ones committed suicide commit themselves to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys attacked on a bridge in Wales tickets with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he started suffering from depression and killed himself at 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I do every day," she says.
Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, tells that her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said he lit up every room he came in."
But before he died he quit his job because the depression had taken him "to a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, found him after he took his own life.
Davis says, "I continue to fear that a chain effect will occur."
He created the tickets "to let people know that there is someone they can turn to to talk to, even if it is a friend.
They don't have to isolate themselves, they have to talk."
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother died.
"You never said he felt down or depressed," she says.
"A couple of days before Christmas we noticed that his attitude had changed.
When the children opened their presents, she avoided looking them in the eye."
He says his death was a huge trauma that they had to process: "He ripped apart the family.
He ripped us apart.
But we had to go ahead and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain: FBI has begun investigation
"I think if we could proceed as he asked, that is, with a limited investigation in time and scope, we could reach an agreement," Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the commission was "losing its temper" because of the blockade of entrenched supporters.
Why doesn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of time.
There are only five weeks left until the midterm elections on November 6. If Republicans as expected get a negative result, they will be severely weakened in their attempt to get the man they chose elected to the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush called on senators to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI completes its report?
It will vote in the Senate, which is currently made up of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh will win at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the lead and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of political refugees "decreases" with Kim
A South Korean legislator says the number of North Koreans seeking political refuge in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Unification Ministry, says that there were 1,127 refugees last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park explains that the main reasons are tighter control of the border between North Korea and China and higher tariffs asked by those who illegally smuggle these people out.
Pyongyang has made no public statements.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, whose border with North Korea is longer and easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers them illegal emigrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have significantly improved in recent months.
This month the two countries have already met in Pyongyang to talk about the negotiations on denuclearization that are in a stalemate.
This was after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, in which they agreed in general terms to work together to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho criticized U.S. sanctions for the lack of developments since then.
"Without confidence in the United States we cannot be certain of our national security and in such circumstances there is no chance that we will proceed to unilateral disarmament first," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and claims he is not fit for the Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi calls Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and states that he is not temperamentally fit to hold that position.
Pelosi expressed this opinion on Saturday in an interview during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I think if a woman behaved the same way, they would have called her hysterical," Pelosi said of Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Visibly emotional, Kavanaugh denied the charge of sexually harassing Professor Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
At the beginning of his speech, Kavanaugh was in the throes of emotion, almost screaming and throat-tight from crying as he talked about his family and years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the committee Democrats who called the allegations against him an "absurd and coordinated smear campaign" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi believes that Kavanaugh's testimony proves that she cannot enter the Supreme Court because she has proven to be biased against the Democrats.
"I think he ruled himself out with his statements and the way he talked about the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi then raised an objection when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh in case he was confirmed and if Democrats were to reach a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I think that if it doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, it's not only not suitable for the Supreme Court, but not even for the presiding court now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe vs. Wade, because he is considered a conservative judge.
In the hearing for his confirmation, Kavanaugh evaded questions about his intentions to overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
Pelosi said that "You can't send a hysterical and biased person to the Supreme Court and demand that this decision be welcomed in a positive way."
And women have to use it.
She's a fair diatribe, months and years of fits of anger she can't get out of without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, what about you?"
And he went on to say, "A woman who was an executive somewhere helped me a lot. She told me that she was also crying when she got angry, but she had developed a technique that when she got angry and started crying she would say to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And so it continued.
I thought his was a brilliant idea."
Tears are tolerated as an outburst of anger in part because they are fundamentally not understood.
One of the sharpest memories I have of a previous job in a predominantly male office goes back to when I once started crying over an access to anger. An older woman, a glacial manager from whom I had always been slightly terrified took me by the neck and dragged me down the stairs.
"Never let you see yourself cry," he said to me.
"They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad and they're happy because they've got you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic member of the Colorado Congress, collaborated with Gary Hart in his presidential run.
In 1987, when Hart's extramarital affair was discovered on a boat called Monkey Business that had to give up the race, Schroeder, very disappointed, thought there was no reason why she should not have tried to run for president herself.
"It wasn't really a well-thought-out decision," he told me laughing about it 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates running and we definitely didn't need another one.
Someone called them "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign was already at an advanced stage, Schroeder was late with the fundraiser and vowed that she would not run if she did not raise $2 million.
It was a lost cause at the start.
She found that some of the supporters who had given the men candidates $1,000 to her would only give 250.
"Do they think I can get a discount?" he wondered.
When she gave the speech to announce that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed with emotions (gratitude for the people who had supported her, disappointment at the system that made it harder to find money and voters than representatives and anger at the sexual discrimination she was a victim of), that she was moved.
"It looked like I was in a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalled thinking about the reaction of the press.
"Someone might have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they would write on my tombstone.
Maybe "Planse a lot."
How the US-China Trade War Could Favor Beijing
The opening blows of the trade war between the US and China have been thunderous and, while the battle is far from over, experts say a contrast between the two countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, has already issued the first warning this year by taxing major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new duties on items worth over $200 billion (€175 billion) in value. This means that taxes will be applied on half of the goods from China.
Beijing has reacted each time with similar measures by recently applying duties of five to ten percent on $60 billion of American goods.
China has promised to respond to the U.S. shot-by-shot and it is unlikely that the world's second-largest economic power will soon back down.
For Washington to give up, it would have to give in to his demands, but publicly bowing to the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Experts believe, however, that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the trade war with the US can positively affect China in the long run by diminishing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision by Washington or Beijing can create the initial conditions of an economic collapse in both countries is in fact much more dangerous than what has been recognized so far," says Abigail Grace, a researcher studying Asia at the Center for New American Security research center.
Syria is "ready" for return of refugees, foreign minister claims
Syria says it is ready for the return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country devastated by over seven years of war.
In front of the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that the country's conditions are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to recover areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they have had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihood.
According to the United Nations estimate, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million still living in Syria need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem has stated that the Syrian regime will gladly accept assistance to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept any aid subordinated to conditions or from those countries that supported the insurrection.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The Europa team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating the USA team with a final score of 17.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has thus lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the trophy when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
USA champion Phil Mickelson, who fought for most of the tournament, threw his tee shot in the water at the 16th hole of par 3 granting victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer has distinguished himself in all his rounds becoming one of the four players ever to record a 5-0-0 since the tournament with the current formula was played for the first time in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated with a score of 5&4 by the European team's bottom-ranked Danish player Thorbjorn Olesen.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, gave up 2&1 to Englishman Ian Poulter who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
A Ryder Cup veteran, Spanish Sergio Garcia who played eight, became the European player who won the most in the history of the tournament with 25.5 points.
"I don't usually cry but I can't help myself today.
It's been a rough year.
I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I got the cup back.
It's a team win and I'm happy to have made my contribution," said an excited Garcia after the European win.
He passed the baton to his compatriot John Ram who beat USA golf legend Tiger Woods by a score of 2&1 in Sunday's singles.
"If I think I grew up watching his matches, I'm really very proud to have beaten Tiger Woods," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now the tally of his Ryder Cup matches amounts to 13 wins, 21 losses and 3 draws.
A strange statistic if you think that he is one of the greatest players of all time having won 14 of the main titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The USA team tried throughout the weekend to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a top level golf throughout the tournament.
US captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance by his team: "I'm proud of these guys because they fought.
At some point this morning we put pressure on the Europa team.
We threw this opportunity away.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players behaved very well.
I'll work with the American PGA and the Ryder Cup committee and we'll move on.
I'm fond of these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We've done our best.
But they played better than us."
Red tide update: concentration decreases in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission's latest report shows a general decrease in red tide concentration in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, patchy flowering conditions, which suggest a decrease in concentration, are evident in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties.
The red tide bloom extends about 130 miles of coastline from northern Pinellas County south of Lee County.
