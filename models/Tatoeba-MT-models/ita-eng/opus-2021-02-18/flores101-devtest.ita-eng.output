This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely diffused, but provides more details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
. According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was brown at the top, with a pale or carotenoid colouration at the bottom.
The discovery also provides detailed information on the evolution of bird feathers.
Since the plumage of the dinosaur is not equipped with the basic structure, the so-called rachis, but has instead other characteristics typical of feathers, beards and beards, the researchers concluded that the rachis is probably the result of an evolutionary development following these characteristics.
The structure of the plumage suggests that it was not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or courtship. Researchers assume that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the exhibit shows an adult plumage and not the chick down.

Huhne has resigned and will be replaced by Ed Davey MP. Norman Lamb MP is expected to play the role of Minister for Business left vacant by Davey.
The appearance of Huhne and Pryce at the Westminster Magistrate Court is scheduled for 16 February.
The victims were Nicholas Alden, 25 years old, and the driver, Zachary Cuddeback, 21 years old.
Edgar Veguilla suffered injuries to his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider will have to undergo facial reconstruction surgery.
Uka's weapon did not explode when it was pointed at the head of a fifth man. Schneider has constant pain, is blind by an eye, lacks a section of skull and his face has been reconstructed in titanium.
Schneider testified via video conference from a USF base in his country.
In addition to Wednesday's event, Carpanedo took part in two single Championship races.
The first in slalom, where on the first descent he recorded a DNT. 36 other competitors out of 116 in the same race did not finish the test.
The other race in which he participated, the giant slalom, saw him ranked tenth in the female group of the category "sedated", with a combined journey time of 4:41.30, slower than 2:11.60 minutes compared to the first ranked, the Austrian Claudia Loesch, and slower than 1:09.02 minutes compared to the ninth place of the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
Four female skiers failed to finish their descents, and 45 of the 117 participants in the Giant Slalom did not qualify in the race.
Madhya Pradesh police managed to recover the laptop and cell phone that had been stolen.
Deputy Inspector General, DK Arya, announced: "Five people have been arrested for the rape of the Swiss woman, and we also found her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
None of the three people who were in the house at the time of the car crash were injured.
Nevertheless, the driver was severely injured in the head.
The road on which the accident occurred was temporarily closed, while the rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been at the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court on charges of killing his own son.
It is held pending referral to trial and trial, but any testimony given by an eyewitness could be polluted, as its image has been widely published.
This is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice has other parameters, and the Scottish courts have considered the publication of photos to be potentially harmful.
According to Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee "journalists who publish photos or other suspicious subjects, walk on a mine ground".
The Crown Office, which has the general responsibility for judicial proceedings, has made it clear to journalists that no new comments will be made at least until the formal indictment.
According to what leaked, the subject of the document will be the dispute over borders, which Palestine wants to be based on the existing borders before the Middle East War of 1967.
According to what is said, the other issues discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement is signed, Israel requires a constant military presence in the valley, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to abandon this presence only for five years.
The shooters within the experimental programme for the control of harmful animals had to be carefully monitored by the rangers, since the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association, the NPWS in collaboration with the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., has recruited qualified volunteers.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of the Park Conservation and Heritage of the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive training and safety instructions.
Martelly swore yesterday in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members.
This is Martelly's 5th Provisional Electoral Council in four years.
Last month a presidential commission proposed a package of measures to push the country towards new elections, including the resignation of the previous CEP.
The committee constituted Martelly's response to the widespread protests, which began in October, which challenge the regime.
The occasional violent protests have been unleashed by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been planned since 2011.
Some 60 cases of malfunctioning iPod overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economics, Trade and Industry (METI) has stated that it is aware of 27 device-related accidents.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Commerce and Industry (METI) announced that Apple had informed Apple of 34 other overheating incidents, which the company called "not serious".
In its reply, the Ministry described Apple's postponement of the report as "absolutely regrettable".
The quake of the Marians was warned at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the Emergency Management Office of the Northern Mariana Islands, no damage has been reported in the nation.
And also the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there were no tsunami signs in place.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino policeman took Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus.
With his M16 rifle Rolando Mendoza fired on tourists.
Many of the hostages have been rescued, at least six have died.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released immediately along with Filipino photographers.
The photographers then replaced an old lady who needed to use the bathroom. Mendoza was shot to death.
Liggins retraced his father's footsteps and began his career as a doctor.
After training in obstetrics, he joined the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While serving at the hospital, Liggins began studying cases of premature labor in his spare time.
His research showed that the administration of a hormone would accelerate the maturation of the lungs in the foetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday recovered two 'black boxes' with flight records.
Even his wrestling buddies wanted to pay tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Moon was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. She died on the night of the two moons. Unique, just like her. A strong woman."
"Luna was as weird as me... maybe even more... I love her and I'll miss her... Let's hope she's in a better place," was Dustin's comment "Goldust" Runnels.
According to the survey of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal elections, people opposed to Australia's transition to a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard said he believed that Australia should become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
This opinion is shared by 34% of respondents to the survey, according to which Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia's last monarch.
In contrast to the survey, 29% of respondents claim that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medal was supposed to compete in the 100 and 200 meters freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but he suffered several ailments that led to doubt of his physical form.
He could not take the drugs needed to overcome the pain because they are banned from the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest number ever known to date.
The discovery was verified by several people through the use of various hardware and software in early February, and was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been one of the sources that have led water and organic matter to earth, that is matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed and in particular how the Earth was formed, having collided with comets a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, has been in office since the beginning of this year as governor; last month he signed a law that makes marriage between people of the same sex legal.
According to him, speculation is nothing more than "politic talk and stupidity".
A presidential candidacy is envisaged in 2016.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system would allow aircraft to cover shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel per year, thus reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
The system uses satellite technology rather than obsolete ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is being set up and the surface trains will not stop at Wembley, while on site there are no parking spaces for cars or interchanges.
The fears of the absence of means of transport have brought out the possibility to have the game played in closed doors, without the support of the fans of the team.
According to a study published on Thursday in Science magazine, a new species of birds would be born on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
According to researchers from Princeton University, the United States, and the University of Uppsala, Sweden, the new species has evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that the time needed for this process was much longer; this due to the coupling of a endemic finch of Darwin, Geospiza fortes, and the finch of immigrant cactus, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked in any shape. It can be rolled to create tiny shapes.
It can be pulled to form a thin thread, suitable to be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into foils.
It can be made very thin and attached on other metals. Sometimes it has been used to decorate the hand painted images in books called "minimized codes" precisely thanks to the possibility of being made so thin.
This is the so-called pH of the substance. Using red cabbage juice you can build a pH indicator.
The cabbage juice changes color according to how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical element is.
The pH level of the chemical analysed is given by the amount of hydrogen ions present (the letter H of pH).
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been torn away from electrons (since hydrogen atoms are formed by a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dried powders together and then, with clean and wet hands, put them into a ball.
Between the moisture present on your hands and the outer layers will trigger a reaction that will cause a strange sensation and form a kind of shell.
Almost all houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a bathroom with running water equipped with a connection to an advanced sewer system.
In Greece, remains of sewerage have been discovered in the homes of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini.
The toilets in ancient times also existed in Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization they were sometimes included in public baths, frequented by a mixed audience of men and women.
To phone someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then sends it back almost instantly.
The launch of the satellite into space was carried out with a rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because the atmosphere of the Earth partly distorts light and visuals.
To transport a satellite or telescope into space, a rocket over 100 feet high is required.
The wheel has changed the world enormously. Among the various advantages it has offered us, the most important is to have provided us with easier and faster transport.
Thanks to its invention, they made their appearance the train, the car and several other means of transport.
Below them are other medium - sized cats that feed on medium - sized preys, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free domestic cats) that feed on small, considerably more numerous preys, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The concept of niche is the secret of their success, a particular objective that each feline has and that allows it not to compete with others.
Lions are the most social felines and live in numerous groups called herds.
The herds are composed of adult males, usually 2 or 3 related to each other, and a number of females and puppies that can reach 30.
Usually the females are closely related to each other, being a large family of daughters and sisters.
The pack of lions acts in a very similar way to the pack of wolves or dogs, whose behavior is in fact surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not to that of other big cats), also with regard to the deadly attacks on their preys.
A complete athlete: the tiger is able to climb (even if not too well), swim, make very long jumps and exercise a traction force five times higher than that of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same family (the genus Panthera) of the lion, leopard and jaguar. These four cats are the only ones to roar.
The roar of the tiger is not as powerful as that of the lion, but more like a phrase of screaming and angry words.
Ocelotti like to feed on small animals. If possible, they hunt for monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds and almost all the preys they catch are much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that the ocelotti follow and find the animals to eat (prey) thanks to the smell, sniffing on the ground where they have been.
Thanks to the night vision they are able to see very well in the dark, as well as being able to move stealthily. To hunt their prey, the ocelotti blend with the surrounding environment and then drop them on.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population to which it belongs (for example, if it moves beyond a mountain range or a river, or moves on a new island, making it difficult to return), it will probably find itself in an environment different from the one in which it was before.
This new environment is characterized by different resources and competitors, therefore, in order to stand as a strong competitor, the new population will need different characteristics or transformations compared to those previously necessary.
The original population has not changed at all; it continues to need the same adaptations as before.
With the passage of time and as the new population adapts to its new environment, it looks less and less like the other population.
At some point, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different from each other that they can no longer be defined as belonging to the same species.
This process, which consists in the formation of new species, is called speciation. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and is a fundamental element of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that is breathed by humans and absorb the carbon dioxide expelled from them (through exhalation).
Plants process their nourishment with the sun through photosynthesis. They also shade.
We build our houses from plants and we produce clothes from plants. Much of the food we eat is made of plants. Without plants animals could not survive.
The Mesasaur was the superpredator of his age, and for this reason he feared nothing but the other Mesasaurs.
From its long jaws more than 70 sharp teeth like razors, plus an additional row located on the palate, so for anyone who crossed its path there was no escape.
We do not know for sure, but it is possible that it had a forked tongue. Its feeding included turtles, large fish, other mosaics and it is also possible that it was a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex could not compete with him.
Although most of their food would seem familiar to us, Roman banquets also included several strange or unusual dishes, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a sort of rodent called a wreath.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate while sitting on chairs, rich men loved to feast together while lying on their side while eating their meal.
Of course, the meals of the ancient Romans did not include different foods, which came to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built for each deity a principal temple, which was considered the dwelling place of the god.
The people brought sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to provide for the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary accessible only to priests.
Sometimes, particular pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurat, were built and became part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a sanctuary dedicated to the god.
Thanks to the mild climate that characterizes the Middle East, the house was not of fundamental importance.
Much of the life of the Jewish family took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard, while the shops were simple open-air counters overlooking the street. The stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so the wood was particularly expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Nordic sagas it is said that it was Erik the Red who gave it the name, having met Greenland on his journey after being exiled from Iceland for murder.
But, regardless of its discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although all of them are "scandinavian" countries, the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland had very different characteristics.
If you've seen the movie "The Mystery of the Templars," you might think a treasure map is drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Anyway, this is fake, even if there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is the inscription "Declaration of Original Independence of 4 July 1776". The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although it is not known for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence the large parchment document (measure 29.75 inches by 24.5 inches) was rolled up to be stored.
Probably, therefore, the record was only intended as a label.
The landings of the D-Day and the subsequent clashes led the north of France to liberation, but the south was still occupied.
It was ruled by the Vichy regime, that is by those French who in 1940 had made peace with the Germans and had allies with the invaders, instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France: this offensive action was named Operation Dragoon.
The American forces and those of the Free French had freed the south of France in just two weeks and headed for Germany.
Civilization means a specific culture, shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work collaboratively, constituting a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis", which means civil; the term is in turn connected with "civis", i.e. citizen, and "civitas", i.e. city or city-state, and in some way also defines the dimensions of society.
Cities-states are the first realities to anticipate the idea of nation. Culture of civilization means transmitting knowledge through several generations, leaving an indelible cultural imprint through a fair diffusion.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical traces, not being thus recognized as true civilizations.
During the war of independence, the thirteen states formed for the first time a weak central government, and Congress was the only component, according to the Statute of the Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes and, given the absence of an executive or judicial power at national level, it relied on the state authorities, often uncooperative, for the application of its acts.
He didn't even have the authority to bypass tax laws and duties between states.
In order to amend the articles it was necessary the unanimous consent of all the states. These for their part had so little consideration of the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, along with the German national football team, the second most successful football team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the most popular sports are: football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, track hockey and Formula 1 motor racing.
Winter sports are more widespread in the northern regions and see Italians engaged in international competitions and Olympic events.
Nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), and this makes Japan the seventh largest archipelago in the world!
From a geographical point of view, we refer to Japan as an "archaeology", given the presence of groups of islands that make up it.
Taiwan was born in the 15th century, when European sailors passing by shortly recorded the name of the island under the name of Ilha Formosa, or wonderful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the south-west of Taiwan, starting a transformation that concerned the systems of production of the cereals of the aborigines and hiring Chinese laborers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan ended up under the control of the forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912); in 1885, Taiwan was declared province of the Qing Empire.
After being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed in 1895 the Treaty of Shimonoseki thus giving Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan; the island remained under the Japanese government until 1945.
Machu Picchu includes three primary structures, namely the Intihuatana, The Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the peripheral buildings have been rebuilt to give tourists a more precise idea of their original appearance.
In 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu's site had been recovered, but restoration work is still ongoing.
The most common format in the world for the photography of fixed images, for example, is 35 mm, the same as the film most used at the end of the era of analog photography.
It is still produced today and, what is most important, its aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Strangely enough, the height of the 35 mm format is 24 mm and its width is 36 mm.
The proportions of this format (divide by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of integers) are therefore considered 3:2.
The proportions of many of the common formats (e.g. the family of ODA formats) are equal or very close to this value.
The much exploited and often mocked rule of third parties is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order within an image.
According to this rule, the most effective point to place the main subject corresponds to the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds, both vertically and horizontally (as in the example).
In this phase of European history, the Catholic Church, which has become rich and powerful, has been under scrutiny.
The Christian religion had acted as a glue between the European states for over a thousand years, despite linguistic and custom differences.
His omnipresent power has influenced everyone, from the king to the ordinary citizens.
One of the foundations of Christianity is that wealth must serve to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the monetary reserves of the church exist precisely for this reason.
The central authority of the church has remained in Rome for over a thousand years and this convergence of power and money has led many to wonder whether this principle has been respected.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain decided to implement a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective: it provided for the interruption of any essential military and civil supply, despite the fact that this blockade violated international law usually accepted and codified by multiple international treaties of the last two centuries.
Great Britain undermined international waters to prevent any boat from accessing entire sections of the ocean, putting neutral ships at risk as well.
Since this tactic had aroused a limited response, Germany expected a similar reaction to its indiscriminate underwater war campaign.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and heaviness of World War I, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla accepted a job offer at the Edison Company in New York City, which led him to move to the United States of America.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation written by Charles Batchelor (his manager in his previous work) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China the different periods of time were indicated in a very singular way: every period of China or every family that was in power constituted a specific dynasty.
Even the intervals between the individual dynasties were characterized by periods of instability and division between the provinces. The best known was the so-called Three Kingdoms period, between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty, which lasted for 60 years.
During these times, fierce wars broke out among many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the most violent epochs in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting to win a place of honor in the imposing palace of Xi'an.
There are numerous social and political effects, including the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to the republic, nationalism and the conviction that the nation belongs to the people and is not owned by a single sovereign.
Moreover, after the Revolution the professions were open to all men candidates, allowing the most ambitious and fortunate to succeed.
The same goes for the military, since the military rankings, instead of being based on class, are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other oppressed workers in various countries to begin their revolution.
Muhammad had deep interest in matters that go beyond earthly life. He used to go to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave, which survived the passage of time, offers itself a very clear image of Muhammad's spirituality.
The cave rests on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, completely detached from the rest of the world.
In reality it is not at all easy to find, even if you knew its existence. Once inside the cave, the isolation is total.
You can see nothing but a wonderful clear sky and a lot of mountains around. From the inside of the cave you can see or feel very little of the surrounding world.
Among the seven wonders of the world, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one that has come to this day not in a state of ruin.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of the great pyramidal structures built in honor of the dead Pharaoh.
The plain of Giza, or "Necropolis of Giza", in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, houses numerous pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheops), several smaller tombs, several temples and the great Sphinx.
The important pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Cheops, and many of Pharaoh's pyramids, tombs, and minor temples were built to honor Pharaoh's wives and family members.
The indication "arched up" resembles a V and the indication "arched down" to a paper clip or a square without the lower side.
Upward means that you should start from the tip and push the bow, and down means that you should start from the alamaro (which is where the hand holds the bow) and pull the bow towards yourself.
An ascending arc usually generates a softer sound, while a descending arc produces a louder and stronger sound.
You may decide to add your personalised pencil markings, but keep in mind that the archery marks you find printed have a musical value, so in principle they should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of women in the market forced King Louis XVI, in terror, to leave Versailles to return to Paris, along with Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Maria Teresa, 11 years old and Louis Charles, 4 years old) and Elizabeth, the king's sister.
With a carriage they returned to Paris, surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and shouted threats against the sovereigns.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point, someone in the crowd showed the terrified queen the head of a royal guard who had been killed in Versailles.
The war expenses of US imperialism incurred to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover much of the expenses and interest on bonds fluctuated in the name of the Philippine government through the banks of Wall Street.
Clearly, the huge gains from the exploitation of the Filipino people over time constituted the profits at the base of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars one must know the context that led to the creation of this order.
The era in which the events took place is commonly called the Upper Middle Ages, the period of European history that covers the XI, XII and XIII centuries (from the year 1000 to 1300 A.D.).
The Full Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Lower Middle Ages, which ended by convention in about 1500.
Technological Determinism is a term that includes in practice a wide range of ideas, from technological innovation or technological imperative to the strict sense that the destiny of man is motivated by a underlying logic, associated with scientific laws and their realization in technology.
Most of the interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: one is that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond political and cultural influence, and the other is that technology has in turn "effects" on societies that are intrinsic, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that the car necessarily involves the development of the road network.
However, a national road network for only a few cars is not economically viable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of ownership of a car.
The mass possession of cars also leads to a higher percentage of accidents on the roads, and consequently the invention of new rescue techniques for the care of injured people.
Romanticism was characterized by a consistent component of cultural determinism, taken from authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romance, geography has conditioned individuals, and over time uses, customs and culture have arisen linked to such geography that, being in harmony with the context of society, have resulted more effective than arbitrary laws imposed.
Similarly to Paris, now known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion capital in feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a nerve center of luxury began around 400 A.D. and continued approximately until 1100 A.D.
During the 12th century its prestige declined, mainly because the Crusaders returned bringing gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this point that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The highest point of Gothic style was reached in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
At first, clothing was influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
But the slowness of the routes of communication means that the spread of styles in the West can delay by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments of the time, the result of the Crusades, was the introduction of buttons to fasten clothes.
Agriculture is defined as subsistence when it is practised for the sole purpose of producing sufficient food to meet the food needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, usually organic, that uses preserved seeds originating in the ecological region in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques aimed at getting the most out of crops.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and in many developing countries this is still the case.
Subcultures unite individuals with the same opinions, who do not feel representative of society's standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are distinguished by age, ethnicity, social class, position and/or gender of its members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinctive can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a set of factors.
Often the members of a subculture indicate their belonging through a peculiar and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, manners and argots.
One of the most commonly used methods to explain the importance of socialization is to analyze some unhappy cases of children who, due to negligence, due to misfortunes, or due to intentional abuse, have grown up without proper socialization with adults.
These children are called "feral" or savage. Some of them have been segregated by people (often their own parents): in some cases the abandonment is motivated by the refusal of a serious intellectual or physical impairment by the parents.
Feral children may have suffered severe violence or trauma before abandonment or escape.
Other children may have been reared by animals; yet others seem to have lived alone in wild nature.
When the feral child is completely bred by non-human animals, it shows behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the particular animal that has taken care of him, such as fear or indifference towards man.
Project-based learning should make learning itself easier and more interesting, while shelving goes a little further.
Scaffolding is not a learning mode, as much as a help for those who undertake a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is an example of "scaffolding", but so is the small assistant in the shape of a staple of Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are intended to question, solicit and explain the procedures that the student may have had difficulty managing alone.
Children are given custody for various reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse, even extortion.
A child should never grow up in an environment that does not guarantee food, care and training, but it happens to them.
We believe that foster care is a safe area for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving foster parents, stable education, and reliable health care.
The custody is supposed to cover all unmet needs in the house from which they were taken.
The Internet brings together elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The characteristic elements of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage theory and gratification.
For example, as important motivations for the use of the Internet are suggested "learning" and "socialization" (James et al., 1995).
The Eighmey and McCord (1998) study on public reactions to websites identified two new aspects of motivation: "personal involvement" and "continuous reports".
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is argued that it is possible to find out if a person is lying by interpreting microexpressions correctly.
In his essay "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks illustrated how people unable to understand the language spoken due to brain damage are, however, able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even claims that such skills in interpreting human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century, research has shown the existence of two pools of genetic variability, i.e. hidden variability and express variability.
With the mutation a new genetic variability is added, with the selection it is eliminated from the pool of expressed variability.
Generation after generation, segregation and recombination redistribute the variability back and forth between the two pools.
For a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans, it is difficult to meet its needs for amino acids with the plant resources available in the savannah.
Moreover, the failure to carry out these activities has serious consequences: slowing down growth, malnutrition and, in the end, even death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins present in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us they are difficult to digest, unless they are cooked.
Animal feeds (such as ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but provide a high amount of protein, containing all essential amino acids.
In the light of all this, it should not be surprising that our ancestors themselves have solved their "protein problem" in a certain sense as today's savannah chimpanzees do.
The sleep interruption is the process of intentional awakening that takes place during the normal sleep period, followed by a recovery of sleep (10–60 minutes later).
This process can easily be put into practice by using a relatively silent alarm clock to lead you to a state of consciousness, without waking up completely.
If you decide to reset your watch in your sleep, you can put it across the room, so you'll have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options focused on biorhythm include the consumption of many liquids before sleeping (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties), which force you to get up from bed to urinate.
A person enjoys an inner peace proportionally opposed to the tension existing in his body and spirit.
Less tension, more positive is the existing life force. Each of us has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. This goal is hindered only by our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's teachings, but has been enriched by the path of love of the Mahayano rite and by various Indian yoga techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It has a foundation in Kundalini Yoga, meditation and a path of omnicomprehensive love.
Kundalini Yoga activates Kundalini energy (energy of illumination) through the use of yoga positions, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
Deity Yoga is the focus of Tibetan meditation. Through the representation of various deities, the energy channels are cleaned, the chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment develops.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, system, procedural and cultural conflicts caused the break between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the allies of the past had become enemies; thus the Cold War began.
It would have lasted for the next 40 years and would have been fought for real, by mercenary armies, in the battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other countries.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken down; the only option was to beat in retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridge head.
However, these plans soon proved obsolete, when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers advanced and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga peace treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
Exploiting ships for freight transport is certainly the most efficient way to move large volumes of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of the marines has always been to guarantee the country the protection of its ability to move people and goods, while at the same time opposing the same ability of the enemies to move their people and their goods.
One of the recent examples in support of this theory and most noteworthy is the battle of the Atlantic during the Second World War. During the battle, the Americans tried to move men and goods across the Atlantic Ocean to support Britain.
At the same time the German Navy, using mainly submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany would probably have had the opportunity to conquer Britain, as it had done in the rest of Europe.
Apparently, goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains, Iran.
They began to be bred by ancient cultures and tribes to have easily available milk, fleece, meat and skin.
Domestic goats were usually bred in herds left free to move on the hills or in other pasture areas, often cared for by goats (similar to shepherds) who were often children or adolescents. These methods of shepherding are still used nowadays.
As early as the 16th century, the wagonways were built in England.
Although they were simply made of parallel wooden axes, the wagonways, when compared with the slightly more rugged roads of the period, allowed the horses that traveled them to reach higher speeds and to move heavier loads.
The rails were introduced relatively early to keep the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was understood that the rails would be more efficient if they had an iron bar at the top.
It became a common practice, even though iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels gave way to the iron wheels. In 1767 the first rails made their appearance completely in iron.
The first means of transport that man knew was the legs. Human beings began to walk in an upright position two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning "erect man").
His predecessor, the Australopithecus, did not usually walk erect.
Signs of specialization for bipede gait are present in the fossils of Australopiteco dating back to 4.2-3.9 million years, although it is possible that the Sahelanthropus walked on two legs already seven million years ago.
To try to mitigate to some extent the future suffering we can start adopting more environmentally friendly lifestyles, we can adhere to the environmental movement and also do activism.
In many cases this works only as a symptomatic treatment. If we do not want only a temporary solution, we should find the ultimate cause of the problems and disable it.
It is quite evident that the world has changed a lot because of the scientific and technological advances of humanity, while the problems have increased due to the overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of human beings.
After Congress adopted it on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap's printery a few blocks away.
In the night they were produced between 150 and 200 copies, today known as "The Dunlap posters".
The document was read publicly for the first time on 8 July in the courtyard of Independence Hall and was entrusted to John Nixon.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which had her read to her troops stationed in New York on July 9, while a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 edges of Dunlap still known are the oldest existing copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
According to many paleontologists of today a category of dinosaurs has survived and is still alive. They are what we call birds.
Many tend not to consider dinosaurs because of feathers and their ability to fly.
Yet birds have many characteristics that unite them with dinosaurs.
Like the T-Rex, they are equipped with feet with scales and claws, lay their eggs and walk on the two hind legs.
Ultimately, the manipulation of information encoded as binary numbers is the basis of all the computers currently used.
A binary number can have only one of the two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and in the technical computer language these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Its symptoms, including vomiting, are very general, so much so that an immediate diagnosis is impossible.
The main indication of internal poisoning could be the presence in the home of a container of medicines or open harmful chemicals.
Check whether there are first aid instructions on the label for that specific poison.
The term acarus is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from the familiarity in ancient times with bedbugs, insects that have strongly adapted to become parasites of man.
Both killer bedbugs and bedbugs are nestiles, i.e. adapted to live in the nest or home of their host.
In the United States of America, multiple sclerosis (MS) records about 400,000 known cases, ranking first among the neurological diseases affecting young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a pathology that affects the central nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that the chances of developing MS among females are double compared to males.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their own interest, or in that of their child.
These couples have the option of choosing an adoption plan for their child.
In one adoption, natural parents renounce their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary objective of science is to understand the way the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most of the scientific investigation.
But it is not only experimentation, since an experiment is a test that is used to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses; even asking questions and making observations allows to guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle’s views on the various subjects of knowledge, including psychology, were accepted.
With the progressive decline of the Greek language, the West has been isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have observed that physiological rhythms and behavior depend decisively on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms have been documented, which are not only reactions to external periodic signals, relative to most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators, whose free cycle continues for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the first experiments to suggest that DNA was a genetic material was that conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, i.e. viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments highlighting the DNA of the bacteriophagus with radioactive phosphorus or the bacteriophagus protein with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations may have a number of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the relevance of the piece of genetic material involved, and depending on whether the affected cells belong to the germ line.
Mutations that can be transmitted to children are only those at the level of germ cells; mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including wildlife and flora.
Examples of activities on site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visits to parks and the study of information about the ecosystem.
For example, by visiting, photographing and learning about Borneo orangutans.
Every morning, people leave the small country to drive to work, crossing other people whose place of work is the place from which they just left.
In this dynamic journey, everyone is somehow connected to a private car-based transport system, which they support at the same time.
Today science reveals that this massive carbon-based economy has forced the biosphere outside of one of its stability conditions that has allowed human evolution over the last two million years.
Every person participates in social life and uses the transport systems, of which almost everyone complains.
In developed countries it is rare to hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or the bridges falling into ruin.
Why do transport systems attract so many complaints, why are they rejected every day? Are engineers designing them that are incompetent, or are there deeper motivations?
The "Traffic Flow" is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one point to another and of the interactions they generate with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is complex because drivers' behaviour cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, driver behaviour tends to fall into a reasonably constant range, so traffic flows in turn tend to show reasonable constancy and can be represented generically in a mathematical way.
In order to obtain a more accurate representation of the traffic flow, the three main variables were correlated: (1) flow rate, (2) density and (3) speed.
These reports are useful for planning, designing and managing road structures.
The insects were the first animals to fly. The ability to fly allowed them to escape their enemies more easily and to find food and companions more efficiently.
Most insects benefit from the ability to fold their wings along the body.
This allows them to take advantage of a greater variety of small ravines to hide from predators.
Of all the insects that exist today, the only ones that are unable to fold their wings are dragonflies and ephemerals.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
For some, he was right, but many others believed the opposite, namely that the solar system, including the Sun itself (and also the other stars), moved around the Earth.
Which makes sense, because we don't feel like the Earth is moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the largest river and the second longest on Earth. It carries an amount of water equal to 8 times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the largest river on Earth, with a width that in some places reaches six miles.
The total 20% of the water that flows from the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long, with thousands of smaller tributaries pouring into it.
They continued to build stone pyramids until the end of the Old Kingdom, but despite this the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in terms of the technical greatness and excellence of their realization.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom remained enchanted by admiring the monuments of their ancestors, who at that time were much more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City consists of about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the one with the least population.
The language of Vatican City for official legislation and communications is Italian.
Italian is also the daily language of use spoken by most people working within the state, while Latin is often used in religious services.
In Vatican City all citizens are Roman Catholics.
Man has begun to know the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper already in ancient times: these elements can be discovered in nature in native form and it is possible to extract them in a fairly simple way with the help of primitive instruments.
According to the philosopher Aristotle, everything is composed of a combination of one or more of the following four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
These actually resemble more of the four states of matter, i.e. (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma. However, he also theorized that they were transformed into new substances, forming what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains numerous elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Obviously, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There may also be alloys composed of minimal amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
In the universe, everything is made of matter and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are incredibly tiny, so much so that trillions of them could get into the point at the end of this sentence.
After his invention, the pencil proved to be a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and less and less widespread use.
Today everyone writes messages on computer screens and never has the need to approach a pencil sharpener.
We can only ask ourselves what fate the keyboard will have when something newer comes.
The principle that energy is needed to put together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons is at the base of the fission bomb operation.
Basically, it's like rolling a heavy cart on a hill. So, by dividing the core further, part of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to break in the presence of a scarce or nothing thrust.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the nearest side and 100 km on the farthest side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountain areas.
The maria could be more numerous on the nearby side because the crust is thinner. This facilitated the ascent of the lava to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what pleases or attracts individuals.
According to these theories, people present certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they become adults.
These theories analyze what some people share and move them to do what they do, and what are the factors in the context in which they live that drive them to do or not to do certain things.
Among the most popular content theories are Maslow's Theory of the Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two Factor Theory.
In general, when managers start to run their former colleagues, two behaviors can emerge. On the one hand, there are those who try to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
The manager of this type finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, implement disciplinary actions, evaluate performance, define and assign responsibilities.
At the opposite extreme, the manager becomes a completely different person, who feels that he has to change the whole work of the team and do it his own.
In the end, the leader is the person who ultimately is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This attitude often generates disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The standard of excellence of virtual teams is similar to that of conventional teams, but with some small differences.
The members of the virtual team often have the function of contact point for their next physical group.
They often have more autonomy than the members of conventional teams, since meetings can take place depending on the different time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
The existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a fundamental element of a virtual team.
It is called "invisible team" the management team to which each member refers and is the one that sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organisation have the will to deal with the long process leading to the construction of a learning organisation? A good reason to implement organisational learning concepts can be innovation.
When you can use all the resources available effectively in all the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Consequently, the process of collaboration within an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
In order for an organisation to be defined as innovative, it is necessary for leaders to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) illustrates the theory of continuum as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological results have demonstrated the physical existence of a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. The research area becomes more restricted and therefore much more precise.
The link between brain disease and behavior is the basis of scientists' research.
It has long been known that certain types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumors can affect behavior and alter certain mental functions.
The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that have never been observed before.
This offers us a great deal of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our mental processes.
Although it has a strong sci-fi connotation, AI is a very important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
AI research includes the creation of machines to automate operations that require intelligent behavior.
Some examples of application are the control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to the diagnosis and questions of customers, as well as the recognition of writing, voice and facial.
These things have become distinct disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real problems.
The AI system is now often used in the economic, medical, engineering and military fields, as well as being integrated into various software applications for home computers and video games.
Trips are a fundamental part of teaching. Often teachers would like to take their students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The solution is offered by technology with virtual trips. Students can see the artifacts of museums, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in class.
Sharing a virtual school trip is also a great excuse to share experiences and travel reflections with future classes.
For example, every year the students of Bennet School, North Carolina, design a website on their trip to the capital; the website is redesigned every year, but the previous versions are kept online and become an album.
Blogs can also help to improve the writing of students. Often, in fact, their first experiences with blogs are characterized by a poor grammar and spelling, but generally the presence of an audience changes things.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, to avoid negative reviews the blog author is committed to improving writing.
The blogs also "force students to become more aware of the moment that surrounds them".The need to nurture the interest of the public motivates students to be ingenious and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that aims to encourage collaboration and develop student learning well beyond normal school day.
The correct use of blogs "can help students to become more critical and analytical. Actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their position within the writings of others, as well as outlining their perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming and bilingual capital, full of art galleries and museums that tell the past and present of the country.
Further south are the Niagara Falls and to the north you can admire the natural and pristine beauty of the Muskoka region and much more.
All this and more makes Ontario typically Canadian according to the views of foreigners.
The larger northern areas are sparsely populated, some of which are almost uninhabited wilderness.
If you compare the population, the result can be surprising for many: in the United States the number of African American citizens is higher than that of Canadian citizens.
East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and its natural heritage makes it a continent in its own right.
Almost all smaller islands, known as luxurious seaside resorts, are mostly independent nations or associated with France.
In the lands the Arabs also brought Islam, which took a long journey to the Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, the discovery of the Cape route, from Europe to India, by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama paved the way for European influence and colonialism.
To the north, the region is bordered by Sahel, while to the south and west it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
For travellers: everyone is recommended to declare that they are married, regardless of their actual civil status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can give rise to what they consider to be harassment, and that it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Have the firmness to reject men, and do not be afraid to oppose them (cultural differences or not, there is no justification!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC; under the name of Anfa, it was a port of strategic importance used by Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed it to rebuild it under the name of Casa Branca, which they abandoned in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city called Daru l-Badya, then called Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who chose these places for their commercial bases.
Throughout Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities for shopping.
In the surroundings of the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tajin, ceramics, leather items, narghilè and lots of chincaglieria, but all this is reserved only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, not far from Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, burying most of the streets of the city, especially those of the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, it is appropriate to document itself well before making any visits outside Goma, so as to assess well the state of the clashes that still persist in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing to the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as being one of the least expensive opportunities to see the mountain gorillas of Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (taxi-motocycle) to move to Goma. The normal price (in local currency) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short run.
Even as a result of its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuctu" ended up becoming a metaphor of exotic and distant land.
Today Timbuktu is a fallen city, but due to its reputation it remains a tourist attraction, also equipped with an airport.
In 1990 it was included in the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites that are in danger, due to the threat posed by desert sands.
In the special of Henry Louis Gates by PBS "Wonders of the African World" was one of the main stages.
With its more arabescent touch than African, the city is clearly distinguished from the rest of the country.
The Kruger National Park (Kruger National Park, KNP) is located north-east of South Africa and winds east along the border with Mozambique, north border with Zimbabwe, and its southern border is represented by the Crocodile River.
With an area of 19,500 km2, the park comprises 14 different ecozones, each of which provides support for a different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the most important of South African national parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, there are daily contributions for conservation and entry to the park.
Buying a Wild Card could also be useful, as it allows access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island, which gives its name to the entire territory, is the main destination for many tourists.
The series of buildings that form the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a shimmering bar chart, even more evident because framed by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To enjoy the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and visit Kowloon's waterfront across the street.
Most of the urban development of the island of Hong Kong has focused on the reclaimed lands of the northern coast, densely populated.
This is the place that English settlers chose for themselves, so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this land, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans are the largest coastal strip of mangroves in the world. It covers 80 km (50 mi) from the coast in the hinterland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of forest included in Indian territory is named Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only made up of mangrove swamps: in them there is also what remains of the imposing jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third consists of swampy areas.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have become a sanctuary for wildlife; in the area is estimated the presence of 400 royal tigers of Bengal and about 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses leave from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although many (especially those heading east and to Jakarta/Bumthang) leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since often the service buses between different districts are full, it will be good to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Most neighborhoods are reached by comfortable and robust small Japanese buses.
Shared taxis are a convenient and fast way to reach nearby locations, including Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a bridge that connects the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
Its two pylons have a height of 83 meters, is 378 meters long and has two lanes 3.50 meters wide.
Under the bridge the free vertical space is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but the opening to traffic took place only in March 2017.
In September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are likely to be completed, the bridge should be fully operational.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group living in eastern Paraguay. They were seminomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and the Payaguá, who lived in hunting, harvesting and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "The Great Province of the Indies", was born in the 16th century from the meeting between Spanish conquerors and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period that lasted three centuries, the period of colonization.
Since the foundation of Asunción, which took place in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain much of its indigenous identity and peculiarities.
Everyone knows that Argentina boasts one of the best teams and polo players in the world.
In December, in the Las Cañitas polo fields, the most important tournament of the year takes place.
Here you can watch smaller tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
To receive information on tournaments and the purchase of tickets for polo matches, please contact Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The Falkland have their official currency, the Falkland pound (FKP), the value of which is equivalent to that of the British pound (GBP).
The only island bank, located in Stanley in front of the FIC West store, offers currency exchange service.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands. Stanley can often also be paid with credit cards and US dollars.
It is likely that on the outlying islands they will not accept credit cards, although British and US currencies can be accepted. Check ahead with the owners to decide on an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland's currency outside the islands, so change the money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; during the summer months temperatures above 30°C are quite normal.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely reach below zero, but the combination of wind and humidity gives the feeling of a temperature lower than that marked by the thermometer.
There are no defined "dry" and "rainy" seasons: the amount of rain remains almost constant throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to the sight of man, the fauna is still wild and must not be fed or disturbed.
The park authorities recommend keeping a distance of at least 100 yards/metres from bears and wolves and a distance of 25 yards/metres from all other wild animals.
No matter how docile they may seem: bison, elk, deer, bears, practically all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors suffer injuries because they have not kept an adequate distance. It is necessary to leave these animals a suitable space because they are large, wild and potentially dangerous animals.
Also keep in mind that smells can attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid taking with you or cooking foods with very strong odors, and try to keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of the Samoa Islands. It is located on the island of Upolu and its population has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded between 1850 and 1860 and is the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In this port the notorious naval stalemate of 1889 occurred, in which seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, with the exception of a British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the killing of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the supreme leader.
There are many beaches, since Auckland is located between two ports. The most popular are divided into three areas.
The beaches overlooking the Pacific Ocean of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) extend from Long Bay to the north to Devonport to the south.
It is mainly sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and most of them enjoy the shade of the pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive in Auckland Central, in the elegant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, overlook the harbour of Waitemata.
These beaches are suitable for families, sometimes a little crowded, surrounded by a wide selection of shops. You can swim safely.
The best known local beer is a non-complex, pleasant and refreshing beer called "Number One". The other local beer is called "Manta".
You can have many French wines, but the Australian and New Zealand wines could face the journey better.
Local tap water is totally safe to drink, but if you are afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
According to Australians, flat white coffee comes from a foreign idea. Espresso is short black coffee, cappuccino is covered with cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is at the same level as Belgian chocolate. Fruit juices are expensive, but very good.
Throughout the year, many trips to the coral reef are carried out and injuries to one of these causes on the coral reef are rare.
Always ask the authorities for advice, follow the instructions and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
The cubomeduses appear from October to April near the beaches and estuaries of the rivers north of Seventeen Seventy. Outside of this period can only be found occasionally.
Sharks are present, but rarely attack the man. Most sharks fear him and tend to keep away.
The habitat of the saltwater crocodiles consists mainly of the estuaries of the rivers north of Rockhampton, not living them actively in the ocean.
Booking in advance, the traveller has the serenity of finding a place to sleep once he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often enter into agreements with certain hotels, but it is still possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through the same agencies.
Travel agencies generally offer packages including breakfast, transfers to/from the airport or even combined flight+hotel packages.
They can also keep the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain additional documents necessary for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests must be submitted to the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, most participants decide to camp on site, considering this aspect a crucial element of the experience.
To be close to the center of the action you need to arrive early and win a space close to music.
Remember that once the music is finished on the main stages, there may be sections of the festival where the music lasts until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as the ice crossing causes quite annoying noises for those who are most exposed to it.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include time to explore the city. Cruise passengers are granted visa exemption (check conditions).
Generally, casinos do everything to increase as much as possible the time and money spent by their guests. Generally, there are no windows, no clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer exclusive food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests' moods high so that they stay.
In some places alcoholic beverages are offered by the house. However, the state of drunkenness alters the judgment and every good gambler knows how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who decides to drive at high altitudes or on mountain passes should consider snow, ice or temperatures close to zero.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is reduced and it is not possible to drive as when you are on clean asphalt.
During a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in no time to keep you stuck.
Rainfall and snow gusts, or the formation of ice or condensation on the vehicle windows, can also reduce visibility.
However, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic continues to flow almost continuously throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the heart of the holiday of many visitors.
In its popular use, the term safari refers to journeys made by land, in particular in the savannah, to see the beautiful African wildlife.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to cars, so a normal equipment is enough to get a good view.
The lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes fearful and for this reason it is possible to observe them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "bush walk", "hiking safaris", or "walk safaris") is an excursion that can last a few hours or more days.
Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2012, and part of the events will take place in other locations around Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympic Games. The first Olympics were held in 1964.
If your reservation for flights and accommodation for 2020 was made before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary between them, however most of the cancellation policies related to the coronavirus, at the end of March 2020, do not arrive until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
It is expected that the cost of most tickets for events will be between 2,500 ¥ and 130,000 ¥, while normal tickets will cost around ¥7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can make drying easier. Many hotels offer the use of iron and ironing board, even if they are not present in the room.
If you do not have an iron, or if you do not like to wear ironed socks, you can try it with a hairdryer, if you have it available.
Be careful not to subject the tissues to too high temperatures, to avoid shrinkage or, in the worst case, burns.
There are various ways to sanitize water and some of these are more effective against specific risks.
In some areas it is enough to boil the water for one minute, in others it takes many minutes.
The effectiveness of the filters varies, so in case of doubt it is appropriate to evaluate the purchase of water packaged in sealed bottles from a reliable company.
Travelers may come into contact with animal pests that are not spread in their regions of origin.
Parasites can spoil food, cause irritation or, at worst, cause allergic reactions, as well as transmitting poison or infections.
The same infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can hurt or kill people by force are usually not qualified as harmful animals.
Duty Free purchases are an opportunity to buy tax-free products in certain locations.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The section of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh motorway between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most difficult driving conditions, as it often crosses isolated areas between vegetation.
If you do not have the habit of driving on country roads, you should keep your eyes open, as steep slopes, narrow streets and narrow curves predominate.
The speed limits displayed are considerably lower than those applied in previous and subsequent sections (usually 35-40 mph / 56-64 km/h). Their strict observance is extremely important.
Strangely, however, in this area the level of coverage of mobile phone service is much higher than in other parts of the route, for example in Pennsylvania Wilds.
The German desserts are quite good and in Bavaria they are quite tasty and varied, similar to those of nearby Austria further south.
Fruit desserts are a timeless classic, from those with apples available all year round to those with cherries and plums, which make their appearance during the summer.
Several German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. The most popular cakes often accompany very well with a strong cup of coffee.
Those who want to taste sweets, small but rich in flavor, can orient themselves on what, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish prepared with herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry may occur both "dry" and "wet", depending on the amount of liquid contained.
In northern India and Pakistan, yoghurt is normally used for curries in the inland regions; in southern India and in some other coastal region of the subcontinent, coconut milk is more used.
Given the presence of 17,000 islands to choose from, the term Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines that meet in the country.
However, when used without further specification, the term generally indicates foods originating in the central and eastern part of the main island, Java.
The Javanese cuisine, now widely spread throughout the archipelago, offers a series of dishes of simple preparation; its predominant flavors are given by the use of peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The brackets are supports for the knight's feet and are hung on both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the rider but may present security problems because of the possibility that the rider's feet will be blocked there.
If a jockey is lifted by a horse but has a foot stuck in the bracket, he could be dragged by the horse that runs away. To minimize this risk, there are some security measures that can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with heel and a smooth and rather thin sole.
Later, some saddles, especially the English saddles, put in safety bars, which make a leather stirrup pull off the saddle when, in the event of a fall, the rider pulls it back.
Cochamó Valley: the most important climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, where a large number of huge granite walls and cliffs are built.
Peaks of the peaks include breathtaking views. Climbers from all over the world continuously trace new routes on its potentially endless walls.
Free-drinking snow sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very popular and provide for snow-slipping thanks to the use of skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is one of the main tourist activities and boasts many enthusiasts, sometimes also called "ski booms" (ski skis), who devote entire periods of holiday to skiing in a particular ski area.
The principle at the base of the ski is very ancient: the first rock paintings with the representation of humans skiing date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport has its origins at least in the 17th century; in 1861 the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by the Norwegians.
Hiking on skis: the activity is also called off-piste, ski mountaineering or hiking on skis.
It is connected, even if it does not usually include them, to ski touring or skimo, which are practiced on steep terrain and require much more rigid skis and boots.
Think of the ski slope as a hiking trail.
If the conditions are good, you will be able to cover distances somewhat greater than those walked, but only very rarely will you reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on beaten slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent but consists of many independent countries. Normally, to travel through several countries you should apply for a visa and go through passport control several times.
However, in this respect, the Schengen area functions rather as a single country.
If you stay within this area, you can normally go from one border to another without having to pass passport checks again.
Similarly, if you are in possession of a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for individual Member States, thus saving time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universal definition of what makes an artifact an antique. Some tax agencies consider such an object that is at least 100 years old.
The definition shows geographical differences with respect to the age limit that may be lower, as in the case of North America compared to Europe.
Craft objects could be defined as antiques, although more recent than similar items produced in series.
Reindeer breeding is an important source of livelihood for Sámi and the culture on which this trade is based is also the basis of many other professions.
Even in the course of time, not all Sámi have always been involved in the breeding of reindeer on a large scale; some lived in fishing, hunting and similar activities, using reindeer mainly as work animals.
Today many Sámi have modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sápmi, the territory of the Sámi.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma people, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and a wrong perception of Roma people.
Should a warning be issued to travellers for the destination you visit, there may be consequences for your travel health insurance or your insurance in case of travel cancellation.
You may also be interested in the opinions of governments other than yours, but keep in mind that these opinions are aimed at the citizens of those governments.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may encounter different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Notices are simply a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The opinions reported are often superficial, generic and simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
"Averse weather conditions" is the general expression used to indicate any dangerous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social distress or loss of human life.
In every part of the world extreme weather conditions can occur, and there are different types, depending on geography, topography and weather conditions.
Strong gusts of wind, hail, higher rainfall and uncontrolled fires are manifestations and consequences of adverse weather conditions, similar to thunderstorms, tornadoes, sea trumpets and cyclones.
Weather phenomena of strong regional and seasonal intensity include storms, snowstorms, ice storms and sandstorms.
Travelers are advised to find out about adverse weather conditions affecting their area, as they may affect travel planning.
Anyone who plans to visit a potentially war zone country must support vocational training.
Searching on the Internet 'Course on hostile environments' is likely to find the address of a local company.
A course will normally deal with all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually using practical experience.
A course normally lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing games, as well as many first aid and sometimes weapons training activities.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in nature are widespread, while few publications deal with war zones.
Travellers planning surgery to change sex abroad must make sure that they have the valid documents for their return trip with them.
The intention on the part of governments to issue passports with no indication of sex (X) or up-to-date documents to match a desired name and gender is variable.
Equally variable is the willingness of foreign governments to accept such documents.
Inspections at security controls also became much more thorough in the post-September 11, 2001.
Transgender people in the pre-operative phase should not expect to pass the controls without their privacy and dignity being affected.
The currents of the river are formed by the return flow of the waves that break on the beach, often near a coral reef or similar formations.
Due to the underwater topology, the flow of return is concentrated in some deeper sections where a strong current towards the open sea can form.
Most deaths occur due to fatigue in an attempt to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming again will not be harder than normal.
Try to locate an area where you're not likely to be trapped again, or consider whether to wait for help, depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted.
The shock from return is manifested in a shorter time than the cultural shock (being a "honey moon" phase smaller), lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travellers who have found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it difficult to adapt to the culture of their country of origin.
Upon returning home after living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the uses of your culture of origin.
In the first experience abroad, it is likely to have met patients and understanding people, aware that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
Many people did not imagine patience and awareness were necessary even for those returning home.
The spectacle of sounds and lights of the pyramid is the most interesting there is in the area for children.
Before the beginning of the show, you can admire the pyramids immersed in darkness and silence.
Normally you always hear the noise caused by tourists and sellers. The show of sounds and lights is just like a book of stories.
The Sphinx becomes the background and the narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected on the pyramids and each pyramid is illuminated.
Claimed by various countries, the southern Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have the largest number of bases, of which sixteen are active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island is the largest and is home to the town of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among the other islands are Livingston Island and Deception; in the latter, the caldera of a still active volcano filled with water from a magnificent natural harbor.
The land of Ellsworth is the region located south of the peninsula and overlooking the sea of Bellingshausen.
Here the peninsula mountains merge on the plateau, and then emerge again and form the Ellsworth mountains, a 360 km chain cut in two by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part, known as the Chain of the Sentinel, boasts the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches 4892 m with Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone can be the only possible alternative.
A satellite phone is not usually a substitute for the mobile phone, because to call you must be in the open air with the view clear up to the satellite.
The service is often used by recreational craft, including recreational craft, as well as by missions that need data and voice at a distance.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
One of the increasingly popular options among those who plan to take a sabbatical year is to travel and learn.
It is particularly widespread among new graduates, since they can take a year before starting college without compromising their education.
In many cases enrolling in a course abroad in the sabbatical year can actually increase the chances of resuming higher education upon returning to their country of origin.
Usually enrolling in these educational programs requires the payment of a fee.
Finland is the ideal destination for those who love sailing. In the "Land of a thousand lakes" there are also thousands of islands, inside the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
It doesn't have to be a yacht for archipelagos and lakes.
Although coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are certainly large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Nautical is Finland's national pastime, where one boat is counted every seven or eight people.
This is also the case in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in general it is quite unusual (e.g. in the Netherlands the ratio is one to forty).
Most of the Baltic cruises include a multi-day stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that it is possible to visit the historic town for two entire days, returning on the ship in the evening to sleep.
For the descent to the ground you will not need a separate visa (starting in 2009) using the excursions on board.
Some brochures also offer cruises in Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea, moreover the visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Travelling by plane can scare people of all ages and of any condition, especially if they have never flown before or had some traumatic experience.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is not unlike the personal fears and aversions that many people manifest towards other things.
For some people, understanding how airplanes work and what happens during a flight may prove useful to overcome a fear based on what is unknown, or the fact that they do not have control.
The couriers are well paid to deliver products quickly. Often the timing is very important in the case of company documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repair.
For some journeys, larger companies use their own aircraft, but for other routes and in the case of smaller companies problems emerged.
On some routes, shipments by air would take days for unloading and customs.
The only way to get it there faster would be to ship it as hold baggage, and that's where you come in, since airline regulations don't allow you to ship luggage without a passenger.
To fly in first class or in business class the most obvious way is to pay a nice amount for the privilege (or, even better, convince your company to do so).
However, the price to be paid is high: approximately, you can expect to pay out up to four times the normal economic fare for business trips and up to eleven times the rate for those in first class!
In general, on direct flights from A to B it is not even worth looking for discounts on first class or business class seats.
Airlines are well aware that there is a category of travellers willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting quickly and comfortably to their destination, and as a result they apply certain rates.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău and the local language is Romanian. However Russian is also widespread.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that in the past has been the scene of an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, with its own government and currency, but not recognized by any UN member country.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations between these two areas of Moldova have been restored.
The predominant religion in Moldova is the Christian Orthodox religion.
Smyrna is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million inhabitants; it is the second largest port after Istanbul and an important crossroads for transport.
The ancient town of Smyrna is spread over a huge bay, is surrounded by mountains and is currently a modern, evolved and active shopping center.
Although there is an atmosphere in the city more similar to that of Mediterranean Europe than that of traditional Turkey, the wide avenues, the buildings with glass facades and the modern shopping centers are dotted with the characteristic roofs of red tiles, the market of the eighteenth century and ancient mosques and churches.
In the village of Haldarsvik you can enjoy beautiful views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and you can visit a unique octagonal church.
In the churchyard, on some of the tombs, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
A half hour is enough to walk around the charming village.
To the north is the romantic and charming city of Sintra, easily accessible. It has become famous in the eyes of foreigners thanks to the brilliant tale of its splendors written by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb 403 bus regularly connects with Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north, visit the great sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (place of worship), a place of Marian apparitions famous all over the world.
Remember that the site you are visiting is basically a mass grave, and has almost incalculable meaning for an important part of the world’s population.
There are still many men and women who have survived these places, and many others who have seen their loved ones murdered or put to work until death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves. Avoid jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Avoid disfiguring these places by smearing the structures with marks or graffiti.
In the city of Barcelona the official languages are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half of the population prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority are able to understand it; Spanish is known to virtually everyone.
However, most signals are written exclusively in Catalan, which is by law the first official language.
Spanish, however, is also widely used for public transport and other services.
By metro, ordinary ads are only in Catalan. Any unscheduled service interruptions are communicated in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese, thanks to an automatic system.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude and presumptuous.
Although it is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to find yourself well in Paris is to behave as best as possible, relating itself as a "bien élevé" (well-educated person). This will definitely facilitate your movements.
The rough outward appearance of the Parisians will vanish quickly if you show off some basic good manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is rich in woods, mostly beech, pitch and fir trees, and is characterized by a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to a variety of microclimates, soils and different altitude levels, it has a wide variety of plant communities.
The area also hosts a wide variety of animal and bird species.
In these places live rare species such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wild cat and the cedar rooster, next to several other animal species more diffused.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide stoles for women who arrive unprepared, but if you already have one, especially if in bright colors, you will earn a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear long trousers under their knees.
These can also be borrowed from the warehouse at the entrance; however, the clothes are not washed after each user, so wearing these skirts you may not feel comfortable. For men, a size unique for all!
Maiorchina cuisine, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil everywhere.
Pa amb Oli is a simple popular dinner, typical of the summer season: bread with olive oil, tomato and all the sauces available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, in addition to the pronoun "Sie" used for the form of courtesy that stands for "She", always start with capital letters, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important mechanism for distinguishing certain verbs and complements.
This aspect probably also facilitates reading, although the need to understand whether a verb or adjective is used in a noun form makes writing quite complex.
The Italian pronunciation is relatively simple since most words are pronounced as they are written.
The main letters to be careful are the c and the g, since their pronunciation changes according to the vowel that follows.
Also make sure to pronounce differently "r" and "rr": dear means beloved, while chariot means carriage.
Persian has a relatively simple and most often regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this basic grammar manual could help you a lot with Persian grammar and understanding phrases.
It goes without saying that if you already know a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, people with little knowledge of the Spanish language can come to the precipitous conclusion that Portuguese is quite similar and therefore should not be studied separately.
Usually nowadays, premodern observers are obsolete and act as museums or educational places.
Since light pollution in their golden age did not represent a problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or campuses, more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern telescopes for research are huge structures in remote areas where weather conditions are favorable.
The admiration of cherry blossoming, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept was native to China, where the flowering of the plums was preferred.
In Japan, the first festivals for cherry blossoming were organized by the emperor only for himself and for other members of the aristocracy near the imperial court.
Plants give their best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even "only" one specimen.
If you visit an Italian garden, even collecting some specimens of plants will cost you the removal from this place, without discussion.
In general, Singapore is a very safe and easy-to-run city; you can buy virtually anything once you arrive.
But being in the "tropical heights", only a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with the heat (always) and the strong sun (more rarely, when the sky is clear).
Some buses also head north to Hebron, the traditional place where the patriarchs of the Bible Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives were buried.
Make sure that the bus you want to take reaches the interior of Hebron and does not stop at the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
The inland waterways can be an excellent theme around which to organize a holiday.
For example, you can visit the castles in the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley, you can take a cruise to visit the interesting cities of the Danube or you can navigate the Erie Canal.
In addition, they define the paths of hiking trails and bike paths well known.
Christmas is one of the most important feasts of Christianity and celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Most of the traditions associated with this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
A tradition is to spend Easter night staying awake in an outdoor place to admire the sunrise.
There are of course Christian theological explanations underlying this tradition, but it could well be a pre-Christian ritual linked to spring and fertility.
In the more traditional Churches, a Easter vigil is frequently celebrated on the Saturday night of Easter weekend, with congregations often beginning the ceremony at the stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally came to the islands would swim, fly, or float.
Since the distance from the continent was considerable, the mammals could not face the journey. This made the giant turtle become the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
The Galapagos were introduced to numerous mammals such as goats, horses, cows, rats, dogs and cats after the arrival of the man.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic territories during the winter, you can experience the polar night when the sun remains below the horizon.
This phenomenon offers the possibility to witness the northern dawn, because the sky remains dark almost all day long.
Since the territories are sparsely populated, light pollution is often not a problem and you can also enjoy the stars.
In Japan, the culture of work is more hierarchical and formal than that to which Westerners tend to be accustomed.
The office clothing normally consists of a suit and tie or suit and is addressed to colleagues with their surname or professional title.
Harmony of the workplace is of crucial importance, since it places emphasis on the commitment of the group rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often have to receive the approval of their superiors for any decision, and they are expected to follow the instructions without asking questions.
