Members of the Assembly of Wales are concerned to "make clowns"
There is dismay among some members of the Assembly at the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal arose as a result of the plans to change the name of the assembly in Parliament in Wales.
Members of the Assembly of the entire political arena are concerned that this may sound ridiculous.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly said that his party is concerned that "it can rhyme with Twp and Pwp."
For readers who do not live in Wales: In Welsh, twp means idiot and pwp means poop.
A member of the Plaid Assembly said that the group as a whole "was not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party claimed to be "open" towards the name change, but pointed out that only a small verbal step separates MWP from Muppet (prick).
In this context, the letter W in Welsh is pronounced in a similar manner to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter U.
The assembly committee, which is currently preparing for the introduction of name changes, said: "The final decision on possible descriptors of what the members of the assembly will be called will obviously be a topic of debate for the members themselves."
The law of the Government of Wales of 2017 granted the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which received broad support for the possibility of calling the Parliament Assembly in Wales.
As regards the title of Members of the Assembly, the Commission expressed its preference in favour of Welsh Parliament Members or WMP, but the MWP option received greater support in a public consultation.
AMs are apparently proposing alternative options, but difficulties in reaching consensus could turn out to be a headache for President Elin Jones, who should come forward with a legislative proposal on the changes within a few weeks.
The Reform Act will include further changes to the functioning of the Assembly, including regulations on the exclusion of AMs and the design of the committee system.
AM will get the final vote on their name during the discussion of the legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls for the referendum on changing the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will decide whether to change the name of their country to "North Macedonian Republic."
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to put an end to a dispute that has been going on for decades with neighboring Greece, which owns a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long stated that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim on its territories and has repeatedly opposed its applications for membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a plebiscite opponent for name change, said he would not take the result of the vote into account.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that change of name is simply the price to be paid for membership of the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's shush while the churches of Harlem are in trouble
"The elders I spoke to say that in the past there was a bar and a church at every corner," said Adams.
"There's neither today."
He explained that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People socialize differently today," he explained.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood lounges that people regularly attend."
As for the churches, he worries that the money from the sale of the assets will not last as long as the leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will go back to where they started."
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums filled with the kind of people who will not help the remaining shrines in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings are white," he says, "and for this reason they will speed up the time when these churches will close completely because it is unlikely that much of the people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by fraternities before Harlem became a black district - Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St Martin's a decade later.
The initial white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A black congregation praying in a nearby church took possession of the building.
St. Martin's was acquired by a black congregation headed by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott against dealers on 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 seriously damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's parishioners planned his reconstruction, they also ordered the music box.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly called the music box "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the music box in July called him in a different way: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the first music box in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who switched to a larger music box at the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has been staged in St. Martin's in recent months has been a complicated plot of architects and entrepreneurs, some presented by the church's lay leaders, others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish assembly, the governing body of the parish, made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July about its concerns about the diocese "trying to unload the costs" on the parish assembly although the latter had not been involved in hiring architects and entrepreneurs sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark hurts a 13-year-old lobster-fishing diver in California
Official sources state that on Saturday a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy while diving in search of lobsters in California, during the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that for half an hour he was diving with friends on Saturday morning when he heard a boy scream and swam up to him with a group of people to get him out of the water.
Hammel thought at first that it was only enthusiasm due to the capture of a lobster but then "he realized that the boy was shouting 'I was bitten!
I've been bitten!'
His entire clavicle was torn," he said he noticed Hammel once he reached the boy.
"I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The boy was transported by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was hospitalized in critical condition.
The shark species responsible for the attack is unknown.
The beachguard Captain Larry Giles stated during a communication to the media that a few weeks earlier a shark had been sighted in the area, but that it had been declared not belonging to any dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper chest area.
Authorities banned access to the beach from Ponto Beach to Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security purposes.
Giles reported that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's program a push towards the beauty products industry in the UK
Sainsbury's is challenging Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with lanes dedicated to department store beauty products assigned to specialized assistants
As part of the major push towards the UK’s £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow as sales in fashion and household goods decline, the largest beauty lanes will be tested in 11 stores in the country and adopted in multiple stores next year if successful.
The investment in beauty takes place at a time when supermarkets are hunting for new ways to use space on shelves once dedicated to televisions, microwave ovens and household items.
Sainsbury's stated that it would double the size of its beauty products offer to reach 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will occupy a larger space with branded areas similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also re-launching its range of Boutique tricks to ensure that most products are vegan - a quality increasingly demanded by younger buyers.
In addition, the perfume retailer The Fragrance Shop will test authorizations in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, South London, while a second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and a shift towards buying small amounts of food daily at small neighborhood shops forced supermarkets to make more efforts to convince people to buy from them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said that stores will increasingly look like department stores while the supermarket chain tries to resist discount stores such as Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's introduced Argos stores into hundreds of stores and has also introduced several Habitats since it purchased the two chains about two years ago, and this strategy has boosted food sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to restore enamel to its departments of beauty products and pharmaceuticals ended in a failure.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s but the synergy ended in a dispute over the division of revenues from pharmaceutical stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy was adopted after Sainsbury's sold three years ago its pharma business of 281 outlets in Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million.
Lloyds was expected to play a role in the program, with the addition in four stores of an extensive range of luxury leather care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, sales manager at Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look of our beauty department to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands has been developed to meet every need and the inviting environment and comfortable locations make us an interesting destination for beauty products, in contrast to the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "furious" after Holly Willoughby bails out of a £11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones is furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from a £11 million contract with her trendy brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby no longer has time for his trademark of Truly household goods and accessories.
The couple's activity was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow's.
This Morning's 37-year-old presenter used Instagram to announce her abandonment.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den's star, Peter Jones, furious after withdrawing from their profitable last-minute trend brand activity to focus on her outstanding new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources say that Jones was furious when the TV golden girl admitted during a tense meeting at the headquarters of her commercial empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts - worth £1.5 million - did not give her enough time to dedicate herself to their trademark of Truly household goods and accessories.
The business was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop and it was estimated that it would double Willoughby's assets, estimated at around £11 million.
As soon as Willoughby, 37, chose Instagram to announce his abandonment of Truly, Jones left Britain to head for one of his holiday residences.
According to one source, "Truly was undoubtedly Holly's top priority.
It was supposed to be her long-term future that was going to commit her for the next 20 years.
His decision to abandon has left all the people involved absolutely speechless.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, they were so close to the launch.
There's a warehouse full of products at Marlow headquarters, ready to be sold."
Experts believe that abandoning This Morning's presenter, one of the most profitable stars in the UK, could cost the company millions because of strong investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and possible delays to the launch of the brand.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin were friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, joined the company as president in March.
The couple spent their holidays together and Jones owns a 40% share of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the ambassador of the M&S brand and will replace Ant McPartlin as guest of the ITV program "I'm A Celebrity".
A source close to Jones said last night that "he doesn't want to comment on his business."
Hard words and "then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media to make a comment that some would consider "non-presidential" and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his voice in imitation of the "journal conductor".
"I didn't give up anything."
He pointed out that Kim was interested in a second meeting after the first one in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a huge step forward in the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the denuclearization negotiations are at a dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho addressed world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, which North Korea did not observe an "equivalent response" from the US to North Korea's first disarmament operations.
Instead, he stressed, the US is continuing to impose sanctions to maintain high pressure.
Trump gave a much more optimistic view of this speech.
"With North Korea we are achieving excellent results," he said.
"We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim were positive: the end of the missile tests, the contribution to the release of hostages and the repatriation of the last American military.
And he defended his unusual strategy by describing his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this crowded field, we'd have about 200 people right across the street," Trump said, pointing the crowd in front of us.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island, causing hundreds of victims
Following the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organisations were told that they were not necessary.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population had been displaced, it was not declared a national emergency, an essential requirement for activating international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have been very clear about not wanting international assistance, so it's a bit complicated," said Sumbung.
While Save the Children is organizing a team that will go to Palu, it is still not sure that the foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities were considering the situation in Palu to decide whether the international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid.
Given the earthquakes to which Indonesia is continually subjected, the country continues to be horribly unprepared in the face of the fury of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, it is not a common structure on other coasts.
The apparent lack of a tsunami alarm siren in Palu, although the alarm had been given, has probably contributed to the loss of human lives.
Under the best conditions, moving between the many islands of Indonesia is complicated.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship anchored in Lombok to assist the victims of the earthquake is heading towards Palu but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo put the improvement of Indonesia's shredded infrastructure at the centre of his election campaign and poured money on roads and railways.
But the lack of funds hit Joko's administration as he prepares for re-election next year.
Joko also faces pressures from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted the most conservative branch of religion.
Over 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have been removed from their homes because of street clashes between Christian and Muslim gangs, fighting using machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool draws against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat against Chelsea with a point at 89 minutes on Saturday, at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a ride from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 25 meters from Chelsea's door, with his team down for 1-0.
He touched the left ball before pulling on the second pole.
The attempt passed high above the door frame as it turned to the top right corner of the network.
The ball finally fell behind Kepa Arrizabalaga and packed into the net.
"Just trying to get in place, get to the ball and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible, so I tried to create as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante arrive and I gave a touch and I didn't think too much about it and I pulled."
Chelsea won 1-0 in the first half after the 25th minute goal scored by Belgium's star Eden Hazard.
The center of the Blue passed by heel to Mateo Kovacic before splashing off near the midfield and shooting in the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick halfway through the field.
So he made a beautiful ride that took Hazard into the area.
Hazard passed the defense and finished on the second pole with a left goal over Alisson Becker of Liverpool.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia rose to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia reached 832, said the disaster management agency in Indonesia on Sunday morning.
Many people have been reported trapped in the rubble of the buildings collapsed following the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that hit the country on Friday and that generated waves up to 6 meters high, said the spokesman of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho during a press conference.
The city of Palu, with over 380,000 inhabitants, has been littered with debris from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman is stabbed to death
A murder investigation was initiated after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 a.m. with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested for suspected murder.
The police have invited people who may have seen or heard something in the area to get in touch.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is just beginning but I would like to appeal to anyone near John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard something suspicious and invite them to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, particularly taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on dashcam, to contact us because they may have very important information for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found is resident in Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, some friends who claim to know the woman arrived at the crime scene to ask questions about the location of the discovery this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have stated that they are currently informing the victims' family.
A cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment but was told by the police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents have been informed that it will take hours before they are allowed to return.
A police officer told a man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene in tears.
He keeps saying, "It's terrible."
At 2 p.m., two police vans were inside the demarcated area and another van was just outside.
Several agents were inside the demarcated area by checking the apartment building.
Anyone who has information about this is invited to contact @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimetoppers at 0800 555 111 indicating register 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue of Parliament becomes the last monument struck by the wave of "rewriting history"
His estrangement would be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects of England performed by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Crick's proposal a "crazy" and a "tempting to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the light of the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside Westminster Palace became an objective.
The iconoclasm during the English civil wars was neither ordered nor conducted by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent portrayal of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft by Cromwell is evidence of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe should still be celebrated.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, a defender of parliament by external pressure, in his case of the monarchy of course.
That this is an extremely accurate representation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century defined the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable figure representing a part of that fracture.
His achievements as Lord Protector must be celebrated and commemorated."
Killer pig eats a Chinese farmer and kills him
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China according to news from local media.
The man, identified only with the surname "Yuan", was found dead with a severed artery, covered in blood near a pigsty at the market of Liupanshui in Guizhou province, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines to pigs in a farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
It is reported that he had traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby piggy was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the pig's face.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the 250 kg pig had eaten the farmer, according to the statements.
"My cousin's legs were covered in blood and rubbed," said his cousin identified with the surname "Wu," as reported in Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking other people, while the police gathered evidence at the crime scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating a refund for the farmer's death.
Although rare, cases of attacks on humans by pigs have already been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injury to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300 kg pig nailed a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife managed to drive the animal out.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba breeder told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as a "catalyst."
"They just want to play.
They're playful, very curious... they don't want to hurt.
Just show them the right amount of respect," he explained.
Hurricane Rosa's aftermath will bring heavy rain to the south-west of the USA
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is losing strength as it moves on the coldest waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains on northern Mexico and the south-western coast of the USA in the coming days.
Rosa recorded winds of up to 138 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane, at 5 ET on Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a bag is forming over the Pacific Ocean and moving eastwards towards the west coast of the USA. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm, she will begin pushing a strong tropical humidity northwards, in the south-western part of the USA.
Rosa will bring up to 25 cm of rain in some areas of Mexico during Monday.
Hence, tropical humidity in contact with the approaching bagging will create heavy and vast rainfall in the south-western area in the coming days.
At local level, from 2 to 10 cm of rain can cause dangerous sudden floods, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
The tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates that will reach 2.5-7.5 cm per hour in some places, especially in the areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfalls of 2,5-10 cm are expected in some parts of the south-west, especially on most of Arizona.
Sudden floods with rapidly worsening conditions may occur due to the widespread nature of tropical rains.
It is strongly advised not to venture into the desert on foot in the presence of the threat of tropical rain.
The heavy rains could make the canyons of the rivers full and the thunderstorms will bring wind to puffs and raise dust.
The approaching bag will cause heavy local rainfall on part of the southern California coast.
Rainfalls of more than 1 cm will be possible, which could cause limited flows of debris and slippery tracks.
This would be the first precipitation of the region in the wet season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona at the end of Sunday and early Monday, before the rains become more extensive at the end of Monday and early Tuesday.
Heavy rains will descend on the Four Corners on Tuesday to last until Wednesday.
In October, temperatures will fluctuate strongly over the USA as the Arctic cools, but the tropics will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to important temperature changes over short distances.
An outstanding example of significant temperature differences in the U.S. power stations will occur on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the residual heat of the summer will try to increase and expand again.
A warm beginning of October is expected for most of the Central and Eastern USA, with 26 oC from the Southern Plains to the north-east areas.
In New York you can reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, which is a temperature of about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecasts indicate a strong probability of above average temperatures for the eastern USA until the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing.
Over 20 million people followed on Thursday on six television networks the compelling deposition by the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual violence that would occur in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continues, with broadcasters interrupting the regular programming for a last-minute breakthrough on Friday: an agreement devised by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford informed the Senate Justice Committee that he was 100% certain that Kavanaugh groped her in a drunken state and tried to undress her during a high school party.
Kavanaugh, during an inflamed deposition, claimed to be 100% sure that this did not happen.
More than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday are likely to have followed the deposition.
The company was calculating the audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for the other networks that transmitted it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting viewers who follow programs in offices.
To put it all in perspective, it's a similar audience to that for a football playoff game or for the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose opinionists strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, led all the networks, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the hearing lasted the whole day, said Nielsen.
ABC was the second network with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS recorded 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement stating that it would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, Flake was filmed by CNN and CBS operators on Friday morning while being insulted by demonstrators while trying to take an elevator to a hearing of the Justice Commission.
He stayed with his eyes down for several minutes while being scolded and broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think I'm telling the truth to the country?
He was told, "You have power, and a lot of women are powerless."
Flake claimed that his office had issued the statement and declared, before the elevator closed, that he would have other things to say during the committee hearing.
All cable networks and broadcasters broadcast live a few hours later, when the Justice Commission voted to present the appointment of Kavanaugh to the entire Senate for one vote.
But Flake said he would do so only with the certainty that the FBI would analyze the allegations against the candidate in the following week, as requested by the minority democrats.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Following a conversation with Coons and other senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was important, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "making politics" on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticized his plans to let the European Union "politically do" with the future of Britain and jeopardize the national interest in an interview with the newspaper Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, 29 September 2018.
In another interview alongside that with the Prime Minister on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson launched his attack on his so-called Chequers Agreement for Brexit, stating that a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect their respective duties is "absolutely ridiculous"
Murder of Wayde Sims: Police arrest the suspect of the death of LSU player Dyteon Simpson
Police have arrested a suspect in the death by gun of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and taken to prison on charges of murder in the second degree, declared the police department of Baton Rouge.
The authorities have made a video of Sims and Simpson fighting, and the police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses from the crime scene and claimed to have detected Simpson's DNA on them, reports the WAFB television station affiliated to CBS.
After questioning Simpson, the police said that the suspect admitted that he accidentally shot Wayde.
The bail was set at $350,000, the defense attorney said.
East Baton Rouge's M.E.'s office issued a preliminary report on Friday stating that the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the neck.
The department has recognized the merit of the task force for the fugitives of the Louisiana state police, the lab of the police forensics, the police of Southern University and the citizens of the area who assisted the investigation that led to the arrest.
The athletic director of LSU thanked local law enforcement for their commitment and the search for justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198 cm striker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
Last season the player had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade said that the team was "disturbed" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"This is what you worry about at all times," said Wade.
Vulcan sprinkles with ash Mexico City
The ash coming out of the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern quarters of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after activity had increased in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash had been recorded in 24 hours.
The center was checking the different rhombus and tremors.
Images on social media have shown thin layers of ash covering the windscreens of cars in Mexico City headquarters such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in activity at the volcano which is 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 hit the central area of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with police riot squads and thousands of people joined demonstrations of opponents to commemorate the first anniversary of the controversial Catalan secession vote.
A group of masked separatists obstructed by riot police targeted the police with eggs and threw powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets that usually overflow with tourists.
There were further fights during the day with policemen who resorted to batons to contain the fight.
For several hours the groups of independentists who sang "We will not forget, we will not forgive" were confronted with the unionist protesters who shouted "Long live Spain."
The local press reported that fourteen people had to receive treatment for minor injuries received during the demonstrations.
The tension remains high in the independence region one year after the referendum of 1 October considered illegal by the government of Madrid but recognized by the Catalan separatists.
The voters had voted with an overwhelming majority for independence, although the turnout was low, and the Catalans opposed to secession had largely boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop violent clashes in the referendum that was taking place at seats throughout the region.
The independence groups camped out on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to follow an alternative path.
Narcis Termes, 68, is an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife and said that he had no hope of the possibility of Catalonia becoming independent.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy for the chance to vote, but now everything is stuck," he explained.
Although they achieved a fundamental victory, albeit of measure, at last December's regional elections, the Catalan independentist parties struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many of the movement's most well-known leaders who find themselves in voluntary exile or in prison awaiting judgment for their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42 - year - old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his phone, said that the conflict was fueled by politicians from the two factions.
"The situation is getting tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison awaiting trial since the end of last year, announced that he will run for elections to the European Parliament next year.
"Presenting me as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the involution of democratic values and repression by the Spanish government," he explained.
Londonderry: men arrested after rambling a house with cars
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested after they repeatedly hit a Londonderry house with a car.
The accident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday, at around 7:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused at the gates and the building itself.
It is also possible that the machine was hit with a crossbow at some point.
Menga's attack marks Livingston's 1-0 victory against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingston signed the victory
The Livingston already promoted left the Rangers amazed by relegating Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 games as director of the club of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's goal made a difference while Gary Holt's team moved on to the second division with the Hibernian.
Gerrard's team then remains without a home win in the Premiership this season and will face next Sunday the first in the Hearts standings, from which they separate 8 points.
The Rangers hosted the Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
In the meantime Livingston continues his series of victories in the division remaining undefeated for six games, with coach Holt having yet to see a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston wastes opportunity against unincisive guests
Holt's team should have been ahead well before the goal, with their immediacy that caused the Rangers many problems.
Scott Robinson broke through but dragged his action in front of the mirror of the door and Alan Lithgow could only kick out the door after entering to meet Craig Halkett's headstroke on the other side of the door.
The guests were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could put visitors in trouble with their kicks.
And that was how the crucial goal was achieved.
The Rangers granted a kick-off and Livingston found an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson managed to move to Menga, which he could score from the center of the area.
Until then, the Rangers had dominated the possession of the ball but the defense of the host team had proved impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had not had to worry too much,
This pattern was maintained during the second half, although Alfredo Morelos engaged Kelly in a parade.
Scott Pittman saw his goal-stopping attempt by the Rangers' goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow made a shot out of another Livingston game scheme.
Crossings have succeeded in the Livingston area and have been continuously neutralized, while two requests for rigour, after Halkett's contrast with substitute Glenn Middleton and one for handfault, have been rejected.
A "phenomenal" performance from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
Until the last player, they were exceptional, continuing to exceed expectations along this exceptional trajectory.
Their style of play and collaborators have changed very little since their return to the top series, but you have to give Holt a lot of credit for the way he has been able to push the team since his arrival.
He's had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, leading a masterly organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in trouble throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, were poorly inspired.
Despite the excellent performance at some times with Gerrard, in this case they have fallen well below these standards.
The last step was missed - only once they were able to penetrate the opposing area - and you can consider it an alarm bell for Rangers, who are mid-ranking.
Erdogan received with mixed reactions in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies Saturday (29 September) during the breakfast meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to extend relations between NATO allies.
They clashed on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's access to the EU.
Erdogan then headed for Cologne for the inauguration of a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest group of Turkish people outside Turkey.
The police motivated the intervention with security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many supporters showed up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, including many Kurds, have made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan's policies and the decision of the German government to welcome him to the country.
The protests reflect the dissent caused by a visitor considered a hero by some Turks of Germany and called a despot by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with a car
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived at the scene, but the man died instantly.
The accident occurred months after another cyclist died, hit by a street pirate on Childers Street, about a mile from where the accident occurred on Saturday.
Metro police said the authorities are working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roads have been blocked and buses diverted and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six guards injured during a disorder
Six prison guards were injured during a disorder at the maximum security male prison, reported the prison office.
The riot broke out at the men's maximum security prison in Long Lartin in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
The specialized agents "Tornado" were employed to manage the riot, involving eight prisoners and which is confined to one wing of the prison.
Agents were treated on site for minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the prison service said: "Personal prisoners specially trained have been deployed to contain an accident currently taking place at the prison in Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate the presence of violence in our prisons and all those responsible will be reported to the police and could be sentenced to a longer sentence in prison."
Long Lartin Prison is home to over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous delinquents.
In June it was reported that the prison director had to receive hospital care following the attack of a prisoner.
And in October of last year, riot agents were called to intervene in the prison to quell a violent riot during which the staff was attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden floods (from which drought-affected areas could benefit)
It is rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that is exactly what will probably happen at the beginning of next week when Hurricane Rosa's last energies cross the southwest of the desert, creating risks of sudden floods.
The national weather service has already released sudden flooding alerts on Mondays and Tuesdays in western Arizona as far as southern and eastern Nevada, south-western California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching Monday in the evening with rains.
Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained the state of tropical storm or tropical depression within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Centre for Hurricanes include rainfall between 5 and 10 cm, with isolated peaks of up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas in the south-west, including the Central Rock Mountains and the Great Basin, will receive from 2.5 to 5 cm of rainfall, with isolated peaks of up to 10 cm.
For areas outside the risk of sudden flooding, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing as the region is hit by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of these rainfalls are likely to be positive as the south-western area is currently experiencing a drought.
According to the Drought Monitoring Centre, just over 40% of Arizona is going through a period of extreme drought, the second highest category," said Weather.com.
Initially the route of Hurricane Rosa will be able to land on land through the peninsula of Baja California of Mexico.
Rosa, who still maintained the force of hurricane Sunday morning with winds at a maximum speed of 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will collide with the coldest waters of the Pacific, losing power.
So it is expected that he will arrive in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or on Monday evening.
Rainfalls on parts of Mexico could be intense, creating a high risk of flooding.
"We expect rainfall between 7.5 cm and 15 cm from Baja California to the northwestern part of Sonora, with a maximum of 25 cm," reported weather.com.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday with a state of tropical depression, then head through Arizona and towards southern Utah in the late evening of Tuesday.
"The main risk that can be caused by Rosa or her aftermath is intense rainfall in Baja California, in the northwestern part of Sonora and in the southwestern desert area of the USA," the National Centre for Hurricanes said.
Such rains are expected to generate sudden potentially lethal floods and debris flows into deserts, as well as landslides on mountainous soils.
Assault of Midsomer Norton: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys to a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at about 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was transferred to the hospital, where he remains in stable conditions.
A 17-year-old, two-year-old, and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, reported Avon and Somerset police.
The authorities have appealed to anyone who may have picked up on their mobile phone what has happened.
Trump states that Kavanaugh "suffered from the wickedness and anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh "suffered from the wickedness and anger" of the Democratic Party during the entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh deposed to Congress on Thursday, passionately and decisively denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusations of sexual violence against her decades ago, when they were still teenagers.
Ford also deposed at the hearing defending himself against the prosecution.
The President said on Saturday that "the American people were able to observe Kavanaugh's extraordinary quality and courage" on that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most experienced minds of law of our time, a jurist with unrivalled precedents in the public service," he said in front of the crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to the appointment of Kavanaugh by talking about the importance of republican turnout in midterm elections.
"Five weeks after one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I'm really busy," he said.
"For this hard fight for exceptional candidates."
Trump said that Democrats are committed to "resisting and hindering."
The first fundamental procedural vote in the Senate for the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, according to a senior assistant to the GOP management to CNN.
Hundreds of people killed by the earthquake in Indonesia and the tsunami, and the numbers of victims continue to rise.
At least 384 people were killed, many swept away by giant waves that fell on the beaches, when an earthquake of great magnitude and a tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, said the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach of Palu on Friday, when waves up to 6 meters (18 feet) fell on the beach at dusk, sweeping away many people by killing them and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and did not run away immediately, thus turning into victims," said to Jakarta Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the Indonesian agency for the control of BNPB disasters.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it dragged cars, trunks, houses, hit anything on land," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami moved to the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles/hour) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he explained.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the Disaster Agency have shown numerous buildings and shops destroyed, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The settling shocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was perceived in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released by the strong earthquake on Friday was almost 200 times the power of the atomic bomb launched on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which is located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have enhanced the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extended" and claimed that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho stated that the victims and damage could be greater along the coast of 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications "have been totally paralyzed, with no information" by Donggala, said Nugroho.
There are over 300,000 people living in the area," the Red Cross said, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading towards the areas involved.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could become even more serious," he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the authorities said that the waves arrived at the time the alarm was launched.
In an amateur video shared on social media, you hear a man in the upper floor of a building screaming agitated way to warn of the incoming tsunami people in the street below.
A few minutes later a wall of water fell down on the beach, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to authenticate the video immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a huge blackout that disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate relief interventions.
According to the authorities, the army started sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but displaced people still need food and other basic necessities.
The city airport was reopened only for rescue and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has scheduled a visit to the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia is rising to over 800.
It's terrible.
Although Donggala's World Vision staff managed to reach the city of Palu safely, where employees took refuge under waxed canvas shelters in the courtyard of their office, during the journey they encountered scenes of devastation, said Doseba.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed," he said.
It's terrible.
Even while the rescue teams have begun the difficult operations of starting the rescue gears, there have been some complaints about the fact that foreign rescue workers with extensive knowledge have been prevented from travelling to Palu.
Indonesian regulations state that funding, supplies and staff from abroad can only begin to arrive if the site of a disaster has been declared a national disaster area.
This has not yet happened.
"This is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, "O.K., this is a national disaster," we can accept international assistance, but status has not yet been defined."
On the second night in Palu after the earthquake and the tsunami on Friday, friends and family of the missing still maintained the hope that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that alleviate the sad stories of natural disasters.
Saturday a child was pulled out of a drain.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been stuck under the rubble for two days with her mother's body next door.
Gendon Subandano, the preparer of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained for the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia two of the missing paragliding pilots.
Others of the people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
"As a veteran in the paragliding industry, I'm carrying my emotional load," he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours following the spread of news about the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel within the paragliding community, he had desperately sent messages via WhatsApp to Palu's competitors, who were participating in the beach festival.
His messages, however, stopped at a single gray check mark instead of two blue marks.
"I think it means the messages weren't delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during an ATM supply at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink operator who was supplying an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle was emptying an ATM in the amusement center and preparing to deliver more money, said Detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, another man "gave up behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag with the money for delivery.
Witnesses identified several suspects fleeing the crime scene, according to the statement, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the crime.
Anyone who has information on the identity of criminals is invited to contact the NYPD at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his name to Ye
The Kanye West rapper is changing his name to Ye.
On Saturday's announcement of the name change on Twitter, he wrote: "The person formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has long been nicknamed Ye and used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change took place before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he will present his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces the program by the singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her participation for "emotive reasons", said the creator of the show.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West stated earlier that the word contains a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, talking about the title of his album with the radio presenter Big Boy.
"So it's you, it's us, it's us.
We went from Kanye, which means the one, to simply Ye - the reflection of our goodness, of our wickedness, of our confusion, of everything.
The album is more than the reflection of who we are."
It's just one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love names.
A former West co-collaborator, JAY-Z, also changed the name with or without a dash and capital letters.
The elected president of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has sworn not to use the army against the civilian population
Mexican elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use military force against the civilian population on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelolco Square "never use the army to repress the Mexican people."
The soldiers had fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were taking hold throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by extending monthly grants to students and opening up more public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training opportunities push young people towards criminal gangs.
The US is expected to double its funding for AI
As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the funds dedicated to research in this field, says the investor and operator of IA Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow the announcements by various groups of the US government about AI, although in the US there is generally no formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its programme last year: it aims to be country No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"To double the budget in AI research would be a good start considering that all other countries are far behind the US and we need a new revolution in AI," Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the chances that the next major success in the AI sector will be achieved in the US, Lee told CNBC during an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinevation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's leading AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat Othello’s American player with the highest score and later was executive at Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese Google section.
Lee has remembered the previous technological competitions of the U.S. government as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one will be held, in order to identify new visionaries.
Researchers in the US often have to work hard to get funding from the government, Lee said.
"It's not China that's taking academic leaders away, it's multinationals," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired luminaries from universities to work on AI projects.
Lee said that changes to immigration policy could help the US to boost its efforts in the area of AI.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to PhD students in IA," he explained.
The Chinese State Council published its program for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Foundation for Natural Sciences provides funding to academics, similar to how the National Foundation for Science and other government organizations distribute funds to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee explained.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defence set up a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, aimed at involving industrial partners and universities, and the White House announced the formation of a Special Commission for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the US system of setting up a National Artificial Intelligence Safety Commission has not been active for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum for changing the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on the possible change of the name of the country in "North Macedonia", a move that would resolve the dispute lasting decades with Greece that blocked its requests for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which owns a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its neighbours is a claim on its territory and has vetoed Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe that the change would damage the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority Macedonian population.
President Gjorge Ivanov stated that he would not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the turnout could reach the minimum of 50% necessary for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the referendum card is as follows: "It agrees with the accession to NATO and the EU and with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that this is the price to be paid for Macedonia to be admitted to institutions such as the EU and NATO, one of the emerging countries since the collapse of the former Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the aegis of the European Union because this means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of members of parliament have stated that they will respect the outcome of the vote to make it final.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority.
The state election commission stated that there were no reports of irregularities until 1:00 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter from the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted for the referendum in Macedonia for the change in the name of the country that would open the door to accession to NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Paramento in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and placing the chairs in front of the tents mounted by those who want to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to go head-on, not for the back door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have a dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China or Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring heavily needed investment to Macedonia, with an unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I believe that the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He stated that a "yes" would be the "confirmation of our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Analysis reported that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum - a percentage below the required turnout.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia indicated that 57% of respondents expected to vote on Sunday.
Of this 57%, 70% said they would vote for the yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it took office in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City scored a goal avoiding the entire defense of Brighton
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling dealt with Brighton's defense during the 2-0 win from Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his 65th minute mark look extremely easy.
The Argentinian striker received a midfield pass at the start of the action.
He moved between three Brighton defenders before catapulting on the free field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four green jerseys.
He humiliated one defender before he crossed several others at the edge of the Brighton area.
He then made a left pass, where he found Sterling.
The British striker used the first touch in the area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton Mathew Ryan's goalkeeper with a right throw in the net.
"Aguero is having foot problems," said City coach Pep Guardiola to journalists.
"We talked about letting him play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he was able to score at that time."
But it was Sterling who initially led the Sky Blues in the Premier League fight.
The goal reached the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep on the Brighton field.
He sent a nice filter ball along his left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few steps before driving Sterling to the second pole.
Sky Blues attacker threw the ball on the net just before he left the field.
The City will fight Hoffenheim in the Champions League at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play dirty against the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to force another start.
But as always competitive Scherzer hopes to be able to launch on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, which maintain an advantage of a Los Angeles Dodgers game in the NL West.
The Rockies have won at least a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still hope to get their first division title.
"Even if we play aimlessly, at least we can be able to launch knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team that will play will probably be at the highest level this year.
And why wouldn't I want to compete?"
The Nationals have yet to announce a first pitcher for Sunday, but they are said to be inclined to let Scherzer launch in such situations.
Scherzer, who would be the first pitcher for the 34th time, on Thursday he performed a launch session and would be the first pitcher on his normal Sunday off.
The Washington pitcher is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikesout in 220 2/3 innings for this season.
Trump at a rally in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke of the importance of the turnout of Republicans in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
It's one of the big, big ones -- I'm not a candidate, but I'm really working hard for that, I'm fighting for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "We see this horrible group of radical democrats, it's happening right now.
And they are determined to take back power by using any means necessary, you can see evil, meanness.
They don't care who they can strike, who they have to overwhelm in order to regain power and control, because that's what they want, power and control and we won't give them to them."
The Democrats, he said, have given themselves the mission of "resisting and hindering."
"And it has been possible to see it in the last four days," he said, calling the democrats "wrong, bad, mean and liars."
He referred to the Senate Justice Commission with Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, triggering loud whistles among the public.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for a -- that was a bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer very tolerant.
He doesn't tolerate people who say what they think.
When my local party's Momentum activists voted to censor me, it wasn't a big surprise.
After all, I am the last in a series of Labour Members who have been told that they are not welcome, and everyone has said what they were thinking.
My fellow Member, Joan Ryan, has received similar treatment because he has resolutely opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for expressing my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically all arguments similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for Friday's Nottingham East Labour meeting states that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as a member of the parliament of the local Labour Party, Friday evening meetings were exactly like this.
However, today is not the tone of numerous meetings and the promise of a "kinder and courteous" policy has been forgotten for a long time, if ever remembered.
It has become increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and every opinion is judged by whether or not it is acceptable for party leadership.
This all started shortly after Jeremy became the leader of the party, and colleagues with whom I previously thought I would share a similar political vision began to expect a reversal of trend on my part and that I would take positions that I would never accept, whether they were national security or the European single market.
When I speak in public - and it really doesn't matter what I say - they follow insults on social media that demand my withdrawal, denouncing the politics of the center and telling me that I should not be part of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I certainly know that I am more fortunate than other colleagues because the comments I make tend to be of a political nature.
I am admired by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist insults every day but who do not let themselves be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalisation of insult levels.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer in a tolerant environment and with every motion of distrust or modification of the selection rules, the party shrinks.
In the last two years I have been given many advices, inviting me to lower my head, not to express my opinions so openly and everything "would have been fine".
But it's not to do this that I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, caused by the negligence of the Thatcher government that had left my secondary school class literally falling apart, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need it most, as a local councillor or government minister.
I've never hidden my political opinions, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way disconcerted by my political positions and the points of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who promoted the motion on Friday, I would like to say that when the country is rushing towards a Brexit that will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy by talking about my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But in reality the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of exclusion or political opportunity will stop me from acting in defense of what I believe to be your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr Scales Ranking
Two late attempts may have somehow unbalanced the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the triumph in this exceptionally fun game of Tennent's championship day.
I'm now at the top of the standings, the only team out of ten undefeated.
In the end it was their superior defense, as well as their audacity, which pushed the home team and Coach Peter Murchied had all the reasons to be satisfied.
"We have been put to the test in our games so far and we are still undefeated, so I must be happy," said the coach.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Ayr's credit must be recognised, they have made better use of our opportunities."
Grant Anderson's goal at the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, but brought Ayr to the lead, but a yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, released from Warriors for the game, allowed Melrose to make the numbers speak and Jason Baggot grabbed an unconverted goal.
Climo increased the distance of the Ayr with a rigor before, just in the middle of time, to score and then convert a goal alone to bring the Ayr to 17-5 at the interval.
But the Melrose started well the second half and the goal of Patrick Anderson, converted by Baggot, reduced the advantage to five points.
There was therefore a long interruption due to a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, which was knocked out, and upon reboot, the Ayr jumped back into the lead thanks to a goal of Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
The replacement captain of Ayr Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card and Melrose charged the extra man with an unconverted goal of Bruce Colvine, at the end of a moment of strong pressure.
However, the home team came back and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for a contrast with Climo without a ball, from the touch of rigor, MacPherson scored a touch down behind Ayr's advancing mix.
Climo converted, as he had done almost since reboot, after Rowe had picked up the football from David Armstrong's area and sent the Gregor Henry flanker to look for the fifth goal of the home team.
Star of Still Game seeks a new career in the catering industry
Ford Kieran, star of Still Game, decided to move to the hotel industry after discovering that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis on the BBC's popular show, which he writes and plays with his longtime partner Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the next ninth series will also be the final one of the show and it seems Kiernan is thinking about a life after Craiglang.
According to official reports, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to make statements, although a source of the Scottish Sun made it clear that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "prosperous catering business."
'"The sea is ours": Bolivia with no outlet on the sea hopes that a court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol a naval headquarters covered in rigging in La Paz.
Public buildings display an ocean blue flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are decorated with the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
It's a duty to get it back."
Throughout the landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the lost coast and now in the hands of Chile after a bloody conflict over the resources of the 19th century is still alive, as is the desire to cross the Pacific Ocean once again.
These hopes have perhaps reached the highest level in decades, while Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
" Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and is obviously waiting for the result with a positive attitude," explained Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the judgment of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will welcome Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent dialogue, Chile should be obliged to negotiate, guaranteeing Bolivia an outlet on the sea that is the responsibility of the State.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president - who is facing a controversial battle for reelection next year - has a lot at stake with Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to our return to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly decide in favor of Bolivia and that little would change if it did.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no power to allocate Chilean territory and has specified that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the ruling of the International Court of Justice comes just six months after the final arguments indicates that the case ‘was not complicated’, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from advancing the Bolivian cause, the last four years may have delayed it.
"The problem of access to the sea has been monopolized by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morale's belligerent rhetoric has broken any good intentions remaining in Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the negotiations at some point, but it will be very difficult to maintain the discussions as a result of what has happened.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was particularly swift.
On Monday Bolivia will be able "to enjoy extraordinary opportunities in relations with Chile" and will have the opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual advantage", he explained.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - one of the most popular presidents of Latin America - is using the maritime issue as a political eschatage.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen without confidence in the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that his nation will never disarm from nuclear weapons unless he can trust Washington first.
He spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He appealed to the United States to keep to the promises made during the Singapore summit between the two rival leaders.
His comments come at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be intent on resuming the stalemate diplomatic negotiations after the meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
He explains that it is an "illusion" that the continuation of sanctions and the opposition of the US to a declaration of the end of the Korean War can never bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is wary of making the statement without Pyongyang first carrying out major disarmament actions.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread scepticism that Pyongyang is willing to give up an arsenal that the country probably considers the only way to ensure its own safety.
Pompey is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows present the latest trend in huge headgear that will soon be in a high fashion store near you
If you want to enlarge your headgear collection or completely block the sun's rays, look no further.
Valentino and Thom Browne designers have unveiled a series of crazy oversized headgear on their spring-summer 2019 collection that impressed the fashion world at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have raged on Instagram this summer and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations on the catwalk.
Valentino's main piece was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with a wide edge similar to feathers that submerged the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jeweled watermelons, a sorcerer's hat and even a pineapple - but they were not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of these colorful masks have sewn lips and look more like a Hannibal Lecter representation than haute couture.
One creation looked like a diving suit with a mask and goggles, while another looked like a loose ice cream cone.
And if you continue with the huge declarations of style, you're lucky.
Watchers of style predict that the huge hats could reach you in the streets of high fashion.
Outsize hats come in the wake of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a brim more than a meter wide that was seen on anyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very unpractical hat that invaded social media has sent another huge creation on the catwalk: a beach bag in straw almost as big as the model in costume that brings it.
The burning orange raffia bag, finished with raffia fringes and a white leather handle was the highlight of Jacquemus' La Riviera's spring-summer 2019 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect these big hats and beach bags to arrive in luxury stores next summer, as the designer has achieved such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scottish independent schools maintain a curriculum of academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another series of outstanding exam results, reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other collective efforts.
With over 30,000 pupils throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare pupils for subsequent higher education, their chosen career and place in the world as global citizens.
As an education sector capable of developing and adopting a personalised school study plan, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular and required subject within schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language that he understands, the message will reach his brain.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, the message will come to the heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on the English alone if we want to build trust relations with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest success rates in independent schools.
68% of pupils who studied foreign languages got the highest grade.
The data, collected by the 74 schools member of SCIS, showed that 72% of students got the highest vote with praise in Chinese, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish got the maximum vote.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as key competences for children and young people, who will no doubt need them in the future.
Currently languages, as a choice of subject, are considered at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, technology and mathematics) in the study plans of independent institutions and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 found that the reasons that employees have indicated for the difficulty in covering jobs are attributable in 17% of cases to a lack of language skills.
For this reason language skills are becoming increasingly indispensable to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more job opportunities requiring language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of your chosen career, if you have learned a second language, you will have an effective advantage in the future with a lifelong competence like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically bring a multilingual person to the forefront of competition.
According to a survey by YouGov among over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language at a sufficient level to be able to hold a conversation and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%.
That is why investing in language teaching is so important for children today.
Knowledge of several languages, particularly those of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages taught.
Several schools will focus on the most classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK by looking at 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be different languages to choose from in independent schools, with the teaching staff specialized in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed for success, whatever their future.
It is not possible to deny at this time, in a global trading system, that languages continue to be fundamental to the future of the country, and this must be reflected in teaching.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered "international communicative skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
The faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make his debut with Lakers Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans waiting for LeBron James to make his first entry with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in Sunday's pre-season opening match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it still has to be established for how many minutes he'll play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited number of minutes.
After training at the beginning of the week, James was asked what his plans were for the six-game pre-season Lakers program.
"At this point in my career I don't need friendly matches to prepare myself," he said.
The time of the rally a West Virginia of Trump, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia at a burst of rallies.
This is the first meeting of the five scheduled for Trump next week, including stops in friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the outstanding confirmation vote for his choice to cover the vacancy on the Supreme Court, Trump will try to create support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress in the November elections.
At what time will Trump's meeting be held and how is it possible to follow it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow Trump's rally in West Virginia online through live streaming on YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about this week's hearings of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who became tense due to allegations of sexual assault with an early Senate confirmatory vote pending for a week while the FBI conducts the investigation.
But the main purpose of this series of meetings is to help the Republicans who are facing the November elections get a little push.
Therefore, President Trump's campaign said that these five gatherings over the course of next week are aimed at "energizing volunteers and supporters while Republicans seek to protect and expand the majorities they hold in the Senate and the House of Deputies," according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so crucial to his program that the president will travel as many states as possible as we go into the most busy season of the campaign," said a spokesman for Trump's campaign in Reuters, asking to remain anonymous.
Scheduled for Wheeling's Wesbanco Arena, tonight's rally could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract Pittsburgh's media coverage, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, the state in which he had won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is in line in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come and try to push him into the polls," said Simon Haeder, a policy scientist from West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: USA team demonstrates the courage to fight to keep their hopes alive until Sunday's singles
After three one-way sessions, Saturday afternoon quartets may have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The motion of the oscillating pendulum is a totally invented sports concept in which players firmly believe and never like in races like these.
Where would the bike be now, then?
"They had a six-point advantage, and now there are four, so I'd say we're saving some bikes," said Jordan Spieth as he drifted away at the end of the day.
Europe is ahead, of course, four points ahead with twelve others at stake.
The Americans feel they have a little wind in their favor, as Spieth said, and they have a lot to hope for, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each boasts three out of four points.
Spieth has been ruthless from tee to green and is setting an example.
The guttural shouts of celebration became stronger as the game continued, sinking a crucial putt to balance the score at game four, when he and Thomas were down two points after two.
His putt that made them win the game at the 15 hole was greeted with a similar scream, the one that tells you that he believes that the American team is not yet out of the race.
"You really have to try hard to worry about your game," Spieth said.
That's all any of these players can do now.
18 holes to make a point.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the irrefutable version of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable couple of Europe is four by four and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" were the only couple not to throw a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogeys Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the ninth hole Friday morning.
That path, and the way their energy seems to flow from and to the noisy crowds consolidates the certainty that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and there would be no more popular Fleetwood or Molinari player to seal a possible European victory as the sun sets on Le Golf National.
Preferably both simultaneously on different holes.
However, European speeches of glory are still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson soon joined Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero in the morning, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogets on the first nine holes plunged the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole from which they couldn't even get up.
But there's no one here on Sunday to help you get out of your hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating that they look up close because of the interactions between couples, the advice they give and don't give and the way strategy can change at a time.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has gained an important advantage in the final day but this foursome session has shown that the US team has the courage to fight, which some, in particular Stateside, have doubted.
Europe with an advantage of 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a solid advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after finishing fourball and foursome games on Saturday with an advantage of 10-6 over the United States.
The inspired couple composed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins on a Tiger Woods in difficulty to bring the score so far to Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, in an attempt to preserve the trophy lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an irregular American team in the morning fourballs, winning 3-1.
The USA has resisted more in the foursomes, winning two games, but they have not managed to recover the disadvantage.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from 12 singles games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend are the second couple to win four points from the four opening games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs, they worked superbly to beat down a Woods and American exordant Bryson Dechambeau with an even sharper 5&4.
Woods, who took off for two games on Saturday, showed occasional sprees of genius but lost 19 of his 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, retired during the morning fourballs, returned to the side of partner Henrik Stenson in the foursome to beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - number one and three in the world standings.
However, Europe has not achieved all the desired results on a pleasant and ventilated day south-west of Paris.
The three-time great winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the reference for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a strong 2&1 win over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the fourballs and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursomes, having lost the two opening holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup a team has returned from a gap of four points to the singles, although as the title, Furyk's team only needs a draw to defend the trophy.
After being the best seconds for two days, however, a Sunday counterattack seems to be out of their reach.
North Korea absolutely refuses unilateral disarmament without trust
The Foreign Minister of North Korea told the UN on Saturday that the maintenance of sanctions was exacerbating the country's distrust of the US, which in such circumstances would absolutely refuse to unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons.
On the occasion of the World Organization's General Assembly, Ri Yong Ho said that North Korea has taken "important measures of goodwill" over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, dismantling the nuclear test site and commitment to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any consistent response from the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the US there will be no security in our national security, and in such circumstances we absolutely refuse to disarm ourselves unilaterally first."
Although Mr Ri has re-used the complaint concerning Washington's resistance to a denuclearization "in stages" with which North Korea would be rewarded on the basis of gradual actions, his statement was important because he did not entirely reject unilateral denuclearization as previously done by Pyongyang.
He referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first absolute meeting between a US President in office and a North Korean leader, held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim committed to working towards the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees to North Korean security.
North Korea sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also opposed calls to ease the strict international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The US insists on the need for "first denuclearisation" and to increase the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve their purpose coercively and even oppose the "declaration of the end of the war", said Ri.
"The idea that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an illusion of those who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions is increasing our distrust."
Ri did not refer to programs of a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the US leader had announced to the UN at the beginning of the week.
The minister instead underlined the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last 5 months and added: "If the counterpart of this question of denuclearization were South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be at this point dead."
But even so, the tone of Ri's speech was significantly different from that of last year at the UN General Assembly, when he stated that it was inevitable to target the U.S. territory with North Korea missiles after "the president of evil" Trump had called Kim a "missile man" engaged in a suicide mission.
Before the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "destroy completely" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to embark on the path of disarmament, but stated that much still needs to be done and that sanctions will remain in place until North Korea's denuclearisation.
Wednesday Trump said he didn't have a deadline, saying that "if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
Cine and Russia say that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for his actions.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "Respect for Security Council sanctions must continue forcefully and without exception until complete, final and proven denuclearisation is achieved."
The Security Council unanimously supported sanctions against North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to stifle funding for nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles.
Pompey met with Ri at the margins of the UN General Assembly and later declared that he would visit Pyongyang again the following month to prepare a second summit.
Pompey visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not go well.
It restarted from Pyongyang in July stating that progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea had accused him of having presented "gangster requests."
North Korea had made a commitment during a meeting this month with Moon to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the US had taken "compliant measures."
He stated that Kim had explained to him that the "compliant measures" he wanted were security guarantees that Trump had committed to in Singapore and actions in the direction of normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year pushed all its students to sleep more in an attempt to counteract the growing manly culture of studying for whole nights powered by caffeine.
A university scholar noted that students of the world's number one university often have no idea of the basic concepts of self - care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he believes to be the first of its kind in the USA.
He had the idea to start the course after a lecture that he had given on the impact of sleeplessness on learning.
"In the end, a girl came to me and said, 'Why am I told this just now, when I'm a senior?'
He said that no one had ever told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me very much," he told The Telegraph.
The course, given for the first time this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits can help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and general director of the university's health services, stated that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students suffered from a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive activities.
In one section there is the image of a dorm room, where students can select cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, and the importance of an evening routine.
In another section, participants are explained how long-term sleeplessness can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe that they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride linked to the "white night to study", still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students lead the lack of sleep to be a growing problem.
Sleeping enough and with a good quality sleep should be the "secret weapon" of the students to fight stress, fatigue, anxiety, explained and even should serve to avoid fattening since lack of sleep leads the brain into a mode of starvation, making people constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student enrolled in the Faculty of Chemical and Physical Biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, after attending one of his lectures last year during his first year at Harvard.
He explained that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course aimed at the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to ask all graduate students to follow a similar curriculum before enrolling in this competitive institute.
Professor Czeisler advised students to set an alarm clock for when they have to go to bed, as well as for when they have to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can tilt the circadian rhythm, leading to sleeping problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal kicks Gerrard's men down
The Rangers suffered another depression attack from outside the home with Dolly Menga's goal that relegated Steven Gerrard's disarmed team to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
Ibrox's team was looking for the first out-of-home victory since the February 4-1 triumph in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted the second defeat of Gerrard in 18 coach games leaving his team eight points from the fleeing leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership, Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the interval and a short-inspired Rangers formation never seemed to equalize.
While the Ranger is now in sixth place, Livingston is up to third, and only behind the Hibernian for different goals.
And there might be additional problems coming up for the Rangers after the Calum Spence line guard was treated for a head injury due to an object apparently thrown out of the house.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which quickly surpassed Ayr in the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, chose the usual line-up that ripped a spot at the Hearts last week and would have been satisfied with the way his well-prepared team suffocated their opponents on each lap.
The Rangers may have dominated for possession of the ball but the Livingston has made better use of the balls at its disposal.
They could have scored just after two minutes when Menga's first-half filtering pass sent Scott Pittman forward to Allan McGregor's door but the midfielder wasted the opportunity.
A deep punishment kick by Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett but his defending companion Alan Lithgow could only pull to the side on the second pole.
The Rangers took control but there seemed to be more hope than conviction in their game in the penalty area.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he had to be given a penalty at the end of the 15th following a clash with Steven Lawless but the referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's demands.
The Rangers managed to pull only twice in the first half but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not let himself worry about Lassana Coulibaly's head stroke and a bland shot of Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's 34th minute opening goal may have been unexpected, no one can deny that he deserved it even for his commitment.
Again the Rangers failed to manage a deep-placed football of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher filtered the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm in choosing Menga for a clean conclusion.
Gerrard acted during the interval replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the gearbox had an almost immediate impact since the wing shoved a ball into Morelos, but the exceptional Kelly jumped out of the door line to block it.
But Livingston continued to drag visitors into exactly the kind of game they love, with Lithgow and Halkett picking up one ball long after another.
Holt's team may have increased the gap in the final stages, but McGregor opposed to stop Jacobs before Lithgow pulled out of the corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton filed a final request for rigor after a crossing with Jacobs but Thomson denied it again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our almanac "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today and the CONTEGGIO continues... the day when the physical future Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger has developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that has made the device known as the Geiger counter.
A firm point of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become a pillar of pop culture, when in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," played by those unbelievable cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these earpieces on you can really feel the effects of the atoms released by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Say it's really blowing up right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of the treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, and their alteration in the laboratory.
They can then "see" a protein common to many types of cancer and are then re-injected
An experimental trial of this vaccine is giving promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect malignant cells has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their alteration in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to numerous types of cancer, called HER2, and then these cells are injected again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
The HER2 protein "promotes the growth of different types of tumors", including breast, ovaries, lungs and colonectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar process of extracting immune cells from patients to "teach" them how to hit cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West jumps into a pro-Trump diatribe wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) cap after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was whistled in the studio during a Saturday Night Live episode after a disclusive performance during which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After playing his third song of the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a MAGA cap, he began an outburst against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Many times I talk to white people and they say, "How do you like Trump, he's a racist!"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he explained.
The SNL started the show with a scene whose protagonist was Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Justice Commission against the allegations of sexual violence presented by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, the recording of West's Filipino was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with the release.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had had a bad time backstage because of his headgear.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat on."
I've been bullied!
And so they told me I was an outcast," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the place submerged?" and said, "I'd wear the cape at Superman's because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go on?
Try love."
His comments generated whistles at least twice from the audience and members of the SNL cast seemed embarrassed, said Variety, with a person who told the magazine: "A deadly silence fell on the study."
West had been invited as the last-minute replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West has baffled many with a performance of the song I Love it, disguised as a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANKS FOR BEING THROUGH MASS."
But the show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "what it is and this is just wonderful."
"But I chose NOT to reward someone (buying his music or his clothes or supporting his "art") who I believe is embracing a vomitable ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so we are," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now "the person previously known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to have changed his name and is following Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper friend, Snoop Dogg, called himself Snoop Lion and, of course, the missing musical legend Prince, who had changed his name into a symbol and then into the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charge of attempted murder for stabbing at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed in an East Belfast restaurant on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to the police.
The defendant will have to report to the Belfast court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The Throne Star of Spade Kit Harington Attacks Toxic Masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as a fighter Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Throne of Swords.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, claiming that such on-screen soils often make the boys think they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit stated that he believed that "something went wrong" and reflected on how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married the 31-year-old co-star Trono di Spade, admitted to being very concerned about this problem.
'Personally I worry, very much at the moment - what was our mistake with masculinity?,' he said.
'What did we teach men as they grew up in terms of the problem we now observe?'
Kit believes that television could be partly responsible for the increase of toxic masculinity thanks to its extremely masculine characters.
He continued: 'What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the streets, that makes kids think they have to be in this certain way of being a man?
I think this is one of the great dilemmas of our time - how can we change things?
Because obviously something went wrong for young people.'
In the course of the interview he also admitted that he will not interpret any prequels or sequels of Throne of Spades once the series ends next summer, claiming to have "finished with battlefields and horses".
Starting in November, Kit will play the leading role in the revival of True West by Sam Shepard, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he considered the meeting with his wife Rose the best thing that happened with Throne of Swords.
"I met my wife during this series, so she gave me in this sense my future family, and my life from now on," she explained.
Rose played Ygritte, the object of Jon Snow's love, Kit's character, in the Emmy fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% in the number of people suffering from HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by these diseases, according to sources of health authorities.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported as early as the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases are due to sexual transmission, which marks a change from the past.
In some regions of China HIV has spread in the past as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has decreased to almost zero, according to the Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan Province.
Year after year, however, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an urgent problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
Because of the traditional values of the country, some studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with other men eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are caused by inadequate protections during sexual intercourse within such relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to anti-HIV drugs as part of its commitment to managing the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked the GOP senators' data, and talks about "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
On Saturday, the U.S. Congresswoman denounced accusations against a member of her staff regarding the publication of personal information by three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
The Democratic Congresswoman in Los Angeles said that the statements were fomented by opinionists and websites of the ultra-right wing.
"Bugs, lies, and still despicable lies," Waters said in a Twitter statement.
Published information would include home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was published online on Thursday, released by an anonymous Capitol during a hearing of an expert committee on allegations of sexual violence against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office and issued information related to a Waters staff member.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been endangered as a result of these false and tendentious accusations, was in no way responsible for the escape of such information.
This unfounded accusation is totally false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly generated online criticism from the former White House Press Secretary, Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is furious," wrote Fleischer.
"This implies that he does not have the character to be a Congressman.
When someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he doesn't have to get angry.
It doesn't have to be provocative.
You don't have to question the accuser's reasons.
He must remain calm and serene."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by the detractors of looking too angry at the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate in the run to dismiss Waters in the midterm elections, expressed his views on Twitter.
"Enormous if confirmed," she tweeted.
In its statement, Waters stated that its office alerted "the competent authorities and law enforcement of these tendentious claims.
"We will ensure that those responsible are exposed," he continued, "and that they must be accountable for all their dangerous and harmful actions for all members of my staff."
Johnny English review strikes again - the spy parody with an undersized Rowan Atkinson
It has now become customary to look for references to Brexit in every new film with a British touch and this seems applicable to this revival of Johnny English's action comedy, which began in 2003 and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English - The Renaissance.
The veiled self-irony on the subject of how much we suck will be the new export opportunity of the nation?
In any case, the incompetent rubber-faced Johnny English and eyes out of orbits got his license to mess things up for the second time - and his name indicates more than anything that it is a comic creation developed for countries of non-English cinema users.
Obviously it's the secreted fool agent who despite his strange claims of glamour has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr Bean and a pinch of that kind that contributed with a single note to the theme moments of Glory of the opening ceremony of the Olympic games in London 2012.
It is a character based initially on the mysterious international traveler and man who once played atkinson in the now forgotten television ads of Barclaycard, who left chaos behind him.
There are one or two nice moments in this latest release of Johnny English.
I liked Johnny English who approaches the helicopter wearing a medieval armor and the propellers throw briefly at his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is obvious, but humor seems rather undersized and strangely superfluous, especially now that "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now offer comedy as an ingredient.
Humour seems to be directed to children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English's crazy misadventures are not as original and targeted as the gags of Atkinson's silent films when he plays Mr Bean.
The premise of immutable topicality now is the fact that Britain is in serious danger.
A computer hacker infiltrated the supersecret web network of British spies, revealing the identities of all British agents on the field, with dismay of the agent in charge, a unfortunately very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that makes the vase overflow for a presumptuous and tormented Prime Minister, who is already suffering a collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her best with this character-like Teresa May but there is not much to work on in the script.
Your intelligence advisors inform you that every single active spy has been compromised and that you will have to call back someone who has already retired.
And this means that clumsy Johnny English, who now works as a school manager in a chic establishment, but who also gives unofficial lessons on how to be an undercover agent: here you can appreciate some nice gags, when English offers a spying class like School of Rock.
English is rewrote to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and meets with its former suffering partner Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, married to a submarine commander, a high society girl role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So the Batman and Robin of Disasters for His Majesty's Secret Service are back in action to meet the beautiful fatal femme of Olga Kurylenko, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously falling into the network of the charismatic billionaire of technology who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous adventures: disguised as waiters, they set fire in a French restaurant; they unleash hell entering underground on the luxury yacht of Volta and English creates pure anarchy while trying to use a virtual reality mask to get familiarity with the interior of the house of Volta.
All the scenes are certainly designed for the last sequence, but however graceful and exuberant, there is a lot of children's TV throughout the story.
The whole thing is quite modest.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: couldn't the British film industry assign Rowan Atkinson a role that does justice to his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is working out a plan for the British to work four days a week but to be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical program that would allow British citizens to work four days a week, while being paid for five.
The party would like the major companies to transfer the savings obtained through the AI revolution to the workers by offering them an extra day's rest.
In this way employees could enjoy a three-day weekend, keeping the same pay.
Some sources have stated that the idea would be compatible with the party's economic programme and plans to tilt the country towards workers.
The shift to a four-day day was endorsed by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the evolving economy.
A senior member of the Labour Party said at The Sunday Times: "By the end of the year, a review of the political line is expected to be announced."
"It won't happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an aspiration in line with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy for workers, as well as its overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week as part of the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration does not enjoy the unanimous support of the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day workweek is not part of the party's political line and is not currently being discussed."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to detail his vision of a socialist economic revolution.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "faceless managers" and "speculators" in companies for public services.
The shadow chancellor plans also imply that the current shareholders of water distribution companies may not recover their entire stock package, since the Labour government could implement "deductions" on the basis of behaviour considered illegal.
He also confirmed plans to include employees on company boards and create inclusive equity funds, so as to transfer 10% of private sector equity to employees, who end up pocketing annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote for his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raises the question as to whether the government agency's findings can influence or not any of the Republican senators in providing their support.
In an interview that will be aired on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it is possible for the FBI to bring to light something that could cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said that on my way to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after what happened, that that charge came out, I said, ‘Did you do it?’
He was resolute, determined, unequivocal."
Graham's vow, however, seems to be carved into the rock.
"I have clear ideas about Brett Kavanaugh and they could resist a bomb-proof charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And whoever you name couldn't prove it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that sees the performance of a remarkable roundup of stars and has an equally remarkable mission: ending poverty in the world.
At the seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people pouring into the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy performances like those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also an awareness of the real purpose of the event, that of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket for the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert audience had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, sending emails to a world leader, making a phone call or any other meaningful way to help raise awareness about their purpose of eradicating poverty.
But, exactly, how successful has the Global Citizen Festival now that there are 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really a genuine way of persuading people to call for action, or is it just another example of the so-called "clicktivism" - people who really feel they make a difference by simply signing an online petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, used for a lot of different purposes.
It states that these actions have helped to urge world leaders to announce commitments and policies of more than $37 billion, designed to influence the lives of more than $2.25 billion by 2030.
In the early years of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from their actions, of which they have already been paid out or used as funds at least $10 billion.
The group estimates that so far protected capital funds have had a direct impact on some 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and performers, committed to "helping children grow to their full potential", with the promise to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens just like you, we can make social injustice or malnutrition become a footnote in history," said the crowd of the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition Tracey Ullman during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that, after more than 5,000 actions have been implemented appealing to the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the FAQs on your website, who asked: "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and difficult path - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of those who will perform at this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to implement a "block" and hinder Russian energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
Washington may, "if necessary", resort to its Navy to prevent Russian energy sources from being available on the market, including the Middle East, revealed US Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russian involvement in Syria - particularly where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East lies in the fact that they want to negotiate for energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern hub of Europe," he said.
And according to officials, there are means and ways to cope with them.
"The United States has the possibility, thanks to the Navy, to ensure that the nautical routes remain open and, if necessary, implement a naval blockade, so that their energy is not put on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants at the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that calls itself the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to the negotiations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are, in fact, the same thing.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to leverage and replace fuels," he said, referring to Russia as "a little versatile", with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
The statements were made because the Trump administration was involved in a mission to enhance the export of its liquid natural gases to Europe, and to replace Russia, an option that for European consumers is by far the cheapest.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, try to convince Germany to pull itself out of North Stream 2, a "inappropriate" gas pipeline project that, according to Trump, made Berlin "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly pointed out that the Nord Stream 2, a $11 billion pipeline, designed to double the capacity of the existing one up to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument for exerting pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak, following a meeting held in Moscow in September with Rick Perry, Secretary for Energy of the United States.
The United States' stance triggered Germany's negative reaction, which reconfirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to remain out of the EU's energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I see the fact that a third state is interfering in our energy supply as a major problem," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industries Federation (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take "serious consideration" of running for presidency in 2020, says Senator of Massachusetts
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday that she will take "serious consideration" of running for president following the mid-term elections.
During a city assembly in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed to contemplate the possibility of running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our battered government, and that implies having a woman at the top," he said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president."
During the city assembly Warren said his own about President Donald Trump, declaring that he was "bringing this country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren was explicit in criticizing Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, whom he appointed to the Supreme Court.
Friday Warren tweeted: "It's natural that we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
A poll published on Thursday, however, showed that the majority of Warren's own voters do not believe that they should apply in 2020.
58 percent of the "probable" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not compete, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
32% supported such a candidacy.
The poll won more support for a candidacy by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential candidacy and 48 percent against it.
Other names of high-profile democrats discussed on a potential candidacy in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden has stated that he will make an official decision by January, as reported by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder at Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September
He was arrested and charged with a domestic violence case on Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he is going through after returning, I can relate him to other families who experience the consequences of post-traumatic stress disorders and some of the injuries our soldiers return with," he told the public at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said, of his son and other war veterans, "they return a little different, hardened, wondering if there is that respect for which their comrades soldiers and pilots, and every other member of the army, have consecrated themselves to the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assault and domestic violence on a woman, which interferes with a report for domestic violence and possession of a gun under narcotics, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States and the District of Columbia support the challenge for new asylum policies
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal battle against a new U.S. policy that denies asylum for victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 States and District of Columbia on Friday presented an amicus curiae memory in Washington to support an asylum seeker who contested this policy, as reported by NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in the appeal Grace v. Sessions that the American Union for Civil Liberties presented in August against federal politics was not revealed.
He stated that his partner "and his violent children members of the gang" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her request for asylum on July 20.
She was put in detention in Texas.
Prosecutors who support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as countries facing rampant problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy reversed a decision taken in 2014 by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed asylum applications to undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence.
On Friday, the District Attorney General of Columbia, Karl Racine, declared that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be judged on the basis of particular events and circumstances of the request, and such a prohibition violates that principle," says the memory amicus curiae.
Within the memory, prosecutors also objected that the policy that bans the entry of immigrants harms the US economy, stating the clear likelihood that they will become entrepreneurs and "provide necessary labour".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop providing asylum for victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
"Asylum is accessible to those who leave their country of origin because of persecutions or fears due to race, religion, nationality, membership of certain social groups or political opinion," said Sessions on 11 June, as part of the announcement of the political line.
Kindergarten has never been designed to mitigate every problem -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate attempts at recovery in Palu while the death balance doubles in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation became increasingly desperate.
"There is a lot of tension," said her 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while comforting her little feverish child in an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"At every moment there's an ambulance carrying bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, rummaging through their dim personal belongings, trying to recover whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were overflowing.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who was the victim of a shoulder and back fracture, rested outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outside due to the continued severe adjustment shocks.
His eyes were filled with tears as he recounted the feeling of the violent earthquake shaking the room he shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor of a hotel.
"There was no time to save us.
"I was crushed in the rubble of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to you and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "doing bullies" with "advertising propaganda"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper, advertising the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press for propaganda.
USA On Wednesday, President Donald Trump referred to China Daily's announcement in the Des Moines Register - the highest-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the US Congressional elections on November 6, an accusation that China rejects.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to meddle in the U.S. election highlighted what US officials reported to Reuters as a new phase of a Washington-based escalation campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in a trade war in escalation that has seen them adapt their duties to their imports.
China's retaliatory duties at the beginning of the trade war were designed to target exporters in states such as Iowa, who supported Trump's Republican Party, as stated by Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and formerly long-standing governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, stated that Beijing had damaged American workers, peasants and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad in an opinion article in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now increases those bullies by publishing advertising in our free newspapers."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the beloved American tradition of freedom of speech and the press, placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"Viceversa, in the newsstand on the street here in Beijing you will find few dissenting voices and you will not see any real reflection of the disparate views that the Chinese population might have on China's problematic economic trajectory, since the media are under the firm grip of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most distinguished newspapers has eluded the offer to publish" his article, although he has not stated what newspaper it is.
The Republicans are alienating the female electorate before the mid-term elections with the Kavanaugh case, warning analysts
Since many leading Republicans defend Brett Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court and stand by him in dealing with various allegations of sexual harassment, analysts have reported that a negative reaction will be seen, especially by women, during the forthcoming mid-term elections.
The agitation in this regard has been extremely high, and many Republicans have already officially shown that they want to continue with a vote.
"You can't pick this up," he told The Hill Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said she doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last-minute insistence on an FBI investigation would suffice to appease angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it either tomorrow or November," he said on Friday, according to Washington newspaper, D.C., Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior consultant and national spokesman of the progressive group MoveOn.
On Friday morning the protesters repeated the slogan "November is coming!" during their protest in the Senate Hall, when the Republicans who control the Judiciary Commission chose to continue with the candidacy of Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of Democrats are skyrocketing," Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told news site.
"People say they were already tall; it's true.
But they could be higher, especially between the undecided electrics of the suburbs and the young voters, between the ages of 18 and 29, who often do not vote despite not liking the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony, which provided details of his allegations of sexual harassment against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts had speculated that a negative reaction could occur if the Republicans continued with confirmation.
"For the GOP it has become a confusing whole," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the vote for the committee, the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be benched, it's also about the way the Republicans handled the situation and the way they treated her," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, pointed out to the news channel, a group that helps to elect Democrats.
In any case, Americans seem to be somehow divided between the person to believe following the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a lower percentage in favor of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents have definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent claim to have certainly or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
Moreover, 38 percent said they believed that Kavanaugh probably or surely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's allegations, as well as at least one of the other accusers, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Last week Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judicial Committee that Kavanaugh attacked her in a drunken state when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate exhibited her genitals during a party during her studies in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to start a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that seeks to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company that takes its origins from Berners-Lee's open source solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what people will have access to and what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt was to "dominate the world".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal data store online" or a POD.
It can include lists of contacts, to-dos, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available on one browser and at the same time.
The uniqueness of the warehouse of personal data online is that it is completely at the user's choice who can have access to what type of information.
The company calls it "personal enhancement through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to John Bruce, CEO of the company, is to provide adequate resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, some developers in the staff hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology programmers from all over the world will be able to create their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team will not tell "Facebook and Google whether or not to introduce a complete change where their business models are completely wiped out overnight.
"We're not asking their permission."

Bernard Vann: Commemorated the clergyman of the Great War with Victoria Cross
The only clergyman of the Church of England to be awarded a Victoria Cross during the First World War as a fighter was commemorated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel, Reverend Bernard Vann, received recognition on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew he had achieved the highest level of British military honor.
On Saturday in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandchildren inaugurated a memorial plate.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that it was "magnificently symbolic" that the stone would be inaugurated exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning feat.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion over the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a thick fog, under heavy fire of the camp and war machines".
Then he hurried towards the line of fire and with the "largest gallantry" advanced the line before running with a single-handed cannon and landing three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never live up to and something that makes me humbler."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a crown of flowers after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "he felt really honored to play a role in the parade" and added "the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given to him by many people".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead they caught Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stayed up all night to watch the famous Bellator 206 just to see the vision of the main event denied.
The program from San Jose included 13 fights, including the six on the main card, and was to be broadcast in the UK during the night, live on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to collide, viewers in the United Kingdom were stunned when Peppa Pig appeared on the screen.
Some remained grounded after staying awake until the early morning hours specially for combat.
On Twitter, a fan described the transition to children's cartoon as "a kind of sick joke".
"The government's rules say that at six o'clock in the morning that content was no longer appropriate, so it had to move on to children's programming," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of Bellator for marketing and communication, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig," "yes."
"The president of Bellator company, Scott Coker, said they will work on programming to include viewers from the UK in the future.
"I think when I think about replay, I think we can probably figure something out," said Coker.
"But there it is 6:00 in the morning on Sunday and we will not be able to find a solution before Sunday of our time zone, Monday for theirs.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when he changed his schedule, a lot of messages came along and no one was friendly.
We were trying to solve the problem. We thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't. It was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen next time.
We will limit it to five fights instead of six - as we normally do - and we have tried to get so much for the fans, and we have just discussed it.
It's an unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" because of sexuality
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to anyone because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old stated that he did not realize, until he arrived at secondary school, that "not everyone is like me".
Speaking on the first episode of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he made his voice heard about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also stated that becoming a parent meant that he cared less about winning the Olympics.
The usual presenter of the long-standing program, Kirsty Young, took a series of months off for illness.
Presenting himself as an outcast in Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less than" anyone else as he grew up because "it was not socially acceptable that he liked both boys and girls."
He said, "Today, the feeling of feeling less, and feeling different, were the things that really gave me the strength and energy to succeed."
He wanted to prove he was "something," he said, so he wouldn't let anyone down if they found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze medal at the Olympics became a high-profile LGBT activist and used its face in this year's Australian Commonwealth Games to appeal to multiple countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he made his voice heard because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said that the fact that he fell in love with a man - the American director Dustin Lance Black, who met me in 2013 - "has taken me by surprise".
Daley married the Oscar winner, who was 20 years older than him last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you spend so much at a young age" - he went to his first Olympics when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The two became parents in June, of a child named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his "whole perspective" changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was all about the fact that 'I had to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know, there are things more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father had not accepted the fact that he was dying and that one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets to London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you won't be around here so you could be in the front row, Dad'," he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and until he actually stopped and died, I had not yet realized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics, winning bronze.
"I only knew it was what I had dreamed of my whole life - swimming in front of an audience at home in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song - Heather Small's Proud - which had a particular meaning for him in preparing for the Olympics and still gives him goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Out of shape Mickelson benched in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will score a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to get back in shape to avoid it becoming an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, playing in the biennial event for a twelfth time as a record, was benched by Captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as it has often been for the United States, the five-time champion spent the day between cheerleading and working on his own game in the range, in the hope of correcting what torments him.
Having never been the strongest driver even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the difficult Le Golf National, where the uneven path regularly punishes the wrong shots.
And if the path itself was not daunting enough, Mickelson, in Sunday's ninth match, faced the careful champion of the British Open Francesco Molinari, who collaborated with the rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, four points below the start of their 12 single matches, start with a hot start, Mickelson's match could turn out to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his own man, not that he could say much else.
"He fully understood the role he played today, patted me on the shoulder, put his arm around me, and said he'd be ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of self-confidence.
It's a Hall of Famer and has added so much to the teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't imagine playing two games.
I had imagined more, but this is the way it went and this is the way we thought it should go.
He wants to participate, just like anyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record on Sunday for the highest number of games played in the Ryder Cup.
It could mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that never even remotely reflected the heights of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 games won, 20 defeats and seven draws, although Furyk said that his presence brought intangible assets to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to make fun of people, and he's a great guy to have in the meeting room," he explained.
"I also think the younger players had fun trying to fight him this week, something that was fun to watch.
He's done a lot more than play."
The captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, knows that a good advantage can vanish soon
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows from experience that a considerable advantage in the individual encounters of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable chase.
The Danish debuted in the 1997 match in Valderrama where the team, led by Seve Ballesteros, despite a five-point gap from the Americans, arrived at the finish line with a minimum advantage, winning 141⁄2-131/2.
"I keep telling myself that we had a good advantage in Valderrama, we had it in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won, but little," Bjorn said (in the photo) after seeing the class of 2018 win, Friday for 5 to 3 and yesterday for 10 to 6, at Le Golf National.
"That's why the story will prove to me and my team that it's not over.
Tomorrow we have to do the best we can.
You have to go out there and do everything right.
It's not over until the stitches are marked on the board.
Our goal is to try to win the trophy, and that's what we need to focus on.
I always focus on the 12 players on my team, but I know who's on the other side: the best golfers in the world."
Happy with the way his team competed in that difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never have been over it.
Tomorrow's is a different challenge.
Tomorrow is the turn of individual performances, which is another thing.
It's nice to be there with a teammate when things are going well, but when you're just your golfer skills are put to the test.
This is the message that needs to be sent to players: tomorrow, you have to bring out the best of yourself.
Then, you forget about your partner because he too has to go there and bring out the best of himself."
In contrast to Bjorn, Jim Furyk will seek the best individual more than team performance in his players, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who collected three out of four points.
Furyk himself found himself on both sides in those great matches of the last day, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before losing against the European "Miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every single word," he commented in response to the question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, led his players in the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but we want to start right away with the right foot as we did in Brookline and Medinah.
When the game starts to take a certain fold, the pressure increases in the intermediate games.
So let's organize our training accordingly and classify the kids as appropriate, because tomorrow we will try to do a magic.
Thomas was given the task of leading the counteroffensive and facing Rory McIlroy in the top match with, in order, the other Europeans, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, in the first half.
"I chose this order because I think it covers the path to the end," Bjorn said about his selection for individual meetings.
the new military ship of Germany is postponed again
According to local media, the last frigate of the German Navy should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old military ships of the Cold War times, but there will not be at least until next year due to faulty systems and a surge in costs.
The commission of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the new frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but worrying issues after delivery tormented the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old ships of the Bremen class.
They will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, in fact it should be possible to employ new frigates up to two years away from national ports.
However, the continuous delays imply that the innovative warships, which are said to allow Germany to project its power overseas, will already become obsolete when they enter service, notes the Die Zeit.
The unfortunate frigate Type F-125 made news last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the builder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media noticed a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that made the ship useless when employed on a combat mission.
The deficiencies in the software were particularly important as the Baden-Württemberg class ships will be managed by a crew of about 120 sailors, just half the staff of the oldest ships in the Bremen class.
Moreover, it has emerged that the ship weighs decidedly too much, and this reduces its performances and limits the possibility of the Navy to add future updates.
Rheinland-Pfalz, of 7,000 tons, is thought to be twice as heavy as the ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from the defective hardware, the cost of the entire project (including crew training) is also becoming an important issue.
It appears that it has reached 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) from the initial 2.2 billion euros.
The problems involving the new frigates become of particular importance in the light of the recent alarms concerning the reduction of German naval power.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, parliamentary commissioner for the Armed Forces, admitted that the military Navy actually "discards ships capable of being employed".
The official stated that the issue has deteriorated considerably over time, since the old unarmed ships have not been replaced by new ships.
His regret is that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Trust is spying on the secret life of bats
New research carried out in a Scottish Highland estate aims to reveal the way bats use sight to procure food.
It is hoped that discoveries can shed light on the behavior of the only flying mammals in existence and guide future protection activities.
The study of the scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will follow common bats and soprano, in addition to the brown mumps and bats of Daubenton at the Inverewe Gardens, in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key places around the property to track the activities of bats during the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using portable detectors.
Analysis of sounds recorded by an expert will determine the frequency of bat calls and the way each species behaves.
A habitat map and a relationship will then be produced to create a detailed picture of their behaviour on a scale.
Rob Dewar, nature protection consultant for the NTS, hopes that the results can reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how these are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows, and how best to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom has decreased considerably in the last century.
Bats are at risk due to construction and development works that affect trespolis and ruin the habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a threat, as can flypaper and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than the eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use a sophisticated ecolocation technique to detect insects and obstacles on their trajectory.
The NTS, responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
Ten qualified experts conduct regular investigations, inspect the trespolis and sometimes carry out rescues.
The organization has even established the first reserve of Scotland intended solely for bats at the Threeve estate, in the region of Dumfries and Galloway, which houses eight of the ten species of bats of Scotland.
The manager of the estate, David Thompson, says that the property is the ideal territory.
"Here in Threeave we have a large area for bats," he said.
"We have ancient buildings, many secular trees and a good habitat.
But there's a lot about bats that we don't know yet, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand more about their growth needs."
It stresses the importance of controlling bats before conducting maintenance within the properties as it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single maternal trespole can kill up to 400 females and small, possibly sweeping away an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass them, disturb them or destroy their trespolis.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish head of Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
He said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations are doing".
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while lawyers sue the German weekly
Cristiano Ronaldo labeled rape charges against him as "false news", claiming that people "want to advertise" under his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel who published the charges.
Juventus's Portuguese attacker was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel also announced on Friday the charge of paying $375,000 to keep quiet about what happened.
In an Instagram video directed to his 142 million followers, in the hours following the accusations, Ronaldo, 33, has cut off the statements as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false," says the five-time Golden Ball facing the camera.
"They want to advertise through my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by my name, but this is part of the game.
I'm happy and everything's fine," added the footballer smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel about the allegations, called "an inadmissible report of suspects in the private sphere".
Lawyer Christian Schertz stated that the player will claim compensation for "moral damage to the extent of the seriousness of the violation of privacy, considered, probably, one of the most serious of the personal rights of recent years".
The event would take place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a discotheque, Ronaldo and Mayorga would return to the footballer's room, where he subjected her to anal violence, as reported in the statements filed at Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo would get down on his knees after what happened by saying he was "99 percent" a "good boy" disappointed by "one percent".
The papers show that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sexual intercourse, but that this was consensual.
Mayorga also states that she went to the police and hospital, where her injuries were photographed, but that she later agreed to a conciliation agreement because she felt "terrorized by retaliation" and worried about the prospect of "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old now tries to overturn the deal, claiming she's still traumatized by the alleged accident.
Ronaldo was about to move to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the event, and this summer he will join the Italian Juventus with a contract of 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK will forever regret the loss of car manufacturers
The UK "could regret forever" the loss of its status as a world leader in car construction following Brexit, said Industry Minister Greg Clark.
He also added that he was "concerned" about Toyota UK's statements to the BBC about Britain's possible exit from the EU without an agreement and the consequent momentary blockade of production at the Burnaston factory near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Minister Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer claims that delays at borders, in the case of an agreementless Brexit, could affect jobs.
The factory in Burnaston, where Toyota Auris and Avensis are built, produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will stop," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's General Manager in Burnaston.
It increases concern in other UK car manufacturers for exit from the EU without an agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, claims that after Brexit it will shut down its Mini plants in Oxford for a month.
The main concern concerns the risks in the supply chain found by manufacturers in the event of Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line is managed on the basis of the "just in time" concept, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from British and European suppliers for custom cars.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there may be difficulties at borders that would cause delays and lack of parties.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day of inventory value at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would be stopped.
Minister Clark argues that Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely designed to avoid these border inconveniences".
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best deal that will allow us to enjoy not only the current success but to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The proof, not only from Toyota but also from other car manufacturers, is that we absolutely must be able to continue what was a very successful distribution chain."
Toyota has not been able to tell how long production could stop but, in the long run, warns that additional costs could reduce plant competitiveness and potentially jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is responsible for the plant's trade union delegates, says that the workers are very concerned: "According to my experience, once jobs are reduced, they are no longer reinstated."
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for future relations with the EU".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says the White House.
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be "a week's delay", while the dispute over Judge Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House declared on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller investigating Russian interference in the elections, the links between Trump's advisors and Russia, and the possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The possibility that Trump could fire the Deputy Minister of Justice, thus jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has fueled Washington's gossip for months.
Over the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about wearing a bug to record conversations with Trump and trying to remove the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House and there was a rumor that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Wednesday with Trump, who was at that time at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid an overlap with the Senate Justice Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual violence, Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week of investigation of questions by the FBI against Kavanaugh, further delaying the final vote of the Senate.
Trump's spokesman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "A date has not been established, it could be this week, I imagine it will be another week considering everything that is going on with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and continue to update the press."
Some journalists may dispute this statement: Sanders has not held a briefing with the press at the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked for the reason.
Sanders said that the lack of briefing was not due to an aversion for television journalists "who show off", although he said: "I do not disagree with the fact that they show off".
He then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press could be more frequent.
"The president holds more sessions of Questions and Answers than any president before him," he said, adding without mentioning the evidence: "We checked the figures."
The briefings will still be there, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it's much better than talking to me.
We try to do this, as in recent weeks, and this will replace briefings with the press and you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown the reason for this, giving a free-wheel speech, and at the same time a bizarre one, in front of a group of journalists.
The Minister of Health writes to the European workers of the Scottish NHS to express his concerns about Brexit
The Health Minister wrote to EU staff working at the NHS of Scotland to express the country's gratitude and wish them a stay after Brexit.
Scottish MEP Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months in advance of the UK's exit from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to meeting the costs of the settled status requirements for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Minister Freeman writes: "All summer there have been continuous negotiations between the UK and the EU on Brexit, which will lead to autumn decisions.
But the British Government has also prepared itself in the event of a scenario without agreement.
I know this is a time of great concern to all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate today my appreciation for the contribution made by all staff members, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, giving benefits to patients and communities to whom we offer a service.
Scotland is certainly your home and we very much want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie was operated in an emergency following a head injury
The Tennessee State Tigers defender, Christion Abercrombie, underwent an emergency surgical operation after having suffered a head injury in the Saturday match against the Vanderbilt Commodores in which the team lost 31 to 27, as reported by Mike Organ of the newspaper The Tennessean.
Technical Manager Rod Reed told reporters that the accident that caused the injury occurred just before the break.
"He approached the edge of the field and fainted," Reed said.
First aid workers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field before putting him on a stretcher and taking him away for further investigation.
A Tennessee State executive reported to Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie underwent surgery at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that "no news yet of the type and extent of the damage" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when he was injured.
Abercrombie, a sophomore, is in his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had made a total of five tackles before abandoning the game, which brought his season total to 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp taxes for the purchase of property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp taxes for buying property in the UK and additional cash flow will be used to help homeless people, according to new Labour plans
The maneuver will neutralise the success of Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters
The increase in stamp duty will be applied to taxpayers who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
Treasury plans to raise up to £120 million a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp taxes for buying property in the UK and additional cash flow will be used to help homeless people, will announce theresa May today.
The maneuver will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters with the promise to provide more affordable housing and higher incomes.
The increase in stamp duty will be applied to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and additional resources will be in support of the government's initiative to combat the phenomenon of the homeless.
The surcharge, which is added to the current stamp tax, including the high levels introduced two years ago on second houses and buy to let properties, could amount to more than 3%.
The Treasury expects the maneuver to raise up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13% of new buildings in London are purchased by non-resident citizens in the UK, raising prices and making it difficult for buyers to enter a first home into the real estate market.
Many of the richest areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the state.
The new policy comes a few weeks after Boris Johnson had required a stamp tax cut to help the younger ones with the purchase of the first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by hoarding land without using it and encouraged Prime Minister May to give up allowances on affordable housing to settle the British "real estate disgrace".
Mr Corbyn announced a striking series of proposals for reforming the housing market, including rent controls and the elimination of blameless evictions.
He also wants to give the board more powers over the construction of new buildings.
Prime Minister May said: "Last year I said that I would be committed to restoring the British dream, namely that life should be better for the new generations.
And that means restoring the real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it would not be fair if the purchase of a home was equally easy for people who do not reside in the UK and for foreign companies, as it is for resident British workers.
For so many people the dream of owning a house has become too distant and the dignity of the homeless remains a reality".
Jack Ross: "My greatest aspiration is to drive Scotland"
Sunderland's Technical Director, Jack Ross, says that his "maximum aspiration" is to eventually become Scotland's manager.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is attracted by the challenge of raising the North-East team that is currently third in the League One, three points from the top.
He landed at the Stadium of Light this summer after driving the St. Mirren during the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a footballer.
I've been in the B series and that's all," Ross told the Scottish BBC Sportsound program.
I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father as a kid, and it's something I'll always remember.
However, this will only be possible if I succeed as a team manager."
Ross' predecessors led Sunderland were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic technician claims to feel no anxiety about following such important names, in an equally important team, having previously rejected the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me right now is measured by the ability to bring the team back to the Premier League."
Considering the structure and facilities of the club, we can say that it undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task, but I think I'll only succeed if I get the team back up."
Ross' career as a manager began three years ago, after a period as an assistant coach in Dumbarton and 15 months as a substitute coach for Hearts.
He then helped Alloa save himself from relegation to the third level and brought St. Mirren from the edge of the relegation to the title of Champions of the Championship, the following season.
Ross claims to feel much more comfortable now than during his career as a footballer in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real turning point," he recalls on the direction of the Alloa.
"I really believed that the role of manager was done especially for me, rather than the role of player.
It seems strange because I worked well, made a living and had some good results.
But playing can be tough.
There are many things you have to deal with weekly.
I still face them in terms of stress and work pressure but the management seems good.
I've always wanted to direct and now I do, I feel much more calm than I've ever been in my life."

The figures show that pubs and bars saw an increase in sales of 2.7% in July, while the receipts of restaurants dropped by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, of CGA's commercial consulting firm, put together the data and commented: "The persistence of the sun and the long stay of England at the World Cup meant that July followed a path similar to that of June, when the pubs were above 2.8 percent, while the restaurants were hit harder.
The 1.8% fall in catering in June worsened in July.
The pubs and bars in which most people drink have been found to be the most solid, with a homogeneous increase greater than the decrease in restaurants.
Even the pubs in which you eat have suffered from the heat, although not too much as the restaurateurs.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Drink sales in managed pubs and bars rose by 6.6% in the month, while food consumption fell by three percent."
Paul Newman, a recreational and receptive RSM analyst, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sporting events remains the main factor when it comes to selling in the retail market.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to struggle, although a fall in sales of 4.8 percent per year will be particularly burdensome in addition to the continuing cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for restaurateurs and only time can tell if the moderate temperatures we enjoyed in August will give us a necessary truce".
The overall growth in sales between pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the drop in brand roll-out.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales monitoring company for British pubs, bars and restaurants brings together and analyzes performance data through 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over £9 billion, and is the industry's reference company.
One in five children has secret accounts of social networks that hide from their parents
A survey reveals that one in five children, some just 11 years old, has secret accounts of social networks that hide from parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in "fake on Instagram" pages
The news has strengthened the fear that sexual content will be posted
20 percent of students said they had a "main" account to show their parents.
One in five children, some just 11 years old, creates accounts of social networks that keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in "fake on Instagram" accounts, a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has strengthened the fear that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of students said they were running a "main" account that was clean to show their parents while keeping a private one.
A mother who accidentally discovered the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who urged others to "rape me."
Research by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of private schools showed that 40% of children between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, and half of them admitted to keeping private accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: "It is alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "voice for athletes" at the Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive member of the Scottish Athletics Council during the National General Assembly of the Administrative Body.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete in light athletics and President Ian Beattie described the appointment as a great opportunity for sports managers to take advantage of his extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys deep respect in the Scottish, British and world athletic community and we are sure that athletics in Scotland could take a huge advantage by bringing it within the board," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I look forward to acting as a voice of athletes and I hope to be able to contribute and help guide sport in Scotland."
The American, winner of the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games and four Olympic Gold Medals, as well as currently BBC opinionist, found herself unable to walk following a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted, "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to doctors only time could tell if I would recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work but I recovered completely, learned to walk again and today I move with agility!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!".
The advertising of a breast pump compares mothers and cows and divides opinion online
A milk pump company has divided the opinion on the net with an advertisement that compares nursing mothers and cows that are milked.
To mark the launch of what is defined as the "first silent and wearable breast pump in the world", the consumer technology company Elvie launched an advertisement in the form of a playful music video to show the freedom to express itself as mothers given by the new breast pump.
Four real mothers dance in a cow barn on a track that includes songs like, "Yes, I throw milk but I don't have one thing" and "If I hadn't noticed, these aren't udders but my boobs."
The choir continues: "Bring him out, pull him out, feed the children, pull him out, pull him out, milk my ladies."
However, advertising, published on the company's Facebook pages, has caused online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video sparked different reactions among viewers, many of whom claimed that it highlighted the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"An unhappy decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they must be pregnant and given birth to produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them a few days after their birth," someone wrote.
The Elvie breast pump is worn discreetly under a breast bra
Someone else commented: "Comprehensibly traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for moms who will continue to keep their children?"
Someone else added, "It's really nonsense advertising."
Others defended her and a woman even admitted to finding the song "fun".
"I think that's a brilliant idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I'd like to have one.
When I used the breast pump, I felt just like a cow.
Advertising is a bit irreverent, but it doesn't go far from reality.
This is a brilliant product," someone wrote.
Another person commented: "It is a fun ad dedicated to mothers who use breast pump (often in the workplace or in the bathroom) and feel like "cows."
Its purpose is not to praise or judge the dairy industry."
In the end, the protagonists of the video show that they danced with a discreet breast pump in their bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use breast pump feel like cows.
The Elvie breast pump is however completely silent, has no wires or tubes and can be stuck in a nursing bra giving women the freedom to move, hold children in their arms and even get out while pulling milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD of Mother commented: "The Elvie breast pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
Comparing the women who use the breast pump to the cows we wanted to highlight all the challenges of this practice demonstrating in a fun and easily recognizable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new breast pump is able to assure".
This isn't the first time the Elvie breast pump has made news.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children showed up on the catwalk of designer Marta Jakubowski wearing this product.
Hundreds of migrant children silently moved to a tent city on the edge of Texas
The number of migrant children has increased exponentially even though the monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and political line of Trump administration have made it more difficult for these children to be trusted.
Most of those who relied on them were usually illegal immigrants who are now afraid of jeopardising the possibility of staying in the country by offering to do so.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that the potential foster care and other adult members of their families would be fingerprinted and that the data would be transmitted to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who had offered to rely on lonely children.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
"Almost 80% of the people who offer to trust children or belong to the families of these people are in the country illegally and most of them are foreign criminals.
We are therefore continuing to hunt these people," Albence said.
To try to process children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules for some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard period, according to those who work at reception points.
Many will appear in videoconferencing rather than in person, to plead their case for legal status with an immigration judge.
Those who are considered unfit to receive help will be expelled quickly.
The longer the children remain in foster care, the more they risk suffering from anxiety and depression that cause violent attacks of anger or attempts to escape, according to those who work at reception points and the relationships that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Those who support this position claim that the probability of this happening is even higher in a large structure such as Tornillo where, precisely because of its size, it is easier for the signs of discomfort of children to be ignored.
They add that moving children into the tent city without giving them time to emotionally prepare or greet friends could exacerbate the trauma that many are already facing.
Syria urges US, French and Turkish occupying forces to withdraw immediately
In his speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also invited Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war has now reached the eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the post of Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces occupy Syrian soil illegally under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "will be treated accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately without any conditions," he said in front of the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where since 2011 there have been more than 360,000 deaths and millions of people have had to leave their homes.
He reiterated that Damascus will continue to "fight this holy war until it has freed all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who mainly train and support Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this war-torn country.
On the refugee problem, Mr Moualem said that the conditions were favourable to their return and accused "some Western countries" of "inciting unfounded fears" that led refugees to stay away from their homeland.
"We asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to intervene to facilitate their return," he said.
"What should only be a humanitarian problem is politicized."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid in Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold, created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey avoided an extensive attack by the Syrian forces supported by the Russians in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem however stressed that the agreement had "precise deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would target jihadists, including al-Nusra fighters linked to Al-Qaeda, who "will be uprooted".
United Nations envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to convene soon a new committee of members of the government and opposition to draw up a draft constitution for post-war Syria and prepare the way for the elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the group's work should be limited to "revision of the articles of the present constitution" without interference.
Why Trump will win the second term of office
Based on this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal spectators may hope, his presidency should end prematurely because of an impeachment or scandal.
In what will undoubtedly be "the most dramatic presidency finale ever!"
At the moment, there are no signs of a decrease in the audience.
Since 2014, the percentages of the first evening have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the first night, significantly increasing compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the program "The Rachel Maddow Show" of MSNBC has exceeded the percentages of the network reaching 3.5 million spectators in the evenings with the most important news.
"It's a fire that people are attracted to because it's not something that can be explained," says Neal Baer, showrunner of ABC's television series "Designated Survivor" that tells the story of a cabinet member who suddenly becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
In Scovell, an expert writer of brilliant comedies and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", she has another theory.
Remember a taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he'd vote for Trump.
She asked him why.
He said, "Because it makes me laugh."
Chaos is therefore a source of fun.
Of course, unlike any other television program, the plot of Washington's events can determine the future of the Roe vs. Wade judgment, whether immigrant families will be able to meet or not and the health of the global economy.
Quit following the news, however, is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet it goes far beyond the duty of informed citizens to find themselves following for the sixth consecutive hour a group of experts who discuss Bob Woodward's in-depth research for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather jacket ("a garment full of tracotancy" commented The Washington Post) and the implications of the disgusting descriptions that Stormy Daniels makes of Trump's anatomical parts.
For example, I won't be able to watch Super Mario without thinking about it.
"Part of why what he does looks like a reality show is that every night there are news," says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of "Pawn Stars", about the rotation of actors and the daily developments of the Trump show's plot (in contrast to N.F.L. that praises Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss an episode, otherwise you stay back.
This week I visited Mike Fleiss on the north coast of Kauai and although it was a sunny day with almost 30 degrees, he was locked in the house watching MSNBC and meanwhile recording CNN.
He couldn't get off the TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh faced the Senate judicial committee and the uncertain future of the Supreme Court.
Fleiss commented: "I remember when we used to do all those crazy programs and people saying, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization."
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

Influence of external money in the race for the tightest elections of the half term
It is no surprise that an influx of money is taking place in the 17th district thanks to the realignment of a congressional district that has made two members in office now run for the same place.
The recent redefinition of the suburban district of Pittsburg brings to the stage Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who took his place in another district during a special election that took place last spring.
Lamb is running against another member in office, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania that overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January ruled that in the old districts the electoral colleges had been unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The 17th district race sparked a campaign characterized by fierce opposition between the financial branches of the two major parties, namely the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a measured victory in the March special election for the 18th Pennsylvania Congressional District.
That place had been occupied by a Republican for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 points.
Political opinionists have given the democrats a slight advantage.
The United States thought to penalize El Salvador because it supports China, then changed their mind
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
In June 2017, a rather cordial meeting took place between President of Panama Juan Carlos Varela and President Trump, who also had a hotel in Panama until the partners forced the Trump Organization executive group to leave.
State Department officials have decided to bring the heads of American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama back to the "recent decision not to recognize Taiwan anymore", said the spokesman of the Heather Nauert department in a statement issued at the beginning of the month.
But the decision to apply sanctions was made only against El Salvador, which in 2017 received some $140 million in aid from the Americans for the control of drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and restrictions on the granting of visas, would have been worrying for the Central American country with a high percentage of unemployed and murders.
After a series of internal meetings, officials from North America and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on economic security and prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in trying to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior management officials made it clear that they intended to continue with the conference, thus giving up any sanctions against El Salvador definitively.
Vice-President Mike Pence was appointed to chair the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, demonstrating the importance that the administration attaches to this meeting, say diplomats.
And the three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without receiving further rebuke or punishment messages from Washington.
A Bolton spokesman at the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials and two diplomats who agreed to speak anonymously about internal decisions.
What they told was confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration who wanted to keep anonymity.
Study History
In his report, Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller may accuse Trump of obstruction of justice, which seems to be sufficient evidence.
According to what is said, Mueller's investigation intends to shed light on Trump's possible collusion with Russia during the presidential campaign.
If Congress were to pass to the Democrats, Trump would have to respond to these accusations before the voters and perhaps to a jury of his peers just as he prepares for a new candidacy.
There are many unknowns and I do not intend to say that Trump's fall is inevitable, as is not the case with his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic we will have to make choices that will determine how long the fight could last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to organize a coup against Hitler if the Western powers had stopped him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
On that occasion, we failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points where the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans have to deal with a number of them at the moment.
What if Trump decides to fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's position has been complicated since this newspaper reported that last year it secretly suggested that Trump be intercepted by questioning his ability to play the role of president.
Rosenstein claims that the news in The Times is not true.
"How will we react if the FBI's new investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or impartial, or if it is confirmed at the Supreme Court despite reliable allegations of attempted rape and perjury?
And above all, in the mid-term elections we will vote for a Congress that will ask Trump to respond to his actions?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will have to prepare for a long winter.
But the lesson I learned in Prague makes me think we're gonna make it.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, moved to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles with the swastika.
With such a legacy, I can only be optimistic about the future."

Graham Dorrans of Rangers is optimistic about meeting with Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the convincing draw against Villarreal in Spain, would give them great opportunities to qualify for the Europa League G Group.
Although the midfielder Graham Dorrans played his first match of the season at the 2-2 draw with Villarreal due to a knee injury, he believes that this result can allow Rangers to do great things.
"For us it was a positive result because the Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We faced the game convinced we were doing well and brought home a point.
Perhaps we could have won in extremis but, after all, the draw is a fair result.
They were better in the first half, while in the second we played better.
As far as Thursday is concerned, it will be another great European evening.
We hope to win the three points but it will be a difficult match because our opponents have achieved a good result in the last game. I am sure, however, that, thanks to the support of the audience, we will not disappoint.
Last year it was certainly difficult because of my injuries and changes at the club level but now the feelings are positive.
The team is in good shape, the boys are having fun and the preparation is going well.
We can therefore forget the problems of last season and think about the future."
Women are concerned about the cost of long-term care
Although those who participated in the survey have clear ideas about the type of assistance they would like to receive, few have addressed the issue in the family.
About half of the people interviewed by Nationwide say they talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% say they talked to their children.
According to Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide life insurance industry, "people want a member of their family to take care of them, but they don't face this conversation."
That's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children about it: You cannot prepare your family to assist you unless you communicate in time what you desire.
If you have a consultant, decide together with him and your family where and how you want to receive assistance, because these factors can be determinant for costs.
Involve a financial advisor: he can advise you how to pay the expenses you will face.
The choice of long-term care funding may include a traditional insurance policy or a hybrid life insurance policy with redemption value to cover these expenses or continue to pay money for insurance as long as you are able to do so.
Prepare all necessary documents to avoid legal battles at your death.
Name a health care attorney so that a person you trust can supervise medical care and make sure that professionals meet your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also consider the possibility of a proxy for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure that your accounts are paid in case you are unable to do so.
Don't forget the details: imagine that your elderly parent is being rushed to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write this information in detail so that you are always ready.
"It's not just about finances, but who are the doctors?" chiede Martin.
"What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Prepare for any eventuality."
Man shot several times with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was hit several times with an air rifle as he walked home after spending the evening out.
The victim, a 40-year-old, was in the area of Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as "random action".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
He's not in any way life-threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official sources, at least 384 people died following a massive earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday. The victims’ balance is set to rise.
Communications have been interrupted and the relief officers have been unable to get any information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is near the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some essential data on Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island Sulawesi and with a population of about 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
When she was hit by the earthquake and tsunami, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a regency that extends more than 300 km (180 miles) of coast in the northwest of the island Sulawesi.
The regency, an administrative region dependent on a province, had about 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of livelihood of the economy of the Central Sulawesi province and especially of the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also an important activity in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected several times by tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
Another tsunami struck the western area of Donggala in 1996 killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic zone called Pacific Fire Belt and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the strongest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On 26 December a massive earthquake on the western coast of Aceh province north of Sumatra caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries killing, along the Indian Ocean coast, 226,000 people, more than half of them Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: an earthquake of magnitude 6.8 struck the southern area of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast killing almost 700 people.
2009: an earthquake of magnitude 7.6 struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
The victims were over 1,100.
2010: an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 struck one of the Mentawai Islands, off Sumatra, causing a tsunami of 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A slight earthquake struck the Regency Pidie Jaya in Aceh causing destruction and panic in people who remembered the devastation of the earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
In this case there was no tsunami but more than 100 people died under the rubble.
2018: A strong earthquake hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia killing more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaskan governor and candidate for vice president Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report issued Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, Palin, 29 years old, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, for obstructing the complaint and resisting arrest.
According to the report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, she ripped her phone off her hands.
Palin was transferred to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility center and his bail was set at $500, according to KTUU.
According to the television network, he appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "safely innocent".
Palin is in danger of being charged with three first-degree crimes, namely detention for up to a year and a fine of $250,000.
He was also ascribed to a second-degree offense punishable with a day's detention and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin has been accused of criminal acts.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently under examination by the Veteran's Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic assault, obstructing the report of the crime and possession of a weapon while he was drunk in connection with the accident.
His fiancee accused him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress syndrome following the period spent in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
The electricity and communications networks are not working and the victims' balance is set to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck off the Central Sulawesi, north-east of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Social media has videos showing the moment of impact.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people had gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu.
Federal prosecutors demand extraordinary capital punishment for suspects of terrorist attacks in NYC
New York federal prosecutors are demanding capital punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the author of the terrorist attack that caused the death of eight people: a rare punishment that has never been committed for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a Home Depot rental van to jump on a bike path along the West Side Highway in the Lower Manhattan area investing pedestrians and cyclists in October.
According to the conditions for the request for capital punishment in the southern district of New York, to justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov killed "intentionally" the eight victims and equally "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily injuries.
According to the court file, both of these charges can lead to the death sentence.
Weeks after the attack, a large federal jury issued 22 charges against Saipov that included eight counts of murder with criminal association, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of vehicles.
The attack called for "real planning and premeditation", said prosecutors describing the way Saipov ended it as "atrocious, cruel and depraved".
The preliminary notice states that "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused damage, offenses and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco".
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
Ten years have passed since the Southern District of New York prosecuted the last case of capital punishment.
The man sued, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death sentence was executed for the last time in New York in 1953 for the federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, husband and wife accused of conspiracy through espionage and charged for passing information to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple both died in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no signs of repentance in the days and months following the attack.
The police say he was proud of what he did in front of the investigators.
According to the prosecution, Saipov told the authorities that he decided to complete the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked the police to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
As far as the 22 counts are concerned, he pleaded not guilty.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to apply for the death penalty instead of accepting a recognition of guilt and the sentence to life without any possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all the people involved," Patton said.
The Saipov group of defenders had previously asked prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.
Member of Parliament Tory says that NIGEL FARAGE must conduct Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage swore today to "mobilize the popular army" during a protest at the Tory conference.
When one of the members of the parliament of the Theresa May party suggested that he should deal with negotiations with the European Union, the former leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party said that politicians should "feel pressure" from Eurosceptics.
In March, Conservative MEP Peter Bone said in Birmingham that the UK "would already be outside Europe" if Farage were Secretary for Brexit.
But the challenges that May faces to try to reconcile the positions of her deeply divided party have been underlined by the Torys in favour of staying in Europe who participated in a separate protest against Brexit in London.
The Prime Minister is trying to apply the Chequers Plan among the attacks of Brexit supporters, those who want to stay in Europe and the European Union.
The Allies insist on continuing the attempt to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the strong collective reaction, and forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between what May proposes and "chaos".
At the meeting of the Leave Means Leave organization held in Solihull, Bone said he wanted to abandon the Chequers Plan.
He suggested that Farage should be entrusted with the task of conducting negotiations with Brussels.
"We'd be out of Europe by now," he said.
Member of the Wellingborough Parliament added: "I am for Brexit but we must abandon the Chequers Plan".
Explaining the reasons for his opposition to the European Union, he said: "We have not fought world wars to be servile.
We want to be able to apply our laws in our country."
Bone rejected the view that public opinion would change by the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in Europe is completely false."
Tory MP Andrea Jenkyns, a Brexit supporter, also took part in the parade and told journalists: "I simply tell the Prime Minister to listen to people.
The Chequers Plan is not appreciated by public opinion in general, the opposition will not vote for it and does not enjoy the favors of our party and our activists who are walking the streets looking for votes to allow us to be elected.
Forget about the Chequers Plan and start listening."
In an incisive message for May he added: "Prime ministers can keep their place when they keep their promises".
At the meeting, Farage said that politicians should be able to "feel pressure" if they were going to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"It is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them we won't let them."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd he added: "I want you to put pressure on our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
We intend to mobilize the popular army of this country that voted for Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, those in favour of staying in Europe marched on the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists pushed the Torys against Brexit flags after the formation of the group this weekend.
Labour ridiculed conservatives for the security issues they had with a party app at the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who say they can install IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus agreement, for the borders without friction and for borderless trade in Ireland," he added.
It's all a farce.
A good Brexit does not exist," he concluded.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November election, she will think seriously about running for president.
According to the Boston Globe, the Democratic Senator of Massachusetts on Saturday spoke about her future at a city assembly in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, often critical of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
The hypothesis that he could challenge Trump in 2020 was in the air for a long time.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in the form of a city assembly since Trump took office.
A participant asked you if you'd like to run for president.
Warren said it's time for "women to go to Washington to settle the government, which means a woman has the highest office."
Arrest for murdering LSU Sims player
Baton Rouge P.D., Louisiana, reported on Saturday that they arrested a suspect for the murder of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced Dyteon Simpson's 20-year-old arrest at 11:00 on ETNews.
On Friday, he released a video of the murder asking for help in identifying a man visible in the sequences.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near Southern University campus early Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims reported a gunshot wound to the head that caused his death," said police chief Murphy J. Paul on 247Sports.
Wayde intervened to defend a friend and was struck by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was at the scene of the crime in possession of a weapon and shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and detained at the Parish Police Department in East Baton Rouge.
Junior player of almost two meters grew up in Baton Rouge, last season Sims played 32 matches of which 10 as a holder with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after winning Sebastian Vettel thanks to team orders
When Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of his partner Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was immediately evident that Mercedes team orders would heavily affect the race.
From pole, Bottas starts off well leaving Hamilton to defend himself from Vettel's attacks in the first two laps.
Vettel stops first at the pits leaving Hamilton in the group's tail traffic, a move that could be decisive.
Mercedes stops the next lap back on the track behind Vettel. Hamilton, however, overtakes him after a few wheel-to-wheel actions in which the Ferrari driver tries to prevent the passage inside, risking to end up outside after a double shift to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen starts from the last row of the grid but at the end of the first round he is already seventh on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then drives the race for most of the race without stopping at the pits for the tyre change and tries to finish quickly to overcome Kimi Raikkonen winning the fourth place.
In the end, however, he has to make the pit stop on the 44th lap and in the remaining 8 laps he is not able to increase the pitch and pass Raikkonen, who arrives fourth.
"It's a difficult day because Valtteri has worked very well all weekend and was really nice to let me pass.
The team has done outstanding work to win the first and second positions," Hamilton said.
A Bad Example of Body Language
In a meeting held on Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein for insisting that she had not revealed the content of Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of attempted rape.
During a rally in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "meschins, villains and liars".
"What can happen and what is happening in the last few days in the Senate where people are angry, mean, mean and lying," he said.
"When there are obvious signs that the news is being leaked and those responsible say, "Oh no, it wasn't me.
I could never do that."
Do You Recall?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak the news?
Remember his answer... did you reveal the contents of the document?
Oh, no.
I didn't."
Wait a minute.
We revealed it...No, we didn't," added the senator.
The letter in which Ford accuses Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July and the content was disclosed at the beginning of September, but Feinstein denies that the indiscretion was leaked from its office.
"I didn't hide Professor Ford's accusations, but I didn't reveal her story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"He asked me to keep the information confidential, and I did."
But his denial is not credible for the president, who during the meeting on Saturday night commented: "I tell you, this is just a bad example of body language.
Maybe he didn't, but this is the worst example of body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate, who was accused of attempted sexual crime by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats are using these charges for their own purposes.
"They are trying to regain power by any means necessary.
You see the meanness, the badness. They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to pass over to regain power and control,” said the president as reported by Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against the Dundees
The Dundee Stars recovered after Friday's defeat in the Elite League match against the Belfast Giants by winning the return race for 5-3 Saturday in Dundee.
The Giants immediately took the lead in two goals against Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie took the home team to the draw before Dwyer brought the Giants back to the lead.
Francois Bouchard scored a draw for the Dundees before two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen decreed their victory.
It was the third defeat of the Elite League season for Adam Keefe's men who on Friday night in Belfast had come back and won the game with the Dundees for 2-1.
The two teams have already met four times this season and the Giants have won the first three games.
Dwyer scored his first goal at the 3:35 minute on Kendall McFaull's assist, while Beauvillier doubled after four minutes on David Rutherford's assist.
In what was a fairly animated first half, Sullivan brought the home team back to the game at minute 13:10 before Matt Marquardt provided the assist of the draw to Cownie at minute 15:16.
Dwyer scored the advantage for the Giants by scoring the second goal of the evening at the end of the first half.
The home team recompacted and Bouchard regained the draw after a strategic maneuver at minute 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran contributed to Nielsen's action, which led the Dundee to the lead for the first time in the match at the end of the second half and scored his team's victory by scoring the fifth goal in the middle of the last half.
The Giants, who at this point have lost four of the last five matches, will play the next home game in Milton Keynes on Friday.
Flight controller dies to allow hundreds of passengers to escape the earthquake
In Indonesia, a flight controller will be hailed as a hero after his death to allow a plane carrying hundreds of people to take off safely.
More than 800 people died and many were scattered due to a massive earthquake that hit Sulawesi Island on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong adjustment shocks continue to affect the area and many are trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
But even though his colleagues had fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung remained in his place in the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu, which fluctuated fearfully.
He wanted to make sure that Batik Air 6321, which was on the runway, could take off safely.
So he jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was going to collapse.
He died later at the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian ABC News.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"It's really sad news for us," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities are concerned that the number of victims may reach thousands and the national disaster countermeasure agency says that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The count of the dead is bound to increase because many bodies are still under rubble and it was impossible to reach many others," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to 6 meters high devastated Palu, where a mass burial will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are carrying aid and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance carries bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Minimarkets are looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is doing everything it can to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find.
The situation is already tragic, but it could be much worse."
Indonesia's president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the men of the country's army: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related activities.
Are you ready?", according to CNN.
During the year Indonesia had already been hit by earthquakes in Lombok, where 550 people had died.
Air Disaster in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that there is a missing after the lagoon accident
The airline of the flight that fell in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, after claiming that all 47 people on board between passengers and crew members had managed to save themselves, now claims that there is a missing person.
According to news from Air Niugini, updated to Saturday afternoon, a passenger is missing from the appeal.
The airline has confirmed that it is in contact with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for further details on the passenger, e.g. age or nationality.
The local boats made it possible to rescue the other passengers and crew after the accident while the plane was trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
According to official sources, seven people were transported to the hospital on Friday.
The airline claims that six passengers were admitted to the hospital on Saturday and are all in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
The US airline and navy claim that the plane crashed into the lagoon because it did not reach the runway.
Witnesses say the plane crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes has stated that the plane has reached a very low altitude.
"And it was really a fortune," said Jaynes.
Jaynes then explained that he and others, walking in the water that came to life, managed to reach the emergency exits of the plane.
He added that the flight attendants panicked and screamed and that he was slightly hit in the head.
According to the U.S. Navy, even some sailors who were working nearby to set up a jetty helped by using a dinghy to transport people to the shore before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicate that 111 people have died in aircraft accidents in airlines registered with PNG over the last two decades, but none of these have involved Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the night of the burnt woman alive
On Saturday, the presentation of the prosecution's evidence in the new trial against a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
US Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone data to reconstruct the movements of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett claimed to have recovered the location data of several cell phones that show that, contrary to what he said, Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claims to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford came to court on Saturday and testified that he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked him if Tellis was telling the truth by saying that he was in the Sanford truck that night, the latter confirmed that he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency is that Tellis has been claiming to know Chambers for two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records indicate they've only known each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that after Chambers died, Tellis removed Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of her life," said Hale.
The defense will begin its final argument Sunday.
The judge expects the judgment to pass to the jury later on the same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative vision of the genre by inserting positive messages in their tracks.
Bristol's The High Breed group claims that hip-hop has drifted away from its origins when it spread political messages and denounced social problems.
Instead, they want to go back to their origins and make a kind of conscious hip-hop again.
Artists such as the Fugees and Common have recently returned to the UK thanks to characters such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
A New York nanny sues a couple for firing her with a "racist" text.
In New York, a nanny sued a couple for dismissing her in a discriminatory manner after accidentally receiving a text in which her mother complained that she was "another black".
The couple denies being racist by comparing the request to a real "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed her disappointment when she discovered that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, who arrived for her first day of work in 2016, was black.
"NOOOOOOOOOO ANOTHER NERA," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a message for her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing the mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman "embarrassed" fired Ms. Maurice saying she wasn't happy with their previous nanny, an African American, and that she was expecting a Filipino.
She paid Miss Maurice her day's work and sent her home in a taxi.
Maurice sued the couple and, for being fired, claims compensation for the beauty of $350 a day for the six-month full-time job for which she was initially hired, even if without a contract.
"I want them to understand that they can't behave like this," he said at the Post on Friday adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to the accusation of racism by saying that Maurice's dismissal was the only thing to do because they feared they could not trust her after having offended her.
"My wife sent her a message in which she said something she didn't mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist people," said her husband Joel Plasco at the Post.
"Would you entrust your children to someone you've been rude to, even if by mistake?
Your baby?
I don't think so."
Comparing the request to a real "extortion", Plasco said that his wife had been giving birth for just two months and was in a "very difficult situation".
"You can't go after a person like that.
It's not very nice," the financial advisor added.
While the lawsuit is still ongoing, the public opinion court has immediately denounced the spouses on social media, criticizing them harshly for their behavior and for the logic followed.
A letter reveals that Paddington's editor feared that readers would not like a talking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was accepted, comments on the letter: "It is not easy to put yourself in the shoes of those who read the book for the first time before it was published.
It's funny now that we know the great success of Paddington."
Affirming that his father, who worked as a cameraman at the BBC before writing the children's book inspired by a toy bear, would not have responded well to the rejection of his work, he adds that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was a bit "sad" after his death last year.
Speaking of Paddington, who she describes as "a very important member of our family" adds that the father was modestly proud of his success.
"He was quite a quiet man, not a presumptuous person," he says.
"But Paddington was so real to him that he acted like he had a son who reached a goal: you're proud of it even though it's not your fault.
I think he interpreted Paddington's success this way.
Although it was a creation of his imagination, he attributed the credit to Paddington himself."
I had to say goodbye to my daughter who was dying.
On landing, her daughter was rushed to the hospital in Nice, Louis Pasteur 2, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called me several times to tell me that the situation was really bad and that our daughter wouldn't make it," says Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then she called me to tell me that she was going to die in a few minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The effect of the medicines that the doctors had given her to allow the heart to continue pumping was slowly fading.
She died a little earlier and it was the end.
I had to sit and wait knowing this was happening.
I couldn't complain, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to stay."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, grieved by the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers unaware of what was happening to her.
"No one knew," he says.
"All the time I've been crying with my head down.
It's hard to explain, but while I was on the plane, I felt an incredible sense of solidarity with Nad.
I thought he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Tickets of two grieving women to prevent suicides on deck
Two women whose loved ones committed suicide are trying to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys attacked on a bridge in Wales tickets with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he started suffering from depression and killed himself at 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," he says.
Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, reports that her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said he lit up every room he entered."
But before he died, he quit his job because the depression had taken him "to a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, found him after he took his own life.
Davis says, "I'm still afraid of a chain effect."
He created the tickets "to let people know that there is someone they can turn to to talk to, even if it is a friend.
They must not isolate themselves, they must speak."
Humphreys, who has been a friend of Davies for years, has lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother died.
"You never said he was feeling down or depressed," she says.
"A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed that his attitude had changed.
On Christmas Day he hit rock bottom. When the children opened the gifts, he avoided looking them in the eye."
He says that his death was a huge trauma that they had to process: "He torn the family apart.
He tore us apart.
But we had to move forward and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain: the FBI has begun investigation
"I think that if we could proceed as you asked, that is with a limited investigation in time and within, we could reach an agreement," Flake said on Saturday adding that he was afraid that the committee was "losing its temper" due to the blockade of rooted supporters.
Why don't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of time.
There are only five weeks left until the mid-term elections on November 6. If the Republicans as expected get a negative result, they will be greatly weakened in their attempt to get the man they chose elected to the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush called the senators and urged them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush, and thanks to him he met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI completes its report?
We will vote in the Senate, which is currently made up of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the gap and confirm it at the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean political refugees "decline" with Kim
A South Korean legislator states that the number of North Koreans seeking political refuge in South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the ministry of South Korean unification, claims that the refugees were 1,127 last year against 2,766 in 2011.
Mr Park explains that the main reasons are a tighter control of the border between North Korea and China and the higher tariffs demanded by those who illegally get these people out.
Pyongyang did not make public statements.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, whose border with North Korea is longer and easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers them illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them by force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have significantly improved in recent months.
This month the two countries have already met in Pyongyang to talk about the denuclearisation negotiations that are in a stalemate.
This was after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, in which they agreed in general terms to work together to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho criticised the sanctions of the United States for the lack of developments since then.
"Without confidence in the United States we cannot be sure of our national security and under these circumstances there is no possibility that we will proceed to unilateral disarmament first," said Ri in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and claims that it is not suitable for the Supreme Court
The minority leader Nancy Pelosi calls the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and asserts that he is not of a character fit to hold such a position.
Pelosi gave this opinion on Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I think if a woman had behaved the same way, they would have called her hysterical," said Pelosi about Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday.
In a visibly excited way, Kavanaugh denied the charge of sexually harassing Professor Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
At the beginning of his speech, Kavanaugh was in the throes of emotion, so much so that he almost screamed and with his throat squeezed by crying as he talked about his family and years at high school.
He also explicitly condemned the committee's democrats who called the accusations against him a "crazy and coordinated defamatory campaign" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi believes that Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he cannot enter the Supreme Court because he has proved to be biased against the democrats.
"I think he's self-excluded with his statements and the way he talked about Clinton and Democrats," he said.
Pelosi then raised an objection when asked whether she would try to put Kavanaugh in charge in case it was confirmed and whether the Democrats would reach a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I think that if you don't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, it's not only not suitable for the Supreme Court, but not even for the court that's presiding now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Court of Appeals for the District Circuit of Columbia.
Pelosi added that, as a democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe vs. Wade, because she is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh eluded questions about his intention to overthrow certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
Pelosi stated that "you cannot send an hysterical and biased person to the Supreme Court and demand that this decision be welcomed in a positive way".
And women have to use it.
It's a fair diatribe, months and years of anger attacks he can't get out of without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, do you?"
And he continued, "It really helped me a woman who was an executive somewhere. She told me that she also cried when she got angry, but she had developed a technique that when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And so it went on.
I thought his idea was brilliant."
Tears are tolerated as a rash of anger in part because they are basically not understood.
One of the sharpest memories I have of a previous job in a predominantly male office dates back to when I once began to cry for anger access. An older woman, an ice manager from whom I had always been slightly terrified, grabbed me by my neck and dragged me down the stairs.
"Don't ever let me see you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're furious.
They think you're sad and they're happy because they've got you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat member of the Colorado Congress, collaborated with Gary Hart in his presidential race.
In 1987, when Hart's extramarital relationship was discovered on a boat called Monkey Business, which had to give up the race, Schroeder, very disappointed, thought there was no reason why she should not have tried herself to run for president.
"In fact, it wasn't a well thought out decision," he told me laughing about 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates already in the race and certainly didn't need another one.
Someone called them Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign was already at an advanced stage, Schroeder was late with the fundraiser and swore she wouldn't run if she hadn't raised $2 million.
It was a lost cause at the start.
He discovered that some of the supporters who had given men candidates $1,000 to her would only give 250.
"Do they think I can get a discount?" he asked.
When she gave the speech to announce that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions (gratitude for the people who supported her, disappointment at the system that made it harder to find money and voters than representatives and anger at the sexual discrimination she was victims of) that she was moved.
"It seemed like I was having a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalled, thinking about the reaction of the press.
"Someone might have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they'd write on my gravestone.
Maybe "Though a lot."
How the US-China trade war could favor Beijing
The opening blows of the trade war between the US and China were thunderous and, while the battle is far from over, experts say that a conflict between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, has already issued the first warning this year by taxing major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with the new duties on items for more than $200 billion (175 billion) of value. This means that they will be imposed on half of the goods of Chinese origin.
Beijing has reacted each time with measures of the same type by applying recently duties from five to ten percent out of 60 billion dollars of American goods.
China has promised to respond to the US blow to blow and it is unlikely that the second largest economic power in the world will soon turn back.
For Washington to give up, it would have to yield to its demands, but to bend publicly to the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Experts believe, however, that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the trade war with the US can have a positive effect on China in the long run by decreasing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision by Washington or Beijing can create the initial conditions for economic collapse in both countries is in fact much more dangerous than what has been recognized so far," says Abigail Grace, a researcher studying Asia at the Center for New American Security Research Center.
Syria is "ready" for the return of refugees, says foreign minister
Syria claims to be ready for the return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country devastated by the more than seven years of war.
In front of the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the country's conditions are improving.
"The situation on the ground today is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to recover areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
According to UN estimates, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million still living in Syria need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would gladly accept assistance to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept any subordinated aid on terms or by those countries that supported the insurrection.
Europe wins victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The Europa team won the Ryder Cup 2018 beating the USA team with a final score of 17.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The USA has thus lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the trophy when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
USA champion Phil Mickelson, who fought for most of the tournament, threw his tee shot in the water at the sixteenth hole of par 3, granting Francesco Molinari the victory.
The Italian golfer has distinguished in all his rounds becoming one of the four players always to register a 5-0-0 since the tournament with the current formula was played for the first time in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated with a score of 5&4 by the lower Danish player in the Thorbjorn Olesen standings of the European team.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, surrendered for 2–1 to the Englishman Ian Poulter who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
A Ryder Cup veteran, the Spanish Sergio Garcia who played eight, became the European player who won the most in the history of the tournament with 25.5 points.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't help it today.
It's been a tough year.
I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I got the cup back.
It's a team win and I'm glad I made my contribution," said one excited Garcia after the European win.
He passes the witness to his fellow countryman John Ram who beat the legend of golf USA Tiger Woods with a score of 2&1 in Sunday's singulars.
"If I think I grew up watching his fights, I'm really proud of beating Tiger Woods," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now the score of his Ryder Cup matches amounts to 13 wins, 21 defeats and 3 draws.
A strange statistic if you think that he is one of the greatest players of all time having won 14 of the main titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The US team has been trying all weekend to find fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have played a high-level golf course throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: "I am proud of these guys because they fought.
At some point this morning we put pressure on the Europa team.
We threw this opportunity away.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All its 12 players behaved very well.
I'll work with the American PGA and the Ryder Cup committee and move on.
I'm fond of these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
We tried hard.
But they played better than us."
