The triumph of right-wing populists in Austria: a total of 29%
The perceptible weakening of both existing parties in the grand coalition and this marked strengthening of the right-wing populist parties led, according to the first provisional results, to the early parliamentary elections in Austria on Sunday.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), in which the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously waning, has suffered particularly heavy losses.
On the contrary, the Union's electoral leader for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the sub-prefect of Kärnten Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphal return to national politics.
According to the provisional results, the country's strongest party remains the socio-democratic party (SPÖ) with 29.8% of the votes, but it lost 5.5% compared to the last elections in 2006.
Even worse, ÖVP lost almost 9% of the vote with 25.6%.
These are the worst results of these two great parties in the post-war history of Austria and above all the literally catastrophic result of the popular, which led to early elections.
Even at the beginning of July, when theVP left the coalition, the popular had in preference to SPÖ a considerable advantage.
But the voters evidently punished them for sinking the government.
Already in the first reactions to the results there were speculations about the possible resignation of the party president, vice-chancellor Wilhelm Monterer.
Observers believe that it could already take place on Monday during the extraordinary convocation of the party's leadership.
This evolution should perhaps facilitate the path towards the ever more likely way out of the election result, that is to say towards the renewal of the SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
With regard to the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the liberals (FPÖ) gained 18% in advance and BZÖ 11% of votes - but the socio-democratics simultaneously revealed the concern of another 1999, when the populists agreed with the popular to the collective government, (then the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 it separated from the BZÖ) which was even cause for sanctions by the EU.
On this evolution Haider obviously plays, who has already stated that he is ready to collaborate with any party and assumes a return to Vienna in national politics.
The Green Party also managed to join Parliament, but it fell slightly, going down among the Austrian political parties from third to fifth.
No other party has clearly exceeded the 4% threshold and has not entered Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relationships with India can be cooled
If the problem could not be solved with Czech scientists who have been accused of the illegal collection of beetles in India, it would be according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The Minister mentioned this in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
“If it doesn’t work out, then there will be some cooling,” he noted after the meeting that took place under the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee after negotiations said that executive power can hardly interfere in legal matters.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted of the charge and punished with a fine, the central government can negotiate with the local government in Dardjeeling which falls under its jurisdiction.
"Your problem could be solved," said the Minister.
According to Mukherjee it would be better, for Emil Kučera sentenced to three years in prison, to resort to a higher instance.
Then you can ask for bail and wait for the sentence at liberty.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed himself in the same way during the negotiations.
"Recommends the appeal to the Major Court then it will be possible to obtain grace," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech side can enter the matter is to lend the condemned the "competent legal support", the Indian Minister said.
At the same time he said that such support is already being provided by the Indian side.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations that have been handed down for many years with India.
The Indians admit it, too," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told ČTK, he pointed out in front of his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We truly consider the imprisonment and prosecution of these Czech scientists to be a profound mistake," he said.
The minister avoided answering the question if he got the Indian side the promise to take care of the matter.
"I have achieved relatively many promises," he merely noted.
A Czech judge in the battle for the seabed
It approaches the electronic map on the wall on which Australia and the adjacent marine areas are drawn.
But he is not interested in the continent but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and along with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is at the same time as large as the continent itself, says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of a team of 33 OSN Division workers for issues about oceans and maritime rights.
His boss, the Czech attorney director of the Division, Václav Mikulka, is following his presentation and occasionally adds something.
It dominates the desire to work and enthusiasm.
The seabed still hides a little known world rich in natural resources.
It is possible to find oil, metal ores and other mineral materials, but also non-discussed living organisms that carry within themselves the key to the discovery of cancer medicine.
The largest seabed on the mainland
Coastal states have begun to lend interest to submarine territory.
According to the OSN convention, they take advantage of the laws on which they made an agreement in 1982 at Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is above all the area of the so-called continental shelf that often extends up to several hundred kilometers from the coast of the state in question.
According to the Convention, that has an exclusive right over all the resources of the continental shelf.
"In short, the continental shelf means that part of the seabed and its subsoil which is a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
The so-called exclusive economic zone extends beyond the territorial sea often beyond 200 nautical miles," Mikulka explains.
The request for which the country submits to the Committee on the definition of the size of the continental shelf must be accompanied by very extensive scientific and technical documentation based on many costly surveys and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparation.
"One of our tasks is to provide the committee with legal and technical-professional assistance.
So far, the committee has dealt with five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three nominees were successful," Mikulka adds.
Australia’s recent success, which has greatly expanded its marine possessions, has seen a worldwide echo.
But also New Zealand has gained us - the surface of the seabed, which was assigned to it by the commission last week, of about 1.6 square kilometers so more or less six times larger than the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profit, which will benefit him in the future from the seabed, as promised will be invaluable.
Other states will also gradually submit their demands.
They can do so for ten years since "the Montego Bay Convention" has been ratified.
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the bottom of the ocean that the convention has declared a common heritage of humanity begins."
No state has an exclusive position here.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by this international institution established by the Convention.
"But the seabed is not Klondike," says director Mikulka, exaggeratingly, "with the fact that its individual parts are legally demarcated and their regime contractually established."
Czechs in the Pacific
A part of the seabed now also belongs to the Czech Republic.
If you share it with other states of the former Soviet bloc within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
It acquired in 1991 according to the convention, as well as investors from a few other states, the status of so-called "pioneer investor".
It has the right of extraction in the Clarion Clipperton area in the Pacific Ocean extended between Mexico, Hawaii Islands and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor is little larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is jagged, it's almost a submarine replica of Tatry.
"It is possible to extract on the total area of 75 000 square kilometers.
The area is a field rich in polymetallic agglomerations containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," explains another Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A worker of the Macedonian division Rober Sandev carries with him an exhibit to show it.
It looks like a small potato or with a bit of imagination, a legendary scheme, as in the legend of the awakening of the Golem.
German special units were present for the release of hostages
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany for the release of hostages – the experts then arrived.
When the situation became critical, the special units were ready, but they did not intervene.
We are getting more and more detailed information on the circumstances surrounding the release of the 11 hostages.
German special units participated in the rescue operation as mentioned by the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior.
In addition to the military specialists, the GSG9 units, the Avian Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office as well as the technical institution's logistical experts were present on the site.
As the minister spokesman said on Monday evening, the German units did not intervene because the kidnappers, given the danger of a force intervention, released the hostages fleeing.
The Egyptian government accepted the help offered by the Germans, to join as assistance directly on the spot.
"We didn't get there luckily," says a spokesman for the Ministry of Interior.
Assailants kidnapped a group of travellers on 19 September in the south of Egypt: 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian companions.
After the kidnapping in a deserted area in southern Egypt the hostages were deported to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers until the end remained secret as well as the details of the liberation or possible ransom payments.
The freed in the meantime arrived in good condition in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the hostages released are under the protection of the German embassy.
It was not explained on the details of the release.
There was no information in Berlin for when they were coming back to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, the 5 vacationers and special units are expected to fly with an Air Force Airbus and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
American House of Representatives rejects the rescue package.
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress just failed the $700 billion bailout package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell down.
With 206 entries toward 227 the U.S. representative house rejected the government's bailout package for the financial markets.
Despite the appeals of US President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both parties there was no majority for the program, with which the chaos of the financial markets should have been curbed.
In a dramatic action the supporters desperately tried to persuade the critics by the heavy package of 700 mld of dollars.
Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the negotiations, urged the MPs to consent, even though the plan was unpopular.
8. It is difficult to have gratitude to avoid something, which has not yet arrived..
While the vote was going on, the Dow Jones collapsed more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The reason for investors’ concerns was that the state rescue package could fail.
He recovered before the end of the vote and then, after the announcement of the failure, collapsed again.
Experts now expect more serious turbulence on the international financial markets.
In order to ensure that the programme enters into force, it must have the approval of both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate.
Promoters record increasing numbers of bookings
It seems it will be a good winter for German tour operators:
According to a study the turnover on travel bookings for the next few months compared to the previous year has increased markedly - for the winter season even more than 30%.
Despite weak economic views, the desire to travel by the Germans according to an investigation remains firm.
On the bookings for the winter season, the travel agencies recorded a 31 % increase in turnover compared to the same period of the previous year, as the German Tourist Association DRV said on Monday in Berlin.
According to the investigation of the market research institute GfK there are increased booking quotas even for the autumn months.
Therefore the excess of travel agencies for October compared with 2007 would have amounted to about 11%, the DRV reported.
Important for these results are the figures of the GfK, which monthly analyzes the booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and develops statistical projections for the entire market.
Also included would be travel bookings made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar price, particularly required would be trips to the United States, reported the DRV.
Here the increase in bookings would amount to about a third.
Travel destinations would also be particularly popular with the Germans, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as locations within Germany.
Especially all inclusive travel has a high price, explained DRV president Klaus Laepple.
Considering the rising costs for energy and food, the costs in this case would be "better calculated for customers than for a holiday organized individually".
Consumers could save money through, among others, discounts for bookings made in advance or offers with everything included, explained Laepple.
Even the summer months would have recorded excellent booking figures, so much so that compared to the previous year there would have again been a surplus of turnover - although according to a further study the number of Germans who started a trip, compared to the previous year has dropped.
My first time at Oktoberfest
Hits of Ballermann, one-litre mug beer and VIP in designer Dirndln.
A debut at the Wiesn
Susanne Kronzucker and I actually don't have much in common.
She is blonde, television moderator and wears a tailor-made Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is second hand.
But one thing unites us: just 3 minutes at the Wiesn, already the photographers throw themselves at us and take photos until they fill the memory of the cameras – very flattering, and this at my first visit to the Wiesn.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap Dirndl seems to achieve its purpose.
As a Wiesn tourist and actually living north of the white sausage equator, the sense of well-being in the costume/dress until today is still within reach.
But once you get to Theresienwiese, it's nothing serious.
Almost everyone wears Dirndl or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed – all perfectly normal.
Only my Dirndl's apron picks up strange looks at the chocolate banana stand.
A monacense points out that I would have tied the apron in a wrong way: "On the left you are free, in the middle you are a virgin, on the right you are busy, behind a widow."
I sneak up on the bow from the back to the left.
All right," he says and laughs.
Others make less waste of subtle flirting techniques and wear sober felt hats, on which leads "To drunk to get dressed!" and stretch their bare behind against an uninvited one.
The guy with exhibitionist inclinations is called Bob, he comes from England and he also visits Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous," with a "oooooo."
This tells me, after he got rid of his beer mug from a liter he drank earlier.
Right next to one of these hydrants, everyone thinks it's a garbage can.
Bob is one of these infamous "Wildbiesler."
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol like this.
At about 8 p.m., the sanitaries walk in a pack on the square of the feast, who have to take care of the poor beons.
The nurses appear each time in a pack – 4 at a time they drag a stretcher covered with a tent into a tent.
This works as with most visitors to the Wiesn: you go empty, you return full.
Who lies under the tarp in this blood alcohol coffin, you can't see it.
"Des sind die, wos goarnimmer packn", one of the sanitaries yells at me and disappears into the slump.
Victim of an accident identified by the police
A 63-year-old woman who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle while walking in Essex was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road, Brentwood, was involved in the incident Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but she died shortly afterwards.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on the charge of reckless driving.
He was released on bail.
Turkey is broadening diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey tried to enter the European Union, the European powers were anxious to penetrate deep into the Turkish hinterland.
On the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 steps in Asia, lies one of the most beautiful relics of this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in neo-renaissance style.
This is at least what the tourist guides tell you.
The building stands on horseback between the end of the platforms with a tower on each of its corners looking to the world like some German provincial municipalities.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building slightly decaying.
But once inside the ticket office from the vaulted ceiling, there is no doubt about the size of the enterprise of what was the most western passage.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a delayer to the imperial game, wanted to realize its ambitions to dominate the Middle East by means of this railroad that ran to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond in what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany’s imperial ambitions sank during World War I.
His railroads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
Its isolation from the surrounding region, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has passed
British and dominatrix forces advanced out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was bad news for Hyderpasha Station, too.
In 1917 an ammunition train broke out destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then it has been slowly in disintegration, largely surpassed by history.
But nowadays, this railway outlet for Anatolia and all points to the east, serve - at least symbolically - to highlight the ever greater diplomatic horizons of Turkey.
The ruling party of Justice and Development - the AKP - has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
Its isolation from its surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has passed.
Now there is a new policy of commitment.
Significantly, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To estimate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded the sleeping car for the Turkish capital Ankara, to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the AKP, the Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a jolting race along the slopes that produced the old world cadences of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - proposed as a new city for a secular state intent on turning my back on its Ottoman past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots represents an exemplary shift in Turkish consensus.
He suggested some suspicions in the West, more notably in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by malls built vehicles and pastry shops of power, where managers in business suits - both men and women - meet to make early morning contracts.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician from almost any other political party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he had a Blackberry.
"The purpose of the foreign policy party is now to reinstate Turkey with its closest neighbours.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he tells me.
Turkey has been cut off from its hinterland.
Today he has to look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't the case with one or the other.
It's got to be both of them.
"But surely at some point," I ask, "will Turkey be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he says, "does not want to face that choice."
Then he points out one point that almost everyone I have spoken to here has recited by heart: the links of not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus, and all around the Black Sea, are as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, Europe as a whole can metaphorically travel those railway lines eastwards through Asia and the Middle East.
Again at the Hydarpasha station, after another blank night, I think of those two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who had looked at this building built 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to find that Europe's Middle Eastern ambitions can now be, to a large extent, in Turkey's hands.
And while I wait at the terminal for the ferry that takes me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that those days Turkey has always been called "the sick man of Europe".
At least then there seemed to be no doubt as to which continent should claim this fascinating country.
Remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: as Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (obituary, 11 September) had the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the choir in charge.
As a member of his music scheme for the municipality, the following year he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus.
It was supposed to be under-21/under 21, but at the time Proteus sang his finale in 1979, many of us were more than twenty - we simply refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being-mutable) represented the good will of the choir and the ability to face all that the music presented to do, both madrigal and Messiaen, without accompaniment or with the whole orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting, and it was all because of the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for the music that remained absolutely constant throughout the years.
How often we were told by Tod to "let music speak for itself".
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in the music.
So sing it!"
His technique in the use of the wand was absolutely clear and precise, although never dictatorial or flowery.
Whatever the musical standard, it made it rise more and more.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If you were to appoint a knight an orchestra conductor, it would have been Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades in which he led the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years and more I have covered more than 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I have never disagreed with just one of them - and many times inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of personal greatness and modesty.
He hated conductors who, in his own words, simply "climbed around the world one or two well-known battle horses".
So many of us are going to miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary of William Woodruff (25 September) specifies that "in 1946 he resumed studying economic history in Oxford and in 1950 became a researcher in Houblon-Norman... studying at the same time for a degree in science, one in letters and a PhD".
This follows from the note of the author of Woodruff in Beyond Nab End, but is not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a university professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, at that time he completed a PhD thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J. D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He spent 1950-51 in the USA as a researcher in Houblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham permanently for Illinois.
Because Woodruff chose to cover this part of his career, you don't know.
J. Vincent Resino at the Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco y vida", because his black and white photographs, in documentary style, are extraordinary.
They attracted my attention for the simplicity and strength they transmit, while treating the protagonists with particular respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feeling.
Resin manages to capture magical moments."
Second assault on Honda supersales
In November Honda will launch the commercialization of the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the previous model was already equipped with great habitability, this new minivan has an even larger interior space.
To all must be added a refined mechanics, which increases driving comfort and save fuel.
Evolution versus revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz has a line very similar to that of the previous model, the changes in this minivan are numerous.
Among others, it is worth pointing out an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before going on to analyze the new model, it is useful to note that this new Jazz arrives six years after the entry into the market of the first generation.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in shorter times than those used by other manufacturers.
Although the Jazz model is less known in Europe than in other markets, it remains a unique phenomenon in terms of sales.
This is exactly the case in Japan, where Jazz was the most sold car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
In Japan, almost a million Jazz units have been sold since the launch.
The second market was that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
Despite these numbers, Honda believes that the new Jazz will allow to increase sales in the segment.
Thus, if in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of this model, for 2009 the estimates are around 100,000 cars, assuming a sales increase of 17% in the European market.
As regards the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, corresponding to 6.7% of total sales of Honda in Spain.
As for the new generation, managers for the Spanish branch expect to sell around 2,000 Jazz units within a year.
Just the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to reduce the fall in sales in Spain.
Indeed, the managers of the company plan to arrive at the end of the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, or 4,000 less than in 2007, with a decrease of 16%.
Despite the increase in sales Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
In addition, the Japanese company expects to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this, Honda trusts in the arrival of another new model.
It is Insight, a five-door hybrid and compact size - 4.37 meters in length - of which the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200,000 units a year worldwide.
For the markets and estimates made by the Japanese producer, 50% of Insight's sales will take place in the United States, while the remainder will be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, immediately after the company presentation in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has grown in all its parts.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), its width is 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and its distance is 2.50 meters, with an increase of five centimeters.
The height, however, remained unchanged at 1,52 meters.
Along with the size increase, the habitable interior is also expanded.
This advantage derives on the one hand from the insertion of a new platform, and on the other from the introduction of the fuel tank in the central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz model.
Moreover, the capacity of the boot – with a double background – rises to 399 liters, or, 19 liters more the capacity of the first generation.
It should be noted that these are the dimensions of the 1.4 motor version, and that the luggage capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements, such as the rear leds or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - concern an improvement in accessibility to the rear seats.
The doors that allow access to the rear positions, open at an angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
In addition, the engines in this second generation of jazz are also new.
At the time of marketing, this small model will be proposed in the models with 1.2 and 1.4 litre petrol engines.
Both mechanics include the i-VTEC technology that allows you to lower consumption, produce less carbon dioxide emissions, optimize the mechanics and at the same time keeps the engine torque high in all its phases.
The 1.2 litre model offers a power of 90 hp at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm. at 4,900 rpm.
The propulsion – which in the previous Jazz reached 78 horsepower – uses 5.3 litres of fuel and produces about 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
Compared to the previous propulsion, which in the first generation model used 83 horses, now 100 are available.
Jazz 1.4 at 100 horsepower reaches a combination of 5.4 litres of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 emitted.
The "bee car" to avoid collisions
As part of the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan was inspired, this time, by nature, and in particular by bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, taking as an example the flight of bees, knows how to avoid accidents.
It is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, or the first step towards collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Nissan Motor Co. Advanced Technical Center have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Scientific and Technological Research of the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Brand Management Technology and Research and Development, the BR23C is an extension of the Security Shield of four areas produced by Nissan.
This robot is intended to improve the ability to prevent collisions in the vehicles of the manufacturer.
During the flight, each bee creates its own personal space of oval shape which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important thing are the bee-composed eyes, able to see in all directions at an angle greater than 300 degrees, and that allow the insect to fly without interruption in its personal space.
To recreate this visual functionality, engineers have developed what they have defined as a localization laser (Laser Range Finder).
This mechanism detects the obstacles in front of the BR23C for a radius within two meters and with a maximum width of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor that immediately, allows to prevent collision.
"When the little robot detects an obstacle, it imitates the movements of a bee and immediately changes direction by turning on the wheels at right angles or greater to avoid collision.
The most obvious difference with any assisted system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
"If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot deviate upwards or downwards, nor diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction in which its wheels can turn and not by exploiting endless directions and ways like bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid collisions.
"This device just needs to process the information every few seconds, and act from this data.
It does not require the storage of information or the intuitive logic of previe maneuvers, so it can work without interruption and with only a couple dozen KB of memory.
This may surprise, but we're not talking about gigabytes of memory, nor mega."
It is the first step towards the development of new technologies for the instantaneous prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan hopes will be standard in cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than the type with lithium ions.
Another potential future application of this technology could be the integration of units with a GPS satellite navigation system to bring the driver to destination avoiding obstacles in the route.
Tremble before asking for a loan
We must recognize that the US Treasury Department, as well as possessing many capitals to intervene, is certainly not without ingenuity.
Faced with the crisis and to prevent Americans from engaging with junk mortgages in banks with dubious insolvency, they have created a fun and instructive game for network users: "Bad Credit Hotel".
In other words, the "bad credit hotel"...or problems.
The gloomy aspect of this arrangement and, in particular, of its receptionist serves to induce you to think not one, but two or even three times before applying for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it, which is probably the primary objective.
Of course the information the game provides is useful, but it is not very detailed.
It is more a page for teenagers than a site for the general public.
What happens if you complete the game?
Well, there's a sleeping room inside the hotel.
It's still something, because to buy a better house not even if he talks...
Morgan Stanley opens his capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced the signing of an agreement with the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, which will invest nine billion dollars in a share equal to 21% of participation in the Company, news received following a net decrease in its shares on the Stock Exchange.
A week after the drafting of a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that the MUFG would have bought 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's shares at the individual cost of $25.25, or a sum of three billion dollars.
The price established is 19% lower than the book value of the securities at 31 August.
The MUFG will also invest six billion dollars in the purchase of convertible securities at a conversion price of 31.25 dollars, ensuring a return of 10%.
Morgan Stanley has specified that the total operation would be carried out on the base of an average price of 29 dollars per title, that is a percentage inferior to its current course of 28%.
At around 5 p.m., however, the Morgan Stanley title dropped by 6.79% to $23.07.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition into bank holding company," explained John Mack, general manager of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow her to differentiate her actions by passing them under the control of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with the MUFG also confirms how the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's biggest names to adopt a much more prudent attitude than they had previously assumed.
The modalities defined Monday also show that in the last days the agreement has been modified: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced the sale of 20% of its shares to the Japanese giant for a sum of 8.5 billion dollars.
"A week ago, in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno, executive director of the MUFG, explained: "We thought that our share would be exclusively made up of ordinary shares.
But considering the current situation of the world economy and the market, we have chosen to minimize risks and protect ourselves."
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will obtain Morgan Stanley securities at a price below their accounting value of 7%.
And the transaction would result in an investment of at least 20% of equity on a diluted basis."
The agreement provides that the MUFG will be able to convert in one year half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares if, during a given period, the latter were traded more than 50% below the conversion price fixed, or about 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley assures her that the capital provided by MUFG would allow her to seize investment opportunities, strengthen her balance sheet and increase her liquidity.
A spokesman for the group, however, refused to give details of the strategic plans of the two new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should therefore set a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan has specified that it has "clearly" lightened its budget from the end of August.
The last few weeks have put the group to the test, which has seen the value of its shares halved while the cost of risk insurance has risen.
Monday's cost, however, remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" among Wall Street's large investment banks after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the takeover of Merrill Lynch, announced that it had collected 15 billion dollars, partly at Berkshire Hathaway, a group from Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa à Quito, let's go.
To establish the republic on a socialism right in the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
On Sunday, following the example of colleagues and friends, it was the latter who gave voice to the draft of a new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since, according to official results, 64% of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, on a basis of votes of 80%.
According to these results, the "no" were 28%, while 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% white cards.
For the draft Constitution to be adopted, it should get half of the votes, plus one.
On Sunday, two polls carried out at the exit of the polling stations and an estimate of a non-governmental organization had announced an overwhelming victory of the "yes", placing it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed on the night between Sunday and Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The "Constitution triumphed gloriously", he assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians in the guayaquil governorate, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As always, Chávez and Morales congratulated Rafael Correa, as did his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The poll, which took place calmly according to the election observation mission of the Organization of American States (OEA), was based on a text of 444 points to consolidate the "new socialism" defended by the President.
This draft Constitution consecrates the state's power over the economy, reserving it the "planning of development" of a country that lives essentially from the oil extraction carried out by large foreign companies and consequently of their currency.
Conceived by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants more power to the head of state, who can be elected for two consecutive four-year mandates, to have the opportunity to dissolve the assembly.
Correa has already announced its intention to exploit this amendment and to re-apply its application for a new term of office in February 2009.
The Constitution also affirms the gratuitousness of health and education services, which the President began to promote in this country of 13,9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It also prohibits the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American drug operations.
The 19 hostages released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched an assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts seized ten days ago.
I'm in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts held prisoners in the desert for ten days were reported Monday afternoon, safe and sound, in the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, they had been freed in Chad by an Egyptian commando.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived at the Almaza military base, near Cairo International Airport, around 3:30 p.m., aboard a special plane.
On board a helicopter, they were transferred immediately, without being able to issue any press interview, to the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, for analysis.
They enjoy "good health" and no ransom has been paid "to the kidnappers", said on the airstrip the Egyptian Minister of Tourism, Zoheir Garanna.
Kidnapped on September 19 during a safari in 4x4 at the foot of Mount Ouanat, bordering Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been tossed from one hiding place to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group consisted of 11 tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of Aegyptous, the safari organizing agency.
An Egyptian security officer said that 30 members of the special forces, on board two helicopters, had launched the assault during the night, just before dawn.
"There have been gunshots, half of the kidnappers have been killed, while the others have fled," said the person responsible who requested anonymity.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "flash" unit were sent to Sudan, where they would support German and Italian commandos.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini stressed, from Belgrade, the importance of the role of Italian secret agents and special forces.
We must admit that if we have achieved this result, it has been thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of the men of our secret services, the special forces," he said, without adding any more details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese patrol army claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on board which the kidnappers were on and killed six of them, including the Chadian leader of the kidnappers, and captured two of them.
According to the army, the kidnappers are linked to a rebel organization in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation Movement, (SLA_U), immediately denied by the latter.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
On the front page there is a debate on the financing of culture on which the current election campaign is focused.
So much the better.
But part of our cultural life always remains in the shadows.
Who will decide to denounce the miserable sums granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical places that are starving?
Which politician will dare remind the federal government that he is neglecting monuments and buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we do not have real laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government is paying three and a half million euros for the only restoration of Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
With our American neighbours, it is the Constitution that states that heritage protection is part of national culture and that the same heritage must be protected by every citizen, by every political authority and by every government department, and all this by mutual agreement.
In Québec, at the Federation of Historical Societies of Québec, there are at least 40 000 volunteers who, grouped into 211 companies for the preservation of historical, genealogical, archives and assets preserve, with little money, private archives and archaeological sites.
It is they who, often, defend our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when real estate entrepreneurs and decision-making bodies attack our forgotten remains and cemeteries with their bulldozers.
When will the right space be reserved for history and heritage?
Benelux Governments Nationalise Part of Fortis Bank
The Benelux states are helping the Belgian-Dutch bank, Fortis, which was first in difficulty in Europe due to the crisis in the US credit market, through partial nationalisation: the three nations will provide EUR 11.2 billion to the financial institution - insurance with interest also in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands agreed at the highest level on the weekend, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the face of the difficulties facing the international financial market for more than a year is that of the Fortis bank, and from a certain point of view the decisions taken in this regard may constitute a precedent.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night all three states will hold almost half (49%) of the bank's share in the country.
The bank will almost certainly sell some of its interests, including first of all the assets, mainly insurance, of the Dutch ABN Amro acquired a year ago.
Last week Fortis' actions had begun with a vertical collapse, serious signs of crisis of the institute had then appeared in the second half of the week.
Analysts, however, agree that the bank, with 85,000 employees, is too large to allow it to go bankrupt.
The bank's shares on Friday fell by almost 12%, the lowest point in 14 years.
Since January the value of the shares has decreased by more than two thirds.
Considering the current stock prices the entire capital value of the group is around 14 billion euros, but according to the bank's managers this value is not real.
The company summit imputes the collapse of Fortis shares to the uncertainties of the non-European market due to the acceptance of the US $700 billion plan.
On Monday the title slowly resumed to rise.
Friday Filip Dierckx was appointed new CEO of the bank.
The financial institution has also sought private buyers but so far no one has presented themselves with a worthy offer.
The Belgian Government had previously assured investors that they should not fear losing money.
There was no panic among the bank's customers, the branches were not attacked.
Fortis owns its own subsidiaries in Hungary and has also acquired leasing companies.
The fox in the henhouse
In America insurers on life and health, based on people's medical purchasing data, often refuse to enter into an insurance contract.
Privacy experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a privacy program according to which the use of prescription drug data depends in any case on the approval of the person concerned.
This program must be in independent hands, otherwise it is like entrusting the henhouse to the fox" - writes the Washington Post citing Richard Dick author of the program to follow the prescriptions of medicines.
Insurance companies shall make the insurance fee and the amount due in the event of claims subject to the health status of the customer and if they consider the risk to be too high they shall not take out the insurance.
A long time ago, the client had to undergo a medical examination and the contract was concluded only after the test had been completed.
Dick 10 years ago invented a much cheaper procedure: according to the customer's identification code you can easily get information from pharmacies on which medicines you have purchased in the last year and a half and from this the program shows which diseases you suffer and what health conditions you find.
For example, if you regularly buy large amounts of cholesterol reducers, this means that the level of fat in your blood is basically incurably high and is classified in the highest risk category.
On the market there are several versions of the program, some also determine the risk multiplier, so in addition to paper work there is not much left, even if there are small difficulties.
Among the cons, some medicines are usable for several purposes, e.g. some compounds can be used against migraines or hot flushes, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter, from the point of view of insurance - commercial, is as a factor of increase risk, the first two are not.
For the request and data processing have formed separate societies and these, before obtaining from pharmacies the necessary information, ask for the approval of the patient.
Now the authorities are forcing them to do so even though they have not yet imposed fines for negligence.
Some firms have recently also developed the results of laboratory tests and link them to the data of drug consumption in order to provide a more precise picture of the health of patients.
More and more companies have access to data and, in parallel, the control of use will be increasingly difficult.
There is a separate law on privacy but its validity extends only to health services and insurance.
In front of the Congress there is a bill that gives the supervisory authorities control powers to companies specialized in data service.
Richard Dick admits that it is not enough: for this reason he has developed a program that connects the forwarding data with the approval expressed by the person concerned.
Another question is that the person concerned cannot deny approval because otherwise insurers do not enter into the contract.
So then in the end the chickens are entrusted to the clemency of the fox.
Global Marseille Menu
European Union and India double trade
Given that the European Union and India are partners that trade in particular with each other, the agenda of the ninth summit meeting was also dominated by this issue, as well as all other global problems.
Today there will be a Franco-Indian summit which will deal primarily with cooperation on atomic energy.
The European Union recognises that India is becoming a great democratic power to which more voice should be given in international affairs, but the member countries have not yet been able to decide whether or not to support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
So we did not insist on this issue in the ninth summit held yesterday in Marseilles.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as President-in-Office of the Union, José Manuel Barroso, Chairman of the Commission and Javier Solana, High Representative for Foreign Affairs, received the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed to double in five years, i.e. to increase trade to EUR 100 billion.
Given that trade in goods rose from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not too ambitious.
As a result, they have legally unified the 26 bilateral civil flight agreements, so air traffic can also start in the future.
India would like to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the deal.
The objective is to balance because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only ninth among the EU's partners.
The summit paid attention to global affairs.
To the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and to terrorism, the latter condemned in all its forms on both sides, and called for the convening of a UN conference.
They called for the conclusion of the Doha Trade Round, although both sides played a role in the failure of this.
The EU has confirmed that it remains in the energy and climate programme, i.e. it would like to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agrees with this, as does the fact that a global pact should be concluded at the climate conference scheduled for next year and greenhouse gas production reduced by 50% by 2050.
They also want to curb the rise in food prices and have supported the convening of an international meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister will now travel to the French capital where at a bilateral meeting he is preparing to sign a treaty on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris it is hoped that in order to build the Indian nuclear reactors the French companies will receive a contract worth EUR 20 billion.
According to information from our news agency, the deal would last 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international event for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair awaits for this edition over 7 thousand exhibitors from 101 different countries who will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Fair with over 403,000 titles on display and with Turkey as a guest of honor.
The Undersecretary of the Ministry of Heritage and Cultural Activities Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian Government at the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Pavilion: Italy will be present institutionally with a Point Italy - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
The meeting with the press at Room Struktur in Hall 5.0 of Buchmesse will follow: this will be the occasion to present figures, trends and perspectives on the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of foreign author books gradually decreases over the total of Italian production, and in particular over that for adults and young people.
Steve Fossett's plane was found, the billionaire who disappeared a year ago.
The wreckage of Steve Fossett's plane, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, was found.
The wreckage was found on a plateau at an altitude of 3000 meters, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammoth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the aircraft, however, there were no human remains.
The sheriff of Madeira County, John Anderson, dispelled the remaining doubts: "The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that this is exactly what Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff therefore pointed out that no human remains were found either in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was given for dead in February.
The U.S. Office for Transport Safety (Ntsb) reported that a team of investigators was sent a few hours after the wreck was seen, which then identified the device: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, missing from September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, again in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett's personal belongings were found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents named Fossett, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a sweatshirt.
Fossett's research was interrupted a month after he disappeared.
The billionaire had gained a place in history thanks to a long series of primates.
In 2002, on the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete the world tour on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world without a stop.
Among his many records, he also flew at 15,445 meters high, above the Andes, but with a copilot.
Glk, the publicity you don't expect
A SUV out of the box with an original design and well defined by strong lines, large surfaces and sharp corners.
This is, in summary, Glk the latest born among the "compact" offroads of the house of the star with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to give a breath of novelty in this field.
For its contents outside the traditional canons, the communication that will accompany the launch of the Suv Glk, available at the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from 17 October, will also be unexpected and unconventional.
Thus the advertising battle that will accompany the debut of the new car will start an unprecedented mode of communication also through a futuristic 3D poster campaign, used for the first time in Italy by an automotive brand.
A project of maxi-posting, divided into three different phases, that will dominate the central Milan shopping street, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision and thanks to special glasses distributed near Corso Como it will be possible to see the new SUV in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, looking at the image you will get the impression that the car comes out of the manifesto.
Subsequently, through the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, and then recomposed into a single image.
Undoubtedly Mercedes with this advertising is trying to introduce something new into the stereotyped field of automotive communication.
Will it be able with this formula to stimulate the interest of future buyers? We will see.
That's who the Italian hooligans are.
Of the Triveneto, they risk Daspo.
But who are those 150-200 boys and girls that all of Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been following the Italian national team for years and that so far, to tell the truth, had never created excessive problems.
Nor had he ever clashed with the opposing fans.
The extraction of the group is right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
To these were added to Sofia groups (a few units, in fact) from Campania and Puglia.
They have tricolor flags where the cities of origin of the militants appear: Saturday evening they were taken away for not being identified.
They're inspired by the English fan.
In Bulgaria they found a real Nazi fan, Levski.
Figc had made 144 tickets available to Italian fans for the match: all names, so easily controllable.
And the Viminal had in fact controlled them all: among those who left for Sofia there was no one with a Daspo in progress, no one who had been inhibited by attending a stadium.
Four blue fans, who had a history of stadium crimes, had in fact been refused the ticket and prevented the trip.
Now the Viminal waits to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police then will take action: in this case, it is possible to give Daspo for five years at least to the fans who have been arrested or to those who have been identified in the riots.
An international Daspo that prevents you from attending not only the Italian stadiums but all over Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, will no longer set foot in a stadium.
Luckily.
But now there is fear-emulation: that to those little more than one hundred and fifty, others are added.
"We must immediately put out this fire and not legitimize those who behave in this way," they say from the Viminal.
So, "eyes well open especially in view of the game of the National on Wednesday in Lecce".
In Puglia in fact there is a small nucleus of supporters of Ultras Italy.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, Tuesday the Casms which can also count on a section of the Aise, that is, the secret services, which deals precisely with the stadium problems.
"The Duce-Duce choirs and the arm stretched out during Mameli's anthem? In Bulgaria it is not a crime...".
This is the thought (expressed in a very unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, for a few weeks director of the Observatory of the Viminale (he took the place that was first Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had previously been commissioner of Trieste where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to sing to the Duce but certainly the behavior of those 150-200 fans was shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - adds No.1 of the Observatory - crimes must be attributed in the country where the event takes place.
Until now this group had remained in line, now we will see what has happened and we will evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about the whistles at Mameli's anthem: even those are not a crime, but if you will allow me, they are not education...".
