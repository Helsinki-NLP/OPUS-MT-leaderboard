This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely diffused, but provides more details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
. According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was brown brown at the top, with a pale or carotenoid colouration at the bottom.
The discovery also provides detailed information on the evolution of bird feathers.
Since the plumage of the dinosaur is not equipped with the basic structure, the so-called rachis, but instead has other characteristics typical of feathers, beards and beards, the researchers have concluded that the rachis is probably the result of an evolutionary development following these characteristics.

Edgar Veguilla suffered injuries to his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider will have to undergo facial reconstruction surgery.
Uka's weapon did not explode when it was pointed at the head of a fifth man. Schneider has constant pain, is blind by one eye, he lacks a section of skull and his face was rebuilt into titanium.
Schneider testified via video conference from a USF base in his country.
In addition to Wednesday's event, Carpanedo participated in two single Championship races.
The first in slalom, where on the first descent he recorded a DNT. 36 other competitors out of 116 in the same race did not finish the test.
The other race in which she participated, the giant slalom, saw her ranked tenth in the women's group of the "seated" category, with a combined travel time of 4:41.30, slower than 2:11.60 minutes compared to the first ranked, the Austrian Claudia Loesch, and slower than 1:09.02 minutes compared to the ninth place of Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
Four female skiers failed to finish their descents, and 45 of the 117 Slalom Gigante participants did not rank in the race.
Madhya Pradesh police managed to recover the laptop and cell phone that had been stolen.
Deputy Inspector General, DK Arya, announced: "Five people have been arrested for the rape of the Swiss woman. We also found her cell phone and laptop".
The defendants' names are: Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
None of the three people who were in the house at the time of the car crash were injured.
Nevertheless, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed, while rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been at the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court on charges of killing his own son.
It is held pending referral to trial and trial, but any testimony given by an eyewitness could be polluted, as its image has been widely published.
This is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice has other parameters, and the Scottish courts have considered the publication of photos to be potentially harmful.
According to Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee "journalists who publish photos or other suspicious subjects, walk on a minefield".
The Crown Office, which has the general responsibility for judicial proceedings, has specified to journalists that no new comments will be made at least until the formal act of accusation.
According to what has been leaked, the object of the document will be the dispute over borders, which Palestine wants to be based on the existing borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
According to what is said, the other issues discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement is signed, Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to abandon this presence only for five years.
The shooters within the experimental programme for the control of harmful animals had to be carefully monitored by the rangers, since the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program, the NPWS in collaboration with the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., recruited qualified volunteers.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of the Park Conservation and Heritage of the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive training and safety instructions.
Yesterday Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) composed of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth provisional election council in four years.
Last month a presidential commission proposed a package of measures to push the country towards new elections, including the resignation of the previous CEP.
The commission constituted Martelly's response to the widespread protests, which began in October, which contest the regime.
The occasional violent protests have been triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been planned since 2011.
Some 60 cases of malfunctioning iPod overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and causing mild burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economics, Trade and Industry (METI) has stated that it is aware of 27 device-related incidents.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that Apple had informed Apple of 34 other overheating incidents, which the company called "not serious".
In its reply, the ministry called Apple's postponement of the report "absolutely regrettable".
The quake shock at the Marianne was warned at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the Emergency Management Office of the Northern Marianne Islands no damage has been reported in the nation.
And also the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there were no tsunami signals in place.
In Manila, capital of the Philippines, a former Philippine policeman took Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus.
With his M16 rifle Rolando Mendoza set fire to tourists.
Many of the hostages have been rescued, at least six have died.
Six hostages, including children and elders, were released immediately along with Filipino photographers.
The photographers then replaced an elderly lady who needed to use the bathroom. Mendoza was shot to death.
Liggins retraced his father's footsteps and embarked on his career as a doctor.
After following training in obstetrics, in 1959 he joined the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While serving at the hospital, in leisure Liggins began studying cases of premature labor.
His research showed that the administration of a hormone would accelerate the maturation of the lungs in the foetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday recovered two 'black boxes' with flight records.
His wrestling companions also wanted to pay tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Moon was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. She died on the night of the two moons. Unique, just like her. A strong woman."
"Moon was as weird as me... maybe even more... I love her and I'll miss her... Let's hope she's in a better place," was Dustin's comment "Goldust" Runnels.
According to the survey conducted on 1,400 people before the 2010 federal election, people opposed to Australia's transition to republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard said he believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
This opinion is shared by 34% of respondents, according to which Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia's last monarch.
At the opposites of the survey, 29% of respondents claim that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medal was supposed to compete in the 100 and 200 metres freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but he suffered several ailments that led to doubt of his physical form.
He could not take the necessary drugs to overcome the pain because they are banned from the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, mathematician and computer professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest number ever known to date.
The discovery was verified by several people through the use of various hardware and software in early February, and was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been one of the sources that have led water and organic matter to earth, i.e. matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed and in particular how the Earth was formed, having collided with comets a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, has been in office since the beginning of this year as governor; last month he signed a law that makes same-sex marriage legal.
According to him speculation is nothing but "politic talker and idiotic nonsense".
A presidential candidacy is envisaged in 2016.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system would allow aircraft to cover shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel per year, thus reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
The system employs satellite technology instead of obsolete ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is being set up and the surface trains will not stop at Wembley, while on the spot there are no parking spaces for cars or interchanges.
Fears of the absence of means of transport have brought out the possibility to have the game played mandatory behind closed doors, without the support of the team's fans.
According to a study published on Thursday in Science magazine, a new species of birds would be born on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
According to researchers from Princeton University, United States, and Uppsala University, Sweden, the new species has evolved into just two generations, though it was believed that the time required for this process was much greater; this due to the coupling of an endemic finch of Darwin, Geospiza fortes, and the finch of immigrant cactus, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked in any shape. It can be rolled to create tiny shapes.
It can be pulled up to form a thin thread, suitable to be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into foils.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. Sometimes it has been used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "minimate codes" precisely thanks to the possibility of being made so thin.
This is the so-called pH of the substance. Using red cabbage juice you can build a pH indicator.
The cabbage juice changes color according to how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical element is.
The pH level of the chemical analysed is given by the amount of hydrogen ions present (the letter H of pH).
Hydrogen ions are protons whose electrons have been torn away (since hydrogen atoms are formed by a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dried powders together and then, with the hands clean and wet, put them in a ball.
Between the moisture present on your hands and the outer layers will trigger a reaction that will cause a strange sensation and form a kind of shell.
Almost all houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a bathroom with running water equipped with a connection to an advanced sewer system.
In Greece, remains of sewers have been discovered in the homes of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini.
The toilets in ancient times also existed in Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization they were sometimes included in public baths, frequented by a mixed audience of men and women.
To call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then sends it back almost instantly.
The launch of the satellite into space was carried out with a rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because the atmosphere of the Earth partly distorts light and visuals.
A rocket over 100 feet high is required to transport a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has greatly changed the world. Among the various advantages it has offered us, the most important is to have provided us with easier and faster transport.
Thanks to its invention, they made their appearance the train, the car and several other means of transport.
Below them are other medium - sized cats that feed on medium - sized preys, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free domestic cats) that feed on small preys, considerably more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The niche concept is the secret of their success, a particular objective that each feline has and that allows it not to compete with others.
Lions are the most social felines and live in numerous groups called flocks.
The herds are composed of adult males, usually 2 or 3 related to each other, and a number of females and puppies that can reach 30.
Usually females are closely related to each other, being a large family of daughters and sisters.
The pack of lions acts in a very similar way to the pack of wolves or dogs, whose behavior is in fact surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not to that of other large felines), also as regards deadly attacks on their preys.
A complete athlete: the tiger is able to climb (though not too well), swim, make very long jumps and exercise a traction force five times higher than that of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same family (the genus Panthera) of the lion, leopard and jaguar. These four cats are the only ones to roar.
The roar of the tiger is not as powerful as that of the lion, but more resembles a phrase of screaming and angry words.
Ocelotti like to feed on small animals. If possible, they hunt for monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds and almost all the preys they catch are much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that the ocelotti follow and find the animals to eat (prey) thanks to the smell, sniffing on the ground where they have been.
Thanks to the night vision they are able to see very well in the dark, as well as being able to move stealthily. To hunt their prey, the ocelotti blend in with the surrounding environment and then dropping them on.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population to which it belongs (e.g. if it moves over a mountain range or river, or moves on a new island, thus making it difficult to return), it will probably find itself in a different environment from the one in which it was before.
This new environment is characterized by different resources and competitors, so, in order to stand as a strong competitor, the new population will need different characteristics or transformations compared to those previously necessary.
The original population has not changed at all; it continues to need the same adaptations as before.
As time passes and as the new population adapts to its new environment, it increasingly resembles the other population.
At one point, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different from each other that they can no longer be defined as belonging to the same species.
This process, which consists of the formation of new species, is called speciation. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and is a fundamental element of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that is breathed by humans and absorb the carbon dioxide expelled from them (through exhalation).
Plants process their nourishment with the sun through photosynthesis. They also shade.
We build our houses from plants and produce clothes with plants. Much of the food we eat is made of plants. Without plants animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the superpredator of his age and for this reason he feared nothing, except the other mosaics.
More than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus an additional line located on the palate, emerged from its long mouths, so for anyone crossing its path there was no escape.
We do not know for sure, but it is possible that it had the fork tongue. Its feeding included turtles, large fish, other mosaics and it is also possible that it was a cannibal.
He also attacked whatever entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex could not compete with him.
Although much of their food would seem familiar to us, Roman banquets also included several strange or unusual courses, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a sort of rodent called a goir.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate while sitting on chairs, rich men loved feasting together lying on their side while eating their meal.
Of course, the meals of the ancient Romans did not include different foods, which came to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built for each deity a main temple, which was considered the dwelling place of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to provide for the needs of the gods through ceremonies and feasts.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary accessible only to priests.
Sometimes, particular pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurat, were built, which became part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a shrine dedicated to the god.
Thanks to the mild climate that characterizes the Middle East, the house was not of fundamental importance.
Much of the life of the Jewish family took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard, while the shops were simple open-air counters overlooking the street. The stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so the wood was particularly expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Nordic sagas it is said that it was Erik the Red who gave it its name, having met Greenland on his journey after being exiled from Iceland for murder.
But, regardless of its discovery, at that time the Eskimo tribes already lived there.
Although all countries are "scandinavian", the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland had very different characteristics.
If you've seen the movie "The Mystery of the Templars," you might think a treasure map is drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Anyway, that's not true, even if there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is the inscription "Declaration of Original Independence of 4 July 1776". The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although it is not known for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence the large parchment document (measure 29.75 inches by 24.5 inches) was rolled up to be stored.
Probably, therefore, the record was only on purpose as a label.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing clashes had led the north of France to liberation, but the south was still occupied.
It was ruled by the Vichy regime, that is by those French who in 1940 had made peace with the Germans and had allies with the invaders, instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France: this offensive action was named "Operation Dragoon".
The American forces and those of the Free French had freed the south of France in just two weeks and headed for Germany.
Civilization means a specific culture, shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work collaboratively, constituting a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis", which means civil; the term is in turn connected with "civis", i.e. citizen, and "civitas", i.e. city or city-state, and in some way also defines the dimensions of society.
Cities-states are the first realities to anticipate the idea of nation. Culture of civilization means transmitting knowledge through several generations, leaving an indelible cultural footprint through equitable diffusion.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical traces, not being thus recognized as real civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states formed for the first time a weak central government, and Congress was the only component of it, according to the Statute of the Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes and, given the absence of an executive or judicial power at national level, relied on state authorities, often uncooperative, for the application of their acts.
He didn't even have the authority to bypass tax laws and duties between states.
To amend the articles it was necessary the unanimous consent of all the states. These for their part had so little consideration of the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, along with the German national football team, the second most successful football team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the most popular sports are: football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, track hockey and Formula 1 car races.
Winter sports are more widespread in the northern regions and see Italians engaged in international competitions and Olympic events.
They are part of the Japanese almost 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), and this makes Japan the seventh largest archipelago in the world!
From a geographical point of view, we refer to Japan as an "archology", considered the presence of groups of islands that make up it.
Taiwan was born in the 15th century, when European sailors passing by shortly record the name of the island under the name of Ilha Formosa, or wonderful island.
The Dutch East India Company in 1624 established a base in the southwest of Taiwan, starting a transformation involving the production systems of Aboriginal cereals and hiring Chinese laborers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan end up under the control of Qing Dynasty forces (1644-1912); in 1885, Taiwan is declared Qing Empire province.
After being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed in 1895 the Treaty of Shimonoseki thus yielding Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan; the island will remain under the Japanese government until 1945.
Machu Picchu comprises three primary structures, namely the Intihuatana, The Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the peripheral buildings have been rebuilt to give tourists a more precise idea of their original appearance.
In 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu's site had been recovered, but restoration work is still ongoing.
The most common format in the world for the photography of fixed images, for example, is 35 mm, the same as the film most used at the end of the era of analog photography.
It is still produced today and, what is most important, its aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Oddly enough, the height of the 35 mm format is 24 mm and its width is 36 mm.
The proportions of this format (divide by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of integers) are therefore considered 3:2.
The proportions of many of the common formats (e.g. the ODA family) are equal or very close to this value.
The much exploited and often mocked rule of third parties is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order within an image.
According to this rule, the most effective point to place the main subject corresponds to the intersection of the lines that divide the image into third parties, both vertically and horizontally (as in the example).
At this stage of European history, the Catholic Church, which became rich and powerful, was afraid to be under examination.
The Christian religion had acted as a glue between European states for over a thousand years, despite linguistic and custom differences.
His ubiquitous power has influenced everyone, from the king to the ordinary citizens.
One of the foundations of Christianity is that wealth must serve to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the monetary reserves of the church exist precisely for this reason.
The central authority of the church has remained in Rome for over a thousand years and this convergence of power and money has prompted many to wonder whether this principle has been respected.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain decided to implement a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective: it provided for the interruption of any essential military and civilian supply, despite the fact that this blockade violated international law usually accepted and codified by multiple international treaties of the last two centuries.
Britain undermined international waters to prevent any boat from accessing entire sections of the ocean, also putting neutral ships at risk.
Since this tactic had aroused a limited response, Germany expected a similar reaction to its indiscriminate submarine war campaign.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and heinousness of World War I, the nations desired to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla accepted a job offer at the Edison Company in New York City and this led him to move to the United States of America.
He came to the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems and a letter of recommendations written by Charles Batchelor (his manager in the previous work) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China the different periods of time were referred to in a very singular way: every period of China or every family that was in power constituted a specific dynasty.
Even the intervals between the individual dynasties were characterized by periods of instability and division between the provinces. The best known was the so-called Three Kingdoms period, between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty, which lasted for 60 years.
At these times, fierce wars were waged among many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the most violent eras in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting to win a place of honor in the imposing Xi'an palace.
The social and political effects are numerous, including the use of the metric system, the transition from absoluteism to the republic, nationalism and the conviction that the nation belongs to the people and is not owned by a single sovereign.
Moreover, after the Revolution the professions were open to all men candidates, allowing the most ambitious and lucky to succeed.
The same applies to the military, since the army rankings, instead of being based on class, are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other oppressed workers in various countries to begin their own revolution.
Muhammad had a deep interest in matters that go beyond earthly life. He used to go to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave, which survived the passage of time, offers itself a very clear image of Muhammad's spirituality.
The cave rests on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, completely detached from the rest of the world.
In reality it is not at all easy to find, even if you knew its existence. Once inside the cave, the isolation is total.
You can see nothing but a wonderful clear sky and a great amount of mountains around. From the inside of the cave you can see or feel very little of the surrounding world.
Among the seven wonders of the world, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one that has arrived in our days not in a state of ruin.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of the great pyramidal structures built in honor of the dead Pharaoh.
The Giza plain, or "Necropolis of Giza", in the Valley of Kings in Egypt, houses numerous pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheope), various smaller tombs, several temples and the great Sphinx.
The important pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Cheope, and many of Pharaoh's pyramids, tombs and minor temples were built to honor Pharaoh's wives and family members.
The indication "arched up" resembles a V and the indication "arched down" to a paper clip or a square devoid of the lower side.
Upward means that you should start from the tip and push the bow, and down means that you should start from the alamaro (which is where the hand supports the bow) and pull the bow towards yourself.
An ascending arc usually generates a softer sound, while with a descending arc it results in a louder and stronger sound.
You may decide to add your own custom pencil instructions, but keep in mind that the bow marks you find printed have a musical value, so in principle they should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of women in the market forced King Louis XVI, in terror, to leave Versailles to return to Paris, along with Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Maria Theresa, 11 years old and Louis Charles, 4 years old) and Elizabeth, the king's sister.
With a carriage they returned to Paris, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and screaming threats against the sovereigns.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point someone in the crowd showed the terrified queen the head of a royal guard who had been killed in Versailles.
The war expenses of U.S. imperialism incurred to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover much of the expenses and interest on bonds fluctuated in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Clearly, the huge gains from the protracted exploitation of the Philippine people over time constituted the profits at the base of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars one must know the context that led to the creation of this order.
The time when events took place is commonly called the Upper Middle Ages, the period of European history covering the XI, XII and XIII centuries (from 1000 to 1300 A.D.).
The Full Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Low Middle Ages, which ends by convention in about 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that includes in practice a wide range of ideas, from technological innovation or technological imperative to the strict sense that man's destiny is driven by a underlying logic, associated with scientific laws and their realization in technology.
Much of the interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: one is that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond political and cultural influence, and the other is that technology itself has "effects" on societies that are intrinsic, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that the car necessarily involves the development of the road network.
However, a national road network only for a few cars is not economically sustainable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of ownership of a car.
The mass possession of cars also leads to a higher percentage of accidents on the roads, and consequently the invention of new relief techniques for the care of injured people.
Romanticism was characterized by a substantial component of cultural determinism, taken from authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romance, geography has conditioned individuals, and over time uses, customs and culture have arisen linked to such geography that, being in harmony with the context of society, have resulted more effective than laws imposed arbitrarily.
Similarly to Paris, known nowadays as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion capital in feudal Europe.
His notoriety as a nerve centre of luxury began around 400 A.D. and continued approximately until 1100 A.D.
During the 12th century its prestige declined, especially because the Crusaders returned bearing gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this point that the title of capital of fashion passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The highest point of the Gothic style was reached in the period between the 10th and 11th century and in the 14th century.
Initially clothing suffered the strong influence of the Byzantine culture of the east.
But the slowness of communication means that the spread of styles in the West can delay by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments of the time, the result of the Crusades, was the introduction of buttons to fasten clothes.
Agriculture is defined as subsistence when it is practised for the sole purpose of producing sufficient food to meet the food needs of the farmer/farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, usually organic, that uses preserved seeds originating in the ecological region in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques aimed at getting the most out of crops.
Historically most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and in many developing countries it is still so.
Subcultures unite individuals with the same opinions, who do not feel representative of society's standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are distinguished by age, ethnicity, social class, position and/or gender of its members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinctive can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a set of factors.
Often members of a subculture indicate their belonging through a peculiar and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, manners and argots.
One of the most commonly used methods to explain the importance of socialization is to analyze some unhappy cases of children who, as a result of negligence, or as a result of intentional abuse, have grown up without proper socialization with adults.
These children are called "feral" or savages. Some of them have been segregated by people (often their own parents): in some cases the abandonment is motivated by the rejection of a serious intellectual or physical impairment by parents.
Feral children may have suffered severe violence or trauma before abandonment or escape.
Other children may have been raised by animals; yet others seem to have lived alone in the wild.
When the feral child is completely bred by non-human animals, it shows behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely analogous to those of the particular animal that has taken care of him, such as fear or indifference to man.
Project-based learning should make learning itself simpler and more interesting, while shelving goes a little further.
Scaffolding is not a learning mode, as much as a help for those who undertake a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is an example of "scapfolding", but it is also the small assistant in the shape of a staple of Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are intended to question, solicit and explain the procedures that the student may have had difficulty managing alone.
Children are given custody for various reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse, or even extortion.
A child should never grow up in an environment that does not guarantee food, care and training, but it happens to them.
We believe that foster care is a safe area for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving foster parents, stable education, and reliable health care.
The custody is supposed to meet all unmet needs in the house from which they were taken.
The Internet brings together some elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The characteristic elements of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage and gratification theory.
For example, as important motivations for using the Internet are suggested "learning" and "socialization" (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord's study of public reactions to websites (1998) identified two new aspects of motivation, namely "personal involvement" and "continuous relationships".
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is argued that it is possible to find out if a person is lying by interpreting microexpressions correctly.
In his essay "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks illustrated how people unable to understand the language spoken due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even claims that such skills in interpreting human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century research has demonstrated the existence of two pools of genetic variability, i.e. hidden variability and express variability.
With the mutation a new genetic variability is added, with the selection it is eliminated from the pool of expressed variability.
Generation after generation, segregation and recombination redistribute variability back and forth between the two pools.
For a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans it is difficult to meet its needs for amino acids with the plant resources available in the savannah.
Moreover, the failure to carry out these activities has serious consequences: slowing down growth, malnutrition and, in the end, death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins present in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us they are difficult to digest, unless they are cooked.
Animal foods (such as ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but provide a high amount of protein, containing all essential amino acids.
In the light of this, it should not be surprising that our very ancestors have solved their "protein problem" in a certain sense as the savannah chimpanzees do today.
The sleep interruption is the intentional awakening process that takes place during the normal sleep period, followed by a resumption of sleep (10–60 minutes later).
This process can be easily put into practice by using a relatively silent alarm clock to lead you to a state of consciousness, without waking up completely.
If you decide to reset the clock in your sleep, you can put it across the room, so you will be forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options focused on biorhythm include the consumption of many liquids before sleeping (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties), which force you to get up from bed to urinate.
A person enjoys an inner peace proportionally opposed to the tension existing in his body and spirit.
Less tension, more positive is the existing life force. Each of us has the potential ability to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. This goal is hindered only by our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's teachings, but has been enriched by the path of love of the Mahayano rite and by various techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It has a foundation in Kundalini Yoga, meditation and a path of omnicomprehensive love.
Kundalini Yoga activates Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) through the use of yoga positions, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
Deity Yoga is the focus of Tibetan meditation. Through the representation of various deities, the energy channels are cleaned, the chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is developed.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, system, procedural and cultural conflicts have caused the break between the two countries.
After two years since the war ended, the allies of the past had become enemies; so the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and be fought for real, by mercenary armies, in the battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other countries.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken down; the only option was to beat in retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridge head.
However, these plans soon proved obsolete, at a time when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers advanced and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga peace treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
Exploiting freight ships is definitely the most efficient way to move large volumes of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of the marines has always been to guarantee the country the safeguarding of its ability to move people and goods, while at the same time opposing the same ability of enemies to move their people and their goods.
One of the recent examples in support of this theory and most noteworthy is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. During the battle, Americans tried to move men and goods across the Atlantic Ocean to support Britain.
At the same time the German Navy, using mainly submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany would probably have had the opportunity to conquer Britain, as it had done in the rest of Europe.
Apparently, goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains, Iran.
They began to be bred by the cultures and tribes of antiquity to have easily available milk, fleece, meat and skin.
Domestic goats were usually bred in herds left free to move on the hills or in other pasture areas, often cared for by goats (similar to shepherds) who were often children or teenagers. These methods of shepherding are still used nowadays.
In the 16th century, the wagonways were built in England.
Although they were simply formed by parallel wooden axes, the wagonways, when compared with the slightly rougher roads of the period, allowed the horses who traveled them to reach higher speeds and to move heavier loads.
Traverses were introduced relatively early to keep the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was understood that the tracks would be more efficient if they had an iron bar on top.
It became a common practice, although iron caused greater wear on the wooden wheels of wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels gave way to the iron wheels. In 1767 the first rails made their appearance completely in iron.
The first means of transport that man knew were the legs. Human beings began to walk in erect position two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning "erect man").
His predecessor, the Australopithecus, did not usually walk erect.
Signs of specialization for bipede gait are present in the fossils of Australopithecus dating back to 4.2-3.9 million years, although it is possible that the Sahelanthropus walked on two legs already seven million years ago.
To try to mitigate future suffering to some extent, we can begin to adopt more environmentally friendly lifestyles, we can adhere to the environmental movement and also do activism.
In many cases this only works as a symptomatic treatment. If we do not want only a temporary solution, we should find the ultimate cause of the problems and turn it off.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed greatly due to the scientific and technological advances of humanity, while problems have increased due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humans.
After Congress adopted it on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap's typography a few blocks away.
In the night they were produced between 150 and 200 copies, now known as "The Dunlap posters".
The document was first read publicly on July 8 in the Independence Hall courtyard and the assignment was entrusted to John Nixon.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which had her read to her troops stationed in New York on July 9, while a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 edges of Dunlap still known are the oldest existing copies of the document. The original manuscript was lost.
According to many paleontologists of today a category of dinosaurs has survived and is still alive. They are what we call birds.
Many tend not to consider them dinosaurs because of feathers and their ability to fly.
Yet birds have many characteristics that unite them to dinosaurs.
Like the T-Rex, they are equipped with feet with scales and claws, lay their eggs and walk on the two hind legs.
Ultimately, manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers is the basis of all the computers currently used.
A binary number can have only one of the two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and in the computer language these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be evident immediately. Its symptoms, including vomiting, are very general, so as to make an immediate diagnosis impossible.
The main indication of internal poisoning could be the presence in the home of a container of drugs or open harmful chemicals.
Check if there are first aid instructions on the label for that specific poison.
The term acarus is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from the familiarity in ancient times with bedbugs, insects that have strongly adapted to become parasites of man.
Both assassinated bedbugs and bedbugs are nestling, i.e. adapted to live in the nest or home of their host.
In the United States of America multiple sclerosis (MS) records about 400,000 known cases, ranking first among neurological diseases affecting young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a pathology that affects the central nervous system, of which are part of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that the chances of developing MS among females are double that of males.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their own interest, or in that of their child.
These couples have the option of choosing an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, natural parents waive their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary objective of science is to understand the way the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most of the scientific investigation.
But this is not just about experimentation, since an experiment is a test that is used to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses; even asking questions and making observations allows to guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle’s views on the various subjects of knowledge, including psychology, were accepted.
With the progressive decline of the Greek language, the West has been isolated from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many have observed that physiological rhythms and behavior depend heavily on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms have been documented, which are not only reactions to external periodic signals, relative to most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators, whose free cycle continues for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the first experiments to suggest that DNA was a genetic material was that conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, i.e. viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments highlighting the bacteriophage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations may have a number of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the relevance of the piece of genetic material involved and depending on whether the affected cells belong to the germ line.
Mutations that can be transmitted to children are only those at germ cell level; mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Naturalistic tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including wildlife and flora.
Examples of activities on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visits to parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
For example, visiting, photographing and learning about Borneo orangutans.
Every morning, people leave small country to go by car to work, crossing other people whose workplace is the place they just left.
In this dynamic journey, everyone is somehow connected to a private car-based transport system, which they support at the same time.
Today science reveals that this massive carbon-based economy has forced the biosphere outside of one of its stability conditions that has allowed human evolution over the last two million years.
Each person participates in social life and uses the transport systems, of which almost everyone complains.
In developed countries it is rare to hear similar levels of complaints concerning water quality or bridges falling into ruin.
Why do transport systems attract so many complaints, why are they rejected every day? Are engineers designing them who are incompetent, or are there deeper motivations?
The "Traffic Flow" is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one point to another and of the interactions they generate with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is complex because drivers' behaviour cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, drivers' behaviour tends to fall into a reasonably constant range, so, in turn, traffic flows tend to show reasonable constancy and can be generally represented mathematically.
In order to achieve a more accurate representation of the traffic flow, the three main variables were correlated: (1) flow rate, (2) density and (3) speed.
These reports are useful for planning, designing and managing road structures.
The insects were the first animals to fly. The ability to fly allowed them to escape their enemies more easily and to find food and companions more efficiently.
Most insects benefit from the ability to fold their wings along the body.
This allows them to take advantage of a greater variety of small ravines to hide from predators.
Of all the insects that exist today, the only ones that are unable to fold their wings are the dragonflies and ephemerals.
Thousands of years ago, a man called Aristarchus claimed that the solar system moved around the Sun.
For some he was right, but many others believed the opposite, that the solar system, including the Sun itself (and also the other stars), moved around the Earth.
Which makes sense, because we don't get the feeling that the Earth is moving, do we?
The Amazon is the largest river and the second longest on Earth. It carries an amount of water equal to 8 times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the largest river on Earth, with a width at some points reaching six miles.
20% of the total water that flows from the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long, and the water of thousands of smaller tributaries flows into it.
They continued to build stone pyramids until the end of the Old Kingdom, but despite this the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in terms of the greatness and technical excellence of their realization.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom remained enchanted by admiring the monuments of their ancestors, who at that time were much more than a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican City consists of about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the one with the least population.
The language of Vatican City for official legislation and communications is Italian.
Italian is also the daily language of use spoken by most people working within the state, while Latin is often used in religious services.
In Vatican City all citizens are Roman Catholics.
Man has begun to know the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper already in antiquity: these elements can be discovered in nature in native form and it is possible to extract them in a fairly simple way with the help of primitive instruments.
According to the philosopher Aristotle, everything is composed of a combination of one or more of the following four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
These actually look more like the four states of matter, i.e. (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma. However, he also theorized that they were transformed into new substances, forming what we see.
The alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains numerous elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Obviously, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There may also be alloys composed of minimal amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
In the universe, everything is made of matter and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are incredibly tiny, so much so that trillions of them could enter the point at the end of this sentence.
After his invention, the pencil proved to be a good friend for many.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to lower status and less and less widespread use.
Today everyone writes messages on computer screens and never has the need to approach a pencil sharpener.
We can only ask ourselves what fate the keyboard will have when something newer comes along.
The principle that energy is needed to put together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons is at the base of the fission bomb's operation.
Basically it's like rolling a heavy cart on a hill. So, by splitting the core further, part of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break in the presence of a scarce or nothing thrust.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km in the nearest side and 100 km on the furthest side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountainous areas.
The maria could be more numerous on the near side because the crust is thinner. This facilitated the ascent of the lava to the surface.
Content theories are centered on the search for what satisfies or attracts individuals.
According to these theories, people present certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they become adults.
These theories analyze what unites some people and impels them to want to do what they do, and what are the factors in the context in which they live that impel them to do or not do certain things.
Among the most widespread content theories are Maslow's Theory of the hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's Theory of Two Factors.
In general, when managers start to direct their former colleagues, two behaviors can emerge. On the one hand, there are those who try to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
The manager of this type finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, put into practice disciplinary actions, evaluate performance, define and assign responsibilities.
At the opposite extreme, the manager turns into a completely different person, who feels that he needs to change the entire team's work and do it his own.
In the end, the leader is the person who ultimately is responsible for the team's success and failure.
This attitude often generates disagreements between leaders and the rest of the team.
The standard of excellence of virtual teams is similar to that of conventional teams, but with some small differences.
Members of the virtual team often have the function of a contact point for their next physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as meetings can take place depending on the different time zones, which may not be included in local management.
The existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a fundamental element of a virtual team.
It is called the "invisible team" the management team to which each member refers and it is the one that sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organization have the will to deal with the long process leading to the construction of a learning organization? A good reason to implement organizational learning concepts can be innovation.
When you manage to use all available resources effectively in all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Consequently, the path of collaboration within an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
In order for an organisation to be defined as innovative, it is necessary for leaders to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) illustrates continuum theory as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance levels.
Neurobiological results have demonstrated the physical existence of a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. The research area becomes more restricted and therefore much more precise.
The link between cerebral pathology and behavior is the basis of scientists' research.
It has long been known that certain types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumors can affect behaviour and change certain mental functions.
The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and investigate structures and brain processes that have never been observed before.
This offers us a great deal of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our mental processes.
Although it has a strong sci-fi connotation, AI represents a very important branch of computing that deals with behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
AI research includes the creation of machines to automate operations that require intelligent behavior.
Some examples of application are the control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to the diagnosis and questions of customers, as well as the recognition of writing, speech and facial.
These things have become distinct disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real problems.
The AI system is now often used in the economic, medical, engineering and military fields, as well as being integrated into several software applications for home computers and video games.
Trips are a fundamental part of teaching. Teachers would often like to take their students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The solution is offered by technology with virtual trips. Students can see the artifacts of museums, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in class.
Sharing a virtual school trip is also a great excuse to share travel experiences and reflections with future classes.
For example, every year students at Bennet School, North Carolina, design a website on their trip to the capital; the website is redesigned each year, but previous versions are kept online and become an album.
Blogs can also help improve the writing of students. Often, in fact, their first experiences with blogs are characterized by a poorly edited grammar and spelling, but generally the presence of an audience changes things.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, to avoid negative reviews the blog author is committed to improving writing.
The blogs also "constrain students to become more aware of the moment that surrounds them". The need to nurture the interest of the public motivates students to be ingenious and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that aims to encourage collaboration and develop student learning well beyond normal school day.
The correct use of blogs "can help students become more critical and analytical. By actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their position within the writings of others, as well as outlining their perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming and bilingual capital of Canada, rich in art galleries and museums that tell the past and present of the country.
Further south are the Niagara Falls and to the north you can admire the natural and pristine beauty of the Muskoka region and much more.
All this and more makes Ontario typically Canadian according to the views of foreigners.
The vast northernmost areas are sparsely populated, some of which are almost uninhabited wilderness.
If you compare the population, the result can be surprising for many: in the United States the number of African American citizens is higher than that of Canadian citizens.
East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and its natural heritage makes it a continent in its own right.
Almost all smaller islands, known as luxurious seaside resorts, are mostly independent nations or associated with France.
In the lands the Arabs also brought Islam, which undertook a long journey to the Comoros and Mayottes.
In the 15th century, the discovery of the Cape's route, from Europe to India, by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama opened the way to European influence and colonialism.
To the north, the region is bounded by Sahel, while to the south and west it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
For travellers: everyone is recommended to declare that they are married, regardless of their actual civil status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can give rise to what they consider a harassment, and that it is not unusual to be followed, grasped by the arm, etc.
Have the firmness to reject men, and do not be afraid to oppose them (cultural differences or not, there is no justification!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC; under the name of Anfa, it was a port of strategic importance used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed it to rebuild it under the name of Casa Branca, which they abandoned in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city which was called Daru l-Badya, then called Casablanca by Spanish traders who chose these places for their commercial bases.
Throughout Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting shopping towns.
In the surroundings of the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tajin, ceramics, leather items, narghilè and lots of chincaglieria, but all this is reserved only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, not far from Rwanda.
In 2002, the Nyiragongo volcano lava destroyed Goma, burying most of the city's streets, especially those of the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, it is advisable to document well before making any visits outside Goma, so as to evaluate well the state of the clashes that still persist in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing to the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as being one of the least expensive opportunities to see the mountain gorillas of Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (taxi-motocycle) to move to Goma. The normal price (in local currency) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short run.
Even as a result of its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuctu" ended up becoming metaphor of exotic and distant land.
Today Timbuktu is a fallen city, but for its reputation it remains a tourist attraction, also equipped with an airport.
In 1990 it was included on the list of UNESCO heritage sites that are in danger, due to the threat posed by desert sands.
In the special of Henry Louis Gates of PBS "Wonders of the African World" ("The Wonders of the African World") was one of the main stages.
With its more arabesque touch than African, the city stands out clearly from the other parts of the country.
Kruger National Park (Kruger National Park, KNP) is located northeast of South Africa and winds east along the border with Mozambique, north border with Zimbabwe, and its southern border is represented by the Crocodile River.
With an area of 19,500 km2, the park comprises 14 different ecozones, each providing support for a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the most important of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all the national parks in South Africa, there are daily contributions for conservation and entry to the park.
Buying a Wild Card could also be useful, as it allows access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island, which gives its name to the entire territory, is the main destination for many tourists.
The series of buildings forming the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a sparkling bar graph, even more evident because framed by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To enjoy the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and visit Kowloon's waterfront across the street.
Most of the urban development of the island of Hong Kong has focused on reclaimed land on the north coast, densely populated.
This is the place that the English colonizers chose for themselves, so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this land, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal strip of mangroves in the world. It extends 80 km (50 mi) from the coast in the hinterland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of forest included in Indian territory is named Sundarbans National Park.
However, forests are not only made up of mangrove swamps: in them there is also what remains of the imposing jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third consists of swampy areas.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have become a sanctuary for wildlife; in the area is estimated the presence of 400 royal tigers of Bengal and about 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses leave from the interdistrict bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although many (especially those heading east and to Jakarta/Bumthang) leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since often service buses between different districts are full, it will be good to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Most neighborhoods are reached by comfortable and robust small Japanese buses.
Shared taxis are a convenient and fast way to reach nearby locations, including Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a stretch bridge that connects the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
Its two pylons have a height of 83 meters, is 378 meters long and has two lanes 3.50 meters wide.
Under the bridge the free vertical space is 15 meters. The construction ended in August 2011, but the opening to traffic took place only in March 2017.
In September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are likely to be completed, the bridge should be fully operational.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group living in present-day eastern Paraguay. They were seminomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other indigenous tribe groups such as the Guaycuru and the Payaguá, who lived by hunting, harvesting and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "The Great Province of the Indies", was born in the 16th century from the meeting between Spanish conquerors and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period that lasted three centuries, the period of colonization.
Since the foundation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain much of its indigenous identity and peculiarities.
Everyone knows that Argentina boasts one of the best teams and polo players in the world.
In December, in the Las Cañitas polo fields, the most important tournament of the year takes place.
Here you can watch smaller tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
To receive information on tournaments and the purchase of tickets for polo games, please contact Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The Falkland have their official currency, the Falkland pound (FKP), whose value is equivalent to that of the British pound (GBP).
The only island bank, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store, offers currency exchange service.
UK pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands. Stanley can often also be paid by credit cards and US dollars.
It is likely that on the peripheral islands they do not accept credit cards, although the UK and US currencies can be accepted. Check ahead with the owners to decide an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland's currency outside the islands, so change the money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, there is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; during the summer months temperatures above 30°C are quite normal.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely reach below zero, but the combination of wind and humidity gives the sensation of a temperature lower than that marked by the thermometer.
There are no defined "dry" and "rainy" seasons: the amount of rain is kept almost constant all year round.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to the sight of man, the fauna is still wild and must not be fed or disturbed.
The park authorities recommend maintaining a distance of at least 100 yards/metres from bears and wolves and a distance of 25 yards/metres from all other wild animals.
No matter how docile they may seem: bison, elk, deer, bears, virtually all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors suffer injuries for not keeping a proper distance. It is necessary to leave these animals a suitable space because they are large, wild and potentially dangerous animals.
Also keep in mind that odors can attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid taking with you or cooking foods with very strong odors, and try to keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of the Samoa Islands. It is located on the island of Upolu and its population has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded between 1850 and 1860 and is the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In this port was the sadly known naval stalemate of 1889, in which seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to abandon the port.
All ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. Nearly 200 U.S. and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the city led to the killing of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the supreme chief.
There are many beaches, since Auckland is located between two ports. The most popular are divided into three areas.
The beaches overlooking the Pacific Ocean of North Shore (in North Harbour District) extend from Long Bay north to Devonport south.
They are mainly sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and most of them enjoy the shade of the pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive in Auckland Central, in the elegant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, overlook the harbour of Waitemata.
These beaches are suitable for families, sometimes a little crowded, surrounded by a wide choice of shops. You can swim safely.
The best known local beer is a non-complex, pleasant and refreshing beer called "Number One". The other local beer is called "Manta".
You may have many French wines, but Australians and New Zealanders might face the journey better.
The local tap water is totally safe to drink, but if you are afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
According to Australians, 'flat white' coffee is born from a foreign idea. Espresso is black short coffee, cappuccino is covered with cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is at the same level as Belgian chocolate. Fruit juices are expensive, but very good.
Throughout the year many trips to the coral reef are carried out and injuries to one of these causes on the coral reef are rare.
Always ask the authorities for advice, follow the instructions and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
Cubomeduses appear from October to April near the beaches and estuaries of the rivers north of Seventeen Seventy. Outside of this period you can only find them occasionally.
Sharks are present, but rarely attack the man. Most sharks fear him and tend to keep away.
The habitat of saltwater crocodiles consists primarily of the estuaries of the rivers north of Rockhampton, not actively living in the ocean.
When booking in advance, the traveller has the serenity of finding a place to sleep once he reaches his destination.
Travel agencies often enter into agreements with certain hotels, but it is still possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through the same agencies.
Travel agencies generally offer packages including breakfast, transfers to/from the airport or even combined flight+hotel packages.
They can also keep the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to get additional documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests must be submitted to the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, most participants decide to camp on the spot, considering this aspect a crucial element of the experience.
To be close to the center of the action you need to arrive early and win a space close to music.
Remember that once the music is finished on the main stages, there may be sections of the festival where the music continues until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, since the ice crossing causes rather annoying noises for those who are most exposed to it.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include the time to spend exploring the city. Cruise passengers are granted visa waiver (check conditions).
Generally, casinos do everything to increase as much as possible the time and money spent by their guests. Generally, there are neither windows, nor clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer exclusive food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests' moods high so that they stay.
In some places alcoholic beverages are offered by the house. However the state of intoxication alters judgment and every good gambler knows how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who decides to drive at high altitudes or on mountain passes must take into account the possibility of snow, ice or temperatures close to zero.
On icy and snowy tracks, friction is reduced and it is not possible to drive as when you are on clean asphalt.
During a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you get stuck.
Rainfall and snow gusts, or the formation of ice or condensation on the windows of the vehicle, can also reduce visibility.
However, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic continues to flow almost continuously throughout the year.
safaris are probably Africa's biggest tourist attraction and the focus of many visitors' holidays.
In its popular use, the term safari refers to journeys made by land, especially in the savannah, to see the beautiful African wildlife.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to cars, so a normal equipment is enough to get a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes fearful and for this reason it is possible to better observe them with binoculars.
A safari walking (also called "bush walk", "hiking safaris", or "walking safaris") is an excursion that can last a few hours or more days.
Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2012, and part of the events will take place in other locations around Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games. The first Olympics were held in 1964.
If your reservation for flights and accommodation for 2020 was made before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary among themselves, however most coronavirus-related cancellation policies, at the end of March 2020, do not arrive until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
It is expected that the cost of most tickets for events will be between 2,500 ¥ and 130,000 ¥, while ordinary tickets will cost approximately ¥7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can make drying easier. Many hotels offer the use of iron and ironing board, although they are not present in the room.
If you do not have an iron, or if you do not like to wear iron socks, you can try with a hairdryer, if you have it available.
Be careful not to subject the tissues to too high temperatures, to avoid shrinkage or, in the worst case, burns.
There are various ways to sanitise water and some of these prove to be more effective against specific risks.
In some areas it is enough to boil the water for a minute, in others it takes many minutes.
The effectiveness of the filters varies, so in case of doubts it is appropriate to evaluate the purchase of water packaged inside sealed bottles from a reliable company.
Travelers may come into contact with animal parasites that are not widespread in their regions of origin.
Parasites can spoil food, cause irritation or, at worst, cause allergic reactions, as well as transmitting poison or infections.
The same infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force are usually not qualified as harmful animals.
Duty Free purchases are an opportunity to buy tax-free and excise-free products at certain locations.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The section of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway between Point Marion and Fairmont is the one that presents the most difficult driving conditions, as it often crosses isolated areas between vegetation.
If you do not have the habit of driving on country roads, you should keep your eyes open, as steep slopes, narrow streets and narrow curves predominate.
The speed limits displayed are significantly lower than those applied in previous and subsequent sections (usually 35-40 mph / 56-64 km/h). Their strict observance is extremely important.
Strangely, however, in this area the level of coverage of mobile services is much higher than in other parts of the route, for example in Pennsylvania Wilds.
The German sweets are pretty good and in Bavaria they are quite tasty and varied, similar to those of nearby Austria further south.
Fruit desserts are a timeless classic, from those with apples available all year round to those with cherries and plums, which appear during the summer.
Several German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. The most popular cakes often accompany you very well with a cup of strong coffee.
Those who want to taste sweets, small but rich in flavor, can orient themselves on what, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish prepared with herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
The curry may appear either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid contained.
In northern India and Pakistan for curry in inland regions yogurt is normally used; in southern India and some other coastal region of the subcontinent coconut milk is more used.
Given the presence of 17,000 islands to choose from, the term Indonesian cuisine is a generic term covering a wide variety of regional cuisines that meet in the country.
However, when used without further specification, the term generally indicates foods originating in the central and eastern part of the main island, Java.
The Javanese cuisine, now widely spread throughout the archipelago, offers a series of dishes of simple preparation; its predominant flavors are given by the use of peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The brackets are supports for the knight's feet and are hung on both sides of the saddle.
They guarantee greater stability to the rider but may present safety problems due to the possibility of the rider's feet being stuck there.
If a jockey is flung by a horse but has a foot stuck in the bracket, he may be dragged by the horse that escapes. To minimize this risk, there are some security measures that can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots equipped with heel and a smooth and rather thin sole.
Later some saddles, especially the English saddles, have inserted safety bars, which cause a leather bracket to detach from the saddle when, in the event of a fall, the rider pulls it back.
Cochamó Valley: Chile's most important climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, where a large number of huge granite walls and cliffs are drawn.
Peaks of the peaks include breathtaking views. Climbers from all over the world continuously trace new routes on its walls, potentially endless.
Free downhill snow sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very popular and provide for snow slide thanks to the use of skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Ski is one of the main tourist activities and boasts many enthusiasts, sometimes also called "ski bumps" (ski ski skis), who devote entire holiday periods to skiing in a particular area.
The principle at the base of the ski is very ancient: the first rock paintings with the depiction of humans skiing date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport has its origins at least in the 17th century; in 1861 the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Hiking on skis: the activity is also called off-piste, ski mountaineering or hiking on skis.
It is connected, although it does not usually include them, to ski touring or skimo, which are practiced on steep terrains and require much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski slope as a hiking route.
If the conditions are good, you can cover some more distances than those traveled walking, but only very rarely will you reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on beaten slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent but formed by many independent countries. Normally, to travel across several countries you should apply for a visa and go through passport control several times.
However, in this respect, the Schengen area functions rather as a single country.
If you stay within this area, you can normally go from one border to another without having to pass passport checks again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for individual Member States, thus saving time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universal definition of what makes an artifact an antique. Some tax agencies consider such an object that is at least 100 years old.
The definition has geographical differences with respect to the age limit that may be lower, as in the case of North America compared to Europe.
Craft objects could be defined as antiques, though more recent than similar items produced in series.
Reindeer breeding is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi and the culture on which this trade is based is also the basis of many other professions.
Even in the course of time, not all Sámi have always been involved in the breeding of reindeer on a large scale; some lived in fishing, hunting and similar activities, using reindeer especially as work animals.
Today, many Sámi have modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sápmi, the territory of the Sámi.
Although widely used, especially among non- Roma people, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and a wrong perception of Roma people.
If a warning for travellers is issued for the destination you visit, there may be consequences for your travel health insurance or your insurance in case of travel cancellation.
You may also be interested in the opinions of governments other than yours, but keep in mind that these opinions are targeted at the citizens of those governments.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may encounter different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Notices are simply a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The opinions reported are often superficial, generic and simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
"Adverse weather conditions" is the general expression used to indicate any dangerous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social distress or loss of human life.
In every part of the world extreme weather conditions can occur, and there are different types, depending on geography, topography and weather conditions.
Strong gusts of wind, hail, higher rainfall and uncontrolled fires are manifestations and consequences of adverse weather conditions, similar to thunderstorms, tornadoes, sea trumpets and cyclones.
Weather phenomena of strong regional and seasonal intensity include storms, snow blizzards, ice storms and sandstorms.
Travelers are advised to inquire about adverse weather conditions affecting their area, as they may affect travel planning.
Anyone who plans to visit a country potentially regarded as a war zone must support professional training.
Searching on the Internet 'Course on hostile environments' is likely to find the address of a local company.
A course will normally deal with all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually using practical experience.
A course normally lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing games, as well as many first aid and sometimes weapons training activities.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in nature are widespread, while few publications deal with war zones.
Travelers planning surgery to change sex abroad must make sure that they have the valid documents for their return journey with them.
The intention of governments to issue passports with no indication of sex (X) or up-to-date documents to match a desired name and gender is variable.
Equally variable is the willingness of foreign governments to accept such documents.
Security inspection also became much more thorough in the post-September 11, 2001.
Transgender people in pre-operative phase should not expect to pass the controls without their privacy and dignity being affected.
Residual currents are formed by the return flow of waves breaking on the beach, often near a coral reef or similar formations.
Due to the underwater topology, the flow of return is concentrated in some deeper sections where a strong current towards the open sea can form.
Most deaths occur due to fatigue in an attempt to swim against the current, which may prove impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming will not be more difficult than normal.
Try to locate an area where you don't risk being trapped again, or consider whether to wait for help, based on your skills and whether you've been spotted.
The shock from return is manifested in a shorter time than the cultural shock (there being a smaller "honey moon" phase), it lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travellers who have found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it difficult to adapt to the culture of their country of origin.
Upon returning home after living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the uses of your culture of origin.
In the first experience abroad, it is likely to have met patient and understanding people, aware that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
Many people did not imagine patience and awareness to be necessary even for those returning home.
The spectacle of sounds and lights of the pyramid is the most interesting there is in the area for children.
Before the start of the show, you can admire the pyramids immersed in darkness and silence.
Normally you always hear the noise caused by tourists and sellers. The show of sounds and lights is just like a book of stories.
The Sphinx becomes the background and the narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected on the pyramids and each pyramid is illuminated.
Claimed by several countries, the southern Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have the largest number of bases, of which sixteen are active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island is the largest and is home to the town of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among the other islands are Livingston Island and Deception; in the latter, the caldera of a volcano still active filled with water from the origin of a magnificent natural port.
The land of Ellsworth is the region located south of the peninsula and overlooking the sea of Bellingshausen.
Here the peninsula mountains merge into the plateau, and then re-emerge and form the Ellsworth mountains, a 360 km chain cut in two by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part, known as the Sentinel Chain, boasts the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches 4892 m with Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone can be the only possible alternative.
A satellite phone does not usually constitute a substitute for the mobile phone, because to call you must be in the open air with the view clear up to the satellite.
The service is often used by pleasure boats, including pleasure boats, as well as by missions that need data and voice at a distance.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
One of the increasingly popular options among those who plan to take a sabbatical is to travel and learn.
It is particularly widespread among neodiplomates, since they can take a year before they start university without compromising their education.
In many cases enrolling in a course abroad in the sabbatical year can actually increase the chances of resuming higher education upon returning to their country of origin.
Usually enrolling in these educational programs requires the payment of a fee.
Finland is the ideal destination for those who love sailing. In the "Land of a thousand lakes" there are also thousands of islands, inside the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
It doesn't have to be a yacht for archipelagos and lakes.
Although coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are certainly large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is Finland's national pastime, where one boat is counted every seven or eight people.
This is also true in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in general it is a rather singular fact (e.g. in the Netherlands the ratio is one to forty).
Most of the different Baltic cruises include a multi-day stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that it is possible to visit the historic town for two whole days, returning to the ship in the evening to sleep.
For the descent to the ground you will not need a separate visa (starting in 2009) using the on-board excursions.
Some brochures also offer cruises to Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea, moreover the visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Travelling by plane can scare people of all ages and of any condition, especially if they have never flown before or have had any traumatic experience.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is not unlike the personal fears and aversions that many people manifest towards other things.
For some people, understanding a little about how planes work and what happens during a flight may prove useful to overcome a fear based on what is unknown, or about not having control.
The couriers are well paid to deliver products quickly. Often the timing is very important in the case of business documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repair.
For some routes larger companies use their own aircraft, but for other routes and in the case of smaller companies problems emerged.
On some routes, air shipments would take days for unloading and customs.
The only way to get him there faster would be to ship him as a hold baggage, and that's where you come in, since airline regulations don't allow you to ship luggage without a passenger.
To fly in first class or in business class the most obvious way is to pay a nice amount for the privilege (or, even better, convince your company to do so).
However, the price to be paid is high: approximately, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal business fare and up to eleven times the first-class fare!
In general, on direct flights from A to B it is not even worth looking for discounts on first class or business class seats.
Airlines know well that there is a category of travellers willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting quickly and comfortably to their destination, and consequently apply certain rates.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău and the local language is Romanian. However Russian is also widespread.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that in the past has been the scene of an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, endowed with its own government and its own currency, but not recognized by any UN member country.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations between these two areas of Moldova have been restored.
The predominant religion in Moldova is the Christian Orthodox religion.
Smyrna is Turkey's third largest city, with a population of about 3.7 million; it is the second largest port after Istanbul and an important crossroads for transport.
The ancient town of Smyrna is spread over a huge bay, is surrounded by mountains and is currently a modern, evolved and active shopping center.
Although the atmosphere of the city is more similar to that of Mediterranean Europe than that of traditional Turkey, the wide avenues, buildings with glass facades and modern shopping centres are dotted with characteristic red tile roofs, the 18th century market and ancient mosques and churches.
In the village of Haldarsvik you can enjoy beautiful views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and you can visit a unique octagonal church.

To the north is the romantic and charming city of Sintra, easily accessible. It has become famous in the eyes of foreigners thanks to the brilliant tale of its splendours written by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb 403 bus regularly connects to Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north, visit the great sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (place of worship), a place of Marian apparitions famous all over the world.
Remember that the site you are visiting is basically a common pit, and has almost incalculable meaning for an important part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who survive these places, and many others who have seen their loved ones murdered or had to work until death, whether Jewish or not.
Treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves. Avoid holocaust or Nazi jokes.
Avoid defacing these places by smearing the structures with marks or graffiti.
In the city of Barcelona the official languages are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half of the population prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority are able to understand it; Spanish is known by virtually everyone.
However, most signals are written exclusively in Catalan, which is by law the first official language.
Spanish, however, is also widely used for public transport and other services.
By metro, ordinary ads are only in Catalan. Any unscheduled service interruptions are communicated in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese, thanks to an automatic system.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude and presumptuous.
Although it is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to find yourself well in Paris continues to be to behave to the best, relating itself as a person "bien élevé" (well educated). This will definitely facilitate your movements.
The rough exterior appearance of the Parisians will fade quickly if you show off some basic good manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is rich in forests, mainly beeches, hedges and firs, and is characterized by a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to a variety of microclimates, soils and different altitude levels, it has a wide variety of plant communities.
The area also houses a wide variety of animal and bird species.
In these places live rare species such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wild cat and the cedar rooster, alongside several other more widespread animal species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide stoles for women who arrive unprepared, but if you already have one, especially if in bright colors, you will earn a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear long trousers under their knees.
These can also be borrowed from the warehouse at the entrance; however, the clothes are not washed after each user, so wearing these skirts you may not feel comfortable. For men, a size unique for everyone!
Maiorchina cuisine, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil everywhere.
Pa amb Oli is a simple popular dinner, typical of the summer season: bread with olive oil, tomato and all the sauces available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All the nouns, in addition to the pronoun "Sie" used for the courtesy form that stands for "She", always start with a capital, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important mechanism for distinguishing certain verbs and complements.
This aspect probably also facilitates reading, although the need to understand whether a verb or adjective is used in a noun form makes writing quite complex.
The Italian pronunciation is relatively simple since most words are pronounced as they are written.
The main letters to be careful are the c and the g, since their pronunciation changes according to the following vowel.
Also make sure to pronounce in a different way "r" and "rr": dear means beloved, while chariot means carriage.
Persian has a relatively simple and most often regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this basic grammar manual could help you a lot with Persian grammar and understanding of phrases.
It goes without saying that if you already know a romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, people with little knowledge of the Spanish language can come to the precipitous conclusion that Portuguese is quite similar and therefore should not be studied separately.
Premodern observers are usually obsolete nowadays and serve as museums or educational places.
Since bright pollution in their golden age was no problem as it is today, they are usually placed in cities or campuses, more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern telescopes intended for research are huge structures in remote areas where weather conditions are favorable.
The admiration of cherry blossoming, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept was native to China, where the flowering of the plums was preferred.
In Japan, the first festivals for cherry blossoming were organized by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy near the imperial court.
Plants give their best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even "only" one specimen.
If you visit an Italian garden, also collecting some specimens of plants will cost you the removal from this place, without discussion.
In general, Singapore is a very safe and easy city to turn around; you can buy virtually anything once you arrive.
But being in the "tropical highs", only a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with the heat (always) and the strong sun (more rarely, when the sky is clear).
Some buses also head north to Hebron, the traditional place where the patriarchs of the Bible Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives were buried.
Make sure that the bus you want to take reaches the interior of Hebron and does not stop at the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
The inland waterways can be an excellent theme around which to organize a holiday.
For example, you can visit the castles in the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley, you can take a cruise to visit the interesting cities of the Danube or you can navigate the Erie Canal.
In addition, they define the paths of hiking trails and well-known cycle paths.
Christmas is one of the most important feasts of Christianity and celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Most of the traditions related to this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
A tradition is to spend the night of Easter staying awake in an outdoor place to admire the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations underlying this tradition, but it could well be a pre-Christian ritual linked to spring and fertility.
In the more traditional Churches a Easter vigil is frequently celebrated on the Saturday night of the Easter weekend, with congregations often beginning the ceremony at the stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally came to the islands were swimming, flying or floating.
Since the distance from the continent was considerable, mammals could not face the journey. This caused the giant turtle to become the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
The Galapagos were introduced to numerous mammals such as goats, horses, cows, rats, dogs and cats after the arrival of the man.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic territories during the winter, you can experience the polar night when the sun remains below the horizon.
This phenomenon offers the opportunity to witness the Northern Lights, because the sky remains dark almost all day long.
Since the territories are sparsely populated, light pollution often does not pose a problem and you can also enjoy the stars.
In Japan, the culture of labor is more hierarchical and formal than that to which Westerners tend to be accustomed.
The office clothing is normally made up of jacket and tie or suit and is addressed to colleagues with their surname or professional title.
Harmony of the workplace is of crucial importance, since it places emphasis on the group's commitment rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often have to receive the approval of their superiors about each decision, and they are expected to adhere to the instructions without asking questions.
