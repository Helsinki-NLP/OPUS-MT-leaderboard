The Prague Stock Exchange at the close of the market had a negative collapse.
After the collapse of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange restored the losses.
Transactions in CEZ shares have reached almost half of current daily trade.
From the beginning of Tuesday, the Prague Stock Exchange resumed from the collapse of the day before it was almost 6%.
Behind this downfall is the collapse of stock on Wall Street.
So, too, we show a market reaction to the result of the House of Representatives voting in America, which refused to support the stabilisation plan for the local financial sector.
Stock collapse in Asia
On Tuesday, the stock of Asian Stock Exchanges experienced a dramatic collapse, although indices, however, later cancelled part of the losses during the day.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng Stock Exchange index cancelled almost 4% during the day, but later also part of the losses stabilized to 2.5%.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which follows the Chinese stock movement on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell by 3.8% while in Shanghai the markets were closed.
Stocks on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than 5%, but eventually losses stood at 4.3%.
The Thay-Wan Stock Exchange, according to the local index, fell by 3.6%.
"The planning of the rescue action is uncertain and this will affect financial markets around the world," noted Hong Kong's head of the Currencies office Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, despite being part of China, runs its own financial policy, so without depending on the Central Bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
American legislators, according to Australian premier Kevin Rudd, should quickly return to dialogue and approve the proposal for financial support.
Otherwise there is a risk that other countries will also suffer from the consequences.
U.S. action massacres
The American Parliament on Monday rejected the financial system's support plan, for which $700 billion was to be allocated (almost twelve billion Czech korunas).
The legislators have thus ignored President Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilise the entire economy.
The American actions on Monday experienced a massacre and the main indices of the actions have recorded the biggest collapse for over twenty years.
The Dow Jones index fell by almost 7% and a similar size collapse was observed the last time in 1987.
The index was down before the vote, but as soon as the bill was not approved, it fell free.
Congress has yielded: the US government can hand out $700 billion to banks.
The highest representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of an understanding of economic support for the American financial system.
The vote on this will be at the beginning of next week.
American lawmakers broke the ice in the dialogue on approving the rescue plan in the form of economic aid to the American financial system for a total of $700 million (almost twelve billion crowns).
But it's not said yet.
The representatives of the Congress, therefore, must define some details of the understanding before publishing the definitive form of the law and voting on it.
The financial system support plan will be discussed Monday on the territory of the House of Representatives.
Sunday he told Reuters agency, the chairman of Barney Frank's banking and financial services committee.
In the Senate, according to some sources, you could vote on the plan probably not before Monday.
According to the economists, the announcement that the approval of the financial plan will take place should be the first and fundamental psychological factor that can awaken the financial markets.
But then we will have a return to reality because of the complexity of the mechanisms by which, in practice, market aid is achieved.
Paulson: The Plan must be effective
"We've taken a big step forward".
"We have clarified our different views on the form of the presentation of the market stabilisation package," said Democrat Nancy Pelosi to the Bloomberg agency.
According to the same, the final vote could still take place on Sunday.
The legislators' delegates met the night between Saturday and Sunday with American finance minister Henry Paulson, to give final form to the government's financial funds.
These funds should be used to acquire non-transferable mortgage assets from financial companies, which lead financial companies to serious losses and jeopardise the stability of the whole system.
"We are at the end of the final agreement of the plan that will work and that must also be effective in the market".
"It is still necessary to carry out the rehabilitation plan, but I think we are there," said Paulson.
The Signal for Asian Trade
The global financial crisis falls heavily on the stock markets that are rapidly collapsing.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, legislators are thus trying to reach a definitive agreement in Congress even before Sunday.
In other words, they want to calm investors before trading in Asian financial markets, which are, in order of time, the first to influence Monday's market following the decision of the Congress.
But for now it is definitely not clear when the two chambers of the American Congress will vote for the law and even if the negotiations can be stopped at the last moment on some problem.
The legislators hope that it will be approved in the next few days.
But the law will still undergo many changes.
The total expected amount of support for the system must be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion must be available as soon as possible as President George Bush has requested.
But Congress can block the allocation of the remainder of the sum if it has the impression that the program does not perform its function, blocking the next $100 billion and after the 350 finals.
Bush appreciated progress in negotiations.
Although the President may veto this decision, Congress may overpower its right of veto.
Despite these changes, the basic thought of the program has remained, namely to get the finances to buy passive mortgage values, whose price has collapsed due to hundreds of thousands of Americans who are unable to pay their mortgages.
"We've worked it out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on Sunday law and the Senate Monday," as the Republican Senator mentioned.
American President Bush is also satisfied with the progress made in the negotiations.
His spokesperson Tony Fratto stated that Bush is satisfied with Saturday's positive trend and appreciates "the effort of both parties to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy".
Restriction of golden parachutes
Senator Christopher Dodd's chairman of the banking committee, the main spokesman, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial programme, the protection of taxpayers against losses, the closure of the budget of reductions, the splitting of the financial plan.
The new law must also limit the so-called golden parachutes for the managers of the companies participating in the programme and is creating a committee that will monitor the funds.
These should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard and we have made a big step towards the agreement that will work and will be useful for the market and also for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan relies on helping homeowners with payment problems.
The government should negotiate the new mortgage instalments it will buy with the aim of lowering monthly expenses on the instalments for debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: psychological support
The plan proposed is, according to the main economist of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea but its realization will be very difficult.
"And that's because we don't know how and for what price the problematic assets will be bought
This will be crucial for how losses will be split between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week for the iHNed.cz site.
If the plan is approved now or at the beginning of next week it is not, according to Marek, so fundamental.
"Much more important, it is that already this week Congress representatives find an agreement on the support of this plan and that they baptize it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of this agreement that will be approved is more important at this time," stressed Marek.
Last-Blood Duel: MP3 players against cell phones
We will recommend how to choose
While almost every mobile phone can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can phone.
From this it is clear that it is best to buy only the phone.
Nevertheless, there are many reasons why we can obtain an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the way of use and the needs of the future owner.
Perhaps you would hardly buy yourself an expensive high-quality turntable to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
First of all, these musical products do not come out as LPs and from a qualitative point of view there is not even an objective reason for this.
However, if vinyls of hard-rock, jazz or blues probably flock to your shelves, a turntable like this at the very least you dream of it.
It also works with portable music, i.e. compressed music or simply in MP3 format.
Here, too, there are price and quality categories.
For some, it may be unacceptable to spend 8 thousand crowns on a reader, as a Pink Floyd fan perhaps hardly digests the twenty crown headphones of the market.
Two extremes among which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The battery life is the decision.
Some high-quality music players can do much more than just read music, but they don't even do cell phones by accident.
There is no other device as universal as the cell phone.
Next to the primary functions, phone and text, you can read music and videos, record both and have a camera, sometimes better sometimes worse and maybe even surf.
And if we consider smartphones and handhelds you will also have a miniature computer in your pocket.
It is a small miracle that no refrigerator can make the grill and no television can photograph anything.
The universality of the cell phone also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile phone and the sooner the indicator on the screen will require the charger.
And reading music consumes a lot of energy.
Few cell phones can read music for more than twelve hours, usually, and much less.
In this sense music players (especially the simplest ones) are much more effective.
As far as cheap phones are concerned, do not count that they can last for more than a few hours.
If you still add to it, from time to time, some calls, get another charger at work for safety, this also applies to the most expensive devices.
But you won't have this problem with an MP3 player, even the worst ones last at least 9 hours to continuous functionality with a charging.
A further problem exists when you download music into your mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices has the universal USB port and not all of them can be connected to the computer without special software.
Of course the music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few memory players are able to do it without adapter for minicards that are not used in mobile phones.
Readers, except for some exceptions (Ipod) do not need any special software.
Just fill the device with music via USB from the computer.
Most mobile phones and readers create themselves a multimedia library ordered according to the names of the performers, album name, genre or user classification.
Some devices only reproduce the folder tree structure, similar to the Explorer tool in Windows, and some know how to do both things (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobile phones can do more.
When you choose a particular device you are especially interested in battery resistance, memory capacity, quality and type of audio outputs and clearly in ease of use.
If you need music especially from the background and if you listen to it every day only briefly on the tram you just need any mobile phone that reads MP3.
This now succeeds, clearly at any cell phone.
You don't have to worry too much about which formats your mobile phone or reader recognizes.
MP3 players support them all, the global majority of the music that comes to you will be in this format.
In addition to this format that belongs to the most popular, the total majority of devices support music in WMA format.
There is less AAC (format used by Apple and its Ipods).
The best mobile phones also allow, for example, to buy music online.
Just visit, through the mobile internet, the corresponding pages of the operator (or another provider) and buy the song or album.
This same service could already be a valid argument for buying a mobile-reader.
Unfortunately, the operators' offer is poor and is usually limited only to the hits of the moment of the radio.
The prices are not so low.
But it is generally assumed that this way of selling music (either via GSM, the internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their phones behind them.
Anyone who wants to listen to a little something rummages in their pocket while the MP3 player remains forgotten at home.
But it also depends on this, whether you always carry behind the headphones or at least the wireless earpiece.
If not, you can use the built-in player that almost every cell phone, but only a small portion of MP3 players, has.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of mobile-readers will be, for many, the price.
The cheaper ones normally cost less than 3,000 crowns.
For 3 and 4 thousand crowns you will already buy a very dignified walkman.
Usually, however, you will be limited by the absence of an input for common headphones.
The best and most technically equipped mobile phones and also with a 3.5 mm socket for common headphones, cost up to 15,000 crowns.
Instead, the reader’s advantage is, in addition to others, easy handling.
The simplest ones are not necessarily cheaper (see our choice) really anyone can handle them.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of manoeuvrability once with the common stereo or perhaps the turntable, is obvious.
There is no danger of accidentally hitting the startup of the mobile internet network and consequently of a giant bill for data transmission.
Which device to take
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have an exchangeable memory card slot (M2, microSD, etc.).
Also with regard to the purchase of the respective card, it falls within the 2 000 crowns.
But be careful.
The basic models only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones can cope with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy an inexpensive MP3 player, take Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are a member of the most demanding listeners, preferably take specialized mobile phones - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices feature individual MP3 keys and the convenience of the service thus approaching the same MP3 player.
In this area it has made more progress Sony Ericsson, which phones of the walkman line have the same scale of use as MP3 players sold separately.
The MP3 players of the above mentioned brands assure you the same service and price category up to 4 000 crowns, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery strength (commonly 15 hours, in principle up to 35 hours).
The first virtual operator will reach the Czech Republic as early as this year.
Maybe.
Perhaps the mobile market in the Czech Republic is mature enough and our operators offer virtually all services like their partners in Western Europe.
However, something is missing here – a virtual operator who forces traditional ones to lower the price.
Maybe he won't be missing for a long time.
Of the fact that Czech operators belong to the most expensive in Europe, we have already written many times on Mobil.cz.
At the end of the day, ČTÚ also confirmed it, which pointed out that the price of SMS is higher than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regularisation of roaming charges, perhaps a paradoxical situation will arise - for some customers of Czech mobile operators SMS will cost less from abroad than at home.
How can prices in the Czech Republic be kept so high in relation to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that would really like to start the fight.
Maybe it sounds crazy, even here we have three mobile networks and coverage highly above 100%.
On the other hand, mobile telophony operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this sense, the head of the Czech Telecommunications Council (ČTÚ) too, Pavel Dvoźk, who in the past has sometimes expressed that there is no room for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is perhaps true that the traditional operator with his own network does not have many possibilities anymore. (It would be difficult to find other frequencies).
But there is still another possibility - the virtual operator.
It was precisely the entry into the market of virtual operators that led to a considerable drop in prices, to which traditional operators would have to react.
At the same time even before the entry of sharks such as Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile into the market, similar voices sounded in Britain as we did.
It has been shown, however, that the place for such operators is there and that they can be really successful.
At the end of the day, for example, we must not go very far.
In February of this year we informed you of the arrival of the Virtual Operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year this operator managed to win more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest local operator.
At the same time, behind Mobilking lies the Penta financial group to which U:fon belongs in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on a much more concrete target group.
In order to be able to actually work, it is enough for him, that is, many fewer customers than for a traditional operator.
They do not carry, i.e., relatively high expenses for the creation, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
Thus in the world virtual operators usually present themselves at low cost, offer calls and SMS at low prices, which is often in balance with the offer of the most restricted services
For example, Tesco Mobile in Britain offers SMS that costs at least half of its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, the bet on a target group can also be quite a good move.
This operator specifically points to men, so to speak.
"True men choose Mobilking operator they like and can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company that produces this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether we can affirm a similar concept as in Poland.
The press spokesman for Vodafone Miroslav Čepický doubted it: "The Czech market is relatively small for a fragmented approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, from the point of view of services it is relatively saturated."
In the Czech Republic no possibilities, say mobile network operators
But it seems almost certain that if there is ever an operator in the Czech Republic, Mobilking will not be.
"There is talk of the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic negotiations do not have much expectations.
The ignition of Mobilking will take place rather in the other countries of our area," said in a telephone dialogue for Mobile.cz Jana Studničková, the press spokesman for the Penta financial group.
Thus it has indirectly confirmed that current operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not very supportive of this view.
Rather, they try to do everything so that no potential competitor is created.
For some time now it has not hidden its interest in starting a virtual operator, the GTS Novera group that would like to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónika O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed services but also mobile telecommunications.
And the sooner the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
We have already managed to advance in the negotiations with some of them," says the spokesman for the Pavel Kaidl group.
So maybe better times will come.
Unofficial information shows that the first virtual operator may have to have it by the end of the year.
For now, however, there is an impenetrable wall of silence around its creation.
"At the moment, we do not believe that there is room in the Czech market for the creation of a full-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very specific.
Until now no subject with a complex and serious project has addressed us," he mentioned in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň of the Telefònika O2 press section.
The Czech market is also characterised by other operators.
T-Mobil press spokesman Martina Kemrová adds in a rare agreement with the O2 statement: "For now we have not noticed any viable and beneficial commercial projects for both of us, on which it is possible to continue building".
He adds: "In the T-Mobil network, a virtual operator will hardly appear by the end of the year.
At this moment we have already had to have a concrete agreement on the table, so that it could be considered on the horizon."
Vodafone focuses its attention rather on reaching its 3G license requests.
Miroslav Čepický adds: "We are open to the negotiations of potential virtual operators, especially in the context of sharing expenses and infrastructure.
Let us consider this, from the point of view of the customers, the most productive.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a common fast mobile internet network."
Competent authorities - with accomplices
The attitude of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to lower prices and thereby lower profits.
Why then facilitate the rise of such a competitor?
The nuisances around creation U:fon testify that when operators care about one thing they can row on the same side.
Perhaps the great pressure pressed against ČTÚ during the period of creation of U:fon towards the company of T-Mobile.
This is evidence of public access information from ČTÚ's web pages.
But right now, U:fon serves as an argument for not accepting the virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová noted: "The competition environment of the mobile market has been only a short while further enhanced with the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
With regard to the type of mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entry of another competitor would place high demands on him and especially on his services."
However, the complete disinterest of the Czech regulatory bodies in the attitude of mobile operators is quite surprising.
It is not just the attitude of the ČTÚ, which unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike Britain and other developed countries - has no competence to interfere in economic competition.
That belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
This, however, has taken its typical position on the whole issue.
"The entry of the virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible after the conclusion of the contract for the rental of the necessary infrastructure between the mobile operator and the virtual operator had materialized.
No such contract has been concluded so far because the offer of potential buyers has probably not been interesting enough for traditional operators," said Kristián Chalupa, of the ÚOHS external relations section, in response to our question.
Such a statement by the representatives of the operators may not surprise us.
On the other hand, the office which must defend the interests of consumers and, above all, take care that no one takes advantage of its position on the market is more than a delicate business.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Foreignly where virtual operators commonly work, we can see that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile services."
But obviously the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the lowering of prices do not belong to the interests of ÚOHS.
Truly shocking throughout the situation is the almost exciting harmony of these three operators resulting from their reactions.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence arises on its own.
Just as the identical price of petrol for all petrol stations is undoubtedly the result of coincidence and competitive struggle.
"The section found no evidence of anti-competitive behaviour regarding this fact and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
No operator has a dominant position, so it does not have a corresponding greater responsibility for its conduct on the market.
The necessary tools for opening up the mobile network market for virtual operators may also be lacking telecommunications regulator," Chalupa mentioned in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications is the only market from the point of view of economic competition.
On such a market, of course, no Czech operator has a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer another approach - for the creation of a virtual operator the agreement of the network operator is always necessary.
And the mobile operator has – at the end of the day logically – the monopoly of its network.
So for a certain portion it has to be dominant.
But even if we did not accept this argument, it should be a minimum warning for ÚOHS that three mobile operators should proceed in such a strangely similar way.
At the same time, complaints from interested parties (including the GTS Novera company mentioned above) show that there are very similar obstacles to trade with all operators.
Downloading responsibility to ČTÚ in telecommunications is a fairly frequent trick with which ÚOHS keeps itself out of the whole matter.
We have already seen this in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it has not been possible to promote the expansion of ČTÚ's rights in the field of economic competition in telecommunications until the recently adopted telecommunications law was updated, despite the fact that many experts expected the situation to improve.
The representatives of ÚOHS must know this more than well, but perhaps their interests are elsewhere.
It can be done when no one looks.
While we do not see how these pseudo-virtual operators work, some of them even exist in Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that publish their own price lists of mobile services but are only partially public.
Usually these are the companies that deal with multilevel marketing.
So for example Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their mobile services.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only pre-established people.
The magic lies in the fact that the company towards the operator is a classic company customer, who orders a large amount of SIM card.
As an important customer then receives special price offers (and more).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar pre-sales.
"If the cases you are talking about, about which we will be interested, could be a breach of contractual conditions, and could lead to the conclusion of cooperation with this company," Martina Kemrová answered.
But it is rather unlikely that such an activity would not reach the ears of those responsible for mobile telephone operators.
Especially in the cases of the three companies mentioned, it can be thousands of customers.
No operator at the same time defends itself from such an attitude.
In other words, the business of these companies derives a not indifferent profit and at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - they are not damaged in any way with their official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns about possible problems: "The law allows such speculation, however only a small percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
They also have to accept that the SIM card in their phone is not registered in their name, so they cannot dispose in full of it as the usual customers of mobile telephone operators "
But this should be a bit strange at ČTÚ.
In addition, another issue opens up for ÚOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to such an attitude, why do they block the creation of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that ÚOHS has strong enough rights to expose similar activities and if it does not want to be satisfied with the explanation of the operators who have no idea of all this and that their commercial conditions forbid it.
When we're no longer expensive
As has already been said several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has led to a significant drop in prices for services.
At the same time, in virtually all countries where operators were born, traditional operators tried more or less to prevent their creation.
The arguments they used were practically identical - too small a market, too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
But in developed countries, in these cases, the regulatory bodies have intervened to defend not mobile operators but their customers.
Both with the formal measures and with the non-formal pressure, then the creation of the first virtual operator was reached and others were agreed to him.
Unfortunately, Czech regulatory bodies launch from one to the other the whole case like a hot potato.
From our experience we cannot get rid of the feeling that the lack of clarity of skills in these cases makes it more than convenient.
But let's not throw in the towel.
If the background information is right and the virtual operator will really appear to us soon, the Czech mobile market will start again.
If one of the operators had agreed to the creation of a virtual mobile operator, ÚOHS could hardly remain impassive of the refusal (discrimination) of the other interested parties.
And perhaps we will stop calling at higher prices than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented in a solemn manner the new recordings of the national anthem "Kde domov můj".
The new recording of the anthem was made by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available – solo with male or female vocals, chorus pitch and instrumental edition.
The song is under the direction of Kateřina Knūnková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the revisions of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krček.
On iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymns.
Already before he said on the radio "Český rozhlas" that he chose specifically to sing solo variants, the singers with the most representative young voices, who are expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I tried to take care that both and even the choir, have the clear diction, that the text is well understood, that they are in harmony," he reported.
Then the national anthem will celebrate next year's 175th anniversary.
The song "Kde domov můj" was first played in 1834 on the stage of the Stavovskéh divadlo in Josef Kajetán Tyl's original Fidlovačka opera accompanied by the music of František Škroupa.
It gained popularity and people spontaneously made it theirs.
The first stanza of the song after the founding of the Czechoslavakia of 1918 then became the natural part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the birth of the autonomous Czech Republic.
How the "new" hymn sounds
On Wednesday MHD Prague will accompany you for the first time also with an electronic card
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be written in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date on which in the metro, tramway and bus will climb the first passengers who instead of the paper ticket will have in their pocket an electronic card.
At the moment they can get about one hundred thousand people who own their Opencard card.
Passengers can buy the 30- and 90-day and annual one (which will be valid from January 1, 2009) and at the same time be charged their card in the Infopoints and offices of the Transport Company and at Muzeum metro station, Můstek, Nádraź Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
You can buy coupons from yesterday on the Internet at the page of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred customers took advantage of the service before the afternoon.
Those who start using the internet service can completely forget the counters at metro stops where they had to make long lines for paper tickets so far.
The coupon is purchased via the internet and on the Opencard they recharge it on one of the twelve branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places passengers have at their disposal a desk with trained staff that will help those interested in the purchase on the internet and will also record on their card the credit acquired," said project spokesperson Martin Opatrný.
In addition to libraries it will be possible to load electronic coupons on the Opencards in ATMs and self-service which are installed at the entrances of the metro.
How are these ATMs?
They are red, resemble ticket obliterators and passengers have already noticed them at Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská metro stations.
"There are now five throughout the city but by the end of the year there should be eighty," concluded Opatrný.
The coupon will be checked instead of by the driver by the ATM.
The ATM service that will run from tomorrow is very simple.
Just enter the Opencard card and after payment of the coupon, it will charge on top.
The electronic cards are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, in the urban lines of trains and buses from the number 300 to 499, which the inhabitants of the municipalities of Central Bohemia take to reach the capital.
"In added trains in Prague's integrated transport there are controllers equipped with card readers with whom they verify the temporal and zonal validity," explained Filip ticket control mode by the Ropid organisation, which develops the timetables for Prague's collective transport.
Urban buses have card readers integrated into the driver’s cash register.
During the ascent it is therefore necessary not only to show the magnetic card to the driver, but also to place the Opencard at the fixed point next to the cash register.
Thus the driver checks the validity of the coupons loaded.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the loaded coupons, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this kind of information," Drápal added.
Passengers who take urban buses and do not remember, when the coupon expires, can go back to the self-service ATMs, where the coupons are loaded on paper.
Here you will see information on the validity of their documents on the device screen.
The Sudetian Germans wanted a referendum from the USA
The Sudetian Germans in 1945 asked to include Šumava in the United States.
This results from the letter deposited in the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States.
With this wish, according to what is said, some groups of Sudetian Germans turned in 1945 to the President of the United States.
This results more than anything from the letter kept in a private archive and now deposited in the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans of Český Krumlov ask in the letter to the American President not to allow the return of the "Šumava district" – occupied by Hitler under the Munich agreement – to Czechoslovakia again.
"We understand the situation and want to be sure of the promises that American units will arrive in German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," we write in the letter signed with the words "People who care about the destiny of Šumava with all their heart".
Because, they say, the annexation to Czechoslovakia – knowing the Czech national character – gives the Germans of the South only hope for brutality, lack of regard, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter pray to the American president to take over the protetorate on Šumava now and always.
"We cannot believe that without regard for the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you would recognize this territory as a foreign state, which oppresses and uproots ethnic minorities and has not contributed at all, at all, to the Allies' victory," says the letter.
The reason why authors cannot sign it is the alleged fear of the thirst for revenge by the "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States were to doubt the belief of the Germans in Šumava , it would be enough to organize a referendum in the district on the will of its inhabitants to become part of the United States or to live under the control of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem naive with our knowledge of the post-war history, some witnesses say it appropriately describes the expectations then of the Germans of the Sudetians.
Although the Czech Germans had to at least sense that it was going to be their move from the republic, only a few of them fully admitted such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the peoples of the Sudetians.
Others believed that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
He was mobilized during the war as a German of Budějovice in the maritime power of the Baltic Sea.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the British and placed in the prison camp in Holštýn, the dozens of other Czech Germans went to find him so that he would teach him the Czech.
"These believed that once they got home the Czech would be good for him," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners, living in Czechoslovakia pima of the war, according to him relied on the fact that on the basis of Beneš decrees they would be moved from the Republic.
You don't think you'll pay!
Emotional campaign will attack drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
Even so one could define the emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport intends to start Wednesday.
The office of Minister Aleš Ḥebźek, expects this to discourage drivers from dangerous behaviour at the wheel.
The 150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, the internet but also on leaflets.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and under the influence of alcohol at the wheel.
And remind him to put his belt on before he leaves.
He wants to touch in consciousness especially young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and not last professional drivers.
What is it that will appear in the commercials?
Especially people's stories that will affect emotions.
And this also bears witness to the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't think you'll pay!
The word "do not think" is capitalized on the plate.
And in a pool of blood there's the word "pay."
This must symbolize that a person can in a moment of distraction pay with his or her life.
The commercials "will scare" viewers until 2010.
The Ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where images with drastic scenes of the victims of accidents can commonly be seen.
This is how it promises to lower the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The commercials were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Carrot and stick to drivers
"The carrot and stick system works with drivers.
The carrot for them is, for example, when they pass with red and thus save time.
The stick is the danger of the fine or the accident.
You have to remember the risk to drivers, " says the psychologist of the Ministry of Transport Martin Koãn of the Na Homolce hospital.
And so it takes information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising, the psychologist believes.
According to him, the panels that warn drivers of the danger are already less effective.
"If the fixed panel that warns of danger has been installed, it will probably soon be confused with the environment and drivers will no longer pay attention to it," warns Koãn.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
Israeli provisional government premier Ehud Olmert spoke for the return of virtually all the occupied territories in 1967, i.e. the borders of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan highlands, in exchange for peace between Palestinians and Syrians.
So he said in the dialogue he published Monday, the daily Jediot Achronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that we will have to return almost all the areas (occupied), if not all," Olmert told the daily newspaper.
"We will keep a certain percentage of these territories but to the Palestinians we will have to leave the same percentage (of the Israeli areas), because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that the eventual return will also include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and above all does not want the bulldozers or the levelers to pass on him, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in the mention of the two July attacks in the city, during which some people were killed and dozens of people injured.
According to the premier it will be necessary to find "a particular solution for the Temple Mountain, the sacred and historical places," which are inside the Old City. .
"He who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270 000 Arabs.
This will not work," he also stressed.
The retirement from the Golan highlands
Olmert has also spoken about Israel's withdrawal from the heights of Golan, that is to say, the indispensable condition for concluding this peaceful agreement with Syria.
But this would also require some effort from Damascus.
"I do not propose the conclusion of peace with Syria solely on the basis of withdrawal from Golan," he warned.
"Syrians know what they will have to give up to get Golan's heights.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with the Hezbollah (movement of the Shiites); they will have to give up their permanent support, which they offer to Hamas’ terrorism, (movement of the Shiites) of Al-Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the holy war) in Iraq," the premier said.
Questions After the Accident: Are stewards illegal in buses?
The law doesn’t recognize them, you can’t walk on the long - distance bus
In the context of the tragic accident near the Italian city of Padua of the bus company Student Agency came out the question whether stewards and passengers can move on board the bus during the ride.
"If we want to comply strictly and formally with the laws, the steward's activity is in conflict with the road traffic law," said transport ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
Last week’s accident in which a 22 - year - old stewardess lost her life was caused by a truck that cut the bus off.
The girl was unfortunately sitting next to the driver on the less secure place of the bus, despite the fact that there were still two more seats assigned.
But the bus can make an accident or brake abruptly even at the time of distribution of the coffee or newspapers.
It depends on whether or not the bus is equipped with standing seats according to the registration book.
If it is not approved, passengers shall sit.
Student Agency buses have no seats, the director of Radim Jančura company confirmed this at Aktuáln.cz.
"We evaluated this with the Ministry and at the beginning it did not allow the movement of passengers on the bus.
It was later revoked and we concluded that passengers can use the bathroom during the ride if they have the seat assigned," he expressed his point of view.
The law doesn't recognize the steward.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the steward's role – no law deals with the regularization of this role."
However, no regulation prohibits the transporter from carrying out the services.
The road traffic law only recognizes the driving term of the vehicle, its rights and duties are not defined," Hanzelka said less clearly.
The director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný instead believes, that the law enough cures this problem.
It depends on whether the bus has the approved standing seats.
That's all," he says.
Categorizes buses in urban areas where there are standing places and maximum limited speed, interurbans with standing places with higher and longer-run maximum speed without standing places with the highest permitted speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
As on the plane, says the expert.
The BESIP expert on road safety Jaroslav Hořín does not find the underlying problem in the movement of stewards on board the bus.
"During a quiet ride there are not so many dangers, the situation can be compared to air service.
Even there it is not safe when a turbulence arrives and the flight attendant can bang his head."
"If the bus makes a sharp brake, of course, the laws of physics apply.
Just like in the city bus or on the tram.
The carrier company must resolve the safety of stewards with an internal regulation," he says and also intends that, from the point of view of the law, the problem is not resolved.
Jančura is willing to suspend services.
Student Agency is the only transport company offering steward services..
This takes about two hundred of them.
Even after the accident, the director feels that their job is dangerous.
"As soon as I feel like I have to consider the steward's profession as a dangerous job, I will abolish it.
Passengers can receive coffee and newspapers on their way up.
It would also reduce expenses," he says.
The director of Asiana Alexej Litvin, who manages a fraction of lines compared to Student Agency, motivated the absence of stewards on his means as an interest in security.
"We don't have hostesses, we're already opposed from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end with a fatal accident," said less than a year ago Týden.cz.
An immense tragedy has happened.
In the incident of the line for Naples a young hostess from the Plzeň region died, who had worked for the company for two years.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency lane without using the arrow and blocked the road to the bus.
The coach driver tried to avoid it with a sharp maneuver, but bumped it with the right front.
Jančura rejects the fact that the two places reserved for the rest of the stewarts had been occupied.
"It is not possible to reserve these seats in long-distance buses, they are untenable."
The company plans to report the truck driver.
The agency will not wait for the Court’s ruling to pay damages to the girl’s family, but expects financial compensation from the offender.
The revision of the law?
Not in sight
The revision of the law, on which a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport have been working for more than a year, could lead to a clarification of the movement of the stewarts on board buses.
"They did not achieve any concrete results, however.
They don’t consider buses much, they deal more with the scoring system, maximum speed on the highway and mobile phone use while driving," says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not regard the activity of Stewarts as a major threat to passenger safety," concludes spokesperson Havelka, that bus safety control is the responsibility of police and security offices.
Düsseldorf's hopes are focused on Frankfurt
There is no shortage of words in the letter from the WestLB director addressed to the employees of the house.
In the letter published on Monday, which could form "the capital market centre of the savings banks' financial group" through the unit meeting of the Düsseldorf banking institution with the Deka-Bank in Frankfurt.
West LB would launch "a competent block" with lasting profits in such an enterprise.
Moreover, such a union could be a decisive boost for further links in the Länder banking sector.
So it is read, when a board of directors in difficult times wants to demonstrate the ability to act.
Because WestLB is still under strong pressure.
Not only by the EU Commission, but also through the National Authority for Financial Supervision, having pointed out long ago to the regional government of North Rhine-Westphalia that time is pressing for a future solution.
The links between the Deka-Bank, which the same customers of the Saving Banks because of their investment funds already know, and the WestLB certainly has been talking about it for quite a while, even from Frankfurt.
In late August, the head of Deka-Bank Franz Waas reported at the time of the presentation of the turnover of the first half of the year that a merger of the house near Mainz street with a national bank such as Helaba or West LB makes no sense.
However, the board of directors of Deka, which is half carried by regional banks and savings bank consortia, delegated the board of directors to conduct talks with West LB on joint negotiations.
It could be market negotiations or parts of them.
However, conversations have, as they say in the square of business, just begun.
Of the Deka-Bank, with its 3000 employees it is one of the ones that count most in the square of the business in Frankfurt, it is not the first time when it comes to consolidating the sector of the savings banks.
In 2003 for a short time it seemed that Deka-Bank could merge with the Rhineland-Palatinate regional bank and Helaba.
Nothing was done about this three-way association.
As soon as the projects were published, the regional bank of Hesse was opposed to Helaba's participation.
The remaining two institutions have also proved unable to reach an agreement.
The Rhineland-Palatinate regional bank went instead to the Baden-Württemberg regional bank in Stuttgart.
Yet they have always thought about it for a merger of Deka-Bank with regional banks.
But in the end Günther Merl , president of the Helaba Board, spoke against design games to meet with his home.
Apart from this, it seems that cognition is created, that the different houses in the public sector need to be brought closer together.
As the election of the Bavarian Parliament has passed, a meeting of the Bavarian Landesbank with that of Baden-Württemberg could first take place.
It's not entirely good news for Helaba.
If the pressure increases for other mergers, the partners will gradually be missing.
In the South there would now be the junior partner, although so far it has overcome the financial crisis much better than the homes in Munich and Stuttgart.
The association of the Hessen-Turingian savings banks that participates with 85 percent of Helaba, has put the bolt to the meeting with WestLB.
Only NordLB would remain
These geo-strategic reasonings are just one thing.
On the other hand, there is also the question of how you match the different business models of individual homes.
In June Merl pointed out that the decisive question, with which business model the future of regional banks would be assured, would not yet be answered by the association of German savings banks.
In the end, the West LB division could also come out, which by that of course is not desired.
Thus the letter of the Board of Directors expresses the will to aspire in any case to a "general solution".
You will see how the single parts reuniting with the Deka-Bank will work.
THE second weekend of the beer festival is dedicated to Italians
For Elena it is the first time while for Luca it is the third or the fourth.
This time Elena is present at the party as a companion, and so she says everything is different.
Behind them next to the 5l. barrel of the Kaiser brand stands a massive bearded and shows the about 200 travelers what are the deep tones it manages to produce from the throat.
Elena first gives Luca a pat and after a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here to the bus parking lot next to Porta Nuova station, four couriers leave this evening with destination Monaco, Beer Festival, scheduled arrival at 6.30 pm.
Three couriers are especially reserved for Italians, in another they travel only Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking lot the South Americans are singing with the flag in their hands, having already celebrated during the night.
It is so noisy, Marco says, that it is not for Italians.
Marco wearing a long coat with false fur lining and a pair of glasses with silvery broad slats belong to the buses.
For 5 years they have been going to Oktoberfest, this year they are 3 tours.
The night shift, daytime at the party, I'll be back at 10:30.
To spend the night would only create unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The cost of 45 Euro includes the trip, the welcome of the toast with Kaiser beer, made according to Bavarian genuineness standards, the sickness fund and the German guide – Marco attended a German course in Frankfurt.
And so at night the buses leave for the Brenner.
There's no beer yet.
Suddenly the silence falls in the bus, the travelers sleep.
Better this way, they'll still need their strength.
They stop at Bressanone and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian plates on the A9 motorway before Munich take a short break.
When, as expected, Marco's group arrives at 6.30 am at the parking lot near Theresienwiese, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others group together, Marco explains for the last time the attack program.
First, put on the yellow hat.
On it on the left there is written "Oktoberfest" next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency: "Known viaggiaggiando.it".
Second: "When they open the doors of the beer tent it means running!", he quotes Marco early in the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats at the bottom of the tent.
"Not in front, or else we block, and not all the yellow caps sitting on the same benches, split into the adjacent space!"
The mug costs 8.25 Euro, Marco screams.
And don't forget to tip.
"Prove to the security service, that we behave well!
As soon as you leave the seats, they disappear!"
Third: "This evening at 10.30 p.m. we meet here again! Understand?"
We're already going to the party.
On the street one attacks as you follow away the yellow caps to the trees, to the road signs and even to a billboard of a large Bavarian popular party.
You want to be ready to beat the retreat.
It's the second weekend of the party, known as the "Italians' weekend".
Exact data do not exist, we speak of 50 thousand, who leave to cross the Alps and invade the tents, it is claimed that 10% of visitors come specifically from Italy.
The police in Munich are strengthened with 7 agents from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian red cross, which makes a statistics on nationalities, where the Italians are in first place with 200 medical treatments in front of the British (about 60 medical treatments) and the Austrians (about 80).
Especially loved by the Italians is the tent of the Hofbräuhaus.
1. Sleepless nights for the creditors of the Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, said Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück last week.
It is good that the politician used the word "relative" and also mentioned, that the German banking sector is not spared from critical developments.
Because the crisis started on the weekend.
The real estate financier Hypo Real Estate, noted in the DAX, obtains from a consortium of German banks a billionaire credit, in order to protect himself from turbulence on the markets.
An experienced person told Reuters on Monday, support credits would reach up to 35 billion Euros.
Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest for the requested part.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
After all, Depfa's affiliate's losses.
The state financier according to a newspaper article has been refinanced in the very short term – which is no longer possible due to the distrust of the markets.
By the first half of 2008, the bank's reserves had fallen by 95% to EUR 2.37 million, the share of equity also sold from 1.6 to 1.45.
Net current income and income from financial affairs had fallen to 0 compared with last year, profits from both demand increases and certain shares as well as the liquidation of provisions in receivables have fallen by more than 70% over the 5 million euro.
Only thanks to higher income from the return of subordinated compensation costs that come both from the restructuring of the former Depfa group and from the repayment of interest according to the single text of tax laws and from the management of business for business consortia, the negative profit was fairly moderate with about 16%.
The former public financier after being privatized in 1990 had lost himself in speculation with commercial real estate credits, which were dissociated into the Aareal Bank.
Given that the income in the traditional state funding was too low, Depfa has been more committed to infrastructure projects and to the financing of joint projects by private and state investors (PPPs) and has diversified internationally.
Hypo Real Estate must now depreciate the value of the affiliate, which will have a fundamental material effect on the group's profit and loss account.
The fact is that dividends have been cancelled.
By 2007, they had already been reduced by 2/3.
The Hypo Real Estate after the absorption of the Depfa is an important financier of the state and infrastructure.
It is more dependent than refinancing on the market between banks compared with other institutions, because it does not have customer trust deposits.
Due to the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago the granting of credits between banks largely dried up, because banks accumulate liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate annually needs the means of refinancing for part of Depfa's credit portfolio – around 50 mld. – in the short term.
According to the notice of the Hypo Real Estate the financial requirements of the group were covered by the credit for a certain period and the company protected from the influence of the international money markets mostly not working.
From other sources you hear, that thanks to the money the refinancing is insured until the end of 2009.
The chairman of the HRE Management Committee Georg Funke on the contrary said that the HRE Group will not need the money markets for a short time.
The Bundesbank and the National Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) are based on the fact that the marketability of the HRE group is still ensured.
This is hoped for the bank's shareholders and creditors.
In view of the dynamics and the imponderability of the crisis there will be no guarantee.
It is possible that the funding will not be fully used.
But even the opposite is not to be ruled out.
After Sunday evening the bank at what was learned it was about to fail, the momentary rescue failed to calm the souls.
The stock price drops by 75% on the 3.30 Euro.
The mortgage classes are pretty good.
While the debts of the previous grade are almost unmovable, they yield the courses of the subordinated credits.
Above all, the loans of the subsidiary Württemberg-Hypo are affected, understandably the decorrences that expire beyond 2009.
Before the loans of the HRE seemed a speculative alternative investment, now their value must, after the strengthening of the crisis of the banks and of the institute itself, that with the relief of the Depfa has settled the crisis, be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
Until the less damaged central banks, governments and banks are still ready, we can count on amortisation of the year-to-years by the deadline.
Or it comes into operation, what no one dares to hope – that the financial crisis will be overcome within the next 15 months.
But regarding the information tipped over due to partial statizations the probability has become almost certain a justified hope.
It will mainly create long-term investors some sleepless nights with the decision whether to split from their commitments.
Short-term investors may conclude the carry-over of losses for future payments of the capital gains countervailing tax.
Sylvana and the secretaries of Bento-Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, on the first day of school should show up at Tachibana Highschool, the girls start giggling: The German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas-in the new Exchange Log tells of Japan.
The first day of school in Japan
How excited I was.
I even had a thing for going to school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and I need 40 minutes with the train to get to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find my own way, and luckily I didn't get lost.
The beginning of the first hour of class does not seem to have been fixed as we did in Lower Saxony.
The pupils arrive slowly from 8 am onwards, until 8:40 am begins a brief interview with the professor, the so-called "home room".
But before class started, it was my turn to introduce myself.
In the meantime, I'm not the kind of guy who talks willingly in front of people, plus a class of 40 pupils.
Since I didn't have the school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt of the host mother, along with a shirt, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Dressed like this, I sat in front of the chair and tried to pronounce well: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..."- my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and I celebrate in a week my birthday.
At that moment I was very happy to have already started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class whispered, giggled and scored and I heard the word "Kawaii" all the time.
I knew this one from my Mangas.
It belongs to the essential vocabulary of Japanese girls to survive and means "nice, sweet".
Then I ran fast in my place.
The girl next to me grinned, it was an honor for her to sit next to an exchange student
The rest of the lesson hour had continued quietly, but when he played the gong, I was assaulted in the true sense of the word.
Everything talked disorderly and giggled and bothered me with questions – then it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
In the break everyone opened their Bento.
My host mother also made me a panierino for Lunch- is different from the boring German sandwiches.
I had risotto with spices, sausages, cucumber salad and algae, fruit and a kind of rolls with meat and tofu..
Actually, I don't even know what I eat in Japan.
Things seem strange and have a whole new flavor.
Done is, that everything is really good.
Maybe except the plums in salt, Brrr!
Bentos aren't just lunch at Japanese schools.
It happens sometimes that a girl gives a self-made Bento, quite artistically prepared, with the hope of then getting to know the boy during recreation.
I read it in my Manga comics.
I'm just curious if you can find out.
"Why Japan?" my friends asked me when I told them, that I wanted to go to school in Japan for a year.
I always said,
"Because I'm fascinated by it."
Finally, I have been reading Mangas for years with fervor.
And to better understand the comics and the culture they contain, sooner or later I started to learn Japanese a little bit.
I was totally convinced I'd be there once.
I am also fascinated by tradition, customs and customs.
They care a lot about us here.
On the one hand Japan is a place of technology and latest trends - on the other hand: strict, disciplined and traditional.
Since everything is well organized, I have never felt lost, although Tokyo is the largest city I have ever seen in my life."
1. Rats also have feelings
A rat or a cockroach escape when they feel the danger.
Neurologist Joseph Le Doux is convinced of this: many animals also have feelings.
4. But how could it be verified if, when they behave in the same way as us, they have the same feelings as us?
For some years, articles by well-known scientists have been published in the Internet newspaper "Edge".
6. SPIEGEL ONLINE in a series presents chosen answers to the question: "What do you think is true, without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings or other states of consciousness, without me or someone else being able to prove it so far, since we can't even prove that other men have conscience.
But in this case we must at least hope that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
9. As soon as we turn to the other species and ask questions about feeling or generally about consciousness, we enter an impracticable territory, because the reference base does not match.
When a rat is in a dangerous situation, it does the same thing as the other animals do, that is, it pretends to be dead, escapes or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from where some scientists understand that there is a comparable subjective feeling.
I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult for us to convey our feelings to animals.
On the one hand, it often connects the lateral prefrontal cortex with human awareness, the associated circuits (this is due to its direct sharing in the short memory and the executive and control functions).
In man this large area is much more developed than in other primates and it seems that among other creatures it is completely missing.
At least in those aspects of our awareness dependent on prefrontal cortex, including knowledge, who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, we thus admit the foundation on the assumption that man differs even from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity should appear in the way of speaking about man: since a large part of life is connected to the language, it is often said to be linked to consciousness.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
Although awareness does not depend on language, it would influence it so that animal awareness, as it is done, certainly differs greatly from the circumstances of our consciousness.
That is why it is difficult to find out how consciousness can be seen in other animals.
If it is not possible to measure it as an internal and subjective thing, in analyzing it through one's own experience because of the special hardware, their research will pose us great problems.
Most interpretations refer to the content of conscious experience, but apart from this there is another aspect of consciousness to which it would be easier for science to have access.
The processes of animal consciousness could be analysed without regard to their content, and this is precisely what happens in the studies on the short memory of primates, in particular to the example of visualization.
So for this principle, which Christof Koch und Francis Crick follow, one passes first to the neural relateds of consciousness rather than to causal mechanisms: both could be identical but not necessarily.
In an interesting way this principle also highlights the value of the prefrontal cortex for the implementation of the visualization.
What, then, is emerging for feelings?
I impute them to the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in one of its conscious activities of the brain.
What we point out as "fear" is therefore the state of mind in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as the reactions of the body) occupies the working memory.
In this way the feelings are closely connected to the regions of the bark, which characterize the primates and in particular the human being.
With the talking nature, subtle shades of feeling are created, because with the help of words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize situations, to describe them to others.
Compared to this Antonio Damasio for example believes that the feelings result from more primitive activities of the body regions of the sensations of the bark and the paleo cephalo, similar to Jack Pankseep, who has however concentrated more on the paleocephalus.
Since this network in the course of human evolution has not changed much, this could absolutely be part of the feelings extended to the species.
At a purely theoretical level, I cannot contradict it, but I believe it to be indisputable.
Pankseep cites arguments that what for rats and humans appears to be fear, probably feels this way with the senses in both cases: but how could it occur, if rats and humans feel the same thing when they behave in a similar way?
A cockroach in case of danger escapes as if he too felt fear?
In my eyes the mere likeness of behavior cannot yet prove any vital likeness.
And that is, the neural comparison continues to be helpful: rats and humans have paleoencephales similar, cockroaches not even a brain.
But is the paleoencephalous responsible for feelings?
And even if you could prove it for humans: how would you want to prove it on rats?
I think that rats and other mammals, maybe even insects (who knows?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on specific circuits and language), I prefer to study emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, here is some progress at neural level, provided that the same procedure is given up on rats and men.
Like I don't do research on language and consciousness in rats, so I don't do it on their emotions, I don't even know if they exist.
This can be considered short-sighted, but I prefer to take steps forward, rather than continually slamming into a wall.
I'm actually a practical emotional.
The President of UEFA Platini: postponement for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik said that preparations will soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees the decision of the UEFA in Bordeaux as a demonstration of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize Europeans with Poland," said Wasjunik
"This, however, is not an amnesty for our country.
Work has just begun and there is still much to do in both countries"
Both host countries limped in the timetable for building or rebuilding stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
If necessary, the number of stages to be used by Europeans will even be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
Now we have to work at the highest speed," said the president of the Ukrainian Grigorij Surkis association.
"UFA will keep a constant eye on us"
An even more radical step has been taken in Poland.
After numerous scandals the leadership of the Polish PZPN association was suspended by the National Olympic Committee and replaced with independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of Sport Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "the serious danger that the PZPN is unable to operate according to the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish information agency PAP.
"In a letter we assured UEFA President Michel Platini that the preparation for EM 2012 will not suffer."
Many members of the first division only last season were convicted of manipulation, in the end the beginning of the League had to be postponed to the last moment.
Dennis Quaid rebuts outraged
He wanted to promote a new film, in interview he talked about the private and now he has trouble with the former: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has declared his former Dennis Quaid adulterer.
He's foaming with rage and he's retorting.
War of the late burst Roses for former married couple Meg Ryan und Dennis Quaid: seven years after their separation the two Hollywood actors now compete with each other in a bad fight - in public.
Meg Ryan in an interview with the American magazine InStyle last week for the first time spoke about the reasons for the failure of marriage: "Dennis was long unfaithful to me, and this was very painful."
The extent of the betrayals would only come to know it after the separation.
The occasion for the "soul stripper" was the work with Ryan's press for her new film "The Women" – the story of adultery is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his being publicly declared adulterous husband was clear: he would be "unheard," said the 54-year-old at the "New York Daily News", that "Meg for the umpteenth time repeats and re-elaborates the story of our relationship".
It would also be "deploreable" that Jack, the 16-year-old son they had together, again "be reminded publicly of the pain and subversion, which a separation means for every child."
While Ryan from separation lives alone, Quaid is again married and will soon become the father of twins.
And therefore his judgments close with the arrow: "My life in any case goes on.
I consider myself fortunate to have a wonderful family to which everything is for the best."
Prices for air tickets and hotels drop
In the first half of 2008 flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would be up to 50% cheaper
Flights and overnight stays in the hotel have become cheaper again - this is the result of a study of the financial provider and American Express travel.
The company analysed its booking data for the first half of the year of 2008 and after an increase in prices in the first quarter observed a clear drop in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have increased for years, overnight stays in many places have already dropped in price.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities examined still averaged around 6.9 compared to 2007
However, from April to June prices were already 3.6 % lower than in the previous year.
The most obvious trend would have been in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 up to 37% less than a year earlier..
The American Express sees as the reason for this the weak price of the dollar, which would lead to a "calming desire to travel by American tourists"
Financial centres such as Frankfurt and London would also be affected by the recession in hotel prices in a stronger way than industrial centres such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger
In the Norwegian city the prices of hotels with an increase of 26.3 % even hold the record in Europe
Also with regard to flight prices, the trend in the first quarter still shows up:
Because of the rise in kerosene, Economy Class passengers had to pay on average 7.1% compared to 2007, fuel intensive long range flights would even be up to 29.2 % more expensive
From April to June, Economy Class air ticket prices dropped by an average of 12.5 % compared to the previous quarter, but price changes in the first class and business were by far weaker.
In Germany, prices have collapsed even more strongly than in other European countries:
From January to March prices had risen by 11,9 %, in the second quarter they fell by 23,6 %.
As for domestic German flights according to the study, prices have even halved.
Reason for the collapse of prices would be on the one hand economic growth down, explains the company.
The demand in many segments of the air travel market has crumbled.
On the other hand, there would be the open skies agreement, which liberalises air traffic between the US and Europe, an increased pressure of competition.
A sign of the critical situation would be the elimination of unprofitable routes at Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that would have declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 – only in Europe were 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach 1 to 0
With a goal and simple methods the Hamburg SV becomes chiefist.
At Borussia Luhukay he still can't find a group of 11 that works.
Here Kristoffer Klein worsens the luck landing for national Marko Marin player.
Gladbach player first entered the game late and failed with a throw on the crossbar
His message was precisely formulated, passed on to his lips convincingly.
He knew he was absolutely right.
"We need the second goal," exclaimed Hermann Rieger in the corridor of the cabins of the Hamburg arena.
Not much had happened in the catacombs, the game break was over and most sat back in place.
Rieger has been a HSV physiotherapist for almost 3 decades, he enjoys an even greater estimate than some old players.
And so his warning also found heed in the high spheres.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumb as a sign of approval.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
His order must have played in a similar way: here's the second goal!
The position change did not occur.
"Today not everything here was nice to see," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt would also have "wanted more relaxed".
For 1–0, those in Hamburg have to thank Mladen Petric's headstroke (11) and the fact that many of Gladbach's weak players could not hurt Hamburg's weak players.
"It was a dirty victory," summarized Martin Jol.
The Hamburg FVC will turn 121 this Monday.
The spectators celebrated before, in the afternoon of Saturday, themselves, the blue sky on the arena and the flashing ranking on the video screen, which legitimized their sports society as before the class.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"we can fix everything," Marcell Jansen said.
It has the feeling, that the provisional table certificate is more indicative of the unpredictability of the championship than of the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its new arrivals hired late – the Brazilians Neves und Silva, the defender of the Petric port as well as Jansen blown to FC Bayern – finds itself slowly, but has not yet managed to shine.
"We need more atmosphere and more Dribble," Jol strongly re-launches.

Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years a mysterious phenomenon has created perplexity among scientists: dark matter influences the velocity of space probes during the so-called Swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einsteins' general theory of relativity might not be entirely correct.
The Ulysses space probe has flown through space for nearly 18 years.
Because of the fuel pipes that freeze quickly it now hangs death for freezing.
Among scientists for years a mysterious phenomenon creates havoc – the anomaly of the Swing-by
The Swing-by is a flight maneuver of the space probes, with which they obtain additional momentum/pushed/swing in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example of the Earth.
So probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical gimmick as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
What amazes scholars already for years: rockets do not behave entirely as one would expect according to the law on gravitation.
In fact, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes suddenly become faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
The year renamed the Swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the force of attraction of matter with a curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study firmly believes as before Einstein did not err, and attempts to explain the anomaly of Swing-by by means of the so-called dark matter that astronomers have spotted in the cosmos.
"Responsible for the anomaly could be the dark matter that could also be very close to Earth," he writes.
Of the existence of dark matter space scholars have known only for about 10 years.
A force of attraction emerges from her, whose effect on the other celestial bodies appears.
Instead, she herself is completely invisible, that is, she does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation of any sort, especially any visible light.
According to scientists' calculations dark matter constitutes at least a good fifth of the entire mass of the cosmos.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After 10 days in the hands of their kidnappers the tourists kidnapped in Egypt would be free again, as the Italian foreign minister confirmed.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros of ransom.
In a shooting before the liberation six kidnappers reported to have been killed.
Five Germans were kidnapped in the south of Egypt.
The ransom negotiations are already under way.
The Germans are always in the sights of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are undoubtedly free.
This has been reported in agreement by Egyptian state television, Arab broadcaster Al-Arabija and Italian media.
Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the news of the Italian television station Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released
We are examining their state of health," said Frattini.
The 5 Germans, 5 Italians and a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian companions would be in good health and safe, reported Egyptian state television.
The 19 members of an expedition to the desert are already on their way to Cairo.
The background of a shooting that took place before the hostages were released remains unclear: so the kidnappers after the indications of an Egyptian public security officer would have been ready for the conclusion of the kidnapping, before the Sudanese army killed 6 of them by surprise.
"The problem had been solved.
They agreed to a ransom," said the official.
It would still be "just a matter of taking over the hostages," when suddenly "this surprise" arrived.
Sudanese soldiers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt had shot 6 of the kidnappers and captured 2 of them.
The kidnappers had demanded from Germany a ransom of 6 million euros; the money should have been handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported in reference to a German intermediary, the release of the hostages would be delayed, because the kidnappers feared for their own safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers wanted to release the hostage women after the ransom was paid.
The men should have been detained until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo refused a position on the report.
The abuse of his stepfather "brought to suicide"
Years of abuse by the stepfather led a woman to kill herself, a court ruled.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, was in prison for 6 years after admitting eight cases of sexual assault.
The Court of Truro Crown Court learned that he regularly harassed his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle, when she was between the ages of five and seven.
Trerise wrote in a confessional note, "I feel responsible for his death."
The court learned that Miss Randle had killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a child and lived in Coventry, Trerise harassed her and bandaged her before having sex, while her mother was out working in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
But the court learned that Mrs. Randle, who had spent a lot of time as a volunteer at the National Trust, was tormented by the abuses that had caused her.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that Miss Randle's friends, who had been a very good surfer and cyclist, were "emotionally dead," and that she had "dissolved with life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
She is thought to have killed herself by choking herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle comforted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession ending: "I tied her up and bandaged her".
"I didn't sexually harass her.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise, "You are an extremely strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been terrifying, especially when you were only seven years old.
"This unpleasant saga ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even harder is the fact that if he hadn't, it would have been difficult for the facts to end up before the court."
I notice the effects Stephanie's father and mother describe having had on their daughter these years.
"Otherwise, she was clearly likely to have been a promising and happy successful young woman."
The officer who lost the data will be punished.
The Cabinet Office officer who left top-secret documents on a train in June must be charged by the Official Secrets Act, learned the BBC.
The man was away from the Ministry of Defense when he left on the train to Waterloo two highly classified documents.
The documents were passed to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It is the least delicate of the allegations made under this law and there is nothing to suggest a criminal intent.
BBC defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the movement would arrive as a surprise to many of the administration.
"They must have thought this was being treated internally at Mod and the cabinet office," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is about to be charged under Section 8.1 of the Act, the clause concerning the safeguarding of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service recommended that the officer should be charged by the Metropolitan Police due to the highly sensitive nature of his work.
The lost documents contained assessments of al-Qaaeda and the capabilities of Iraq's security forces.
He was informed of the decision Monday morning and was taken away from his home and taken to a hidden location.
Construction companies face B&B account
British construction companies could face an account of over £80,000 after the rescue of Bradford & Bingley Bank.
The government has given £14billion to protect Bradford & Bingley's 2.6 million savers deposits.
Interest on that loan will be paid by all companies taking the money of savers, including 59 construction companies.
The general manager of the Building Societies Association (BSA) Adrian Coles said that it is "irritant" that companies and their members have to pay.
The loan of £14billion will eventually be repaid when Bradford & Bingley's loans are redeemed.
But the interest that will mature in the meantime will be charged annually to the 700 financial companies that take deposits. But the interest that will mature in the meantime will be charged annually to the 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies would be included in that number.
It is irritating that those institutions that have behaved prudently are now called to pay part of the bill of those institutions that have been far less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company had to pay in proportion to the deposits it had, and that companies among them had to pay 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find £81 million to pay for the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, general manager of the construction company association, told the BBC that he believes it is unfair.
"It is irritating that those institutions that have behaved prudently in the house-resuming market are now called to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been much less cautious."
According to the BSA, no company has failed since documentation began in 1945.
"We need to look at all aspects in the coming weeks to see what options there are to protect construction companies and their members from what could be a significant account," Mr. Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, the interest of a whole year will be due and this could be almost twice as high.
Since construction companies are mutual organizations without shareholders, their members end up paying the account through higher rates or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Milk rises to 5pence per litre
People in Jersey are facing the fact that they have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy announced that there will be an increase in wholesale prices of her milk for an extra fivepence per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two penny increase in February, and comes after a research carried out by a consulting company.
Retailers must decide for themselves whether they want to download the price increase on their customers.
(DANILO) Before the February increase, the wholesale price changed for the last time in 2002.
Denied bail to the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A Bangladeshi court refused a bail request from previous Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means that you could be arrested when you return to the country.
His lawyers said the court refused to grant her bail for extorting 50 million takas ($729,700) to a businessman when he was a member of parliament
The case is one of the many corruption charges that hangs against you.
Sheikh Hasina's long-time political rival, Khaleda Zia, had been released on bail at the beginning of the month.
Sheikh Hasina's return to Bangladesh is expected for the next few weeks but his party, Awami League, called for the temporary government of the country supported by the military to give her total freedom first.
The correspondents say that while you were going abroad for medical treatment on parole, it is unclear according to the terms of your release, whether you can remain free when you return to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say he will appeal to the Supreme Court against the High Court order.
"The High Court has refused bail for Sheikh Hasina claiming that you cannot have bail since you are already abroad on parole for medical treatment," says his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We shall make an appeal against the order of the High Court."
His lawyers explain that he needs bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December election.
He expects Sheikh Hasina's return home after October 17, said a senior leader of the Awami League party on Sunday.
She was detained last year after the government flanked by military force took power, but was released in June, to go abroad to receive medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fear for Afghan Anti-Polio Campaigns
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan are missing from the recent immunization campaign due to violence related to the Taliban, says the UN.
The UN carried out a vaccination program in six provinces last week.
But it is said that it cannot reach the children in the parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for safety reasons.
A UN spokesman said that this happens despite the promises of the Taliban that they would not attack or hinder thousands of staff people carrying vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal battle with ITV
BSkyB lost its legal battle with the Competition Commission's decision to force the company to reduce its participation in rival ITV television station.
BSkyB was told by the competition's appeal court to cut its shares in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the commission had said that BSkyB's participation hindered competition and allowed an unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought participation in 2006 in an agreement that effectively blocked NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that the acquisition of BSkyB participation in ITV sows doubts about ITV's independence, causing the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
Virgin's head, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom's regulator opposed the purchase.
BSkyB argued that forcing it to reduce its ITV stake was unreasonable and a disproportionate remedy - particularly as BSkyB had said it would surrender its voting rights.
New investigation into the US prosecutor's case
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special prosecutor to examine the dismissal of nine American lawyers in 2006.
The operation occurred when a report on the case by the Inspector General of the Department of Critical Justice actions of administrative officers.
The report was critical towards the White House, legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was triggered by the fear that prosecutors had been removed for political reasons.
Special prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers questioned during the investigation have lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
"Series allegations concerning potentially criminal behaviors have not been fully investigated or ascertained," said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The assignment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of the main recommendations.
The dispute began when nine American prosecutors were removed from their positions by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the department said the lawyers had been fired for poor performance.
But later it emerged that the dismissed lawyers had not been rated any poorer than many other colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that dismissal had been motivated by politics.
Some of the prosecutors had been involved in judicial action against Republican members of the high-profile Congress, while others had refused to investigate the charge of fraud against democratic voters.
American prosecutors investigate and prosecute cases in court on behalf of the government.
They can be fired at any time, but they cannot be fired for political reasons.
The then head of the Justice department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, found himself in the storm for the layoffs, and eventually rasched his position.
A number of other justice department officers quit.
(The Inspector General's report was very critical of Mr Gonzales' role in the case, saying that he had a primary responsibility for layoffs, that he had abdicated his role as leader and had been extraordinarily detached during the trial.
Other officers, including Bush's previous senior assistant Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The epic of Meat Loaf will be celebrated
The rock star Meat Loaf is about to be honored at the Q Awards for her epic hymn Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will withdraw his special gold prize at next week's ceremony in London, said he was "honored" to gain recognition.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit track track.
Coldplay will lead the nominations for this year's awards, being on the list of nominees in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said, "There are some songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is undoubtedly one of those."
The song, composed by Jim Steinman, required a strong vocality that was provided by the Meat Loaf.
It opened with an instrumental section that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was made as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached 15th place.
But Meat Loaf Bat Out Of Hell's album remained almost nine years on the chart and came to sell more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, including surgery for an irregular heartbeat in 2003 after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel the concerts.
Later he emerged that he had a cyst on a vocal cord.
Dark city streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other crossroads, some famous, others merely of use.
But also many veteran taxi drivers and residents for a long time find it difficult to give the location of Extra Place, mostly because they have never heard of it.
The tiny street is in the East Village and goes north from First Street – without doing Second Street – between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, it looks more like a dusty alley than an active busy street.
There are no road signs.
It is virtually impossible to see her on a normal atlas.
The road must, however, have admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the real estate company of the newly built luxury buildings on the First Street.
You want to reopen Extra Place and create a cleaner passage for shops and boutiques that should open in new buildings.
Other admirers include longtime neighbors who say they were hit by the truncated road simply because it was one of the last remnants of the stately neighborhood of the past.
But the city's preservation and development department, which has road control, has no interest in keeping it.
During a meeting of the Land Use Committee of the district's municipal commission some representatives of the city's agency and Avalon Bay outlined a proposal for the real estate company to buy the streets.
But the committee prefers that the road remain in the hands of the city, and asked for a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, the director of the Community Board 3 district.
"There is very little space left to the city property, and we would like the city to continue owning Extra Place," he said.
"There could be proposals to set it up and manage it, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to ensure public access."
Avalon Bay many months ago announced that he wanted to reopen the small street and install seating, including some to use for a café to which the real estate company hopes to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay bought the road was first made public at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the road, it does not necessarily mean that it wants to own it.
"Avalon Bay's main concern is to renew this derelict alley and turn it into a public amenity," he said, adding that the city suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for Accommodation Preservation, said that it was in fact the city's desire to sell the street and pointed out that the agency's purpose was to develop property rather than administer it.
Compared to its most colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a slight historical footprint.
Some believe that it was named in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among his numerous children and the narrow strip of land was not claimed.
The rear door of CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened on Extra Place, and the street is perhaps best known as the set for the cover photo of the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia."
"The terrain was beautiful," said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the picture in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, shreds of clothes and pieces of casks, posters, leaves, strings."
Some residents, including some bloggers writing about "gentrification" of the East Village, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, claiming that the piece of public property, modest as it is, should remain public.
Others praised Extra Place as a rarity – a fragment of almost nothing changed city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who has a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Complaints: A somewhat nostalgic look at the dying city"), published part of a Discourse in the city's history that appeared on The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow, never-ending street, dark even during the day and delimited rusted iron warehouse doors and shuttered windows, with week-old newspapers fluttering along the slums."
With few exceptions, the road seemed almost the same as a recent evening.
A rat ran easily through the back of the road near a door leading inside the CBGB, which is now the site of an aristocratic clothing store.
On the walls were graffiti and a 22-ounce empty beer bottle lies next to a group of fresh abandoned newspapers.
Few passers-by said that they rarely thought about Extra Place but suggest that it would need to be a little beautified.
Mr. Fields, for his part, said that he also thinks some people underestimate the attraction of the road in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in black, dirty, disgusting places."
The bilingual debate: immersion in English
In this episode of Educational View, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior member in California studies and senior director of educational studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Why the middle class needs to choose a school."
Attracting Hispanic voters really is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's educational projects are a significant example.
Mr Obama's campaign notes that, "Afro-American and Latin students have significantly less chance of graduating than white students, "which is true.
To combat these shortcomings in achieving goals, Obama's educational plan specifically supports, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for English students.
Yet, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes class teaching of languages other than English, does not take into account his interest in bridging learning gaps.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, a primary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
School students are mostly Hispanic and low-income.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived, are studying English.
But, among the fourth graders, an amazing 100 percent of the students did the superior level test in the 2008 math state exam.
Equally surprising 93 percent of fourth graders did the expert level test on art-di-language-English.
This incredible result was achieved using a different ingredient from Mr. Obama's favorite.
Sixth Street emphasizes review and exercise, constant evaluation of skills and an attitude of the "no excuses" type.
Also, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school's obstructive approach for English students is "full immersion."
The use of English emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in the context of education.
Mrs. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, "we had a fantastic success with a student who just came from Mexico and if you had entered the class 12 months later you wouldn't be able to identify which one it was."
"It works," he observed "it works for us."
Would Obama model a school like Sixth Street Prep to replicate it in other Hispanic-majority schools and with English students?
The results achieved by the school make the answer to that question very easy, but educational policy in its own party (the National Education Associations is a long-standing advocate of bilingual education) and its own continued support for bilingual education prevent you from predicting Mr. Obama's response.
While he agrees that immigrants should study English, Obama recently made the subject trivial when he said that people should stop worrying about "only-English" legislation.
Instead, he said, "you must be sure that your children are able to speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close these gaps in achievement, he should consider carefully the educational models that work rather than despise them or trivialize them.
Oil drops sharply and renews economic fear
Oil prices dropped sharply on Monday due to concerns that even the US rescue plan for the financial markets may not be able to raise the economy.
The futures of the crude oil fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel at the New York merchant stock exchange in the morning operations.
Prices have lost more than $20 a barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by Wall Street's financial turmoil, and by couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.26 per barrel in June, prices had collapsed to nearly $90 per barrel earlier this month, before rising again, against the backdrop of tremendous uncertainty in the financial markets.
Anxiety affected investors again on Monday even after Congressional leaders had said they had reached an agreement on the rescue plan at the weekend, the biggest in history.
The news was obscured by the fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the last episode of the progressive merger, Citigroup will buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, the government said on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg Governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts said that the frenetic weekend negotiations had led to a rescue deal "they seem to have failed to rekindle the market sentiment.
As the economic situation worsens, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to calm down.
"The prospect for global equity, interest rates and exchange rate markets has become uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape the contagion.
From a raw material perspective our most pressing concern is to what extent the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China."
Banking analysts lowered their expectations for next year while home oil consumption due to slowing economic growth, reducing oil and gas price forecasts by about 20 percent for 2009.
The exploit in the second quarter marks a team record.
After spending more time than anyone in the Jets uniform in the last eight and more seasons, defender Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then he watched the second quarter of Sunday, when the Jets turned a pointless game into a comeback.
"Never seen such a thing," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had equaled the grayness of the threatening clouds that dominated them with a sluggish game.
Then quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles for a touchdown of 12 yards, providing the perfect signal for an afternoon when their growing tune made a giant step forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns in the fourth, including one when one cornerback fell and another with 10 seconds left at the end of the first half.
"I didn't get out of my path," Favre said of all the passages that came to Coles.
He's a great player.
Our communication was great, despite what people can think."
While Favre and Coles played catch games, the defense heavily hit Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a stray launch and relaunched it for 32 yards in a touchdown.
Security Eric Smith scheduled another ride and intercepted him.
Linebacker David Bowens forces a Warner fumble.
The last turnover, the fumble forced by Bowens, may have been the most notable.
The Cardinals went ahead on that ball possession, with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets had picked up the ball with 10 minutes left, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard goal, for a 34–0 lead.
It was more than the Jets ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe its madness, Jets coach Eric Mangini said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When he was told both - the Jets gave 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said, "I can tell you that I liked the second quarter much more than the third."
There were a lot of points in a small amount of time."
Getting rested Gebroxye exceeds his world record
Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia showed again because many consider him the best marathon runner ever, breaking his own world record at the Berlin Marathon Sunday and becoming the first person to run a 26.2 mile run under 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a win over the race favorably flat at 2:03:59, Gebrassessie smashed his previous score of 2:03:26 last year in Berlin for 27 seconds.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie set the world's 26th record of such a stunning career that it produced a world championship or world record at every distance from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrsalessie skipped the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect - that air pollution would worsen his asthma problems.
Instead, he decided to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees on departure, 55 degrees on arrival - Gebrselassie won Sunday with a hot average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As soon as half cross-country skiers such as Gebrsalessie and Paul Tergat of Kenya went to long distances, the marathon record fell more than two minutes in the past decades, since Ronaldo da Costa del Brazil won in Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebselassie told reporters that two weeks ago she had calf cramps and missed a week of workouts.
Clearly, his rest left him fresh, not rusty.
"I'm so happy," Gebnersie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and I had some doubts today, but in the end it all went well."
He has been somewhat criticized - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's East African rival - for overly orchestrating his races, generally avoiding many of the best marathon stars in the world, counting on a dozer as if it were a mid-bottom race, and placing world records over the sense of competition.
But these criticisms rarely diminish Gebslerassie's skill size as a marathon runner.
With the pace of four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebnerassie reached the halfway point at 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, held Gebrelassie in competition after the opener vanished.
Just over three miles from the arrival, Gebrelassie made a final surge to separate from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his best personal time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi arrived third at 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan who is now a German citizen, completed a notable year winning in 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time ever.
Paula Radcliffe of Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36, was a surprise winner of the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the Beijing Games with what is described as a bad accident, but healed to win in Berlin, making her best personal time of almost five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
She ran a race doing the calculations well, letting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners leave with a great detachment, taking them back after about 18 and a half miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia arrived second in 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a city apart, pride and processes of a black life
Hidden in the theme park extended on the suburbs of Orlando, a few miles from the splendor, the noise, the enormous, lies the quiet city where the pride and complications of African-American experience enter life.
Eatonville, the first all black city incorporated in the country and Zora Neale Hurston's home, is no longer as simple as he described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, plenty of guava, two schools and no prison."
It is now a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to show their respect to Hurston, Harlem Renaissance's most famous writer.
Yet in many ways, the city that he described - and that makes tourists stop by understanding it in the Florida tourist guide produced by the Depression-era Federal Writers' Project - remains a separate place.
It is so independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their thoughts with the white man, that "knowing so little about us, he does not know what he is missing."
Even now, in a year where a black presidential nominee, Senator Barack Obama, has been called for an opening speech on race, many here remain distrustful of the outsider's gaze.
"We are very cautious about how our story is told," said Hortense Jones, 59, a lifelong resident and member of the city's oldest church.
"It's got to be fair."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and difficulty.
It is both a historical model of black takeover and a community of nearly 2,400 where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a literary center but also an example in the shade of the oaks of the rural culture of southern blacks - sometimes disdained, sometimes rewarded - born of American slavery.
Not surprisingly, residents here are both proud and protective.
And the concern for Eatonville's imagination really began with Zora, whom everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented the world to her hometown through sincere, dialect-rich books, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of Florida's guide transformed the city, just off the Rout 17, a road that runs through Florida's often forgotten center into a scenery from black history and human drama
Low as a drum in both life and literature, Hurston brought readers to the store owned by the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then diverted to more private areas.
"Out of the street on the left," he wrote "is the modern public school, brown with white finishings, with its well-kept gardens and courtyards, which Howard Miller always looked after, thinking he could barely read and write."
She also mentioned the widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and whatever suits the passing rooms".
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Clearly, this wasn't Fodor's.
In fact, it was not a portrait that everyone appreciated.
"Zora said it like it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of Johnson's girls who Hurston immortalizes it by quoting men singing gross songs about their beauty.
He adds, "Some people don't like it."
Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who frequently returned from her family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembers that when Hurston stormed into the city, he usually arrived unannounced in a triumphant Chevrolt, smoking and wearing pants in a city that even today boasts of dignified clothing.
Many inhabitants were fascinated, says Mr. Franklin, while others were grumbling.
"People were always very happy to see Zora," Mr. Franklin said.
But, he added, swinging on his chair on the patio on the back overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "she never stayed long".
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books had gone out of print.
Along with the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in a grave without a plaque in Fort Pierce, Fla., where she had lived.
In Eatonville, there were no major commemorative ceremonies, and no major conference.
"I don't think they understand his contribution to the world or his legacy to everyone," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A change occurred in the 1980s.
Orange County officers wanted to place a five-lane highway across the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the two-lane main road.
Orlando's expansion has already pushed La Interstate 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period of its history.
Forced integration, in addition to other things, had ended its idyllic isolation of the community
In the 1950s, the battle over racial mixing brought hatred to the community's home door.
"During that time, a group of white boys came and threw oranges and things to people sitting on one side," Mr. Franklin says.
"In fact we had a girl who was killed by that once.
They threw a watermelon out of a car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston made the Supreme Court a request for forced integration, calling his decision in Brown against the school office "an insult rather than an honor for my race".
Residents now say that desegregation of schools, despite being positive in some respects, dilutes Eatonville's cohesion and undermines the confidence of its young people.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember this - hugging your teacher in the morning, hugging your teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins' daughter and the executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
This lasted, he added, until the teachers and students came from the same place.
"You didn't hug your white teacher because your white teacher...-I mean, there's a cultural division there," Mrs. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped and created space for many other Zora Neale Hurstons - black writer, actress and artist who overcame prejudice, as he did, with cheerful self-confidence and lines such as: "How can some deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
I just don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker began a long journey to the Hurston-free tomb and began fighting for the resurrection of her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Robert E. Hemenway's Hurston hit the bookshelfs, reintroducing it into the American canon.
The highway project came just as his most famous daughter had drawn the limelight again.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community began planning in 1988 a festival dedicated to Hurston to show what could ruin the state with its highway.
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for commemoration.
Many years later, the state withdrew from its street project.
"The five lanes of the resurrected highway have brought what one would call high speed, a real pride for the city," Ms. Nathiri said.
Mrs. Boyd makes it easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the highway project helped change the city's image of itself.
Those from out of town like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began coming to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to reassess the past.
Eatonville joined the public historical register in 1998.
A new one-story library (called Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a repaved and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: only six miles from downtown Orlando, it can give the feeling of a secondary road in the summer rain, small as when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1980s.
(It's 90 percent black today.)
Outsiders who come to look for Eatonville's story, for its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A permit asked in advance is required for most of the interviews, to some things - such as the murals on the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man, who show black men in the fields - are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Ms. Jones, a fat teacher, with a weakness for brilliant red, still fear that their island community will be misunderstood.
Yet, as soon as the Hurston festival expanded, a high level of city pride also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville with Hurston see his entire race: beautiful, problems and everything, neither better, nor worse and proud, creative, great worker, silly and confused as other races and ethnic groups in America.
It is sincere civic affection what can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or the Police Department, which he said may need help.
And even those who are younger, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Many people, if they just came in here, will think, 'Oh, this town is nothing compared to all the others,'" said Alondra Kenon after mass on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at history, it's really a pretty town."
Here in New York we all talk fluently about finance
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If the tourists in Manhattan kept away from the newspaper stalls and the huge TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't notice being in the eye of the cyclone.
They would never guess that the glass offices, nested on their heads the bankers and hedge fund managers that monopolize New York live every day the worst "bad day in the office" since the collapse of 1929.
The messengers shake metal trolleys for tea through the sidewalks, carrying muffin trays for meetings at breakfast.
Latin-Americans drag their feet between condominiums carrying, like human mules, 50 and broken stretched shirts hanging from a stick on their shoulders.
Employees still wait in line for their morning bagel at food carts on the sidewalks, and it is still impossible to take a yellow taxi between 16 and 19 on a working day.
It did not seem that there was a real crisis, until, with all the talk of ruin and sadness, I decided to open a new savings book Thursday afternoon.
Although I had planned the matter so that it coincided with the late afternoon break at my JP subsidiary Morgan Chase, a tail of about twenty was already waiting in line.
Not in front of the cashier's desk, to withdraw money or make deposits, but in front of the customer service desk, where old customers order chequebooks, tourists ask for directions to the Macy department store and new customers open accounts.
Many of those who are in front of me, I would then learn from Starr, my "banker of trust", they were in line for the same reason as me.
Unlike me, however, they have already taken savings from smaller banks from places where commuters do, such as those from New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They took the money from the so-called thrifts (a bit like a construction company), credit cooperatives and types of city savings banks whose branches operate only within a state, and say they treat customers as family members.
In the past few years, 15 of these banks have failed.
In recent days Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in surplus, was subdued to the controlled administration, and, as New Yorkers headed home for the weekend a Friday afternoon, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a buyer to save it.
The employees and clerks who stood in front of me, afraid of another collapse, were moving their money to a bank perceived as a safe haven, the bank that is asking for more bails on Wall Street.
Common New Yorkers in recent weeks have become competent in finance.
A woman at my trusted Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bank went bankrupt, and her emaciated general manager Dick Fuld in all familiarity, as if complaining about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed concierge, almost fifty years old in my apartment building, has changed the theme from our normal topic of conversation about Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my shopping.
She told me, after my visit to the bank, "Now I have all my savings in market funds!.
I've changed, I'm not taking any chances."
Moslem tombs desecrated as Austria turns right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, to the left of the Austrian right wing of the Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the right Belgian party Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration to present the organization "City Against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry signals like street signs representing mosques with a red line passing in between.
Police blamed right-wing extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same week that far-right political parties earned much in the national general election.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at Traun Cemetery, near Linz, in a few hours between Friday night and this morning, in what police believe was an organized action.
The culprits sprayed Jewish symbols such as David's Star over some graves, but the detectives believe it may have been an attempt to mask extremist motives driven by hatred for Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident is linked in any way to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the desecration, which took place towards the end of Ramadan, a month of religious importance for Muslims.
Austria has meanwhile taken a spiritual search trip following its right turn in yesterday's parliamentary election.
The two far-right parties that took almost 30% of the vote, the Austrian Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, did a campaign with vehemently anti-immigration tickets and some of their slogans were defined by xenophobic critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the votes, campaigned against veils and burkas and also expressed his opposition to foods that are perceived as related to Islam.
At the final rally in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties seem to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, claiming that they are political symbols of a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses made immediately after the election, which established the extreme right as the nation's strongest political block, indicating that change was brought into predominance by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Travel abroad banned Gary Glitter.
Gary Glitter, the glamorous rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, was forbidden to travel to France and Spain by the court.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he had informed the authorities controlling him that he wanted to go to Spain passing through France.
The ban on travel abroad was granted to Kent police last Thursday after he had provided magistrates with evidence of Glitter's previous arrests for sexual abuse of minors.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadi, was not present at Ashford's pretura hearing in Kent but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A Court Service spokesperson said: "Thursday, September 25 at Ashford Pretura, Kent police filed a request to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd's foreign travel to France and Spain until March 25.
"Paul Gadd was not present in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad as requested by the sex offender register.
He must notify the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He is also required to give the police seven days notice of his planned departure date.
Failure to notify the authority may lead to a sentence of five years in prison.
Kent police said they did not want to discuss individual cases or Glitter's possible movements in the country.
A Kent police spokesman said, "Kent police will do whatever it takes to protect children in this country or abroad.
"From our point of view, it is easier to control someone who remains in the UK because we have suitable comprehensive systems to manage every potential risk more effectively.
"Protecting Kent residents is the primary concern of Kent police and we work closely to monitor the behaviour of convicted sex offenders registered in the country to minimize any possible risk to the public.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two 10- and 11-year-old girls.
When Glitter came, he flew to Bangkok where he should board a flight to London.
But he said he felt sick and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities would not let him pass through passport control and eventually took a flight to Hong Kong.
Even the Chinese authorities did not let him in and returned to Bangkok where Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
He eventually arrived at terminal 3 in Heathrow on 22 August and stayed there as his lawyer David Corker went to the Pretura in Uxbridge, west of London, since Scotland Yard had successfully applied for an order to include him in the register of sex offenders.
Glitter had previously been imprisoned in the United Kingdom in 1999 for possessing images of child abuse.
A source of the Interior Ministry said that Jacqui Smith, the Secretary of the Interior felt reassured and happy that Glitter had been stopped from travelling to France and Spain.
"Photographer the master away from the scene to extract his character" Günther Bauer, photographer
No heels, no flints, no clothes from before.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration that characterizes the interpretation, to look at the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Two inseparable faces, except in private, in those moments away from the public, when the intimacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen gaze or the expressiveness of the hands, are natural because they must not go on stage.
The German Günther Bauer in "Flamenco-People" alternates the theatricality of some shots with singers, dancers and guitarists on stage with the less known side of these masters.
With this aim, the photographer offers an original iconography of flamenco, capturing it from different visual angles.
The exhibition, included in the programming of the Month of Flamenco Photography, reflects the international importance of this dance, every day more and more," explains the artist and clarifies that in "Flamenco-People" they may also be ordinary people, but seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists, performers or performers on the scene.
These people portrayed "on the street" are "artists able to convey passion, sadness, joy when they are on stage ... and capture the audience.
To capture the personality of these greats it is not necessary to portray them on stage,
because their personality and character are inner.
What I was interested in was creating an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the great flamenco."
With a passion for the festival "Cante de las Minas", Bauer began in 1997 a long journey aimed at portraying singers, guitarists or dancers using a plate camera.
They are portraits that, due to the type of machine and the material, recall classical photography.
The application of different stylistic techniques breaks with the traditional principles of image, giving the photo modernity, according to an idea that reflects Bauer's conception of flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and is able to surprise every day."
Not dancing, singing or playing in itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, capable of conquering the audience with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essential elements, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain way of feeling and being, are and have been the constant of this work, on display these days at the El Fotómata gallery.
Famous flamenco artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, appear in this selection of about seventy portrait artists.
The project has become a sort of flamenco anthology, and will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited at the exhibition.
The passion for portraits led Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of Veteran Athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although in "Flamenco-People" the concept is different, the photographer admits "I love portraying people, knowing them and being able to penetrate their lives for a moment, whether this is a long or short moment.
I think portrait is the most difficult genre in photography.
You meet or compare with people, characters you sometimes don't even know or who only give you a few minutes to take the picture.
Beyond these circumstances, like a photographer, I always try to put my ideas into practice."
The collection of portraits of the contemporary flamenco, entitled "Flamenco-people" is set up at the El Fotómata gallery, at number 20 of Via de la Mata, parallel to Via Alameda de Hercules, and will be open to the public until the next 16 October.
Vargas Llosa reveals that the novel she's writing is a "hazard"
It is set in places that still do not know and deals with unknown topics: despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is struggling with a new project he is working on, a novel whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in Congo and crossed the Amazon.
Always preferred for the Nobel Prize for Literature, the writer confessed yesterday on the occasion of the Hay Festival in Segovia, that the project he is dealing with today "is a gamble" and that "everything indicates that I shouldn't write it."
"If I had common sense, I wouldn't write it, but I will do it anyway and I hope to finish it as soon as possible," concluded his speech at the festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days saw a hundred writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people passing through the city of the Aqueduct.
The author of "La ciudad y los perros" was, as per prediction, the leading figure at the third edition of the word festival.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award to be the most voted writer by the participants – an ancient edition of Dickens' "Our mutual friend" book, filled the seats of the Juan Bravo theatre.
Presented by Félix Romeo, the writer found himself in front of an audience who flew time when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, recalled how the literary vocation was born in him, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "pleasure to read" and "to live beyond what I lived"; as he writes in "disciplined manner" to compensate for the "lack of inspiration", with an intense work of documentation, drafting and continuous remaking; as Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his vocation and as "images of memory" are the basis on which his stories rest.
The Spanish-American novelist, acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know whether books can change people's lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," Vargas Llosa stressed, arguing that, on the contrary, it "has effects" and that it "makes people more nonconformist." That's why he invited writers to "do not give in to frivolity" and to "take responsibility" for their vocation.
Time hinders the Pozoblanco Festival, depriving it of bullfighting
The celebration of bullfighting that was supposed to seal the days of the Pozoblanco Festival was suspended yesterday morning, after the bullfighters selected for bullfighting had verified that the ground conditions of the square were not adequate.
Therefore, the company, in agreement with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, decided to suspend the bullfighting celebration.
The weather was fierce against this Festival, preventing it from celebrating two days out of three.
On Saturday, the rain prevented the second bullfighting of bulls.
The billboard included Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista, who would face a Castilblanco bull.
Therefore, the Festival was only regular on Fridays.
On this occasion it was Daniel Luque who triumphed, cutting out three ears and being brought out in triumph, after having toured with taste and aesthetics.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante completed his two bullfightings collecting greetings and an ear, granted more by the public than by merit of the bullfighting itself.
The worst of all was El Juli, passing by the Los Llanos arena without glory and pain.
With the second bull, after a tremendous mule, he earned the whistles of most of the audience.
A truck with two thousand kilos of hash passes the checkpoint in Alava
Five minus ten in the morning.
Officers are intimidating the alt to the two occupants of a van that instead of stopping they run away.
Officers have alerted the alt to the two occupants of a van who instead of stopping gave themselves to the escape.
Their cargo, more than two tons of hash, is a good reason not to stop.
The officers after chasing them, manage to arrest one of the two occupants, a man about 28 years old, identified as A. A. J., as reported in the statement of the Department of Interior of the Basque government.
The arrested individual is accused of drug trafficking and falsification of public documents.
The incident occurred when some Alava road officials were carrying out a transport check on the N-1, at the point where it crosses the Armiën municipal district.
They were about to stop a van for inspection when the driver, transgressing orders, abruptly accelerated and crossed the checkpoint.
The officers went in pursuit until the vehicle, after a couple of kilometers, stopped on the edge of the road and its two occupants ran off to a wooded area.
Ertzaintza agents were then able to arrest one of the fugitives and seize the 2,178 kilograms of hash they carried and took note of once the van, an Iveco Daily, was inspected.
Hashish panets, which were located at the rear of the vehicle, were subsequently placed in police custody for an in-depth investigation and weight detection.
Moreover, since officials found that the freshman had been "duplicated" because it did not coincide with the one reported in the van's documentation, the arrest was also charged with the crime of falsification of public documents.
Ertzaintza is continuing the investigation to arrest the second suspect, who has managed to escape as already mentioned, and to determine the provenance of the seized drug.
Inmate A. A. J., aged 28, was taken to the police station to carry out the appropriate procedures and be available to the judge in the next few hours.
Arrested actress Heather Locklear for driving under the influence of drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, Amanda of the popular Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the influence of drugs.
A witness saw her perform risky maneuvers while trying to get out of the parking lot in Montecito, as revealed to People magazine by a California road spokesman.
The witness specified that around 4.30 p.m. Locklear "crushed down the accelerator, making a lot of noise, and trying to get the car out of the parking lot with abrupt maneuvers back and forth. Backwarding, it passed several times in front of its sunglasses."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who at first sight, apparently, had not recognized the actress, saw that Locklear had stopped in a nearby street and had come out of the vehicle.
It was this person who alerted emergency services, because "he was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, he found the actress sitting inside his vehicle, partially blocking the road.
"She seemed confused," and for this reason the agents led her to a specialist drug and alcohol center to submit her to a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress proved collaborative and the assumption of excess alcohol was discarded from the outset, although "according to what the officers observed at first, we believe Locklear was under the influence of some drug."
Locklear was arrested with suspicion of driving under the effect of some not better specified substance and was locked up in the local prison around 7:00 p.m., to be released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear had been re-established from a specialist clinic in Arizona after being admitted following an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian Federation of the IU to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The general coordinator of the UI and member of the Izquierda Unida party, Gaspar Llamazares, confirmed today that it will be up to the regional federation of training to take a decision on the case of the former Youth and Sport Councillor of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week following the accusation of clientelism.
"In these cases I am particularly federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities," Llamazares said as regards the resolution that the party will have to adopt regarding what has been councillor on the council of Seville to date.
However, the UI leader stressed the need for "transparency" in all possible investigations regarding the irregularities that Silva would have committed. "The UI has always wanted this type of investigation to be transparent."
Similarly he stressed that training is regulated by "very strict ethical codes for all public office."
"Sangre de mayo", Garci's epic bet
Inspired by Episodios Nacionales by Benito Pérez Galdós, Jose Luis Garci presents in Sangre de mayo the famous Spanish revolt against the French, in what is the most ambitious film of his filmography, with almost 15 million euros of budget.
With this film, the director attempted to "illustrate the torrent of characters and at the same time the social analysis" that he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of a large cast of performers.
Sangre de mayo, more than two and a half hours long, debuts this Friday in cinemas, to become in the future a television miniseries of more than four hours on TeleMadrid.
A great admirer of the literature of Galdós, Jose Luis Garci claims to have realized with this film "a dream of his childhood", and believes he must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid had commissioned him three years before shooting a commemorative film for the second centenary of May 2, medrilegno. The director had accepted as long as the story was based on the novel Episodios Nacionales.
The 15 million budgets allocated in full by the Community of Madrid have represented for Garci a "unique opportunity" to recreate the appropriate scenery and costumes to portray a "a stunned Spain that wronged the choice of the leader to fight for and the fact that the struggle for independence brought the people a huge delay in development under the reign of Ferdinand VII," said Garci.
However, the director regrets that he did not receive funding equal to those of Alatriste or Los phantoms de Goya - more than double that of Sangre de mayo, so it was not possible to shoot some scenes scheduled by the set that he himself had signed with Horacio Valcarcel, a collaborator of almost all his career.
This, for the director of Volver a empezar, has influenced what is his usual work practice, the staging with the actors, with whom he often uses to try before shooting with those who will not be part of the cast, because he considers it "humiliating," considering that "part of the director's work lies in going to theater and cinema to know what is happening in the sector in which he works."
Many of the performers, part of whom are part of the cast of Sangre de mayo, try in front of his car, as in the case of Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Candidate for the Oscar four times - winning one - Garci believes that none of the three films nominated to represent Spain this year at the Academy of Hollywood - his Sangre de mayo, Siete mesas de billar francés and, the last selected Los sunflowers ciegos - do not represent the youngest generation of Spanish cinema "which should instead be known."
From this film Garci does not expect awards.
"At first you think you're working for posterity, then you realize that you only work for prosperity, and at one point you conform to just filming an extra film," explains Garci after more than 30 years of career.
Isabel Bayon rediscovers the sivilian essence of the dancer Tortola Valencia
A Seville dancer pays tribute to another equally Seville dancer.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, Catalan father (Florence Tortola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgena Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district, and at the age of three he moved with his family to London.
She was a free dance dancer and a specialist in oriental dances.
She led a fascinating life and was a pioneer of female emancipation, the likes of Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was Buddhist and vegetarian, and defended the cause for the abolition of the corset that prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman, who marked a revolution in dance and aesthetics in Europe between the two wars, has always fascinated Isabel Bayon.
"I would have liked to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me. I seemed incredible."
She supports the dancer: "We do not demand to tell her whole life, but to gather her spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested to me some basic elements of flamenco.
Thus, "la danza de la mariposa" suggested me a guajira, or "la danza de la serpiente" some tango.
His dance was sensual and I was told that even my way of dancing is part of this aesthetic," he explains.
The staging includes two outstanding contributions: that of Miguel Poveda, who will sing Isabel again in one of his shows, such as the face in "La puerta abierta"; and that of the teacher Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with what had been his pupil.
"Matilde plays Tortola as an adult, the character of maturity.
I am happy because he has agreed to work in my work and I feel very honored about this."
The set also includes the musical composition and guitarists such as Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, Miguel Ortega's singing, Pulga y Moi di Morón; El Pájaro's percussion, as well as Rafa La Viola's viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfran Juárez "who plays the role of eternal companion of these artists who have been divas to the full, and who have always had many suitors."
In the work is also present in some form the life of this woman that takes place in distant places, especially for that time, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then the whole of Europe, because, usually, she resided in London.
"I wanted to remember her, because I think she is one of the women who have had a huge influence in a given historical period and now no one remembers her and even less considers her work as something of value," says Bayon.
The show will begin today, at 8.30 p.m. at the theatre of Lope de Vega.
With the publication of the "Diary of a poet recien casado" the Triennio is also closed
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado" at the Church of Saint Stephen (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Council of Culture of the Junta of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for literature and the death of both.
Thus, the "Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" concludes with the re-edition of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel House-Museum and with the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: Aquel chopo de luz", which was inaugurated last May and which, after touching the various provinces of Andalusia, is expected to arrive in New York in conjunction with the International Congress.
In addition, the Council of Culture of the Junta of Andalusia has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado", edited by Pietro Tabernero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, to continue the diffusion of the figure and work of one of the highest-value Andalusian poets.
America likes it a little less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
The phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Ausencia de Malicia" and gives the idea of the impotence of American cinema, and of all America, in the face of the shocking idea that Newman has left.
And yet it cost him a lot to give him an Oscar.
And since 2007, he was retired.
And it was also known that he was very ill.
Despite this, it was a very hard blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels goes beyond any expression, and I have now lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country have been better because of its existence."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or overreacting.
A father of cinema and homeland died at a particularly dark time, because of the fear of terrorists and markets, with the self-esteem of the American people on the ground, desperate for new motivations to feel worthy.
When times are so difficult, men so without virtue and remain well people to admire, you don't need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For everyone it embodied the Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and defender of lost and won causes, from the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honor of the first-born overdose dead at the creation of the home and biological food brand.
All gifts to a country that has cost a lot to go beyond a suicidal food culture.
The wave of admiration went beyond Hollywood, without caring for either nationality or passports.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, noted that no man died, an era ended.
Another Englishman, Sam Mendes, an Oscar-winning director, said that working with Newman constituted nothing less than the peak of his career.
The bad boy who arrived from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Paul Newman his greatest inspiration.
"He left an example of the highest level for all of us," notes George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today tries to live as Paul Newman did: keeping in high consideration the need for rectitude and having a serious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or possible in today's media jungle.
However, some try and Paul Newman sets a good example for them.
He divorced once but remained married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he remained faithful while certainly not missing the opportunity not to be.
"Why am I eating out burgers today, if I have a steak in my house?" he used to joke.
In heaven he is accompanied by the pride that his daughters on earth are also his admirers, something not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he played, he was as proud of no one as he was of his devoted husband, loving father, solicitous grandfather and passionate philanthropist," they say.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that sooner or later the Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed attempt for 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I'd say no!
They called it the "perfect race," but in my opinion it was by far the worst I've witnessed.
A lot of nonsense, that if they were later taken into consideration at the time of the evaluation and I had to examine them, the answer would be absolutely negative.
But let's go in order and start from the beginning.
The nonsense began with the withdrawal of the ridge, which assumed that we went sooner.
It didn't sound like the wrong idea, but if they force you to go, it's to pick up everything (including the chip to avoid queues during the race).
No, you're not.
You had to go only to take the dorsal (first nonsense, go only for this) and (after its tail), surprise! they had t-shirts only size 'S' (second nonsense, because I need a size XL).
What world do we live in?
Is it because of the crisis that they decided to buy only small T-shirts, made with less fabric and therefore less expensive?
Well, things like this are idle compared to the very day of the race.
In addition to having to go very early to get the chip, the waiting queue was 15 minutes and, moreover, you had to deposit the backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a run that more than 11,000 people expect.
So, as was predictable, the race began that we had not even deposited the backpack yet, although, once successful in the enterprise, the recovery was even worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the wait of more than 40 minutes, to which were added attempts of popular rebellion and assault on the stand.
In at least 500 people tomorrow we will definitely have pneumonia, and some, like me, will not even be in the rankings in correct order because of the chip that, I guess did not register the arrival correctly.
In the future, if they ask me about the perfect race, this will certainly not enter my thoughts.
So I think we will continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft seeks receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT conference on emerging technologies, Microsoft premiered a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a sort of artificial intelligence, but without much intelligence, able to perform some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or, in the case illustrated by Microsoft, a shuttle service to move within the company's campus) assisting the telephone user.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" is able to know how many people there are in a room, who they are - including remembering their position in the company - and to listen to and understand the keywords in a conversation with them.
It can also group those present into conversation groups.
In the example video the receptionist detects a third person, but understands that he does not belong to the group he is talking to and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks her if she is there to visit someone and tells her that she will be at her disposal shortly.
All without blue screen.
Impressive.
But this, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better to focus on, for example on the next version of its Windows operating system.
Much has been said this week about a change of strategy in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers were equipped with essential functions and less loaded with commercial garbage, they would go five times faster – hey! Steve, it will be for "the least".
All a discovery, if you take into account that Microsoft, version after version has continuously added to Windows functionality and "extra".
The change of direction is appreciable.
Microsoft is right: the operating system is increasingly losing importance, and with it the software.
When Google launched Chrome into the network, I was one of those who supported the theory that it was Google’s first step to compete with Windows.
Many rightly point out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is an essential element for hardware and software to communicate.
He performs the same function as your wife or husband when you have something to say to his mother-in-law.
It's true.
It will never disappear, but perhaps it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but relative.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People pay less and less attention to the operating system, and more and more to the Web browser.
You take your computer just to launch Explorer or Firefox – or Chrome – and spend more time daily browsing the network than in a remote window environment.
What are half the operating system applications for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less overload, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services to provide a valid alternative to Google.
They're desperate for it, actually, and I'm bringing back a little example here.
I took the photograph inserted in this post in one of the recreation venues for Microsoft employees, in Redmond, earlier this month.
On the soda machine a sign urges them to use their own research tool - "Your research. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study came to the conclusion that 66% of Microsoft employees use Google to perform a search online.
Last week, moreover, the delay in developing the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
It will not be put on the market in the early months of 2009, but probably at the end of the year, if not even in 2010.
Microsoft will definitely try to jointly launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The mobile phone, after all, is becoming more and more a computer.
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already on the market, is penalizing.
La Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso brought her to the French Riviera, Leonardo di Caprio shined in Edward Zwick's 'Diamante de Sangre', as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' as well as being part of the uniform typical of the muscular gay parish.
And if we try to enumerate the star appearances, we can recall the image of the forzuto with the pointed mustache that raises the weights in the walking circus.
It is, in essence, the typical men's shirt, with the inside of cotton, tight and sleeveless.
It is the 'tank', as the Englishphones call it, though, Belgian Fabuleux Marcel stands out above all.
The "Marcel" excels against the others for the high quality of cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive coat of arms and for the small Belgian flag (just recognizable), which the most emblematic models of the shirt carry as detail on the neck.
The "Marcel" excels over the others for the high quality of cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive coat of arms and for the small Belgian flag (just recognizable), which the most emblematic t-shirt models carry as detail on the neck.
And be careful, because the production of the Belgian company is not just about the famous "tanks".
It also includes college sweatshirts, retro boxer, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, marinara shirts, baby-dolls, mini shorts...
Intimate garments designed to be comfortable.
And it's a shame to use them as underwear.
They're too good.
"I want to be a young mom, the candidate doesn't worry me"
The great resemblance to her sister did not prevent her from developing her personality.
Monica Cruz is small, but full of vitality.
Currently, the Cruz sisters have taken their new fashion business very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful girls and celebrities who lend their name.
She was in Paris for the promotion that the Mango signature made of her new home, as well as the presentation of the most important awards that the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Warm and shy, she'll get you fast.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that we designed my sister Penelope and I for the autumn-winter season of Mango, as well as to participate in the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and dinner at the Opera in honour of Valentino.
Let's say, a very intense day, but at the same time, exciting.
Where does your new Mango collection start in this fourth season of work for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I like the movies of the '50s and '60s, from here we get various inspirations.
Then, I love getting lost in the city and looking at how women dress, how they combine and mix their clothes. I do it frequently.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, even if in the end, everything flows together and there are many elements in common.
I, as a child, liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to go through my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was a bomb, even better than going to the playground.
Then, once a dancer, I always paid a lot of attention to dress.
It is known that dancers love to have their own style to go to class and essays, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And as an actress, when they give you the wardrobe, it's the moment you actually meet the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for designers and professionalism.
Not long ago, you turned 30, you went into a crisis?
But no.
Never felt better, I like the idea of 30 years.
I find that at that age women are mature and have a good experience to enjoy life by making fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done the things I wanted since I was little and that has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, you think you're a mother, don't you?
Of course, I know that I will be a mother because my own body asks me and I also want to be a young mom, I don't want to miss this.
As for the candidate, I don't worry too much.
What I'm going to do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with a lot of love.
As for the cinema, you're waiting for some films shot last year to go out to different theaters.
That's right, and I really want them out.
Being a woman who comes from the theater, I am very impatient and restless, I would like everything immediately and clearly, but it cannot always be so.
I want him to go out "La última hora" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo".
Let's see if you'll like them.
A few days ago, you debuted on the catwalk with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I was on the runway as a model.
Simply Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a long time, called me to invite me to go to London to attend a charity show for her organization "Women for a better world" and the clothes we exhibited – I brought two pieces of our collection for Mango – were auctioned up to raise funds for this Naomi NGO.
People don't know this soft side of Naomi.
So many things are said about her, that I, who have known her for a long time, can confirm that they are not so true.
Also, I find myself with this good part in which you are involved.
He asked me to parade for a noble cause, but if he had asked me to make pine, I would have done it anyway.
If it's to help third world women, you can't back out.
Relapsed drivers of alcoholism will have to install the "alcoholock"
The Ministry of the Interior requires that drivers with three administrative penalties for excessive blood alcohol, install in his car the system that prevents driving the drunk vehicle or if you do not blow into the appropriate device.
The measure was announced last June and is already included in the annual report of the State Attorney General, according to which it will be a pilot project lasting one year.
The aim of this project is the reintegration of the driver, since he will have to attend a rehabilitation course on the road.
In addition to the Public Prosecutor General for Road Safety, the Directorate General for Traffic (DGT) and the Fondazione Istituto Tecnologico per la Safety dell'Automobile (FITSA) will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists reported more than once for drunk driving then returns to drive the car.
Alcoholock would avoid it, because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in the exhaled air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not blow, or when a higher concentration of alcohol is detected than that allowed.
The cost is higher than 1000 euros and would be borne by the sanctioned person.
In this respect, a study carried out in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with such devices could reduce the infringements committed during the first year of introduction by up to 65%.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people a year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to curb these behaviours before they become criminal offences.
And to facilitate their development, since legal reform can be carried out on an ordinary basis, and, no doubt, the reform necessary for criminal proceedings would require organic law.
However, the device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, although it has already been introduced experimentally in some industrial and public vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on a PSOE initiative in which it intends to install this system in school buses, as has already been done in France.
In Mexico, and without "peep-toes"
With British punctuality, at 5:40 p.m., second program, the Spanish plane on which the Asturias princes were travelling landed in the presidential hangar at Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico City.
The sun was setting but the rays still forced the hand to be used as a visor to see the royal couple get off the plane.
At the foot of the ladder, the Spanish ambassador and the other authorities.
A few hours earlier I had asked a taxi driver, on the street, if he knew that the Spanish princes were going to visit the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very well, so you can't go to the airport to load people at that time... you're from here or...
No, no, sir, you're Spanish, but you lived here for a couple of years.
- Ah, very well...
The Mexican press, on the other hand, knows very well who the principles of Asturias and the importance of travel are.
There are many who wait in the airport hangar crushed to the red carpet and the military cordon made up of 27 navy soldiers who offer the honorary salute.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in sea blue, and she, the princess, hair in the wind, very sober, does not use her usual "peep-toes," perhaps told her that in Mexico City she threatened bad weather.
They give photographers a smile and a short stop before passing through the room where the official group is waiting for them.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest in the city, a funny Mexican television reporter is waiting for them.
The best award offered by fashion
There is probably no place in the world more appropriate to present a fashion award, than Paris and probably there is no more exquisite designer and Valentine's bont vivan.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to promote the international promotion of new talents in the field of fashion.
It offers a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her drawings in the Mango showcase at number 54 of Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried from emotion.
Moreover, it is the second largest store in Europe and has just been opened with 1,335 square metres of extension.
The first is in London.
The many events, together with the desire to please the designer Valentino who presided over the jury of the competition, began with a luxury dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
With the proximity of Chagal's most exquisite canvases, the gala presidential table prepared by Mango, was even more spectacular.
Born, with a broken heart and making virtue of necessity, due to his brother's recent death, he wore a house dress and some ELAH complements to take his breath away and on the arm of his son Luis - a big boy almost two meters tall - accompanied Valentino to the presidency of the homage dinner.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, did the house honors and as a knight whom he finished, along with Baron Rotchil, without jacket, because both had surrendered them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who managed the shop in trousers and shirts – designed by her hand – turned for dinner, wearing a long black dress very sensual and was excited during the night walk accompanied by Goya Toledo inside the opera, when we were shown the room for the ballet essays and she, remembering other times, grabbed a bar and sketched a "grand plie".
Inés Sastre did not stop for a walk in the premises of the building, but had shown us earlier photos of her son on her cell phone.
The next day we rejoiced at the presence of Olivier Martinez – another big boy who moves in motion – and John Travolta, who had arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and made sure before, that there were no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, there's the way.
1001, the antistress number
There are not 1,000 but 1,000 and a way to forget the chaotic and hectic daily life.
And as if that were not enough, they are all collected in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock is almost a punishment when it rings every morning at 7 a.m. but it is even worse to imagine being involved in the hectic pace dictated by modern life.
The office is called tension and the computer's backache.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
However, there are not one or even two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the struggle to break away from the world of work.
No, this number amounts to nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Beyond the yoga positions, the classic massage or the "spa" treatments, Susannah Marriott collects in the pages of her book, all a "menu" of options tailored to each's taste and time.
The anti-stress work is titled "1001 ways to relax" and its calm will reach the bookstores thanks to publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to conquer calmness in areas such as work or personal relations, this "manual" denies this belief.
In addition, it suggests alternative solutions, such as being in contact with nature, or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline doesn't already flow into your veins to regain body balance and stress has become a problem, it's time to sit on the couch, turn your mind off and focus on reading.
Talking in your sleep
Some children talk during the night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very agitated to tell us something that happened to them the previous day, but to those children who speak while remaining asleep.
The first time that happens, at most you get a fright, but it doesn't really matter.
It is a benign alteration of sleep called somniloquium.
It occurs with a certain frequency, especially in children and adolescents.
Surely, most of you have been told that you spoke in your sleep.
This phenomenon can occur in a very sporadic way (once in life, for example associated with a high fever episode) or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the next day the child no longer remembers anything.
There is no single reason to explain this phenomenon.
Sometimes there are episodes related to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night fears, night enuresis (weeing in bed), or sleepwalking, but not necessarily so.
As mentioned above, it may be associated with very high fever stages, situations of stress or overexcitement.
In any case, it is still a phenomenon that has not been studied.
The intensity with which it appears is also extremely variable.
It can happen that the person speaks with a very quiet tone of voice, with loose words, almost in a whisper or that the opposite happens (screams, screams, long speeches ...).
In cases where the event is particularly intense, it would be appropriate to observe the child and possibly consult a specialist to check if there is any issue that is generating an abnormal state of anxiety as an outlet to the situation.
We have said that this is a benign alteration so there is no treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders that can be treated (for example, if coupled with insomnia or stress situation).
What can be done, on the other hand, is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child too much before he goes to sleep.
Propose quiet games and avoid programs or television series that arouse fear or suggest violence.
With very nervous children for whom it is tiring to relax, you can use relaxation techniques to help them acquire some inner calm.
This will allow the child to sleep more quietly.
Once the sonniloquies appear try to keep calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day they will remember nothing of what happened.
Useful tips
Don't wake him up.
It's useless, because he's not aware of what's going on, and you'd disrupt his sleep.
Although he's talking, he's asleep, so he's resting.
Remember that if he appears very distressed and the episodes have a certain frequency it is better to consult a doctor or check where such great anxiety comes from in the child.
If you understand what it says (which is not the most common situation), do not fall into the temptation to question him for information.
You will get nothing, because he is asleep and therefore unconscious to organize his thought.
In addition, you are able to hear what he says but not to see what he is dreaming to say, so you have to pay close attention to the interpretation of the information and to the conclusions to which these could lead.
Never tell the child that you could ask him questions during the night to know his secrets.
Not even a joke.
Something like this is causing enormous distress.
In short, don't worry, it's nothing serious, it's an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
The Illhaeusern has finally found the way to victory at home after a long unsuccessful period.
Without playing a formidable game, the Black-Yellows created the most number of networking opportunities by transforming one into the game's win.
The pace was not very sustained during this encounter in which the strikers hardly expressed themselves.
After a first attempt by guest team captain Kauffmann who crossed seven with a shot from a distance, the Illhaeusern began to win and one after the other provoked the defense of Dannemarie, Fonderflick from a distance, then Hirn alto, Romain di pointe and still Diebold.
The Dannemarie responded with a block in the middle of the field, leaving only the wild Riahi at the point of attack.
The start of the second half was decisive with two initial occasions signed Riahi and Temporale for the Dannemarie, and immediately after Marais's first net for the well-placed Illhaeusern, he resumed a ball rejected on a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But Illhaeusern's gunner will not be able to enjoy his happiness for long and will be expelled a dozen minutes later leaving his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But the Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not pose big problems to the Eleven of the Illhaeusern, just backed to "strengthen" the defense, except in the last few minutes of the game when, after a strong action, the ball touched the cross.
Sarkozy meets fishermen in anger
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a stop in Brittany.
In the face of the demonstration of fishermen who on Monday have brutally prevented access to several Breton and Norman ports, the President of the Republic decided to go to the port of Guilvinec, in the department of Finistère, on Tuesday morning to enchant its representatives.
The latter have promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hope that he will "present himself with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that takes place precisely at the same time as the general assembly of the "crisis committee", created by the Breton fishermen in order to take measures to cope with the surge in the price of diesel, which has reached its record with an average of more than 1,14 euros per litre.
According to Elysée spokesman David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them about possible solutions to help businesses regain competitiveness and to secure working conditions and the remuneration of sailors".
Fishermen wait for Nicolas Sarkozy to stand still.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted "snail operations" in Morbihan and Calvados, causing almost 10 km of traffic jams.
The port of Quiberon has also been blocked, but the connections to Belle-île have not been interrupted.
On the Quiberon Peninsula a roadblock has been implemented.
On Monday the sailors have already demonstrated their determination by burning, from dawn, tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots at the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to the ports of the Atlantic coast and the Channel, such as Sables d'Olonne, in the Vendée, where the vessels remained at the pier, or in Havre, where about twenty boats prevented the movement of trade ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe et del Croisic, near the Loire Atlantica, interrupted in the evening the blockade of Donges' famous Total refinery.
In Boulogne-sur-Mer they decided to wait for the meeting to be held on Wednesday at the ministry to decide on possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will decide on Tuesday the future actions of the movement and the possible participation in the meeting planned for the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by those responsible for the National Fisheries Committee, who did not support the movement.
"The strike will continue" as "fishers will not give up" and "are not going to move to Paris", announced, for example, Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre, but estimate that the efficiency limit of a boat is reached only with a diesel of less than 0,30 euro per litre.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
The unforgettable interpreter of "Butch Cassidy" died of cancer, aged 83, in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary et Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and again Sam Mendes greeted film legend and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains delivery forecasts in 2008
The aircraft manufacturer counts 215 deliveries this year, despite the threats of recession that weigh on the world economy.
Embraer, the fourth world company in the industry, maintains delivery forecasts for 2008 with the delivery of 215 aircraft, confirmed its president Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first semester, he delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian company relies heavily on the Chinese market, particularly for aircraft in the range of 30 to 120 seats.
Until now, Embraer delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would sell more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group insurance company, re-established by the American monetary authorities, would yield more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the US$85 billion loan, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
The IGA is ready to consider the sale of most of its activities, in addition to the sale of life insurance branches to the international market and the United States, the paper specifies on the basis of more than authoritative sources.
The Board of Directors of the IGA met on Sunday evening to consider any disposals, according to the FT.
No confirmation was obtained at the AIG.
The assets that the AIG intends to divest include the International Lease Financial Corp. air leasing subsidiary, its 59% stake in the Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and its investments in private equity, adds the FT.
No final decision has been taken on these supplies, the FT continues.
The AIG must quickly find liquidity in order to repay the 85 billion loan granted to it by the Federal Reserve, at the cost of seeing the American authorities take over 80% of its capital.
Paris: Morning Meeting history
The New York Stock Exchange suffered a historic collapse on Monday, after the House of Representatives spoke out against the Paulson plan to rescue financial institutions: the Dow Jones lost 6,98%, that is a decrease never seen, approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Media (DJIA) finished at 10,365.45, down by 777.68 points.
In terms of points, the worst loss in its history (684.81 points) higher than that of September 17, 2001, the day of the reopening of the Stock Exchanges following the terrorist attacks of September 11.
Nasdaq, the index of major technological titles, lost 199.61 points closing to 1,983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 8.81% (or 106.85 points) closing to 1,106.55, according to the final closing figures.
Demoralized at the start of the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection of the bank bailout plan, designed to restore stability to the markets.
By 228 votes against the plan and 205 in favour, the representatives rejected the funding requested by Treasury Minister Trésor Henry Paulson.
About two out of three Republicans rejected the plan.
"It's a negative signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza, of FTN Financial.
"All this indicates how much the market was counting on the project," he added, fearing that in a few days it might already be "too late" to adopt one.
"If the project were actually dying (...) then the witness would be quickly transferred to the Fed – Federal Reserve – and to the other central banks to resolve the crisis, which would further limit credit conditions," said Brian Bethune, head of finance and economics at Global Insight.
And highlighting the state of emergency again, "every day that passes leads to the collapse of a financial institution" in the United States, the Piegza stressed.
After the failure of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities organized Wachovia's purchase of banking activities by rival Citygroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, urging urgent intervention in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets "are not only faced with an American crisis, but with a global crisis," FTN Financial analyst added.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The return on the 10-year Treasury Coupons declined to 3.632%, compared with 3.827% on Friday evening, while the 30-year Treasury Coupons fell to 4.161%, compared with 4.357% on the previous day.
Obama ahead of first TV duel
After the first debate on Friday between the two White House candidates, here is a second to know who, between John McCain and Barack Obama, was the winner.
Without any surprise, Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed the respective victory of the TV duel, followed by a third of American families.
Politologist David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, though worthy, was not brilliant enough to enable him to curb the drop in polls five weeks after the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, of which an opinion poll published on Saturday gives Obama a five-point lead (49% versus 44% for McCain), shows that the Democrat has had the upper hand.
An instant poll conducted by CbsNews on an undecided voter champion, found that 39% of them believe Obama to be the winner, while 25% points to McCain.
An excellent performance by his listmate Joe Biden, expected during the first and only debate with rival Sarah Palin, should confirm Obama's advantage on Thursday.
"Underestimating it would be a mistake.
He has a good intuition," however warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
Seventy-year-old McCain has never stopped promoting his unquestionable experience in foreign policy, stressing the opponent's "ingenuity" regarding the topics addressed during the first face-to-face.
"Senator Obama does not seem to understand that." he has often stated on multiple occasions.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and expertise to become president," he assured.
What has been a constant target for the Republican television campaign since yesterday.
Obama, for his part, stressed that his election would represent a new future.
Without lengthening, it proved concise and precise.
He has promoted his willingness to make the right decisions and his intention to restore the image of the United States on the world stage.
"McCain never understood, unlike Obama," he rebutted, this weekend, a democratic spot, reprimanding the Republican for not taking the necessary measures to cope with the impact of the financial crisis on the American people.
During the ninety-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, yesterday he denounced Obama, in front of 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina, in a pouring rain, for an election meeting.
He didn't even say the words "average class" or "workers." The financial crisis goes in favor of Obama, considered by Americans as the most suitable person to save the economy on the edge of the precipice.
"Next week could be a turning point," he considered, yesterday, influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's economic intuition to that demonstrated by Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current collapse "is the final verdict after eight years of bad economic policy adopted by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
Reiterating the intention to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite Wall Street riots, Illinois Senator also mentioned among his priorities the achievement of a possible energy independence of the country thanks to the promotion of renewable energy and the implementation of a health insurance system.
McCain, for his part, would build a 45 nuclear centre park by 2030.
Carefully, the two candidates dodged questions focused on the $700 billion (EUR 470 billion) financial rescue plan adopted last night by Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "did you notice there was an election?"
Young people and opponents manifested Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to contest in advance the results of the legislatures.
A few hundred Belarusians met on Sunday evening immediately after the closing of the polling stations in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent character of the legislatures.
While the results were still expected, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "the dictator, resign".
Some confess that they didn't even vote: "What's the point? They'll do what they want, of my vote," says a young man.
They do not believe that that regime which has made a good impression before foreign observers with the aim of resuming dialogue with the European Union is ready to embark on a democratic breakthrough.
The sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian executives and the freezing of assets, could be removed if these elections were considered legitimate by observers.
They weren't, according to the opposition.
"We were removed from the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the stripping of votes," complained Iouri Potemkine, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous alliance of twelve parties.
" It's a façade change, says Alexandre Milinkievitch, former candidate of the opposition to the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is who counts the ballots and in this case is the executive.
If Members of the opposition enter Parliament, it is because they have been appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into parliament may involve a television space, regional meetings and legislative proposals."
The opposition therefore has a duty to enter the political game because "it is necessary to start the dialogue with the European Union.
For if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, is in crisis, and we do not provide any reform, we risk becoming a Russian protectorate.
Now we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the organisation for security and cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process will recognise the validity of the ballot.
He stressed that participation rates seemed too high, and that the generalisation of the vote in advance (26% of voters in Minsk) gave rise to all kinds of manipulation.
"Did you not notice that there were elections? Asks social-democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released this year, in August.
There was no one at the polling stations.
And there must have been at most five Members of the opposition to parliament, the most convenient in power."
Night silence falls on the square in October.
On television, President Loukachenko and members of the Central Election Commission welcome their success.
The meeting - Blood is safe again
Héma-Québec celebrated yesterday the tenth anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Dr FrancineDécary, had every reason to rejoice, as Héma-Québec has become one of the most secure and effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, it regained public confidence, seriously shaken by the scandal of infected blood in the years between 1980 and 1990.
As we know, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were infected with the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C in the 1980s.
Faced with such a tragedy and population protests, the government of Canada conducted in February 1994 a public investigation, led by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to the spread of recommendations to prevent the recurrence of such a disaster.
While Judge Krever was late to draw up a report, some provinces set up a committee with the aim of designing a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this mandate was carried out by the Gélineau Committee.
Following the Gélineau et Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to provide Québec and Société canadienne du sang (Canadian Blood Society) for all other provinces and territories.
In 1998, when Héma-Québec started its activities, just 38% of people said they still had confidence in the donations system in Québec, recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was mortifying.
Thanks to continued efforts to improve the safety of blood samples and field research over the following years, we have regained public confidence," he explains before saying proudly that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the population of Quebec now had confidence in Héma-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary is convinced that "confidence is something extremely fragile".
Since its creation on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At the time, there were numerous cases in Europe of the human variant of mad cow disease, a new manifestation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which has been the president since 1998, the year of the foundation.
"And we absolutely did not know if that disease could be transmitted through infected blood.
It was therefore based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélinau reports, that when doubts arise and a serious illness may arise, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which manifests itself with a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, is taken with exclusion measures.
In April 1999, the blood of those who had spent more than a month in the United Kingdom since 1980 was rejected.
Now, for a few years, it has been shown that this disease is no doubt transmitted through infected blood.
This episode thus showed us that it made sense to apply the precautionary principle."
In 1999 a much more efficient technique for the detection of HIV appeared on the market: nucleic acid (TAN) tests that allow the presence of the virus in donors' blood to be recognized directly and not the presence of antibodies against the virus, on which instead the tests used until then were based.
The TANs have allowed the window period to be reduced, i.e. from the moment the person contracted the disease to the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood thanks to our techniques, explains the specialist.
That period could be reduced to less than one week.
The risk of ignoring the presence of infected donors and of not being able to detect them has thus decreased considerably.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS with a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
"In other words, this means that 12 million blood samples will have to be distributed before anyone is infected with the HIV virus.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400 000 and 500 000 blood samples each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmitted with a transfusion occurs.
I believe that today one can feel calm in receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover health, says the head of the Héma-Québec management.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen will emerge in the system.
No later than a year ago the Chikungunya virus appeared on Réunion Island, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted in the blood by an insect.
"We must be constantly vigilant," continues Dr. Décary before pointing out that in addition to having secure resources, Héma-Québec must also provide sufficient resources.
"Needs increase as the population ages.
Because cancer treatment is more aggressive, patients often need a supply of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population also has consequences for the number of donors, which on average accounts for only 3% of the Québec population acceptable as donors."
However, all healthy people who are 18 years of age and meet eligibility criteria may donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who offer themselves as donors are not accepted, because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have travelled to a country where the latter is widespread, they will be rejected for a period of one year.
"With this 3% we manage to maintain an inventory capable of responding to the needs of hospitals.
Shortcomings are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this group of donors as they grow older and can no longer make donations.
Now it is difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all to restrain them and incite them to become regular donors.
Nowadays life is so frenetic that it is hardly an hour to donate blood," says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec distributes not only blood samples, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, eye globes and skin heart valves that are used almost exclusively for severe burns.
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before being deposited with Héma-Québec which operates the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
In the umbilical cord, which was once considered a biomedical waste, abounds in blood rich in stem cells that can serve to cure serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the insertion in the bank of our thousandth sample of cordon blood and we plan to take more than a thousand each year.
You should start proposing them for transplants early next year," says Dr. Décary who describes this practice of collecting cordon blood as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that they cannot have access to it," because Héma-Québec does not have the means to propose this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Football - The Impact in semifinal
The Impact Montréal qualified for the semi-final of the A-series eliminations, winning 3-1 against the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during a second decisive game of the quarterfinals, at the Saputo Stadium.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal at 90'.
After a first half without goal on both sides, David Testo and Rocco Placentino scored the following goals for Montreal.
For the Sounders, Roger Levesque was ready to mark Matt Jordan.
Let's remember that at the first game of the outward-return, Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat to the Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in the outskirts of Seattle.
The Impact will face the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
Saturday night in Minnesota, Thundler filled a first 3-1 in the return game winning 4–3, but Whitecaps will still participate in the semi-final.
The Impact will face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but more details will be confirmed in the day.
In brief - Kovalev's decisive network
The Canadian and its aces are ready to start the season again.
The trio formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the offensive game phase by winning 3–2 against the Panthers, Florida, last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the star of the first match, scored a goal, made two passes, and picked up a pass for victory, in the fourth of the Hab's preparatory games.
The only net signed by Kovalev was decisive for the victory.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian warned.
I need another game to feel comfortable."
"He tried to overdo it in the first period, noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the outcome of the game.
There's been a good ovation."
Charest points to the North
The Prime Minister does not rule out the start of elections before the end of the year.
The Liberal Party General Council concluded, Jean Charest went yesterday to Jean-Talon, Quebec where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc, (left) attempts to be elected during today's partial election.
"Enlarge the borders of our last great north frontier": this is Jean Charest's long-term ambition, presented yesterday in Levis, by means of instruments with a strong visual impact, on the occasion of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec.
Behind him, during his speech, the projection of a sort of "image mill".
On three large screens, they were confused with the spectacular negatives of hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec images seen with "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Large means like in the middle of the election campaign.
During the press conference, moreover, the Prime Minister refused to exclude the start of the autumn elections, although he pointed out that he was very busy.
The "North Plan" is the fourth point of a "project" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a first agreement with France on labour, a second agreement between Canada and Europe and other agreements with Ontario.
Often named in the Prime Minister's most recent speeches, the opening of the North—the northern territory to the 49th parallel— had never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister merely explained why the North would be "a jewel with immense potential", but did not comment on timing or investment quotas, as he did not explain what the precise priorities will be in the implementation of future projects.
At the very least, he merely pointed out what he felt to be a priority: hydroelectricity, forests, but above all the mining sector, which has experienced several improvements following the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
According to Charest's list, the North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titan, and even diamonds".
That "large territory twice as big as France", it's here, it's Quebec.
Not only is it here, but it is inherent in us," he insisted, as if to urge a national founding myth.
The foundations of Quebec are rooted in his relationship with the North, he stressed: gold fever in Abitibi, national engineering, James Bay.
"It's up to us, it's our future," he added, after a theatrical pause to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec territory, includes a part of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the Prime Minister said during the press conference.
" It is a position traditionally maintained by all governments.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a long time and, when the opportunity arises, I will reiterate that position in the name of the government," he pointed out.
After all," considering climate change, we must reassess the North," he said, talking about the passage of the northwest, which will be open throughout the year due to the melting of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister estimates that occupying the territory is a duty."
And the locals, the First Nations and the Inuits?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very careful about this and that the project would meet their interests, especially those of young people.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former MEP of the Hungarian FP), have already started consulting some thirty communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) plays an important role, started work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a great meeting," not necessarily a summit," but a time when "common visions will be provided"
The development of the North would follow the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "concerted, ordered and will respect the environment," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "project" as a continuum with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
"Like the liberals who have preceded us, we know how to stand out to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was also one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a great cocktail in honor of the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rebaptize the Beauharnois Central in the Adélard-Godbout Dam.
"From Godbout, creator of Hydro-Québec, to Lesage which nationalized hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, creator of Bay James, our party has always been able to forge the future," said Jean Charest.
During the press conference, she used another reference, conservative this time, the "Roads to the North" program by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Addressing the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Charest pointed out that its operation would be scheduled for 2012.
"All this remains between us, but I feel that we will make it," he confessed to his militants, arousing heartfelt applause.
In fact, the Prime Minister, who said there would be no elections in April 2008 and probably not even in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of starting a ballot in the autumn, which could happen in accordance with the law.
He stresses that he is certainly very committed, particularly on a federal council mission in China and in the Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend General Council provided the Liberal leader with a platform of nationalist resolutions, in particular of the "constitutional aspirations" that have passed smooth as oil: the PLQ calls above all for recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It also hopes that Quebec will appoint the members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that they will have a right of veto over the decisions taken in Quebec.
As far as the opposition is concerned, the draft of the North Plan has been sceptically accepted.
FP leader, Pauline Marois, dusted North Quebec Development Policy launched by the Landry government in 2001.
In your opinion, the Liberal Government, which came to power in 2003, would not have respected its application.
If he had," we would have progressed today," said Marois alongside Jean-Talon's candidate (scrutinium today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has stated its support for the adoption of the North Plan by the government.
"What we hope, is that all of this is not simply perceived as a spectacle," commented leader Sébastien Proulx, Mario Dumont's replacement, who is returning today from vacation.
Letters - A disgraced country
It was Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (irony of fate) of the Harper cabinet, who dared to declare last summer that Louise Arbor was a "shame" for Canada.
To dishonor in this way a woman who has fought incessantly for justice and who deserves all our admiration says much about both the entourage of the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper himself.
Here we are before a government that is the only one, of all the Western countries involved, not to have repatriated one of its citizens in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that takes no account of the fact that Omar Khadr was a mere teenager at the time when the accused facts occurred.
The only government that, despite signing the Geneva Convention, denies its word and lets a child-soldier rot in inhuman conditions.
The only one who trusts in a parody of justice to establish the guilt of the accused.
We recall, for information, that UNICEF, Amnesty international and the Canadian Bar, in particular, invoke the repatriation of Omar Khadra so that he can be subjected to a regular trial in Canada.
It is precisely that same government that closes its eyes to torture: it does not care very much that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps forever, after so many years of abuse.
We do not yet realize this, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, freedom and "democracy", a word that Harper does not stop flaunting and which sounds so senseless on his lips.
Here we are at the moment when there is no longer any moral: one can mistreat, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the discretion of a minority head of government until today (to see what will happen after October 14...).
Many voters believe that a party that preaches the Virtue, the Respect of the Law and the Order represents salvation: they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
This is where the shame lies, Mr. Toews, in giving up all this, and nowhere else.
Free opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian speech
In the September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from M. Patrick J. Garver, vice-president director of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Pursuing an Orwellian logic, the latter states that the world's largest aura company filed a six-million libel lawsuit against three authors and a small, squatted publishing house with the intention of starting a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of a libel lawsuit, but the law.
Without any surprise, this substantial difference is completely hidden by Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to ruin anyone who dares to stand up for a position contrary to his.
No matter the outcome of the trial, writers and publisher of the book Canada Nero will have to spend a large amount of money in order to organize their own defense and fight, with decidedly unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers financed from practically bottomless pockets of the mining company.
Moreover, in these fights with unequal weapons, the tactic is often to ruin the defendant in order to impose a consensual regulation that gag the opposition in addition to scaring anyone who dares to rule on the matter again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it is before the public that it should have presented its own vision of the facts.
Contrary to what happens in many countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada usually take place with the exchange of views and not with batons.
It would have been sufficient for the company to open its books, its documents, and to establish a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications and the funding of teams of independent researchers who could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to have too much confidence in public opinion and reluctantly rejects petitions and letters in support of the authors of Black Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can ask for a "public" debate when his contempt for that same audience is clearly evident?
In the vice-president's world, it seems that this word refers exclusively to the highly paid lawyers and not to the whole of the Canadians; here is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democratic system, even denigrators have the right to speak.
What Barrack Gold does not understand – or does not want to understand – is that the public supporting the authors and publishers of Black Canada does so first because it rejects the brutal means adopted by the mining company.
This audience is ready to listen to Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civil exchanges of opinion, and not from the perspective of what many perceive as a sort of gagging (seeking the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just given the authors of Black Canada an ultimatum inviting them to suspend the use of that word...)
Beyond Garver's surreal discourse, Barrack Gold's lawsuit constitutes a direct attack on university research freedom and the pursuit of truth, indispensable in every democratic society.
It denies in bulk the right to quote authentic sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which are the very basis of intellectual work.
If, in a country like Canada, it is impossible to study and discuss matters that are uncomfortable to the richest companies in the world, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following scientific standards as the authors of Black Canada do.
You have the right to reply.
For a long time, the university environment, of which we are part, has been able to handle debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
The excessive measures of Barrick Gold clearly show that, contrary to its claims, it is not seeking a transparent debate at all.
This is at the expense of the university world, as is the public debate in Canada itself, and it is high time that governments took measures to limit abusive lawsuits.
Operation - rescue for Wall Street – Dialogue between Republicans and Democrats
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, representatives of the Republican and Democratic deployment, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the greatest plan for saving-finance after the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the US $700 billion plan, which aims to curb the financial crisis that has been hanging over Wall Street for months, has yet to be ratified by the two chambers of Congress.
In particular, it provides for: verifications of its effective implementation by elected leaders, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public money, new provisions to contain the number of homes for which no payments have been made, as well as a right of inspection on remuneration paid to managers of protected companies.
The American Secretary to the Treasury, Henry Paulson, the President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a two-day negotiation marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an effective agreement on markets," said Bush administration representative, Henry Paulson.
"Every decision was taken in such a way as to safeguard the American economy and people from the current crisis on Wall Street.", the Democrat explained.
"It's the crucial point: if we hadn't acted in this way, invaluable discomforts and upsets would have spilled on the daily lives of Americans," declared Republican Judd Gregg.
The conclusion of the negotiations was marked by concerns about the impact of a new failure on investors.
The time limit granted corresponded to the opening of the markets this morning.
United later in the negotiations, the two candidates for the American presidentials showed rather favourable to the agreement, but did not avoid expressing their discontent before the adoption of extreme solutions.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama deserves the credit of adding some provisions to the agreement, in particular the one that will allow the owners to keep their homes and the one relating to wages for the managers of companies covered by the state.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of others, there is nothing to rejoice about.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the screen of American TV.
Interviewed on another channel to know if he will vote in favour of the plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I would like to analyze the details, but I hope so."
"As far as I've read, it's something that we all have to digest and that will allow us to move forward."
The option of non-intervention is simply unacceptable," he said.
The 700 billion plan aims to buy back with taxpayers' money the dubious, risky and unsaleable assets of American financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis due to the outbreak of a real estate bubble that led first of all to the collapse of risk mortgage loans (borrowers) , and then extended to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAA) and resulted in the freezing of liquidity and the disbandment of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of incumbent Republicans who blew up the first draft agreement last week.
It seems to have emerged from that dead end since Democrats accepted that the active "toxic" of some companies in difficulty is only protected by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to meet everyone, in Congress, a provision has been added that, if the government were to cope with losses over the five years to come due to this programme, it could impose new taxes in order to maintain its own balance.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion to which 100 billion can still be added if the President considers it necessary.
The payment of 350 billion is expected to be ratified by a further vote of Congress.
In exchange for his help, Washington will obtain shares in the protected companies that will receive dividends in the event of a profit and that will be able to resell when the waters have calmed down.
According to the plan, the Federal Government will have the opportunity to delay the foreclosure procedures relating to real estate loans and to set limits on remuneration and starting allowances paid to the managers of the companies involved.
Starting today, the architects of the plan would like to submit him to the vote of the House of Representatives, and to the vote of the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will be given the go-ahead.
In fact, yesterday there were several votes against the project, both at the Republican and Democratic side.
"Evidently, Washington does not hear you," said Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House's Finance Committee, addressing his voters.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not to take advantage of the taxpayers..
Leader of a small group in Congress dubbed "the caucus of sceptics", Democratic representative Brad Sherman presents the situation differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred eminent professors of economics, including three Nobel laureates, wrote to us to say: we ask Congress not to draw hasty conclusions and to examine carefully the way forward," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, once again there was evidence of the global nature of the crisis.
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for €11.2 billion (16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary when the French bank BNS Paribas made it known that it would give up the purchase of its competitor, in full bankruptcy after the loss of EUR 2 billion (2.9 billion) for the crisis of risk real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis has 85 000 employees and is part of the twenty largest banks in Europe and the ten largest insurers.
"It's not about lost money," said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos.
In return, they gain influence and voting rights in banking matters.
It is certainly something that savers and families now appreciate that the times are announcing uncertain"
During this period, at the other extreme of the Channel, the British Government seems to be nationalizing another bank on the brink of the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take charge of all loans currently under way at the Bradford and Bringley bank, of which more than 41 billion (US$75,5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it will be you who will buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Since the start of the economic crisis, Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to undergo a process of nationalization by the English government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
The blue-eyed beauty was for a long time his ace in the sleeve, for others his weak spot.
He got rid of the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with a bewitching smile?
Yes and no.
His discretion, sensitivity and obvious talent would expel him from that circle of powerful consecrated to true sacred monsters.
What a constancy!
Paul Newman, who passed away on Friday, at the age of 83, in his Connecticut ranch, following lung cancer, remains one of the latest icons of American cinema of the high years.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and of which he was for a long time a sort of rival on the screen, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also he spoke for the freedom and development of dramatic convictions.
Mixed couples often give birth to magical children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, to German Jewish father and Hungarian mother of origin.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
A humble ego, last mark of quality.
Since in him he recognized all an engrossed country of the safe made man, of the Pacific war fighter, proud in combat, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art at Yale, he subsequently attended the Actor Studio in New York, before triumphing in theatre, television and soon at the cinema.
That same civil rights militant man was also the autopilot who ranked second to Mans' 24 hours in 1979, as well as sex symbol, though part of a model pair since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
They leave with him the shadow areas of a reserved star, discreet, committed, allergic to the scandals of show-business, of which one will never be able to fully reveal the mystery.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the term.
This weekend Paul Newman's disappearance was a heart dive for the cinephiles, while his great characters populate the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of American cinema in full transformation reproposes itself through its interpretations.
They confuse in memory the charming cow-boy of Butch Cassidy(1969) and that boy unable to desire his fiery wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the roof that burns adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
More recently, we remember him as the sensitive Mr. Bridge (1990), troubled by a marriage that did not keep what was promised.
So many more Paul Newmans have gone through history.
The boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in There someone loves me, Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean and resumed after his death, which officially launched Newman in 1956.
That cute thug in the excellent Stangate, Oscar for Best Film in 1973.
Biscuit player bitter and vindictive in The Spaccone, a magnificent Robert Rossen film (1961), The Color of Martin Scorsese's Money, which earned him in 1987 the only Oscar out of 9 nominations.
That face through the years, it was his.
It's him again.
The epochs happen through his path.
Young people know him especially for cult movie Slap Shot- Dry blow by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in Mr. Hula Hoop, of the Coen brothers.
The circle had closed with a final godfather role of the Irish mafia in Era my father, in 2003.
Unlike the most prominent legends of cinema that soon abandoned the trade, Newman will remain in the theaters for a long time, denouncing Hollywood in all its pomp, parties and concessions.
Bertrand Tavernier, French filmmaker, described him, with a hint of irony, as "a living challenge to underplaying", judging his performance exaggerated.
The profession has not always been a game for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles seemed to fall like manna from heaven.
However, he often preferred the role of the outcast to that of the young actor: neurotic characters, alcoholic carrion or desperate, of which he expressed disbanding and rebellion with his perfect traits.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown nuances of his true, modest sensibility.
Jennifer's first time, 1968 (based on the Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with her wife Joanne Woodward as the lead character, drew a subtle female portrait of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott to an overdose, dedicated to him in 1984 the film Harry and Son, a discreet and sad film.
Among the countless tributes rained yesterday on Newman, his great friend and old comrade Robert Redford (they had recited together in La Stangata and Butch Cassidy) affirmed with infinite sadness" His presence made my life and this country better".
Generosity and love for life, two great features of the missing actor.
Beyond a legendary career, a great militant for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protester of the Hollywood drift, dies.
We will have seen his face stand out on bottles of vinegar, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging it as a choice of bad taste, although born as a gag.
However, the revenue from those sales was earmarked for its children's foundation in difficulty.
Newman, instead of resting on his myth, chose to engage to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter saying "Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful to his good star.
Being there was a privilege."
And just as much privilege it was for us to follow the path of such a clear and generous American artist.
Model citizen, therefore, and much more.
What was produced in the Zuschlag & Associates Invoice Factory?
Soon, on October 8, the hearing of the criminal trial against János Zuschlag and its members will be discussed.
The political man and his associates are accused of repeated commercial fraud committed within the framework of a criminal association which has caused considerable damage, and of other offences, including forgery of documents.
According to the Public Prosecutor's Office the money obtained from competition notices, was used by them for private purposes, and they have often certified the carrying out of activities through false invoices.
State and municipal money, a total of 65 million florins, ended up partly in the coffers of the Fiatal Baloldal organization, partly in the pockets of some people.
According to the method, announced by the investigating authorities, they took the money obtained from calls for tender on the basis of invoices for non-existent transactions and the associations never fulfilled their obligations.
According to the accuser act most of the invoices were false.
To do so, the invoice blocks were purchased at the market in Józsefváros, the circular stamps instead were manufactured in Kiskunhalas.
And to decide on behalf of which firms to issue invoices, it was established among other things during the trip through the hills over the Balaton where János Zuschlag had sent István Lados.
According to the latter's confession he had to choose pensions and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for the consummations, along the lines of these then were prepared invoices to be forwarded to the calls for competition, among others, to those of the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the City of Budapest.
Most of these are the work of István Lados and András İri, who, according to our information, has drafted the reports needed to obtain the funding.
One of the choices of Lados' "travel studies" was a brewery.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and members in 2003, the restaurant provided meals for a group of 90 people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
So many people, however, according to the restaurateur, would not all join the premises together.
Similarly, the bill issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later called Együtt in Harmadik Évezredert, is full of formal errors and content.
A guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj has only three rooms, more than 10 people could not stay there, however the invoice included 130 guests.
But the compilers of the invoices full of imagination exaggerated when they signaled Pigal Kft., also this one deals with catering, in whose accounts - according to the information issued to the judicial authorities - did not even include the documents on behalf of the companies Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá.
Győző Farkas, the company's director, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to the prosecutor's office and showed him the invoices, he immediately realized that they were fake documents.
"On the stamp the name and the VAT match of our enterprise were at a wrong place."
He added: in addition to the formal reasons, the fact that according to the invoice 100 people were accommodated, when in total they have eleven rooms and there are not so many beds.
Moreover the invoice was catering and their restaurant is no longer in operation for a long time.
Assiduous invoice compilers did not bother to inform themselves that the Budapest travel agency of their choice, organizes only trips abroad, so they foolishly indicated on the invoice with payment in cash trips to Hungary, which did not agree with the company's bill issuing practice.
In addition, as shown during the survey, VAT was also shown on the invoice, while travel to countries outside the European Union is exempt from VAT.
Among other things, the amount of VAT was also incorrect on the four documents issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. in favour of the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, in fact on the services offered by the company you have to apply the VAT to 15% and not 25% as indicated on the invoices, moreover the employees of the hotel issued only printed invoices, while the invoice was made by hand.
In addition to this, the "emittances" have ruined other invoices, in the case of a company they have indicated as carried out the transport of goods by road, as is known from the proceeding of the Public Prosecutor, activity that was not carried out by the company founded originally for advice of investments.
Also for formal defects - due to non-compliant invoice format, false stamp - it was found that invoices issued in favour of Együtt in Harmadik Évezredert Alapítvány, of XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont are false.
The same happened in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó Sports Field, whose representatives denied having issued the invoices in question.
The falsifiers did not even pay attention to the fact that the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in liquidation when (2001) a group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület had lunch there, precisely for this reason the curator of the liquidation of the company, according to our information, denied having issued that invoice.
They made invoices knowingly
Another group of invoices issuers consists of those who were aware of having to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány foundation issued an invoice at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták in favour of the Együtt foundation in Armageddon Évezredert of nearly 4 million florins.
Ludovic Györfi, one of the defendants, according to the accusation, persuaded the director of Collab Kft. to issue fictitious invoices.
Biogate Kft also cooperated with Zuschlag and its partners in liquidation, which in 2003 provided invoices issued for a value of approximately 5 million florins to the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület association and the Vörösfenyő Egyesület association, behind which there was no real economic activity.
Not even movement of money because the invoices prepared were then reversed, but the associations forgot to make this aspect appear in their own documents.
In the following group of companies issuing invoices belong those who are connectable with the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov, authorized to the address of the general manager of Delta Trió Kft, based in Budapest but not available there, who deals with the trade in fuel and motor vehicles.
The company issued several invoices in October, November and December 2005 relating to the sale of computer equipment, worth about 18 million florins.
According to the data of the investigation Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas under liquidation from September 14, 2005 purchased these invoices.
The general manager of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov would forward the company documents between 2002 and 2005.
As far as we know, Kubatov, during the investigation, acknowledged that he issued invoices on behalf of the company to Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt companies in Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and the countervalue was taken from him.
At the express request of Ivan Kubatov Romanian masons founded the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of the companies were operational, because according to the defendant they had not received a job.
At the request of the co-defendant lawyer Zsolt Szente, editor of the company's founding documents, invoices were issued in the name of the companies to the associations related to Zuschlag: the Atlasz and the Y-Generáció.
On behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade Kubatov issued 15 invoices to the various institutions for a total value of 14.2 million guilders.
The prosecutor considers that Kubatov has pocketed 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices, as well as the VAT.
The man also used Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictitious invoices, manufactured for Biztos Pont's call for competition.
Y-Generáció and Szövetség at Modern Magyarországért in January 2006 submitted a call for the Socialist Party's public utility body, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They also won 500,000 florins each but the sums were not used for the purposes indicated in the ban.
In order for this not to come out, five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft have been submitted to TMA.
These invoices were found during the search of Árpád Kemecsei's office at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing some of the defendants, as they have already done in the prosecutor's office, will probably report on the development of the production of invoices.
However, the most interesting thing could be if defendant number one, János Zuschlag, would decide to lift the veil over everything.
His confession so far has not been very detailed and although he has repeatedly promised to talk about everything extensively, he has not yet done so.
We must see if it is in your interest, it may also be that the socialists have made agreements with Zusi, who - in exchange for compensation of 50 million guilders, much of the damage - would be willing to make the scapegoat.
Zuschlag could have been offended by the fact that his demands to lighten his prison conditions, that is, the granting of house arrests, have not so far been fulfilled.
While the perpetrators of indemnifiable commercial offences and causing much greater damage can freely walk or at least wait at home for the end of the proceedings against them, which is not granted to him.
The psychology of excessive bidding: why spend more money?
At auctions buyers are inclined to spend more, to overestimate the goods.
Neurologists and research economists at the University of New York have been able to discover the neuro-economic bases of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study appeared in Science magazine men do not want to stay back in a race such as eBay auction, so they are also available to pay a higher price.
Research has tried to trace the nervous pattern of this "game" at the level of the nervous system through experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played the lotto, the other group of players participated in an auction while using the functional magnetic resonance imaging method (fMRI) they examined the active areas of the brain of the people participating in the experiment.
In both games the participants could win some money, but in the auction game, in which the substantial element is to licitate more than the other, the striated body under the cerebral cortex intensively enters into operation when losing to the game.
This brain area, in addition to other functions, plays a role in the "self-gratification" mechanism of the nervous system.
Thus, according to researchers, the price rise is explained by avoiding the vehement reaction of the striated body.
To support their theory, research group economists carried out a financial pursuit investigation.
In this investigation, three groups contested a partner under different conditions.
They reported to the control group what the real value of the product in question was and they placed their bet.
Another group in addition to this have promised that in the case of winning they will receive another $15 prize.
The third group would instead receive $15 before the auction, but the members of the group would lose the money in case of auction loss.
The difference between the two groups consisted in the fact that for one of them the win was emphasized, while for the other the loss.
Countering the neurologist hypothesis, members of the group who played "against loss" were willing to make higher bets than the control group or "winning".
"These results are not deductible from any of the previously existing economic theories.
These, in fact, so far explained the phenomena found at auctions with the joy of winning and avoiding risk.
Only the methods of creating the neurological image helped solve the contradiction between the two theories, so that we came to a third explanation" - said Andrew Schotter, professor of the Faculty of Economics of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: when to seek medical attention?
Almost half a billion people in the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary chronic liver diseases are mentioned among the first causes of death.
In Hungary, the number of hepatitis patients amounts to one hundred thousand, of which only 7000 are treated: the reason is that many patients do not know they are infected.
The definition of hepatitis is the collective name of contagious liver diseases caused by several viruses.
There are many similarities between the symptoms, typical are hepatitis and jaundice, but their pathogens and the diseases caused differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses spread into two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E via the food channel (e.g. water and infected foods), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal leakage, saliva).
For those traveling it is useful to immunize against the A and B virus, against the C there is no vaccine.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating infected foods, accompanied by general malaise, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After yellowish spots are formed on the skin and on the white of the eyes, the stools become clear and the urine dark, the healing takes place within two to three weeks.
One million people die every year worldwide from hepatitis B, the most serious variant of the disease, which causes liver tumors and liver cirrhosis.
The main reason is, according to estimates, that only one in ten people receive pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if not treated it can cause liver cirrhosis and liver tumors.
Most infected people do not know that they have contracted the disease because pathogens degrade their liver cells in a subtle way, in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore it is very important to prevent and perform regular medical tests.
This disease is much more frequent than average in three groups: those who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts and tattoos.
In the world to date the number of people infected with chronic hepatitis C virus amounts to 200 million.
Since a routine laboratory examination also reveals the disease it is worth asking your family doctor when you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
Recognized in time the disease is curable, the virus can be eliminated from the body, so it ceases infectious power and can be prevented the formation of tumors.
September 30 is the World Day of Hepatitis, organized for the first time in 2004 worldwide by associations of patients.
The aim is to draw attention to chronic viral hepatitis, the causes of its development and early recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God feels less pain?
According to the result of a recent investigation, religious faith functions as a kind of analgesic that has made the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
Oxford University scientists performed an interesting experiment, examining how faith in God affects the feeling of pain, the British Telegraph reported.
As part of the somewhat bizarre investigation, an electroshock was carried out to 12 Catholic believers and to as many atheists, while everyone observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to reject much of the pain.
Thanks to the exploration technique of the human brain it was discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for pain control.
The test is the first in a series of research in which in addition to academics also take part scientists, philosophers and theologians of the University.
The test took place exactly this way: an instrument that emits discharges and passes the electroshock was connected to the left hand of the subject of the experiment.
Researchers asked participants to focus on two paintings, the Virgin Mary painted in the 17th century by Sassoferrato and the Lady with Leonardo da Vinci's ermine painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the examination hoped that the image of the Virgin Mary originated a sort of religious state among believers, while Leonardo's painting was chosen because it did not differ too much from the other and they considered it to have a tranquilizing effect.
The subjects of the experiment spent half an hour in front of the MRI scanner and in this time aro received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive series, while observing either the religious theme painting or the other.
Catholics reported that the vision of the Virgin Mary made them feel "safe", as if "someone took care of them" and "were calmed down and were pervaded by peace".
Looking at the religious-themed image, they accounted for 12% less pain than when Leonardo's work was before them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who took part in the test himself, believes that such a result can be achieved with any image with a strong effect even for atheists, but you have to find the right image.
"We need to look for an image to which they have very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the result of the research.
"The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it can change our personality." - added Wright.
After the excellent results only the question remains if the painting of a Madonna by Leonardo or another painter of similar caliber is presented to believers, what effect could it have on the control of pain?
Would the vision of a quality virgin Mary bring better results?
You're what you say about yourself
On the tenth birthday day Google can claim to be in people's pockets as well as in the sky above their heads; it knows where they spent their holidays, which clinic they attend and what they care about.
However, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's directors, this is not enough yet.
What concerns the skeptics who compare with the Orwellian nightmare, they just don't see the substance of web 2.0.
Recently Eric Schmidt told the Financial Times that Google's main purpose is to collect as many personal data as its users and this is necessary to stick to the original goal of Google's founders that it was: "we put all the information in the world into a system!".
According to the Google director interviewed the company, after 10 years of revolutionary work, it is still at the beginning of being able to handle all the information.
When asked what will happen in five years Schmidt answered: he would like if Google could answer questions like "what do I do tomorrow?" or "what would be the right job for me?", but software can't answer seemingly simple questions because they don't know enough about users.
Not all internet users are aware that during their internet searches, exactly the words you search are recorded, from which IP address they are searched for and on which page the interested parties stop after the search.
Through the Personalized Search started two years ago users e.g. can store their browsing history, may relate what they searched and clicked, these then in the long run will generate much better tailored results; on this same logic is based Recommendations with which the system offers us products and services based on our preferences declared and recorded previously.
What happens if my data is used against me, if they look at what I do? - concerned users are wondering about Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, the counter-reactions of the internet users are caused by the fear of the size of the potential power represented by the company, and not by the sense of guilt, by the fear of punishment, by the desire for freedom or even by the rebellion against power.
One fact is confirmed, however, that all the expressions sought are not only recorded but in justified cases they can also be provided to third parties, in such legal cases nothing defends the personal rights of internet users.
The most striking example of this in recent times has perhaps been the coordinated action against Brazil's paedophiles, in which Google has forwarded to the Brazilian government the information that has made possible the identification of paedophiles from the Orkut community page maintained by Google.
Internet users worried about personal rights instead sighed of relief in May when the company - in agreement with the electronic legal protection association EFF - successfully demonstrated the truth in court against the FBI: not even later can Google be forced with no point of the constitution to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time the federal government successfully snatched nearly 50,000 web addresses and a thousand search expressions obtained in reference to the confirmation of the child protection law passed years earlier, but however failed to obtain the search lists of individual users and the entire list of web pages and keywords dating back to two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore rather contradictory: those who fear to provide their personal data are pushing Google because they believe that this undermines their intimate sphere and private life by starting to use its services and rising up with the rebellion of multinationals that stand out for the conservative image.
Meanwhile the American geek culture and the proliferation of fans, activists and computer users appeared in many countries see in them the future generation of big companies, the "cool corporation", as opposed to their rival, the Microsoft liquidated as the conqueror of the world because of Windows, although both fought for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for an identification code, does not ask for money for their services, the source code kept up to date and the program package is much more accessible, youthful and cool than the official software giant practice.
But it can also happen because geeks see exactly the problematic relationship between personal rights and the internet, which implies just one of the most often repeated keywords in recent years, web 2.0.
Web 2.0 speaks of nothing but collaboration, intentionally leaving traces behind us and exploiting the communication channels at our disposal and while the size of these changes for each individual, the substance is the same: to show ourselves.
A young average can create profiles in multiple community pages, from Facebook to Xanga, can connect them with other services such as Twitter or last.fm that lists his or her musical tastes, all of these can insert them into systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, can also write blogs on which his latest photo galleries are automatically stored on Flickr or Picasa.
Meanwhile, we read of numerous exemplary cases from which it is clear that the girl, seeing the series of photos taken in the morning from the common tour of friends, easily learns with whom she spent the night her treacherous boyfriend or a company can fire one of its employees because she has written a sincere opinion on the company summit: one thing is sure, the concept of private life has now completely reconsidered.
Those who live an online life do so to show themselves and so we can formulate the fundamental thesis that hides behind the behavior of young people.
Those who want to hide something or just want to avoid Google's monopoly can do so (starting with Scroogle using Google's search system but at the same time leaving no traces voluntarily).
There are not a few people who do not register on purpose to community pages for not being found, Google's online applications, from text processing to image management and news collection, can be replaced with alternative versions not linked to huge server parks and that do not make up our best existing profile.
Public opinion doesn't even wait so long in secret when Google pulls out its claws.
Currently the company with its 156 billion dollars worth of value is worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca Cola (110 billion dollars), AdWords/AdSense advertising spaces threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, the services introduced in record time instead cause big evils not only to Microsoft but also to numerous companies of software development.
However, critical observers alongside all this find alarming points: the company summit, for example, totally rejected the employee protest after having doubled the line of the company's kindergarten, considered the repeated catering to the daily pleasure of the employees too expensive, but all this diminishes in the face of the fact that in 2006 Google bent its head to the Chinese government and under their agreement the company will filter all the results that offend the good taste and interests of the Chinese regime.
An internal rule of the company seems to be not to advertise a new service in advance but only when it is usable, one thing is sure, that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will move the world to one point: while some believe that the project of scanning and archiving Google books and magazines will assume proportions such that the company will soon be faced with the American Supreme Tribunal, others are afraid of the Health system, in fact in this we can create our own health profile with our reports, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database can offer good material to the next generation of science fiction writers, the Scroogled tale of the famous Cory Doctorow describes the future with Orwellian accents, in which a man with Google data can be approached alarmingly.
Two underage men helped Ozd's double killer make the tracks disappear
Police questioned two juveniles about the double murder of Ózd, suspected of having helped to make the traces of the crime disappear - said the spokesman for the Police Police Police Police of the Borsod region on Tuesday.
Young people have recognized the crime they are charged with, they are currently charged with aiding.
The two underage girls, two girls according to MTI information, defend themselves on the loose.
Aiding is punishable up to 5 years of imprisonment.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, was put in preventive detention on Sunday.
He's suspected of multiple premeditated murder for profit.
The investigation revealed that the young 23-year-old had a large debt to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay off the debt, for this reason last Wednesday he lured his creditor into an Ózd yard with a deception where he killed him and his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI information, the young man was prepared to commit the crime, a sign is that he committed the murder with a hidden weapon on the spot.
The police are examining the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the involvement of an expert.
Warsaw Stock Exchange made an offer to buy Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered 200 million euros, around 5 billion Czech kronas, for the purchase of 100% of the stock list of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles despite the Czechs having previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange as a possible buyer of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for the exclusion is the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is owned by the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state which intends to sell more than 60% of its shares within a few months.
The Czech financial newspaper E15 states that the Polish offer represents the highest figure so far advanced for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have so far submitted an offer.
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that of all concerned the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst owner and did not exclude that this could lead in the future to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange in 5-10 billion krones.
According to the shareholders' agreement almost 90% of the securities would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Country Finance with a share of almost 25%, followed by Bank Česká Spořitelna with 14.7% and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5%
The economic crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
The main European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday dedicated to the international economic crisis already speak of "a second 11 September".
The global financial disaster took place thanks to the American President - accuses La Repubblica - who was unable to compact his party behind a law drafted in a hurry, whose aim is to remedy a desperate situation.
Instead of a second Pearl Harbour, as billionaire superfinancer Warren Buffett said, it would be more accurate to talk about a second 11 September.
Even part of the Madrid press sees Washington as the scapegoat.
According to El Mundo the lack of American political leadership has thrown the world economy on the brink of the abyss.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is growing more and more, and the whole world will suffer from it later.
Bush's plan was not perfect but as a result of the Congress vote there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political means for managing the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air, just when the greatest transformation in the history of capitalism is taking place.
It is no longer possible to overlook the threat - the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva mentions.
Some states today can still offer a rescue donut to staggering financial institutions and with taxpayers' money they can save them from failure.
But if more and more banks collapse like in a domino effect then neither financial means nor new improvised solutions will be sufficient.
In the long term, Member States of the European Union must overcome their national selfishness and concentrate control on the dismembered financial markets.
Only on Monday, weakened financial institutions have obtained more than EUR 100 billion - recalls the Viennese Der Standard, according to which the anxieties that European taxpayers, like those of the Americans, will have to put their wallets in place to remedy the crisis seem increasingly real.
The EU has so far not been very concerned about the crisis that has crossed the old continent as a tsunami.
The "saviors" must not wave the EUR 100 billion immediately, however it would be better if they determined in which case it is appropriate to touch taxpayers' money to prevent greater damage.
The intelligent machine imitates the bumblebee's flight
What could be the best way to develop anti-collision technologies if not to imitate sensors of obstacles in nature?
For example, bees.
In the amazing project presented to CEATIC in Japan, the bumblebees gave the initial strategic cue to Nissan engineers on how to build the next generation of anti-collision systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the biomimetic robot BR23C, a robotic mini-auto with the properties of bees, with the final aim of creating a system able to avoid all collisions.
Flying the bees form their own oval personal space that looks very much like our protective shield - explained Kazuhiro Doi, director of the field of PR technologies and research and development.
Important is the role of the bee's view, capable of a 300 degree view in every direction.
Engineers drew on the telemetric laser idea to copy the bee's view function.
The BR23C detects obstacles up to two meters away within a 180-degree radius, calculates the distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor that immediately transforms it into a command to avoid collision.
In a fraction of a second the robot perceives the obstacle and then, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes direction turning the wheels of the necessary measure to avoid the accident.
This avoiding maneuver, in a different way from the current system, takes place in an entirely instinctive way.
"If it weren't, the robot car wouldn't be able to react quickly to avoid collisions," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and auto robot project.
It must react instinctively and immediately because this technology corresponds to the damaging and inner layer of the protective shield, within which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a bee does to avoid the other bees.
This process must take place in the blink of an eye.
But unlike bees the deviation cannot go up or down or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and in the steering direction of the wheels.
In this way instead of the endless possibilities available to bees to avoid the other bees, the robot, as a possibility available, can rotate on itself, accelerate and slow down.
The BR23C is powered by batteries to lithium polymers, lighter and with high energy density, which means that their duration is longer than those to lithium ions.
According to Andoh, the instantaneousity of the intelligent reaction is important, not data processing or even less the ability to store them.
This robot has to process some inputs in seconds and react.
There is no need to store and react with intuitive logic based on previous manoeuvring data, so it only uses a memory of a few dozen Kb.
You don't need a gigabyte or megabyte memory.
This is the first step towards the development of a technology for the immediate avoidance of collisions that are expected at Nissan, within 10 years it can be installed on standard vehicles.
Further possibilities for application can be represented by the unification with the GPS satellite navigation system which avoids obstacles on the road leads to destination.
They also found the name of the very expensive child.
The written version of the $700 billion economic bailout law for the purchase of disproportionate receivables, to be applied in several parts, has been drafted.
In the first step half of the sum is spent.
In the new agreements extended until midnight on Saturday according to the timetable of the eastern coast the congress leaders decided on the $700 billion rescue plan after a debate that had lasted for days - Reuters reported.
We have made some serious progress - said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic president of the American House of Representatives that he has only remained to put the agreement on paper.
Both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the plan compromise.
Treasury Minister Henry Paulson spoke of the result of the compromise he stated: the program will work and will be effective, but there is still much to do. According to Pelosi it is not about the rescue of Wall Street but about the reversal of the economic cart.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of Asian markets at 8 a.m. according to Washington's time (2 a.m. on Monday according to Central Europe's time), but did not bring much growth in the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will vote first on the draft established economic stabilisation law of 2008 concerning the program, after which it will be the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, then joyfully welcomed the news of the agreement to the White House.
We are pleased with the progress achieved tonight and we greatly appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilise our financial markets and defend the economy - said Tony Fratto, White House spokesperson.
However, the program differs from the Bush administration's original proposal, which predicted that the $700 billion would all be spent on buying securities with disproportionate credits behind them.
Now, as a first step, you can spend at most half of the sum of $700 billion, 250 billion immediately after the vote on Monday of Congress, with these the Treasury will buy securities with disproportionate credits behind, the fate of the remaining $100 billion will decide the president.
A special college will control the program in which the president of the Federal Reserve also takes part.
The expenditure of the other half of the 700 billion depends on a new Congress decree.
Under the law, the Treasury can apply a combined tactic: it can buy at the same time credits, mortgages and securities with mortgages and other types of "poisoned" credits.
The purchase can take place through auctions and directly - they have announced competent of the ministry.
The legal rule makes it possible for the companies concerned to take part in an insurance programme where the Ministry of the Treasury guarantees the means of concern, for which companies will pay an adequate price for the likely damages.
Henrz Paulson said: the law gives the necessary means for $700 billion to arrive for the urgent needs of the American monetary system, whether it be the purchase of wrong financial means, or their insurance or to avoid the risk of the collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take all necessary steps to make ourselves ready to introduce the law just signed - he added.
Bank directors in crisis and waiting for state aid instead think that the government will limit their bailout, defined by the overseas slang simply as a golden parachute.
The limitations of payments will only occur in some cases, and the limitations also depend on how the Treasury will offer the help.
In essence the limitation means that if the ministry buys in the framework of an auction, it will impose a surcharge on the golden parachute, if they do not retiring the fallen bank manager.
At the time of the direct purchase of disproportionate credits, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that directors' money is not exaggerated.
It should be added that the existing contracts of the Golden parachute will not change, the limitation is valid only for new ones to encourage participation in the programme.
This is the first case in American history of the entry into force of a legal limitation concerning the remuneration of directors general - commented the provision the Democrat Barney Frank chairman of the committee responsible for the financial services of the House of Representatives.
In addition to this, the state has the right to take over a share of the banks participating in the programme, reducing the risk of taxpayers, since they can eventually also gain if the economy, and together with it the bank saved, will get back on their feet.
The bill understands that over the next five years the president must present to Congress a proposal that has how to return to taxpayers the expected losses arising from the financial sector.
Of course, on both sides there were those who expressed their doubts about the project.
This is not what American citizens asked us not to defend taxpayers' dollars - said Republican California MP Darrell Issa.
His Democratic colleague from Ohio Mary Kaptur believes that the measures were taken by the same ones who are responsible for the Wall Street collapse.

The prices of domestic industrial sales in relation to the previous month increased by only 0.1%.
National sales prices in the processing sector also rose to a minimum, 0.1%, compared with July.
The highest price increase in August 2008 occurred in the leather and shoe processing sector (2.8%), especially bags and belts with 4.6% and shoe production with 2.5% monthly increase.
The high price of plastics and chemicals has caused a significant monthly increase (1.6%) in the chemicals and products sector.
A decrease in prices occurred in the oil processing sector (1.4%), in the production of electrical instruments and machinery (0.9%) and to a minimum extent in wood processing (0.1%)
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing activities have not changed.
In the other sectors of the processing industry there was an increase in prices between 0.2 and 0.9%.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector, prices rose by 0.3% in August in domestic industrial sales, mainly as a result of the dominant effect of the increase in the gas price made by the authorities since 1 July.
Compared in 12 months, given the national sales of the processing industry sectors, the largest increases were in the oil processing sector (32.4%).
In the manufacture of products from metalworking, prices rose by 13.2%, 11% in the production of food, drink and tobacco representing a decisive weight.
Prices fell in the textile sector (2.5%) and in the manufacture of electrical instruments and machinery (0.3%).

The Hungarian guilder weakened in one month compared to the euro by 1.7%, compared with the US dollar by 7.1%, compared with August 2007 by 7.5% compared to the euro and by 15.9% compared to the US dollar.
Next year in the United States without a visa?
Kinga Göncz sees the possibility that around 12 January the American-Hungarian visa waiver agreement can enter into force - the Foreign Minister spoke about this in Chicago with the Hungarian representatives of the place.
According to his opinion "everything now depends on the fact that the electronic system of entry and control is built in time."
However, it drew attention to the fact that in the new system there will be no entry permit, but before departure tourists will have to register.
The Hungarian diplomat will continue the negotiations in Washington today.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleeza Rice, to whom he will hand over the Cross Medal of the Order of the Hungarian Republic with the Star and engage in talks with foreign policy advisers of Democratic candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and John McCain also sided in favor of the bank bailout plan
Barack Obama and John McCain, the candidates for the presidency of the two great American parties, guaranteed on Sunday their support for the $700 billion government plan for the rescue of banks, but there are politicians who demand the resignation of the Treasury Minister.
Representatives of Congress and Administration after marathon negotiations lasted for days, Sunday night announced that they had concluded an agreement of principle on the bank bailout plan.
The Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market release financial package have become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain want to be more suitable than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls with the focus on economic issues Obama has again recovered some advantage, while McCain's advantage, obtained after the Republican convention with Sarah Palin's appointment as vice president, has dispersed.
Obama in a speech in Detroit expressed hope that the convention will quickly pass the $700 billion plan law.
He stressed that the proposal contained those steps of consumer protection which he also supported.
"Now we must act responsibly (...), the danger threatens your work, your savings, all industrial sectors, complete economic stability" - he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
He didn't let McCain's economic ideas get out of his way.
McCain in an interview with ABC explained that "all of us will send down this situation with difficulty (...) but doing nothing is not a viable path".
The Republican Senator reported that the proposal includes the creation of a control committee of the Minister of Finance and the limitation of the good exits of top managers, things he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no merit role in the agreements, but he was in daily contact with the minister.
President Nancy Pelosi reported on Sunday that the House of Representatives will probably already vote on the bill on Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking world
The pole of the right is intact, only within the pole voters have become more self aware - thus analyzes Der Spiegel's weak result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider's party is ready to rule Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
Franz Walter, in the internet edition of the German left-wing magazine, in the article The Revolution of Bavaria devours its parents analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU started long before the sad Beckstein-Huber couple took office.
Christian-socials have modernised Bavaria for decades and right now these modern citizens are moving away from them.
The change of age is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, so also of Angela Merker.
The defeat was not a great surprise for the CSU, but Sunday ended a process that exactly ten years ago had been feasible: the indisputable hegemony of a party-state ended.
Already 10 years ago, in 1998, CSU had fallen to 47.7%, for the first time below the 50% threshold since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the Bundestag election in 2005 again in the period of the so-called Stoiber.
This is due to the subsequent modernization in the region, which devours parents.
The sociologists predicted it 40 years ago, but it was a very bad time. But secularization, the results of education, the settlement of East and North Germans in the developed Bavarian region could not remain without consequences on the allegiance of voters to the CSU.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increased possibilities and the political consequences are clear.
The pole of the right is intact, only within the pole voters have become more self conscious, critical, stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks the classic bourgeois groups have moved away from the CSU: free professionals, artisans, graduates and graduates.
Here support for the CSU fell below 40%.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The Viennese Conservative newspaper "Who with whom?" in the article "Presidents of the parties are stuck in coalition matters" deals with the confused Austrian internal political situation created following the elections.
The SPÖ intends to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the intervention of SPÖ in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, the Greens still do not want to discuss coalition.
Elections were made, now it's all about the coalition; in the public TV discussion party leaders just showed the cards.
Werner Faymann, President of SPÖ, confirmed that he wanted to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to demonstrate that cooperation between the two parties is possible, in some regions and in the social partnership already exists.
Faymann left the question open if he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, current president of the ÖVP, as vice-chancellor.
As you said, the Schüssel-Molterer course was in any case rejected.
The repetition of this direction is not considered.
Molterer reacted cautiously to red offerings.
As you said, cooperation will certainly not succeed if Faymann tries to meddle in the ÖVP's internal affairs.
If your party chooses the opposition or enters the coalition it is still an open thing in the party, issues must be discussed in any case within the ÖVP.
Jörg Haider leader of the BZÖ repeated to be open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition we are ready to take responsibility for governing," said Haider.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today in Paris the European Summit for Equal Opportunities began, organized this year by France having the rotating presidency of the European Union.
Lívia Járóka, MEP Fidesz of the European People's Party in the message addressed to the plenum as the main speaker of the congress drew attention to school segregation because it is the most serious legal violation that affects Roma children and also the most serious obstacle to their affirmation.
Mr Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and Mr Vladimír Špidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, opened the conference at the highest level.
The conference was attended by governments, European social partners and representatives of major European civil and rights organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
Járóka, according to the press office of the parliamentary group Fidesz PE, recalled, in addition to discrimination in recruitment, that the Roma are expelled from the labour market primarily because of their low schooling.
"Most young Roma have no medium-level education qualifications and as a result of poor quality elementary education only a small number of them can achieve a higher level of study".
Járóka also stressed, as a fundamental human right, the key role of education in upholding human rights.
Investing in the education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of the member states of the European Union.
According to the honourable Member, these links need to be made more widely known between Roma and non- Roma.
In fact, the sooner the school starts a Roma, the more its chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market grow; through taxes paid for income and consumption they contribute to the nation's budget.
"The Roma's right of European citizenship must guarantee their right to quality education and the elimination of low-level and segregated schools," stressed Lívia Járóka.
According to the congresswoman, the European Union must unite its purpose and action in order to accelerate the processes of desegregation of schools, and for this reason it is of fundamental importance to respect the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be interrupted, Roma children must be given the opportunities provided by the democratic space so that they can contribute as citizens to the full future of Europe," Mrs Járóka asked.
In the sign of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities" to be guaranteed for all, the aim of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities organized every year, from last year's Berlin meeting is to ensure a unique forum to promote the objectives of anti-discrimination and equal opportunities set at state and European level.
CSU: pity for a transitional period
At the end of October the fate of the awkward Huber-Beckstein couple will be decided.
Despite the bad electoral defeat the heads have not yet fallen, the discussion of personal issues has been postponed at the top of the Bavarian CSU.
The president of the Erwin Huber party and the regional governor Günther Beckstein remain in their place, the question is as long as pity lasts.
The fate of the tandem that suffered a catastrophic loss of votes of 17% will decide the extraordinary congress of the party in the last weekend of October.
The two highly criticized politicians have in any case made it known that they are not attached with all their strength to the chair.
They thus attempted to soften the angry members of the parliamentary group and the base that one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded the personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber then at the height of his career, the Christian-Social Union gained 60.7%, now instead after the coup against Stoiber they dropped to 43.4%.
The CSU for 46 years was "absolute monarch" in Bavaria which gives 18% of the German GDP.
However, the conservatives in the southern region of fundamental importance for the Hungarian economy always count, in the future they will be forced to unite in any way.
As the first sign of the reorganization within the party the vice president and federal minister of agriculture Horst Seehofer, considered possible heir of Huber, gets a place in the narrow exploratory group that will begin negotiations with the liberals of the FDP and with the Free Electors exponents right-wing values for a possible government coalition in Munich.
For a strange joke of fate on the list of Free Electors enters the legislature that Gabriele Pauli whose attitude against Stoiber had been exploited as an opportunity for coups by the Huber-Beckstein couple and then treat without regard to the woman with great ambitions.
CSU executives now concentrate all their forces to somehow stabilize Beckstein.
Meanwhile, Stoiber will also play an active role, which he has so far been plotting in the shadows. Former regional governor and former president of the CSU has defined on 28 September as the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday Huber made some statements to the gall towards the CSU, according to which they deserved more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Merkel cannot be chancellor after the Bundestag elections scheduled for September 2009 unless the CSU, which played a decisive role in the 2005 national victory, is re-established with common forces.
According to Merkel, which does not hide the disappointment over the fiasco, the loss of land of the CSU will not adversely affect the great Berlin coalition.
What is certainly relative: it will not be easy to handle the wound CSU, but the Social Democrats' crisis is still going to last.
SPD has achieved its lowest result since 1946 in Bavaria with 18.6%.
Lukashenko-opposition: 110-0
Not even an opposition representative entered the Belarusian Parliament after Sunday's election.
According to Russian observers it is the sign of well-being and stability ensured in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, according to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) instead it is explained by the frauds committed in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the legislation of 110 people from a country of 10 million inhabitants has been unopposed for more than a decade, before yesterday's election the opposition gathered under the name United Democratic Forces (ODS) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, with the renewed presidential term for the fourth time following the constitutional change in the 2006 elections held under discussed circumstances, "allowed" some seats in Parliament to representatives of the opposition.
The ODS thus gave up a boycott previously evaluated.
Behind the opposition's expectations was that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, which demanded credit to reduce the import of increasingly expensive Russian natural gas and agreed to give Russians the pipelines in possession of Beltransgaz crossing the country, intended to improve the relationship with the EU where Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians cannot enter for the Belarusian political situation considered anti-democratic.
He referred to a détente that the OSCE, considering the election campaign, placed emphasis on positive movements and not on shortcomings, such as the ban on showing up for one third of opposition candidates.
The OSCE's fast Monday report however also criticised the campaign, during which opposition candidates in practice could not appear in the press, and in particular that the opposition could not be present at the vote count.
Nevertheless, according to the opposition, an improvement in the political climate is evident: political prisoners have been released, Minsk is also willing to a small confrontation with Moscow continuing to deny recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, although Russia, with which Belarus forms a federal state on paper, considers the two countries independent for a month.
We have made two steps forward and one back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun - he said to our newspaper Aleksandr Milinkevich.
According to the 2006 opposition presidential candidate, it is desirable that it remain despite the fact that "power has been afraid to bring even one opponent into a Parliament without weight".
The opposition does not provide for protest actions for the results but rather tries to send the voters the message of the need for economic reforms.
Obviously we have many problems, we have to print the opposition newspapers in Russia, for distribution the local authorities raise difficulties, but also so I see that more and more people support change, even among the elderly - said Milinkevich referring to the fact that not even the most officially aided class, that of pensioners, considers Lukashenko's regime that considers its main result to be the creation of social security.
Due to the country's indebtedness and increasing economic deficit it is only a matter of time the disintegration of social security "remembering the sepulchral silence" - Milinkevich believes.
In contrast to the opposition politician, Russian observers judged the elections to be democratic.
Sergej Lebedev President of the Community Independent States told the Russian press agency RIA Novosti: "Men believe not in words but in deeds", so the lack of opposition is nothing more than evidence of maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunette: "From now on breakfast before work"
It never happened in the history of Palazzo Chigi that there were revolving doors to the entrance and exit of the employees.
But from now on, this new measure against the smarts starts, against the stampers and then goes for a coffee at the bar on working hours.
The new anti-fanglery was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary-General of the Council Presidency, Mauro Masi.
"The revolving doors - says Brunetta - are a tool to work better, with more productivity, more presences and more services," the minister says.
"Now a new season of accountability and transparency opens.
This is reformism," says Brunetta.
Palazzo Chigi completes the installation in all the palaces of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of revolving doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There was no resistance from the employees, assures the secretary general: "It was a process shared by the workers and there was the collaboration of all".
In short, no more breakfast on working hours; no more coffee and croissant.
The word of Brunetta, who suggests, smiling, "a nice cappuccino at 7 a.m. is a holy hand".
During a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
of Rome, the minister then announces that "in three months absences due to the illness of civil servants have been reduced by 50%, that is to say 60 thousand more people at work in a year".
And he adds that it is necessary to make the Public Administration more efficient
Italian, "whose wage dynamics - explains the minister - in the last 8-10 years have been double compared to the private sector and well above inflation rates".
Meanwhile thousands of civil servants have joined to contest the rules of the Brunetta decree adhering to the appeal supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister of the Public Function today issues about the least absenteeism at work due to illness - writes the consumer association - the people of the 'industrious straws' are constantly growing.
In fact, thousands in Italy are the employees of the correct and productive public administration who have joined to declare war on the illegitimate norms contained in the decree".
In particular, the Tar will contest the exclusion of additional economic treatments for infirmity dependent on cause of service; the extension of the time slots of availability of the sick worker, within which the checks are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions wanted by the minister.
Work accidents, Napolitano: "Criminal prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 remain permanently disabled.
For 2007, Inail data confirm that the white deaths were about 1,200.
Figures that testify to the severity of a phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic issue, today the Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th National Day for the victims of accidents at work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data disseminated by the Anmil and the same tragic chronicles of these days confirm how crucial the question of work prevention is," says the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the president of the Anmil, National Association mutilated and disabled of the work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "live appreciation for the continued associative commitment to prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, the care of families of victims and public awareness".
"Of course, an outraged 'just', sincerely shared, arose in the face of tragedies that, due to their size, arouse the clamor of the media and the involvement of public opinion but daily reality brings back dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics".
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly also a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
The many initiatives promoted in the school field are particularly significant for a more direct awareness by young people who are in the world of work.
It is necessary to keep the attention to the phenomenon alive, not to degrade in the alarm about its social gravity, to apply and improve the legislative norms.
For his part, the president of the House Gianfranco Fini stressed "how the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each one of us and imposes on all institutions a firm commitment to put an urgent end to it".
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not prevent the number of white deaths from still impressive," said Anmil president Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not want this downward trend to be less careful, because it is precisely when attention is loosened that tragedy explodes.
"We believe that too little is still being done at a general level to counter the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be exercised through multiple actions.
They are necessary, in our opinion - it has emphasized Mercandelli - greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger participation on the formation of the workers, and this starting from the world of the school".
"It needed a further effort - he added - in terms of communication and public awareness.
But above all, we need a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the levels of compensation for the victims of work" and "the welfare drift towards which the system has been pushing in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to give back to the worker the insurance guarantee - he added - so that the fate of the injured should not depend on spontaneousisms or donations from time to time arranged by the legislator".
Mp3 readers under charge, risk hearing
Listening to high volume music for an extended period of time using portable music devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing injury.
This is what the European Commission reports, which in a statement published in Brussels quotes the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (Csseri) of the EU, published today.
"From this scientific opinion - it is read in the note - it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable music devices weekly for more than one hour a day keeping the apparatus at high volume risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity".
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and mobile phones at high noise levels can unconsciously damage their hearing irreparably," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From scientific findings - continues the responsible EU - a clear risk emerges and we must react quickly.
Most importantly, we need to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
We must also review existing control systems, in the light of this scientific opinion, to ensure that they are fully effective and keep pace with the new technology."
Brussels had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the large use of portable musical instruments and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise from them.
"Scientists - concludes the EU executive - confirm that there is a cause for concern and the European Commission will now examine together with Member States and stakeholders what measures could be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable music equipment and related equipment".
At present, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music equipment to 100 dB, but concerns about hearing damage that may result from excessive exposure to such sources of noise are growing.
This damage can be greatly reduced by means of solutions such as reducing noise levels and exposure duration.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee points out that users of portable music equipment if they listen to music at high volume (more than 89 decibels) for only 5 hours a week exceed the limits currently in force regarding the maximum noise permitted at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing ability after a period of 5 years.
This would affect 5 to 10% of the users of such appliances and their number can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno kicks off the Commission for the future of capital
Today it begins, in March it closes, in June the sums will be drawn.
This is the timetable set by the Capitol for the work of the "Committee for the Future of Rome Capital", which settled this morning in its new headquarters behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the 49 other members of the Commission will develop guidelines for Rome.
Once the doors are closed in March, the Board and the City Council will evaluate analyses and projects, so that they can present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and there are all political, social and cultural ideas represented - he wishes to stress - He will have to provide proposals for an idea of Rome's development which the political decision-makers, who remain the Junta and the City Council, will then be able to use.
There is no overlap of roles but only the will to have a place to elaborate a great project for Rome.
In March he will finish his work and then dissolve, because this experience must have a precise time limit.
In June - announced the mayor - we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of Rome Capitale".
To those who accuse the Commission of being useless, since its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replied: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and the quality of its proposals.
If quality is there, as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure in Rome, its contribution will be crucial.
Too often politics is crushed on the management of the daily life and on the emergencies that from time to time are kept.
On the contrary, we want to look further and further, in a deeper perspective, working with seriousness on the development of Rome and its future."
Moreover, the mayor of Rome wishes to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless body nor a carriage: it is absolutely free, it will not cost a euro to the Roman citizens and will serve to reason and involve the best intelligences that the Capital expresses".
For Alemanno, in fact, "it is necessary to have a strategic reference design, not closed or motionless, to allow our city to make an authentic leap of level, which it absolutely needs, thinking with unitary spirit to its future".
A future that, the mayor of Rome states "will not limit itself to the current municipal boundaries but will look far beyond" not only in view of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital but "also in view of the role that Rome can and must play as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president. That's why
He wrote a well-known American politician who wants us to pass for independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who by his decisions decimated the US economy and had relations (as he does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam".
Attacks against Obama are increasing just as the election date approaches.
She wrote a Miami lady on a web: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a lot of nerve: he believes he will win the highest office of a nation he has had in all two governors and five black senators!".
In fact they are attacks that do not say much; they are clearly racial attacks and do not answer the voters' question: will it be a good president? And then there are the polls; they all say Obama will win and with a good detachment.
Again, there are those who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the bowels of the south of the United States, wrote an editorial: once in the voting booth we know who the American patriot will vote for.
It comes out one side of the U.S. mentality kept covered to the last.
"Say what you want, then we'll take care of where to put the cross, whether on Obama or McCain".
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave America.
Things never said before, which seem almost certain the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all this reasoning, the winning weapon for Democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: what were Bush's mistakes during his term of office? 89 percent replied: Iraq.
It changes America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home kicks in the butt.
In Iraq there are 4500 soldiers who have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack.
Yet, Iraq for the majority was Bush's weak spot.
Whoever takes George W's place will have a huge task to do.
Usa, the economic collapse is also felt by journalists: in the newspapers it is time to cut. And many blame the internet, "killer" of the printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists were questioned by the PEW Research Center on the state of their profession and mind control regarding the future.
Well, today journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, newsmen have not openly stated that they feel less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel as isolated as they used to.
The problem for U.S. journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of destroyed economic model.
Moreover, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where editors work to put together newspapers, is a big problem.
It is a problem that needs to be resolved, according to the journalists interviewed, if we do not want traditional journalism as the large public understands it to shrink substantially.
A clear but complex pessimism pervades the American journalist today.
Six out of ten newspapermen and senior executives are convinced that national news is on the wrong track.
In the local field the executive group is 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web goes.
The major publishing houses open a gap to the internet, for many seen as the "killer" of printed paper.
The "economic pressure" that journalists feel has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope that it "does something good" for their journalism.
The biggest break in American journalism today is between those who direct newsrooms - i.e. directors - and reporters who work for them.
56% of national executives are sure that their reporters divide their values, while at local level the percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this has to do with "work security".
Executives who think they lose their jobs within 3 years are at 47% nationwide.
For the staff reporters we go to 30%.
The "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, ed.) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work with a contract.
In an immense nation like the US, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and internet employers often offer what they want and thus become a matter of "take it or leave it", take it or leave it.
Directors receive almost always large wages, while the editor can earn even $10,000 a month, as well as pension and insurance payment.
For holidays, then, the reasoning becomes complicated: tot days after the first year, tot after the third to get to 15 days overall after a number of years.
But American journalists, by their admission, often "sick" during the year.
It's all about the weather.
UNIPOL: TRIBUNALE ROMA, DANILO COPPOLA RESTA A GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second penal section of the court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the request of the immobiliarist Danilo Coppola who had asked to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a dwelling in the city of Rome.
Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy in the context of the counter-pattern investigation of the Unipol-Bnl climb.
During the trial against him, last week, he obtained the release from the housekeepers transformed into an obligation to reside in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the immobiliarist could travel from the provincial town to a dwelling in the capital.
According to the court, however, these movements (to which the PM has given the contrary opinion) would allow him to influence his company and access the evidence that accuse him.
The elites in danger
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago with the House of Representatives vote against the $700 billion bailout plan launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
The New York Times of yesterday confirms this by informing us that the current crisis is breaking the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, instead, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington" and the world of finance, strong especially in the States of Central and South.
The soul, in fact, that became overwhelmingly alive with the vote of which I said at the beginning.
However, this is just one example of the changes, the great changes, which the current economic earthquake perhaps heralds or already shows: not only in the United States but throughout the West and perhaps not even here alone.
Both in the US and in Europe, the crisis seems to function as an incubation accelerator for a long time that in the new climate solidifies and finally comes to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-realization, the extraordinary revival, of the dual category State-sovereignity in relation to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions which, yes, have deep ties with foreign countries, but which first of all see the budgets of people and families living in a single country, in a single state, very much involved.
This immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: namely how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and families who, among other things, are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically world-wide but politically it is almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems fundamentally out of the question or not to have much to say: the clear evidence is that the European Union, divided as usual between the different interests and between the different state strategies, fails to decide any common political line.
And so it is from the government of every single state that everyone expects interventions, rescue and revival plans, new rules, and above all the provision of funds: since when we get to grips it is only the states that possess the economic resources, the mass of financial resources that can try to put things back together.
And they also have the necessary means and the right to use them: two resources of immeasurable value, in certain circumstances, of which no market and no international organization will probably ever be able to dispose to a similar extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis places on the state-national element is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the increasing importance that the most recent developments in the economy tend to attribute to a factor very closely linked to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had now entered the realm of the network, of the increasingly sophisticated technology, of the immaterial, while we were convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we suddenly realized that our future will have to deal more and more with those very little immaterial things that are water, crops, oil.
All things that, look a little bit, can certainly be transported from one place to another of the earth but are still absolutely linked to a circumscribed space, to a territory.
So that those who are sovereign, certainly have several more cards than those who are not, to those who have the misfortune to live in a place without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second new feature, however, that foresaw a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this respect, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand the awareness of the objective need for authoritative leadership, the request of someone who knows how to take control of the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leaders, economic species, proved so inadequate and full of shadow zones.
And together something even deeper and in a certain sense disturbing: a discredit, an intolerance, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class in an increasing number of Western countries.
In other words, the conviction seems to grow more and more, in vast sectors of the population, that before their actions are the same ideas as the social elites so far in vogue, their way of feeling and being, their culture in the overall sense of the term, to have made their own time and to be increasingly foreign to the opinions of majorities.
The demand for leadership, in short, subterraneanly feeds a branched but powerful movement of delegitimization of the traditional ruling classes and political arrangements, which manifests itself in the sudden "revolts" election or in the sudden turn of the collective moods of these last and very recent times, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavaria to the collapse of Labour consensus in Britain, to the rebellion of the American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps even the victory of the right in Italy has something to do with it).
There is the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their formats would say someone, make it increasingly difficult to understand, and therefore to represent, what is not taking shape from today in the deep strata of Western societies and that the economic crisis reinvigorates, increases, potentially shakes to an extent.
In the face of all this, talking about a 'rebellion of the masses' on the agenda would be frankly exaggerated.
But keeping your eyes open is certainly not for nothing.
The superglue to walk on the walls
Defeat the laws of gravity thanks to super glue and in the future walk on the walls as Spiderman.
It is the goal of several American research centers and now a team of four institutes has come very close.
With an adhesive of only 2.5 square centimeters, scholars were able to glue a body of 100 kilograms onto a vertical wall.
THE STUDIO – The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of scholars is an evolution of those existing using a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a pile of spaghetti," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have inspired themselves to the legs of geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that can ensure perfect adherence to the animal.
Tests carried out on different materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles and at the same time "it easily detaches from the wall", explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton's Engineering Faculty.
WALK ON MURI? -"This material could be useful as a transitory adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on the walls just like Spiderman? Maybe so, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications could be aerospace engineering.
So far, no superheroes.
THE OTHER RESEARCH – The University of Berkeley, California, is also devoting itself to the search for a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society magazine, Californian scholars presented an adhesive formed by microfibres as hair self-cleaning from dust during movement on a surface to always maintain perfect adhesion.
Medicines: Never with fruit juices
Be careful with grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in summer because they are thirst-quenching and rich in vitamins, if taken at the same time as some life-saving drugs alter their absorption by amplifying or decreasing their effectiveness as appropriate with serious consequences for health.
To underline the risks of both packaged and fresh fruit juices associated with taking certain medicines David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who since the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia launches a new alarm: a glass of grapefruit juice, orange and apple juice is enough to reduce the absorption of some life-saving drugs, cancelling their beneficial effects and putting at risk the health of patients.
Grapefruit juice had already been accused because it was considered responsible for increasing the effects of certain antiarrhythmic medicinal products, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines and neurological medicinal products to levels considered toxic.
FARMACI A HAZARD - The Italian drug agency itself reported this in a newsletter two years ago alerting doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger resulting from this mix and to pay attention to what they drink in case they take drugs such as Diazepam or Metadone.
NOT ONLY POMPELM - According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
Along the list of active substances inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Hence the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department of the State University of Milan:"These findings are usually immediately reported to the various international and national drug agencies that eventually provide to change the information notes of medicines.
So always read the illustrative leaflets of the medicines you take and if there is something that is not clear to us, do not make us impressed but ask for clarification from the doctor or pharmacist» the expert pointed out to the agency Ansa.
The Nobel Prize in Economics at Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize for Economics was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies on trade patterns and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a Neokeynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known columnist of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the major critics of Bush administration's economic and foreign policy choices.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, on the days Enron failed, Krugman predicted in an editorial published in the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on U.S. history.
A prediction that sparked not a few controversy and that for years was reproached to the economist, but that has now turned out to be exact.
"I am surprised and also a little shocked at the speed with which the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom disappeared from the attention of the public," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "economist of great value", but also a popularizer with a "very aggressive style, particularly critical against the excesses of liberalism of the Bush administration".
Open Office, here is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the best known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year of work by volunteer developers, behind whom SUN Microsystem is watching, the new Open Office shows itself to the general public with several new features: to the welcome screen and the revised interface and made less Spartan, more substantial ones such as native compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, the latest ISO standard version.
Attention is also placed to interoperability with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific features of some modules such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example to send them via email, or the ability to import PDF files into the graphical processing module, preserving the original appearance of the page.
Also on this front you can create "PDF hybrid" documents, which add the typical graphics of Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text processor.
The collaboration is an element that has received several improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet you can intervene in several hands between different users, avoiding conflicts over changes, in the text processor, each contributor is assigned a color in the comments for a better recognizability during the revision.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice features to the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should release the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://en.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and has been added to the English version that has been on mirrors since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
The installation cd can also be shipped home or at the workplace on request.
And if the theme of gratuitousness can be a driving force for the diffusion in the homes, it is precisely in the business area that Open Office attempts the great bet, already being able to count on several projects carried out in the public administration and in the schools.
And there are also the realities that offer an ideal training, consulting and assistance service for small and medium-sized companies, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for Word's consideration videowriting; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for Powerpoint emulus presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the most famous Access is the program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, is finally the graphical module.
The goal for 2008 is to get to 5 million downloads, and considering that to date we are at almost 3 million 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that we can also exceed the expected figure.
Kohl is also positive is the fourth case of doping
A new case of positivity at the last Tour de France: this is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the Gerolsteiner team, third runner-up and winner of the best climber jersey.
The news is reported by the website of the newspaper L'Equipe.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth positive racer at the Cera, the third generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also of Gerolsteiner.
The tests on Kohl's blood samples are among those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-analysis confirms the positivity in Cera, the Austrian will lose third place on the Tour and will meet the two years of canonical disqualification.
To confirm Kohl's positivity at the third generation Epo, he is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who informed the Associated Press that he had notified the positivity to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian finished on the final podium behind Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, also winning the best climber's polka dots jersey.
IMMIGRATES:NEW YORK TIMES WISHES, IS ITALY RAZZIST?
Italy "from a country of emigrants has only recently turned into a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed reluctantly.
Is this turning the Belpaese into a nation of racists? It is what is asked in a long article the New York Times that has devoted a long article to the debate on racism in Italy starting from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what Nyt calls the "northern paradox": the northern regions are at the same time those where there is "more integration and more work" but also the "highest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the highest support for the Northern League".
To confirm the increasing tension between Italians and immigrants, Nyt also mentioned episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only that.
The new legislation wanted by the League that tightens the brakes on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
Trend underlined by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano meeting Benedict XVI at the Quirinale asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism".
Students who are victims of the caro-rents up to 900 euros per room
The rent market for university students knows no crisis.
According to Sunia's latest investigation, the tenant union, taking a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now assumed very serious characteristics to the point of excluding entire groups of young people from the right to study for the very high total costs that the families of origin should bear - explains the head of the study office of Sunia, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand from students has so deformed the market that it triggers a process of generalized increase also for residents".
In most cases, rental offers also contain a number of violations: free, unregistered contracts, without limit of rent, sub-rents linked.
For Sunia, extraordinary measures are needed which, through the revision of taxation, can calm down prices.
Looking at the detail of the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room you go from a minimum of 650 (Black Bande area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate area, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 (Victoria area).
In Florence a bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in the areas close to the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a bed in a double, from 370 to 500 for a single.
In Rome in areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) about 600 euros are requested for a single room, 450 for a bed in a double room.
Values only slightly lower (550 euro for a single room) in areas close to the other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You save only if you move to peripheral areas: 300 euros for one bed and 450 a single in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar areas.
In Naples for a bed you need 300/450 euros, for a room you spend from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the areas Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
Bari needs 250/350 euro for a single bed, at least 350 euro for a single bed.
In smaller cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but have a greater weight in the city economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of rents to non-EU students is more frequent, as in Perugia, there is a further anomaly: the increase of about 25/30% of the fee required of foreign students compared to that applied to Italians.
Farewell old cinema Paradise, cities erase historic halls
Historical cinemas close in favor of the Multiplexes.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes".
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore photographes effectively what is happening in the large Italian urban centers but also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth in the suburbs of the large multi-sales and the consequent death by consumption of the single rooms in the central areas of the cities, is one of those events that appear to us ineluctable and incontrovertible but also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
To disappear are often historical places and full of memory, "it is as if a friend, an acquaintance with whom we shared a piece of street and many emotions," observes the director of New Cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago earned Tornatore the Oscar award and the Grand Prix of the Cannes jury, and that told the poetry of a provincial room and nostalgia for a way of living lost cinema maybe forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of exhibitors, speak clearly: in the last five years 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and to pay the biggest scott are mainly the halls in the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures stands Emilia-Romagna with 82 single-sala cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And as a demonstration that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of multiplex, these are the three Italian regions that have recorded the most number of new multisala cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 both in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian exercise has developed irrationally", Paolo Protti, president of Anec, observes, "it is useful to build new structures but we should guarantee the survival of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all its visitors are willing to move into multiplexes.
Not to mention the lack of funding for the fund for exhibitors: the state's previous debt is about EUR 10 million.
It is shameful, from an ethical and moral point of view, that the Government does not respect existing laws.
In order to support the field they would serve between the 16 and the 18 million euros the year".
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, worried about the closures, decided to run to the shelters with the signing of a protocol between Comune and Anec, the first of this type in Italy, to protect and promote cinemas single room both in the historic center and in the suburbs.
Among the proposed rules are tax facilitation measures for operators and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic area and will have special parking rates and some parking lots.
"I like this initiative", Giuseppe Tornatore observes, "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by setting up other measures.
It is certain, however, that in order to counteract the overpower of multiplexes, traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image, because the audience today is more demanding.
The defence of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to do "New Cinema Paradiso", which I have been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass in front of the Rialto or the Quirinale of via Nazionale now closed, where I have experienced so many shared emotions, not to see the black billboards from the dust I turn to the other side".
Links between politics and 'ndrangheta arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to standardize the municipal choices to the interests of the Piromalli thigh".
The accusations that the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria address to the mayor and deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and to the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition in mafia association, are heavy.
In handcuffs also Gioacchino Piromalli, the elderly mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his nephew lawyer, the boss of the same name, already sentenced for association for mafia-style delinquency, sentenced to compensate 10 million euros.
"In contempt of any legal and moral norm, as well as common sense," the prosecutors wrote, the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay advice to lawyer Piromalli.
"It would have been thus granted to the thigh - the judges write - to enter officially inside the municipalities facilitating the possibilities, already huge, of control and direction of the public administration".
The president of the Calabrian regional junta Agazio Loiero does not hide that "collusions between local authorities and organized underworld there are several" in his region: "There are areas where the Mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressures of 'ndrangheta, heroes who keep themselves clean".
This morning's arrests follow those of last July with which the police announced that they had beheaded the leg Piromalli.
Since the end of April, Gioia Tauro's municipal council had been dissolved but already in 1991, and always due to alleged influences between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been relieved of the task of administering the Municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, Mayor of Udc at the time of his dissolution, had been elected head of a centre-right coalition, after the May 2006 ballot.
He shouted at the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the city council.
He called into question the then Deputy Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti, accusing him of having planned the whole thing for a political issue, but the judges, in the arrest order signed this morning, explain that the leg Piromalli had even come to ask for the variation of the project of the A3.
From the environmental interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, write the pm, emerged "the willingness to marry the needs of an entrepreneur, representative of a larger group known to be close to the Piromalli, standardizing the choices of the public administration to the interests of the thigh".
When the energy comes from the waves now the big ones fall into the field
It is an exterminated field, which occupies over 70% of the planet's surface and is now being discovered by the world's largest energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which they have put their eyes, and now they try to put their hands, giants like Chevron.
The possibility of obtaining energy from sea movements has been studied for a hundred years and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil dropped, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now environmentalists and the new rise in oil give impetus to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15% of the world's electricity needs could be covered by sea wave exploitation plants.
This would be twice as much as the amount currently produced by nuclear power stations.
And in addition there would be currents and tides.
Colossi on the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a plant in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced it seemed a revolutionary step.
Two years later they are increasingly betting on marine energy and among these companies have always been devoted to traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technologies - said the spokesperson for a subsidiary company to the US oil giant at the Wall Street Journal economic newspaper - and is considering cooperating with us".
The cooperation in question concerns obtaining a permit from the US Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a marine energy exploitation project in Alaska.
It is a very good signal, especially considering that in Alaska the US continues to extract oil and President Bush recently started a plan for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron there are Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey to cover the road of energy that comes from the sea and the sums invested so far, as not known in the details, indicate an increasing interest according to observers.
Technology to be developed.
Experts talk about a technology still in its infancy, also because marine energy does not escape all doubts about the environmental impact.
For now, plants such as Portugal or some in Scotland are small and do not seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
In order to produce large-scale energy, however, technologies with a greater environmental impact must be used.
And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other.
The thrust of the waves, which causes the buoys to move up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure by pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
Pressure runs a turbine that in turn powers a generator.
The electricity is sent ashore through submarine cables.
For now there are four plants of this type being designed, waiting only for federal approval and part of the energy could serve for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a mall and a parking lot using six submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The movement of water when there are tides rotates the blades of the turbines, creating a rotary movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant said it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary permissions to take advantage of the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they tell the Institute for the research of electricity, deserves at this moment the potential of tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as an energy source.
It is precisely on the energy of the tides that states like that of New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others bordering on the coast, have already invested 7 and a half million dollars in 2008 and previewed investments up to 35 million for 2009.
