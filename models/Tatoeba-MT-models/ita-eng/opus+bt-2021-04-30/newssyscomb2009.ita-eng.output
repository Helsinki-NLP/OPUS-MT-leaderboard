The triumph of right-wing populists in Austria: in total they have 29%
The perceptible weakening of both existing parties in the grand coalition and this marked strengthening of the right-wing populist parties led, according to the first provisional results, to the early parliamentary elections in Austria on Sunday.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), within which the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously waving, has suffered particularly strong losses.
On the contrary, the Union's electoral leader for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the sub-prefect of Kärnten Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphal return to national politics.
According to the provisional results, the country's strongest party remains the socio-democratic party (SPÖ) with 29.8% of the vote, but it lost 5.5% compared to the last elections in 2006.
Even worse it went for ÖVP, which lost with 25.6% almost 9% of the vote.
These are the worst results of these two great parties in the post-war Austrian history and especially the literally catastrophic result of the popular, which resulted in early elections.
Even at the beginning of July, when theVP left the coalition, the people had a considerable advantage in the preferences ahead of SPÖ.
But the voters evidently punished them for sinking the government.
Already in the first reactions to the results there were speculations about the possible resignation of the party president, Vice Chancellor Wilhelm Monterer.
Observers believe that it could already take place on Monday during the extraordinary convocation of the party's leadership.
This evolution should perhaps facilitate the path towards the ever more likely way out of the election result, that is to say towards the renewal of the SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
With regard to the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Liberals (FPÖ) gained 18% in advance and the BZÖ 11% in votes - but the socio-democratics simultaneously revealed the concern of another 1999, when the populists agreed with the popular to the collective government, (then the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 it separated from the BZÖ) which was even a reason for sanctions by the EU.
On this evolution Haider evidently plays, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party and presumes a return to Vienna in national politics.
The Green Party also managed to enter Parliament, but it fell slightly, going down among the Austrian political parties from third to fifth.
No other party has clearly exceeded the 4% threshold and has not entered Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relationships with India can be cooled
If the problem could not be resolved with Czech scientists who have been accused of the illegal collection of beetles in India, it would be according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The Minister mentioned this in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If it is not resolved, then yes, that there would be some cooling," he noted after the meeting that took place on the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee after negotiations said that executive power can hardly meddle in legal matters.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted of the charge and punished by a fine, the central government can negotiate with the local government in Dardjeeling which falls under its jurisdiction.
"Your problem could be solved," said the Minister.
According to Mukherjee it would be better, for Emil Kučera sentenced to three years in prison, to resort to a higher instance.
Then you can ask for release on bail and wait for the sentence to be released.
Mr Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner spoke in the same way during the negotiations.
"Recommends appeal to the Major Court then it will be possible to obtain grace," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech side can enter the matter is to lend the condemned the "competent legal support", the Indian Minister said.
At the same time he said that such support is already lending him the Indian side.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relationships that have been handed down for many years with India.
The Indians admit it, too," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told ČTK, he pointed out in front of his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really consider the imprisonment and prosecution of these Czech scientists to be a profound mistake," he said.
The minister avoided answering the question if he got on the Indian side the promise to take care of the matter.
"I have achieved relatively many promises," he merely noted.
A Czech judge in the battle for the seabed
It approaches the electronic map on the wall on which Australia and the adjacent marine areas are drawn.
But he is not interested in the continent but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and along with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is at the same time as large as the continent itself, says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of a team of 33 OSN Division workers for ocean issues and maritime rights.
His head, the Czech attorney director of the Division, Václav Mikulka, is following his presentation and occasionally adds something.
It dominates the desire to work and enthusiasm.
The seabed still hides a little-known world rich in natural resources.
It is possible to find oil, metal ores and other mineral materials, but also living organisms that are unknown so far that they carry within themselves the key to the discovery of medicine against cancer.
The largest seabed on the mainland
Coastal states have begun to lend interest to submarine territory.
According to the OSN convention, they take advantage of the laws on which they made an agreement in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is above all the area of the so-called continental platform that often extends up to several hundred kilometers from the coast of the state in question.
According to the Convention, that has an exclusive right over all the resources of the continental platform.
"In short, a continental platform means that part of the seabed and its subsoil which is a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
The so-called exclusive economic zone extends beyond the territorial sea often over 200 nautical miles," Mikulka explains.
The request for which the country submits to the Committee on the definition of the size of the continental shelf must be accompanied by very extensive scientific and technical documentation based on many costly surveys and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparation.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical-professional assistance.
So far, the committee has dealt with five requests, namely Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three nominees were successful," Mikulka adds.
Australia’s recent success, which has greatly expanded its marine possessions, has seen a worldwide echo.
But also New Zealand gained us - the surface of the seabed, which was assigned to it by the commission last week, about 1.6 square kilometers so about six times larger than the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profit, which will yield to him in the future from the seabed, as they are promised, will be inestimable.
Other states will also gradually submit their requests.
They can do so for ten years since the "Montego Bay Convention" has been ratified.
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean bottom that the convention has declared a common heritage of humanity begins."
No state has an exclusive position here.
The right of extraction in this area shall be granted by this international institution established by the Convention.
"But the Seabed is not Klondike," says exaggerating Director Mikulka, "with the fact that its individual parts are legally demarcated and their regime contractually established".
Czechs in the Pacific
A part of the seabed now also belongs to the Czech Republic.
If he divides it with other states of the former Soviet bloc within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
It acquired in 1991 according to the convention, as well as investors from a few other states, the status of so-called "pioneer investor".
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean extended between Mexico, Hawaii Islands and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor and slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is jagged, it is an almost underwater replica of Tatry.
"It is possible to extract from the total area of 75 000 square kilometers.
The area is a field rich in polymetallic agglomerations containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," explains another Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian division worker Rober Sandev carries an exhibit to show it.
It looks like a small potato or with a little imagination, a legendary schem, as in the legend of the awakening of the Golem.
German special units were present at the release of hostages
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany for the release of hostages – the experts then arrived.
When the situation became critical, the special units were ready, but they did not intervene.
We are getting more and more detailed information on the circumstances surrounding the release of the 11 hostages.
German special units participated in the rescue operation as mentioned by the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior.
In addition to military specialists were present on the spot GSG9 units, the Avian Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office as well as the logistics experts of the technical institution.
As the minister spokeswoman said on Monday evening, the German units did not intervene because the kidnappers, given the danger of force intervention, released the hostages fleeing.
The Egyptian government accepted the help offered by the Germans, to join as assistance directly on the spot.
"We didn't get there luckily," says a spokesperson for the interior ministry.
Assailants kidnapped a group of travelers in the south of Egypt on 19 September: 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian companions.
After the kidnapping in a deserted area in southern Egypt the hostages were deported to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers until the end has remained secreted as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
The liberated in the meantime arrived in good condition in Cairo.
Steinmeier said, that the hostages released are under the protection of the German embassy.
It was not explained on the details of the release.
There was no information in Berlin for when they were coming back to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild" the 5 vacationers and special units should leave in flight with an Air Force Airbus and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
American House of Representatives rejects the rescue package.
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress just bankrupted the $700 billion bailout package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell down.
With 206 entries toward 227 the American representative house rejected the government's bailout package for the financial markets.
Despite the calls of US President George W. Bush and prominent politicians of both parties there had been no majority for the program, with which the chaos of the financial markets should have stemmed.
In a dramatic action supporters desperately tried, to persuade critics by the heavy $700 mld package.
Barney Frank, one of the negotiating leaders, incited the MPs to consent, although the plan was unpopular.
8. It is difficult to have gratitude to avoid something, which has not yet arrived..
While suffrage was in progress, Dow Jones collapsed more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The reason for investors' concerns was that the state rescue package could have failed.
He recovered before the end of the vote and then, after the announcement of failure, collapse again.
Experts now expect more serious turbulence on the international financial markets.
In order to ensure that the programme enters into force, it must have the approval of both the Chamber of Members and the Senate.
Promoters record increasing numbers of bookings
It seems it will be a good winter for German tour operators:
According to a study the turnover on travel bookings for the next few months compared to the previous year has increased clearly - for the winter season even more than 30%.
Despite weak economic views, the desire to travel by the Germans according to an investigation remains firm.
On the bookings for the winter season the travel agencies recorded a 31 % increase in turnover compared to the same period of the previous year, as the German association for tourism DRV said on Monday in Berlin.
According to the investigation of the GfK market research institute there are increased booking quotas even for the autumn months.
So the surplus of travel agencies for October compared with 2007 would amount to around 11%, the DRV reported.
Important for these results are the GfK figures, which monthly analyzes the booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and develops statistical projections for the entire market.
Also included would be travel bookings made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the low dollar price, particularly required would be trips to the United States, the DRV reported.
Here the increase in reservations would amount to about a third.
It would also be particularly popular for the Germans to travel to Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as to locations within Germany.
Especially all-inclusive travel has a high price, explained DRV president Klaus Laepple.
Considering the rising costs for energy and food, the costs in this case would be "better to calculate for customers than for a holiday organized individually".
Consumers could save money through, among others, discounts for reservations made in advance or offers with everything included, Laepple explained.
Even the summer months would have recorded excellent booking figures, so much so that compared to the year before there would have been a turnover surplus again - although according to a further study the number of Germans who undertook a trip, compared to the previous year has dropped.
My first time at Oktoberfest
Hits of Ballermann, one-litre mug beer and VIP in Dirndln designeri.
A debut at Wiesn
Susanne Kronzucker and I actually have not much in common.
She is blonde, television moderator and wears a tailor-made Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is second hand.
But one thing unites us: just 3 minutes at Wiesn, photographers already throw themselves at us and take photos until they fill the memory of cameras – very flattering, and this at my first visit to Wiesn.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap Dirndl seems to reach its goal.
As a tourist of Wiesn and actually living north of the white sausage equator, the sense of well-being in the costume/dress until now is still within limits.
But once you get to Theresienwiese, it's nothing serious.
Almost everyone wears Dirndl or leather pants; nobody looks disgusted or embarrassed – everything perfectly normal.
Only my Dirndl's apron picks up strange looks at the chocolate banana stand.
A monacense points out to me that I would tie the apron in a wrong way: "On the left you are free, in the middle you are a virgin, on the right you are busy, behind a widow."
I'll sneak the bow from the back to the left.
All right," he says and laughs.
Others make less waste of subtle flirting techniques and wear sober felt hats, on which leads "To drunk to get dressed!" and stretch their bare behind against an uninvited one.
The boy with exhibitionist inclinations is called Bob, comes from England and also visits Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a "oooooo" trail.
This tells me, after he got rid of his beer mug from a liter he drank earlier.
Right next to one of these hydrants, which everyone thinks is a garbage can.
Bob is one of these notorious "Wildbiesler."
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol like this.
At about 8 in the evening, the health care workers walk in packs on the square of the feast, taking care of the poor beons.
Nurses appear each time in packs – always 4 at a time drag a stretcher covered with tent into a tent.
This works as with most Wiesn visitors: you go empty, you return full.
Who lies under the tarp in this blood-alcoholic casket, you can't see it.
"Des sind die, wos goarnimmer packn", one of the sanitaries yells at me and disappears into the coffin.
Victim of a police-identified incident
A 63-year-old woman who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle while walking to Essex was identified.
Carole Paulson, of Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the incident Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in town.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but she died shortly thereafter.
After the incident a 51-year-old man was arrested on a careless driving charge.
He was released on bail.
Turkey is expanding diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey tried to enter the European Union, the European powers were anxious to penetrate deep into the Turkish hinterland.
On the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 steps in Asia, is one of the most beautiful relics of this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in neo-renaissance style.
This is at least what the tourist guides tell you.
The building stands as knights between the end of the platforms with a tower on each of its corners looking to the world like some German provincial municipalities.
The stone is dirty.
The entire building slightly decaying.
But once inside the ticket office from the vaulted ceiling, there is no doubt about the size of the enterprise of what was the most western passage.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a delayer to the imperial game, wanted to realize its ambitions of dominating the Middle East by means of this railroad that ran to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond in what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany's imperial ambitions sank during World War I.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
Its isolation from the surrounding region, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has passed
British and dominatrix forces advanced out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was bad news for Hyderpasha Station, too.
In 1917 an ammunition train broke out destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then he has slowly gone into disintegration, widely surpassed by history.
But nowadays, this railway outlet for Anatolia and all the points to the east serve - at least symbolically - to highlight the ever-greater diplomatic horizons of Turkey.
The ruling party of Justice and Development - the AKP - has created an entire new foreign policy for the country.
Its isolation from its surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has passed.
Now there is a new policy of commitment.
Significantly, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To estimate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I embarked on the sleeping car for the Turkish capital Ankara, to visit one of the main foreign policy experts of the AKP, the Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a jolting run along the slopes that produced the ancient world cadences of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - proposed as a new city for a secular state intent on turning my back on its Ottoman past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic root represents an exemplary shift in Turkish consensus.
He suggested some suspicions in the West, more notably in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by malls built vehicles and pastry shops of power, where managers in business suits - both men and women - meet to make early morning contracts.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a center-right politician from almost any other political party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he had a Blackberry, too.
"The purpose of the foreign policy party now is to reinstate Turkey with its closest neighbours.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he tells me.
Turkey has been cut off from its hinterland.
Today he must look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't the case with one or the other.
They must be both.
"But surely at some point," I ask, "will Turkey be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he says, "does not want to face that choice."
Then he points out one point that almost everyone I have spoken to here has recited by heart: not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus, and all around the Black Sea, are as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, Europe as a whole can metaphorically travel those railway lines east through Asia and the Middle East.
Again at the Hydarpasha station, after another blank night, I think of those two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who had looked at this building built 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to find that Europe's Middle Eastern ambitions can now be largely in Turkey's hands.
And while I wait at the terminal for the ferry that takes me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey has always been called "the sick man of Europe".
At least then there seemed to be no doubt as to which continent was to make claims about this fascinating country.
Remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: as Guildford's music director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (obituary, September 11) had the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and choir in charge.
As a member of his music scheme for the municipality, the following year he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus.
They were supposed to be under-21/under 21, but at the time Proteus sang his final in 1979, many of us were more than twenty-year-olds - we simply refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being-changeable) represented the goodwill of the choir and the ability to deal with everything music presented to do, both madrigal and Messiaen, without accompaniment or with the whole orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting, and it was all because of the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for the music that remained absolutely constant through the years.
How often we were told by Tod to "let music speak for itself".
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in the music.
So sing it!"
His technique in using the wand was absolutely clear and precise, though never dictatorial nor flowering.
Whatever the musical standard, it made it rise more and more.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If you were to appoint a knight an orchestra conductor it would be Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades in which he led the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years and more I have covered more than 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I have never disagreed with only one of them - and many times inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of personal greatness and modesty.
He hated conductors who, in his own words, simply "climbed around the world one or two well-known battle horses".
So many of us are going to miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary by William Woodruff (25 September) specifies that "in 1946 he resumed studying economic history in Oxford and in 1950 became a researcher in Houblon-Norman... studying at the same time for a science degree, one in letters and a PhD".
This follows from Woodruff's author's note in Beyond Nab End, but is incorrect.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a university professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, at that time completed a PhD thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J. D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He spent 1950–51 in the USA as a researcher in Houblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he permanently left Nottingham for Illinois.
Because Woodruff chose to cover this part of his career, you don't know.
J. Vincent Resino at the Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco y vida", because his black and white photographs, in documentary style, are extraordinary.
They drew my attention to the simplicity and strength they transmit, while treating the protagonists with particular respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of sentiment.
Resin manages to capture magical moments."
Second assault on Honda supersales
In November Honda will start marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the previous model was already equipped with great habitability, this new minivan has an even larger interior space.
To all must be added a refined mechanics, which increases the comfort of driving and allow to save fuel.
Evolution versus revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz features a line very similar to that of the previous model, the changes in this minivan are numerous.
Among others, it is worth mentioning an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before going on to analyze the new model, it is useful to note that this new Jazz arrives six years after entering the market of the first generation.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in shorter times than those used by other manufacturers.
Although the Jazz model is less well-known in Europe than in other markets, it remains a unique sales phenomenon.
This is exactly the case with Japan, where Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
In Japan, almost a million Jazz units have been sold since the launch.
The second market was that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
Despite these numbers, Honda believes that the new Jazz will allow to increase sales in the segment.
Thus, if in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of this model, for 2009 estimates are around 100,000 cars, assuming a 17% sales increase in the European market.
As regards the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, which correspond to 6.7% of Honda's total sales to Spain.
As for the new generation, managers for the Spanish branch expect to sell around 2,000 Jazz units over a year.
Just the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda . to reduce the fall in sales in Spain.
Indeed, the company's managers plan to reach the end of the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, or 4,000 less than in 2007, with a 16% drop.
Despite the increase in sales Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared with 1.6% last year.
In addition, the Japanese company expects to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this, Honda trusts in the arrival of another new model.
It is Insight, a five-door hybrid and compact format - 4.37 meters long - of which the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200,000 units a year worldwide.
For markets and estimates made by the Japanese producer, 50% of Insight's sales will take place in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is planned for the first months of the year, immediately after the company presentation in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has grown in all its parts.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimetres more), the width the 1.69 meters (two centimetres more) and the distance to the 2.50 meters, with an increase of five centimetres.
The height, however, remained unchanged at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in size, the habitable interior is also enlarged.
This advantage derives on the one hand from the insertion of a new platform, and on the other from the introduction of the fuel tank in the central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz model.
In addition, the capacity of the boot – with a double background – rises to 399 litres, that is, 19 litres more the capacity of the first generation.
It should be noted that these are the measurements of engine version 1.4, and that the boot capacity of Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements, such as the rear leds or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - concern an improvement in accessibility to the rear seats.
The doors that allow access to the rear positions, open at an angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
In addition, the engines in this second generation of jazz are also new.
At the time of marketing, this small model will be proposed in models with 1.2 and 1.4 litres petrol engines.
Both mechanics include the i-VTEC technology that allows you to lower consumption, produce less carbon dioxide emissions, optimize the mechanics and at the same time keeps the engine torque high in all its stages.
The 1.2-litre model allows a power of 90 hp at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
The propulsion – which in the previous Jazz reached 78 horses – uses 5.3 litres of fuel and produces CO2 emissions of about 125 grams.
Compared to the previous propulsion, which in the first generation model used 83 horses, 100 horses are now available.
Jazz 1.4 at 100 horses reaches a combination of 5.4 litres of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 emitted.
The "bee car" to avoid collisions
As part of the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan was inspired, this time, by nature, and in particular by bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, for example, takes the flight of bees, knows how to avoid accidents.
It is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, or the first step towards collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Nissan Motor Co. Advanced Technical Centre developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Scientific and Technological Research of the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Development of Brand Management, the BR23C is an extension of the Security Shield of four areas produced by Nissan.
This robot is intended to improve the ability to prevent collisions in the manufacturer's vehicles.
During the flight, each bee creates its own personal oval-shaped space which is very similar to Nissan's security shield.
But the most important thing are the compound eyes of bees, able to see in all directions at an angle greater than 300 degrees, and that allow the insect to fly without interruption in its personal space.
To recreate this visual functionality, engineers have developed what they have called a localization laser (Laser Range Finder).
This mechanism identifies the obstacles in front of the BR23C for a radius within two meters and with a maximum amplitude of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to a microprocessor on board that immediately, allows to prevent collision.
"When the little robot detects an obstacle, it imitates the movements of a bee and immediately changes direction by turning on the wheels at right angles or greater to avoid collision.
The most obvious difference with any assisted system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
"If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot deviate upwards or downwards, nor even diagonally; it can move only in two dimensions and in the direction in which its wheels can turn and not by exploiting endless directions and ways like bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid collisions.
"This device just needs to process the information every few seconds, and act from this data.
It does not require the storage of information or the intuitive logic of previe maneuvers, so it can work without interruption and with only a couple dozen KB of memory.
This may surprise, but we are not talking about gigabytes of memory, nor even mega."
It is the first step towards the development of new technologies for the instantaneous prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan hopes will be standard in cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than the type with lithium ions.
Another potential future application of this technology could be the integration of units with a GPS satellite navigation system to bring the driver to destination avoiding obstacles in the route.
Tremble before asking for a loan
We must recognize that the United States Treasury Department, as well as owning a lot of capital to intervene, is certainly not without ingenuity.
Faced with the crisis and to prevent Americans from engaging with junk mortgages in banks with dubious insolvency, they have created a fun and instructive game for network users: "Bad Credit Hotel".
In other words, the "bad credit hotel"...or problems.
The gloomy appearance of this accommodation and, in particular, of its receptionist serves to induce one to think not once, but two or even three times before asking for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it, which is probably the primary target.
Certainly the information the game provides is useful, but it is not detailed.
It is more a page for teenagers than a site for the vast audience.
What happens if you complete the game?
Well, there's a sleeping room inside the hotel.
It's still something, because to buy a better house not if he even talks...
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced the signing of an agreement with the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, which will invest nine billion dollars in a 21% stake in the Company, news received following a net decrease in its stock on the Stock Exchange.
A week after the drafting of a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that the MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's stock at the individual cost of $25.25, or a sum equal to $3 billion.
The price established is 19% lower than the book value of the securities at 31 August.
The MUFG will also invest six billion dollars in the purchase of convertible securities at a conversion price of 31.25 dollars, ensuring a return of 10%.
The Morgan Stanley has specified that the total operation would be carried out on the base of an average price of 29 dollars per title, that is a percentage inferior to its current course of 28%.
At around 5 p.m., however, the Morgan Stanley title dropped by 6.79% to $23.07.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition into bank holding company," explained John Mack, general manager of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow her to differentiate her actions by making her pass under the control of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with MUFG also confirms how the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's biggest names to adopt a much more prudent attitude than the one previously assumed.
The modalities defined Monday also show that in the last days the agreement has been modified: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced the sale of 20% of its shares to the Japanese giant for an amount of $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno , executive director of the MUFG, explained: "we thought that our stake would be exclusively made up of ordinary shares.
But considering the current situation of the world economy and the market, we have chosen to minimise risks and protect ourselves."
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will obtain Morgan Stanley securities at a price below their accounting value of 7%.
And the transaction would result in an investment of at least 20% of the equity on a diluted basis".
The agreement provides that the MUFG will be able to convert in one year half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares if, during a given period, the latter are traded more than 50% below the conversion price fixed, or approximately 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the capital provided by the MUFG would enable it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokesperson for the group, however, refused to give details of the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should therefore set a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan stated that it had "clearly" lightened its budget from the end of August.
The last few weeks have put the group to the test, which has seen the value of its shares halved while the cost of risk insurance has surged.
However, Monday's cost remained high, at around 12%.
Last week Goldman Sachs, the only "survival" among Wall Street's large investment banks after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the takeover of Merrill Lynch, announced that it had collected $15 billion, partly at Berkshire Hathaway, a group from Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa à Quito, let's go.
Founding the republic on socialism in the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
On Sunday, following the example of colleagues and friends, it was the latter who gave voice to the draft new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since, according to official results, 64% of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, on an 80% basis of votes.
According to these results, "no" was 28%, while 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% blank cards.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it should obtain half of the votes, plus one.
On Sunday, two polls carried out at the exit of the polling stations and an estimate of a non-governmental organization had announced an overwhelming victory of the "yes", placing it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed in the night between Sunday and Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The "Constitution triumphed gloriously", had assured, congratulating Ecuadorians in the guayaquil governorate, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As always, Chávez and Morales congratulated Rafael Correa, as did his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The ballot, which took place calmly according to the election observation mission of the Organization of American States (OEA), was based on a text of 444 points to consolidate the "new socialism" defended by the president.
This draft Constitution devotes the state's power over the economy, reserving it the "planning of development" of a country that lives essentially from the oil extraction carried out by large foreign companies and consequently of their currency.
Conceived by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants more power to the head of state, who can be elected for two consecutive four-year terms, to have the opportunity to dissolve the assembly.
Correa has already announced its intention to exploit this amendment and re-apply its candidacy for a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also affirms the gratuitousness of health and education services, which the president began to promote in this country of 13,9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It also prohibits the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched an assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts seized ten days ago.
I'm in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions held captive in the desert for ten days were reported Monday afternoon, safe and sound, in the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, they had been freed in Chad by an Egyptian commando.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived at Almaza military base, near Cairo International Airport, around 3:30 p.m., aboard a special plane.
On board a helicopter, they were transferred immediately, without being able to release any interviews to the press, to the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, to be subjected to analysis.
They enjoy "good health" and no ransom was paid "to the kidnappers," said Egypt's Minister of Tourism, Zoheir Garanna, on the airstrip.
Kidnapped on September 19 during a safari in 4x4 at the foot of Mount Ouanat, bordering Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been tossed from one hiding place to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group consisted of 11 tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and 8 Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of Aegyptous, the safari organiser agency.
An Egyptian security officer said that 30 members of the special forces, aboard two helicopters, had launched the assault during the night, just before dawn.
"There were gunshots, half of the kidnappers were killed, while the others escaped," said the manager who requested to maintain anonymity.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "flash" unit were sent to Sudan, where they would support German and Italian commandos.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini stressed, from Belgrade, the importance of the role of Italian secret agents and special forces.
We must admit that if we achieved this result, it was thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of the men of our secret services, special forces," he said, without adding any further details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese patrol army had claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on board which the kidnappers were found and to have killed six, including the Chadian leader of the kidnappers, and to have captured two.
According to the army the kidnappers would be linked to a Darfur rebel organization, the Sudan Liberation Movement, (SLA_U), immediately denied by the latter.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
On the front page there is a debate on the financing of culture, on which the current election campaign is focused.
All the better.
But part of our cultural life always remains in the shadows.
Who will rule to denounce the miserable sums granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical places that are starving?
What politician would dare remind the federal government that he is neglecting monuments and property buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we do not have any real laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government is paying three and a half million euros for the only restoration of Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
With our American neighbours, it is the Constitution that affirms that heritage protection is part of national culture and that the same heritage must be protected by every citizen, every political authority and every government department, and all this by mutual agreement.
In Quebec, at the Federation of Historical Societies of Quebec, there are at least 40,000 volunteers who, grouped into 211 societies for the preservation of historical, genealogical, archives and property preserve, with little money, private archives and archaeological sites.
It is they who, often, defend our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when real estate entrepreneurs and decision-making bodies attack our forgotten remains and cemeteries with their bulldozers.
When will the right space be reserved for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalise part of Fortis bank
The Benelux states help the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which was first in difficulty in Europe for the crisis in the US credit market, by partial nationalisation: the three nations will provide EUR 11.2 billion to the financial institution - insurance with interest also in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands agreed at the highest level on the weekend, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Competition Commissioner.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the face of the difficulties facing the international financial market for more than a year is that of the bank Fortis, and from a certain point of view the decisions taken in this regard can be a precedent.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night all three states will hold almost half (49%) of the bank's share in the country.
The bank will almost certainly sell part of its interests, including first of all the assets, especially insurance, of the Dutch ABN Amro acquired a year ago.
Last week Fortis' actions began with a vertical collapse, serious signs of the institute's crisis then appeared in the second half of the week.
Analysts however agree that the bank, with 85,000 employees, is too large to allow it to go bankrupt.
The bank's shares fell almost 12% on Friday, the lowest point in 14 years.
Since January the value of the shares has decreased by more than two thirds.
Considering the current stock prices the entire capital value of the group is around 14 billion euros, but according to the bank's executives this value is not real.
The company summit imputes the collapse of Fortis shares to the uncertainties of the non-European market due to the acceptance of the US $700 billion plan.
On Monday the title slowly resumed to rise.
Friday Filip Dierckx was appointed new CEO of the bank.
The financial institution has also sought private buyers but so far no one has come forward with a worthy offer.
The Belgian Government had previously ensured that investors should not fear losing money.
There was no panic among the bank's customers, the branches were not attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis owns autonomous subsidiaries and has also acquired leasing firms.
The fox in the henhouse
In America, life and health insurers, based on people's medical purchase data, often refuse to enter into an insurance contract.
Privacy experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a privacy program according to which the use of prescription drug data depends in any case on the approval of the person concerned.
This program must be in independent hands, otherwise it is like entrusting the henhouse to the fox" — writes the Washington Post citing Richard Dick author of the program to follow prescriptions of medicines.
Insurance companies shall make the insurance fee and the amount due in the event of claims subject to the health status of the customer and if they consider the risk too high they shall not take out the insurance.
A while ago, the client had to undergo a medical examination and the contract was not concluded until after the test was completed.
Dick 10 years ago invented a much cheaper procedure: according to the client's identification code you can easily get information from pharmacies about what medicines you have purchased in the last year and a half and from this the program shows what diseases you suffer from and what health conditions you find yourself in.
For example, if you regularly buy large amounts of cholesterol reducers, this means that the level of fat in your blood is basically incurably high and is classified in the highest risk category.
On the market there are several versions of the program, some also determine the risk multiplier, so the insurer in addition to paper work does not remain much, even if there are small difficulties.
Among the cons, some medicines are usable for several purposes, e.g. some compounds can be used against headaches or hot flushes, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter, from an insurance-commercial point of view, is worth as a risk increase factor, the first two are not.
For the request and processing of data, separate companies were formed and these, before obtaining the necessary information from pharmacies, request the approval of the patient.
The authorities are now forcing them to do so even though they have not yet imposed negligence fines.
Some firms have recently also developed the results of laboratory tests and link them to the drug consumption data in order to provide a more precise picture of the patient's health status.
More and more companies have access to data and, in parallel, the control of the use will be more and more difficult.
There is a separate law on privacy but its validity extends only to health services and insurance.
In front of the Congress there is a bill that gives the supervisory authorities control powers to specialized companies in data service.
Richard Dick admits that it is not enough: for this reason he has developed a program that connects data forwarding with the approval expressed by the person concerned.
Another question is that the person concerned cannot deny approval because otherwise insurers do not enter into the contract.
So then in the end hens are entrusted to the clemency of the fox.
Global Marseilles Menu
European Union and India double trade
Since the European Union and India are partners that trade in particular with each other, the agenda of the ninth summit meeting has also been dominated by this issue, as well as all other global problems.
Today there will be a Franco-Indian summit which will deal primarily with cooperation on atomic energy.
The European Union recognises the fact that India is becoming a great democratic power which should be given more voice in international affairs, but the member countries have not yet been able to decide whether to support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
So there was no insistence on this issue in the ninth summit held yesterday in Marseilles.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as President-in-Office of the Union, José Manuel Barroso, Chairman of the Commission and Javier Solana, High Representative for Foreign Affairs, received the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed to double in five years, i.e. increase up to EUR 100 billion, trade.
Given that trade in goods rose from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not too ambitious.
As a result, they have legally unified the 26 bilateral civil flight agreements, so air traffic can also start in the future.
India would like to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the deal.
The objective is to balance because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only ninth among the EU's partners.
The summit paid attention to global matters.
To the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and terrorism, the latter condemned in all its forms by both sides, and called for the convening of a UN conference.
They urged the conclusion of the Doha Trade Round, although both sides played a role in the failure of this.
The EU has confirmed its continued energy and climate programme, i.e. it would like to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agrees on this, as well as on the need for a global pact at next year's climate conference and a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas production by 2050.
They also want to curb the rise in food prices and supported the call for an international meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister will today go to the French capital where at a bilateral meeting he is preparing to sign a treaty on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive a contract worth EUR 20 billion to build Indian nuclear reactors.
According to information from our news agency, the deal would last 15 years.
In Frankfurt over three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Book Fair in Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international event for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair awaits for this edition over 7,000 exhibitors from 101 different countries who will occupy the 171.790 square meters of the Fair with over 403,000 titles on display and with Turkey as a guest of honour.
The Undersecretary of the Ministry for Cultural Heritage and Activities Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian Government at the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Pavilion: Italy will be present institutionally with a Punto Italia - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
The meeting with the press will follow at Room Struktur in Hall 5.0 of Buchmesse: this will be the occasion to present figures, trends and perspectives on the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of foreign author books gradually decreases on the total of Italian production, and in particular on the one for adults and children.
Found Steve Fossett's plane the billionaire who disappeared a year ago
The wreck of Steve Fossett's plane, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, was found.
The wreckage was found on a plateau at 3000 meters of altitude, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammoth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the aircraft, however, there were no human remains.
The sheriff of Madeira County, John Anderson, has dispelled the remaining doubts: "The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that this is exactly what Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff then specified that no human remains were found either in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was given for dead in February.
The U.S. Office for Transport Safety (Ntsb) indicated that a few hours after the wreck was seen, a team of investigators was sent, who then identified the device: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, missing from September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, again in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett's personal effects had been found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
It is two documents under Fossett's name, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a sweatshirt.
Fossett's research had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of primates.
By 2002, on the sixth attempt, he had become the first man to complete the world tour on an aerodynamic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later he had traveled the world by plane and without a stop.
Among his many records, also that of having flown at 15,445 meters in height, above the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the publicity you don't expect
A SUV out of the box with an original design and well defined by strong lines, wide surfaces and sharp corners.
This is, in short, Glk the last born among the "compact" offroads of the house of the star with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to give a breath of novelty in this sector.
For its contents outside the traditional canons, the communication that will accompany the launch of the Glk Suv, available at the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from 17 October, will also be unexpected and unconventional.
Thus the advertising battle that will accompany the debut of the new car will start an unprecedented mode of communication also through a futuristic 3D poster campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project of maxi-affissions, divided into three different phases, that will dominate the central Milan shopping street, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision and thanks to special glasses distributed near Corso Como it will be possible to see the new SUV in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, looking at the image you will get the impression that the car comes out of the manifesto.
Subsequently, through the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, and then recomposed into a single image.
Undoubtedly Mercedes with this advertising is trying to introduce something new into the stereotyped field of automotive communication.
Will you be able to stimulate the interest of future buyers with this formula?
That's who the Italian hooligans are.
From Triveneto, they risk Daspo.
But who are those 150-200 boys and girls of which all of Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been following the Blue National team for years and that so far, for the truth, had never created excessive problems.
Nor had he ever clashed with the opposing fans.
The extraction of the group is right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
These were added to Sofia (a few units, in fact) from Campania and Puglia.
They have tricolor flags where the city of origin of the militants appear: Saturday evening they were removed for not being identified.
They are inspired by the English typhosia.
In Bulgaria, they found a real Nazi typhoserie, Levski's.
Figc had made 144 tickets for the game available to Italian fans: all names, therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminal had in fact controlled them all: among those who left for Sofia there was no one with a Daspo in progress, no one who had been inhibited by attending a stadium.
Four blue fans, who had a history of stadium offenses, had been refused the ticket and prevented the away.
Now the Viminal waits to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police then he will take measures: in this case, it is possible to give Daspo for five years at least to the fans who have been arrested or to those who have been identified in the riots.
An international Daspo that prevents you from attending not only the Italian stadiums but all over Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, will no longer set foot in a stadium.
Lucky for you.
But now there is fear-emulation: that to those little more than one hundred and fifty, others are added.
"We must put out this fire immediately and not legitimize those who behave in this way," they say from the Viminal.
So, "eyes well open especially in view of Wednesday's national team match in Lecce".
In Puglia, in fact, there is a small nucleus of supporters of Ultras Italia.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, Tuesday the Casms which can also count on a section of the Aise, that is, the secret services, which deals precisely with the problems of stadium.
"The Duce-Duce choirs and the arm stretched out during Mameli's anthem? In Bulgaria it is not a crime...".
This is the thought (expressed in a very unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, for a few weeks director of the Observatory of Viminale (he took the place that was first of Francesco Tagliente and then of Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had previously been commissioner of Trieste where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to sing to the Duce but certainly the behavior of those 150-200 fans was shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - adds No.1 of the Observatory - crimes must be attributed in the country in which the event takes place.
Until now, this group had remained in line, and we will now see what has happened and evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about the whistles at Mameli's anthem: even those are not felony, but if you allow me they are not education...".
