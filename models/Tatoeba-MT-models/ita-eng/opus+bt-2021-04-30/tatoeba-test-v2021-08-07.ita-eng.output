White pawn at f3, black pawn at e6, white pawn at g4, black woman at h4 - checkmate! This is jokingly referred to in chess circles as "mad fool".
White: Tower in a1, pedestrian in b6, king in c8. Black: pedestrians in a7 and b7, king in a8, bishop in b8. White puts the opponent in the zugzwang playing the tower in a6, then Black has only two options: take the tower in a6 or move its bishop in any other check on diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, White advances its pedestrian from b6 to b7 and gives checkmate. In the second situation, the white tower takes the black pawn in a7, with the same result.
