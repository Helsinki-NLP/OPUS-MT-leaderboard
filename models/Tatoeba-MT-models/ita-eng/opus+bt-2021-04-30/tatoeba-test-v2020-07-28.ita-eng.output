I don't drink alcohol.
Looks like there's no way out.
We fell asleep.
I was very annoyed by him.
Why should we help you?
I put the plan into practice.
He made a list.
For a while, I was really addicted to Coca-Cola, and I drank it every day.
I think Tom's circling around.
Africa is exporting beef to Europe.
Did you tell Tom why you want to go to Boston?
Tom and Mary are gone now.
The more the merrier.
She helped us.
She asked her teacher for advice.
It scared him of the devil.
What are these things?
I need it.

She wants to buy her boyfriend a present.
I went to the beach with Tom and his friends.
Good luck with the exam!

I don't usually close my eyes at night.
I want to stay home and read a book.
I want Tom to like you.
We don't want him to leave.
I'll be very busy next month.

What are they doing here?
I tried to call him.
Do you travel often?
My car is German.
I'm so glad Christmas is here.
I just need to get some rest.
She said she wasn't convinced.
I'm totally satisfied with my new home.
Why do you study English every day?
I'd like to cross the United States of America with a convertible.
You won't find them there.
Your explanation is too abstract for me.
These monks live inside the monastery.
I just have to find him.
Can I see this?
He's able to speak in Japanese.
I might be wrong.
You're afraid to sleep, aren't you?
Tom will find a job soon enough.
Correct the highlighted words.
Did you tell him you were kidding?
Keep looking.
When the results are made public, I'll let you know.
I wanted to go back to your village.
Tom is satisfied with his success.
You're reliable.
I didn't even consider it.
It's more worth having friends in the square than money in the crate.
You can only smoke on the terrace.
I agree 100%.
These flowers as well as being beautiful also smell good.
He's in college now, isn't he?
We should call him.
It's interesting how it happened.
You should remember that.
Tom said he likes to teach French.
He pulled a coin out of his pocket.
Are you related to her?
Who broke this window?
I'll go tell them.
If you heard him speak French, you'd trade him for a Frenchman.
He came ten minutes later.
We waited for him yesterday.
Tom said Mary was short.
Where's the exit?
If I remember correctly, Tom sold his car to Mary for just $500.
I'll call you after lunch.
We didn't agree on anything!
It's very unlikely.
No doctor can explain that.
I have to try it.
You're depressed.
You're wasting my time.
Aren't you Mary's husband?
It was all your imagination.
I'm not going to vote!
Why can't you do that?
Tom didn't save anything for retirement.
Tom never yells at us.
Lalita called.
I thought you hated us.

It'll stay our secret.
It'll happen soon.
I saw my sister there.
Why don't you try and fix it?
We've made far too many mistakes.
I hope to see you tomorrow.
What does this have to do with my family?
Leave him at home if he wants!
I lived here for ten years.
I'd be happy to give you a ride.
He tried to get up early.
I like blue.
They have many different fish to try.
What is the difference between real diamonds and imitations?
Could you call me later?
I would like two copies of each of these documents.
I expect I'll have to do it for Tom.
What do you think of the new teacher?
If actions are stronger than words, why is the pen more powerful than the sword?
She bought a tea service.
We're all gonna die.
Tom kept crying.
I can't do that yet.
George was out of his mind with anger!
You misled me.
Are you willing to learn?
Poor people are also people with feelings.
I'm sure Tom's just trying to help.
You smell so good.
I forgot everything about them.
He doesn't use it.
I'm messy.
I know a good Italian restaurant.
We can't let him die.
For all I know, Tom's retired.
What time does he leave here?
I usually drink a lot of milk.
With a smile, anything is possible.
I like black and strong coffee.
He says no one cares about something like that.
Tom works for a bank.
I had three options.
Tom and Mary won't be happy to see you here.
These goats are very friendly.
The two sisters resemble each other so much that it is difficult to distinguish them.
Why don't koalas have a navel?
Please leave a message.
When was the last time you connected to the Internet?
I played with Tony yesterday.
We can't let that happen.

How do you say "I love you" in your language?
Start.
You look really pale.
Tom forgot the milk.
That song sounds familiar.
Do you have any chalk?
I'm bringing Tom some food.
I'd like to see some dance.
I don't want to eat right now.
Wouldn't you like to eat?
Everyone knows you're rich.
I study at school.
What would Jesus do?
He says he hates studying Berber.
We must be warmly welcomed and supported.

I like his novel.
Who wrote the Bible?
You'll be ready.
We don't drink.
I came back from school, then I went out with my friends.
I got to the station this morning.
Does that make me look fat?
It's all getting cheap.
He's not our son.
You have osteoporosis.
You can tell her that's what I said.
I thought you might want to get divorced.
Look at the beautiful moon!

Now give me your hands.
I screamed.
Mary also likes bananas.
I'm a casanova.
I want to meet them.
Tom's on his way to the mall.
Tom wants a big family.
Did you like it?
I should have stayed with her.
We'll be friends forever.
I never stole anything.
Tom tried to ignore Mary.
I got home late last night.
We ran out of gas in the middle of the desert.
Don't worry, I'll get home safely.
Ask Tom if he'll attend the meeting.
I can't run a company, it's too hard for me.
Are you learning French?
Is that your son?
Tom never asked why.
He was often up late.
I don't eat bananas often.
Get them out of here.
I've never seen them wear hats.
Do you know Tom?
He had a book in his hand.
Give me an ashtray, please.
Who found her?
What exactly did he say?
You have to go to the hospital.

I'm sorry I dragged you into this.
Tom did it for his family.
I prefer summer to winter.

I hate to say it, but Tom's right.
I already gave him your number.
Show me another watch.
Do you want to stop them?
You should have seen them run.
He and I were in the same camp back then.
Tom doesn't know how much you love him, Mary.
I think I'm objective.
Tom hasn't heated his car yet.
I'll be happy to help you.
How long will he stay?
This is intolerable.
I appreciate you inviting me to the party.

That caused the accident?
Have you ever been to a foreign country?
I think I've had too much to drink.
I texted him to ask why.
He doesn't have much time.
Skip the boring chapters.

I still have friends in Boston.
Were you jealous of them?
I'm sure Tom isn't Canadian.
I want to be safe.
It starts tomorrow.
Can you speak Esperanto?
I'll see her again next Friday.

We have to wait here.
I'm Chinese.
Tom wasn't very active.
We cleaned the road from the snow yesterday.
I'm really not busy right now.
Tom doesn't think he's gonna win.
Maybe you should listen.
He's a brilliant artist.
Hurry up, guys.
I like your painting.
I waited an hour and a half.
I'm not good at math.
Tom refused to say what he did.
I don't like his hat.
I can't be happy when Tom's so sad.
I want to share this with you.
I study at Hyogo University.
We're going to participate in the marathon.
Maybe you should tell her.
I know what to study.
His life went smoothly.
Nobody wants to help us.
They talk very fast.
Tom was lucky at first.
It's urgent to go to the bathroom.
Mary really looks like her mother.
He didn't have any money to buy the farm.
How often do you go to the movies?
Are you religious?
Did he talk to you?
Are there many sharks around here?
Tomorrow, God willing, we'll be with your parents.
He's from Sweden.
He didn't have any money to buy the farm.
Did you really believe that?
Tom decided to sell his car.
I don't like fish with bones.
I feel protected.
You're the tallest.
Isn't this funny, Tom?
Tom was born on October 20.
It's a nice picture.
I'll leave her alone.
Tom won't even look at me.
We humiliated them.
He's already here.
I know who my enemy is.
Tom needs to sleep now.
Tom's not honest.
Tom's father is a cop.
Tom works here?
That's what Tom was looking for.
What did you do to her?
Tom wanted to send a message.
I wasn't happy to see them.
Don't break my heart.
I have no plans for tonight.
Stop being sarcastic all the time!
She was crying.
I wish I could be as rich as you.
We had fun.
It's dishonest.
I often read books.
Tom and I want to talk to you about something.
I can meet you at 2:30.
Tom got upset.
I'm old already.
I have a criminal record.
Good night, my friends.
He bought a book in English in a bookstore.
I'll go to the bookstore tomorrow and buy some books.
What would the world be without women?
They tell us funny stories.
Can you hear what Tom's saying?
What's your favorite historical movie?
We can't see her.
Tom and I still love each other.
Tom needs to eat.
Everybody get out of here.
Giant pandas live only in China.
I'm being followed.
Don't say anything like that.
From bad to worse!
Jim is Canadian.
You did well here.
Where did all the others go?
I'm relaxed.
The cattle were grazing in the field.
He has meddled in his private life.
Can I borrow your knife?
I'm late for a date.
Tom's still away.
I ate all the apple.
Roast the bhakri while the pot is heated.
Is the park open today?
We only make Uyghur food.
We're leaving Boston in the morning.
We can't leave you there.
Tom played soccer.
Stop stuttering.
I know her.
We're the real heroes.
We're waiting for Tom.
Unfortunately, my birthday is only once a year.
Put your bike away.
I meant it as a compliment.
They called President Roosevelt pirate.
I could go to the movies.
It's not a date.
It makes me nervous.
Who do you think told them?
Why did Tom give it to Mary?
Listen to her!
He's good at this game, isn't he?
Take care of them.
I live in Fiji Islands.
You want to eat with us?
You don't seem too surprised.
I don't go to school on Saturdays.
It's my job to protect you.
Tom's treacherous, isn't he?
Is this cage intended to protect from sharks?
Tom wants to get to know Mary better.
I'm very disappointed.
Tom wants more coffee.
Who do you think is the author of this novel?
I wish you'd called me.
Don't you want a job?
I used to play trombone when I was younger.
I'm loyal.
Can you write Braille?
I don't know what happened to him.
I'm free today.
Why do you want to kill us?
He ate an apple.
I caught him.
He adopted the orphan.
I guess they speak French.
Step forward.
You need to get more active.
Tom and Mary are joking?
Smoke broke.
I have no choice.
I think Tom knows who lives in that house.
He's smarter than him.
What are you going to do this summer?
He became irritated.
Can you speak shanghainese?
He narrowed down because I washed him.
Tom was wearing an old pair of shoes.
Tom wondered what happened to Mary.
Something bad happened to them.
How much was paid?
They didn't touch anything.
Do you like horror movies?
I know a lot about animals.
Don't hold your breath.
Am I in London?
You're still there with her, aren't you?
This will make a big difference.
Tom didn't have much money on him.
Tom doesn't have a big appetite.
Were you with them that night?
I was running.
The village had died after sundown.
What's your favorite female rapper?
Say hi to Tom for me.
It's good to see you so happy.
I usually swim in the summer.
Why are you leaving early?
I'm pretty proud of it.
I smell gas.
I'll tell them it's not true.
Here's a picture of you.
I can depend on my friends.
The experiment confirmed his theory.
Tom's lucky.
Give me the ketchup, please.
It happened that I sat next to her at a conference.
There's no furniture left in the room.
Tom showed up early for class.
He's a little overweight, isn't he?
Who's the man who's playing the piano?
I decided not to do it again.
No, I haven't written it yet.
You need to listen to Tom.
He slept in the car.
Tom and I are going to Boston with Mary.
He spent all his income drinking.
Search harder on Google!
It's not the only problem with your idea.
You talk like you're the boss.
You want me to go with you?
I came to see you.
Does he look familiar?
I'll check your game tomorrow.
So, what am I supposed to tell him?
It's starting to rain.
Do you play any instruments?
Will they die?
I really like it.
Are you guys coming in?
Tom stabbed her.
I don't have feelings.
She's incredibly stupid.
We landed on a lonely island.
It takes patience.
He convinced the teacher.
When's your new novel coming out?
I would never betray her.
Are you aware of any problems?
The mystery remains unsolved.
I will never forget Germany.
Why didn't you call a doctor?
You're good.
How would you like to change it?
It's snowing today.
He made a promise to write to me every week.
I wasn't born deaf.
We should leave you alone.
I can't raise our son alone.
Go get some milk.
Tom seemed surprised.
I love being right.
Tom married a rich girl from Boston.
I forgot whether he drinks wine or not.
Who warned them?
Have faith in God.
"I will give 50,000 for this statue. "Who will offer more?"
Why would anyone want to kiss her?
He should have bought a used car.
I'm going to stay at the hotel.
I didn't grow up like that.
You can park here.
Please tell him to hurry.
Tom hated them.
I shave almost every day.
I won't apologize.
We really like picnics.
I haven't talked to him yet.
It was a hot summer night.
I always walk.
It's decisive.
You're not much fun at parties, are you?
He searched his bag for the keys to the car.
I don't really want to talk.
So he must be Argentine.
I really like my job.
I'd suggest you be more careful.
She's shaken.
He should have done it yesterday.
I'm a big fan of American cuisine.
Tom's dancing with Mary.
Your destiny is in my hands.
No, you don't have to go now.
No one wants to help you.
He'll clear up in the afternoon.
He became blind.
We subscribe to a newspaper.
I thought it was a combination.
What do you imagine when you look at that painting?
How many continents in the world are there?
He's good at singing, isn't he?
Tom's mad at Mary, isn't he?
Your idea is superior to yours.
Tom never forgave me.
I'm the expert.
Tom has a secret.
We're losing blood.
Chaucer and Boccaccio are two writers. The first is English, the second is Italian.
Tom's getting emotional.
I was just scared.
Tomorrow's a party.
I had too much beer yesterday.
I'd like to teach you Chinese in exchange for another language.
I'm still busy.
I appreciate your insights.
I went to the park this morning.
Tom loves fly fishing.
We have no choice but to risk it.
I don't want to play chess.
Mary's jealous.
I should have changed the oil.
Do you have a calculator?
I asked him to stay.
If you really want to know, all you have to do is ask.
We need to inform Tom.
Tom's still asleep.
Tom's a little impulsive, isn't he?
You agree with Tom, right?
Tom didn't take much money.
Tom calculated his expenses.
It's not my idea of fun, but whatever you want.
Could you ask Tom to stop after work?
He plays the drum.
It must be hot.
Which online dictionary do you use most?
You lit the candles.
We lived in Osaka for ten years before coming to Tokyo.
No one can solve this problem.
German cars are among the best.
Call them.
That's cool.
Tom doesn't respect Maria's opinion.
She'll land the camp.
He came to listen to jazz.
Do you really think Tom is handsome?
I can't give Mary everything she wants.
When does school end?
Tom and I are pretty busy.
He hired me.
I said I'd get him.
I knew they were watching me.
I have plans with them tonight.
I might know someone who can help you.
Do you know how to ride a bike?
These shoes are too small for me to wear.
I see a model.
She brought me a cup of sugar-free tea.
It was published in 1969.
We just need to relax.
He speaks Chinese.
Tom told me he wants to go to Boston.
London is smaller than Tokyo.
I'm three years older than you.
Look, I'll show you.
I said he was innocent.
Fear of failure is one of the most widespread fears in the world.
Why are you so jealous?
You think Tom killed Mary?
How come you have nothing to say?
Scandalosis!
Come on, Tom, aren't you curious?
Keep your tongue at bay.
I drank wine.
He's more popular than me.
When can I get out of here?
You're early again.
We left this.
All I want is to go fishing.
Would you like to take this?
Tom didn't want to go back to the orphanage.
Gold is heavier than iron.
I'll find one later.
At least I'm older than you.
Tom didn't want to spend any more time with Mary.
Tom says he kissed Mary.
You can choose what you want.
I'm at the hospital, and I was struck by lightning.
Did you call them?
Turn off the radio.
Why did you decide to become a professor?
It was a very scary story.
He's in the van.
I don't introduce them.
Do you like golf?
Forgive me for interrupting the other day.
Can you believe it?
I waited for a bus to arrive.
He found the bug.
You'll never guess where I am.
I didn't have a good time.
You students are required to be diligent.
I won't be able to help them.
It's a scandalous idea!
The sun disappeared behind a cloud.
You're interested in politics.
Many people go to church on Christmas Eve.
Thank you, my daughter.
I don't know how to drive very well.
I heard Tom's learning how to drive.
She knows I love her deeply.
He's trying to kill himself.
I don't need your help anymore.
The problem is, we don't know where Tom is.
It's under the bed, isn't it?
I shot down the branch with an axe.
The miniskirts are back in fashion.
There are some books on the table.
Come at least at six.
I have a lot of work to finish by the weekend.
He forgot his name.
Are you Mary?
After dinner I walk on the beach.
Why didn't he go with him?
It's two years older than him.
French is difficult.
I'm sure she's very busy.
My name is Ahmad.
Wrong number.
Age is not a result, and youth is not a sin.
I've known him for over ten years.
We are grateful for the music he left us.
It's not like the idea of putting an ammonia appliance in my house attracts me very much.
Judy is a very smart student.
We knew the dog would run after the cat.
I'm a cop.
You kissed her, didn't you?
Why don't I just buy her a hat?
I thought Tom would show up.
She's pale at bad news.
This car doesn't belong to me.
Are you listening, Tom?
He often shows his anger.
Tom's my dad.
We don't have to leave yet.
Do you like the mountain?
My daughter likes to play with dolls.
Come aboard.
You're charming.
Do people drink tea in your country?
I don't want to waste any more time.
We lost sight of him.
The hostages will be released before Christmas.
Go wake them up.
Which tooth hurts?
You have to read between the lines.
Tom was proud.
Tom was a little baffled by Mary's request.
I'm here to help him.
It is not easy to speak English well.
I don't believe a word you say.
Get off me!
Only Naoko drinks coffee.
Sami needed to use the bathroom.
He changed his name.
You're vulgar.
Tom's getting better.
We can help them.
They called us.
I think Tom should be hungry.
The country is rich in natural resources.
It was a tough start for Mary.
Tom won't be back today.
You again!
Why do these things always happen to me?
The birds are catching the ground.
The park is closed on Monday.
You didn't even update the firmware?
I have a job for you.
This is just a game.
Can we do that now?
All my friends like them.
I like my tongue.
Why won't you answer me?
We're Tom's classmates.
There's nothing better to do.
Tom started writing.
That's what I'm looking for.
He's practicing.
Are you coming in?
Which way should I start?
Have you studied Darwin's theory of evolution?
His horse had a heart attack.
It is worth visiting the ruins.
He should be ready for the worst.
Tom pulled the suitcases out of the trunk.
That reminds me of someone.
I'm so hungry.
Tom lost his new watch.
Tom sang with Mary.
Is that what you told Tom?
Do you remember your license plate number?
He told us a lie.
She has seven children.
Let's listen to music.
I think it's dangerous for kids to play in the pond.
You bought me a nice coat.
The bell rang.
Take it to the men in room 318.
I'm falling in love with her.
We must postpone our departure.
Tom doesn't even care.
We were separated.
It's really early.
You saved Tom's life twice.
I don't like big cities.
This happened to me.
He's got a lot of friends in America.
I didn't live in Boston last year.
You read this book tonight?
Does Tom have a car?
I'll be fine. Don't worry.
Tom rarely laughs.
I can't forget her smile.
I disobeyed him.
Do you know Canadians living in Australia?
Tom's proud, isn't he?
I'm perfectly happy here.
Do you like it?
What exactly do you want me to do, Tom?
Listen, we need to talk.
Tom didn't like it very much.
Could you do the dishes, please?
Lunch was great.
She turned the computer off.
Torture is against the law.
I remembered.
It's not impossible.
What do you want me to do?
She was supposed to share a bedroom with her sister.
I heard the door closing.
He got him drunk.
How are you feeling today?
Would you be interested in working for me?
It reminds me of my childhood.
Mary and Alice were like sisters.
Tom arrived in Boston last night.
You're stubborn.
I don't feel nervous.
She's got a nice dog.
What do you really want to do?
Tom didn't even read Mary's letter.
They were perfect.
What are you going to do this summer?
You're going to my house.
But the fox with its leap has reached the quiet Fido.
Tom is engaged to my older sister.
My father always gets involved in my personal life.
Everyone wants something different.
Tom refused to execute the order.
I know you don't like them.
I didn't know about his plan.
Why don't you go back to Boston?
I don't want to be away from home.
What do you say we go out for a walk after dinner?
Fight like a man!
Tom and Mary sing?
Tom and Mary okay?
Contracting is common in the markets.
They shot him.
We're sorry for the inconvenience.
Tom was looking for his pen.
I don't want him to see this.
How many kidneys does a human have?
Saved money is earned money.
We're not cold.
We need to talk to him.
I know his name.
It went red.
Don't bother them.
We were good.
She started acting weird.
You should ask Tom to help.
Who sent the flowers?
Do I owe you money?
Would you like me to go?
You left this, didn't you?
Tell us something.
You're random.
Please turn the music down.
I trained Tom for the job.
He watched him swim.
Who broke the vase?
You'd better go with him.
The Queen visited the museum.
Tom didn't go, and neither did I.
Would you like to leave a message?
The children played together.
Say it again, please.
You're bothering her.
Sami's not here to ruin your day.
I took off my shoes.
I'm learning Esperanto now.
He hired mercenaries to kill Sami.
Are those yours?
The woman drinks water now.
Tom was a lawyer.
People here are demanding about what they eat, so even if a restaurant is inexpensive, it will soon close its doors if the food does not taste good.
The man Tom and Mary are talking to is a lawyer.
He changed his diet.
He's a man of his word.
I'm free tonight.
Do you think I'm too tall?
What are we supposed to do now?
Tom tried a new technique.
Were you blindfolded?
Are you interested?
Tom cut his wrists.
You seem relieved.
You should have kissed Tom.
I know I'm wrong.
I'm looking for my keys.
Will you join our club?
Don't fire Tom.
He doesn't listen.
I bought it at a garage store.
Why don't you do it yourself?
He's finally here!
Tom thinks they'll all be here by noon.
Why don't you work with me anymore?
It doesn't mean anything.
You're lying.
She helped him.
Everyone was talking about it.
Are you telling me you're not busy?
He hates clubs.
Go home.
Tom told me Mary was busy.
Where's my money?
No one saw them do it.
Tom hasn't read any of these books.
You're still inexperienced.
I have to go to work now.
You've come too soon.
He's capable of speaking ten languages.
Come home before dark.
I got off the train at the wrong station.
I hated French in high school.
Shouldn't you be home with your mother?
He's got blue eyes and blond hair.
I don't understand.
Tell him who you are.
My name sounds weird.
I'll never forget that night.
Be cheerful! Add an exclamation point to all your phrases!
Can you see anything in there?
You're ready.
Why would I talk to them?
I won't forget.
I don't want to forget her.
I can't open it!
Tell Tom I'm innocent.
I bought myself a pair of shoes.
I started working here in 2013.
They're traitors.
I'll stay.
I'm not always busy.
I'll assist you.
I got up before dawn.
I'll be right behind you.
How long did you live in Kobe?
We're getting close.
Tom always says the same thing.
Did you talk to Tom?
Try to get some rest.
Do you have a Facebook account?
He asked how to cook fish.
No one will believe his story.
Tom's a golden boy.
You seem to be biased against ideas coming from foreign countries.
I bought that book for him.
I didn't mean to hit Tom so hard.
She makes me throw up.
I want a doctor.
What does the cat want?
You'll meet her tomorrow.
You're three years younger than Tom.
Complete the sentence.
The clock's broken.
I won't wait forever.
Just give the order.
Do you know Canadians living in Australia?
This book is much more interesting than that.
We were obliged to obey the rule.
I hope Tom's not angry.
The rock was moved with dynamite.
Mary made breakfast.
Where did you meet my father?
Who was Mona Lisa?
He said he had to go.
You can keep them.
This smell is unbearable.
She became famous.
What are you pointing at?
I became friends with him while I was in Taiwan.
He was intimidated by his intelligence.
She's got the balloon.
We have to go.
Staying home isn't funny.
I'm sure Tom will be awake.
She can't find her hat.
Mr. Young would like your son to study more.
I opened an account at a bank nearby.
I didn't like that one.
Can you be sure?
I was glad to see you.
You don't have to worry.
We'll be close.
I'm really worried about them.
He clearly wants to go.
I knew Tom would do something romantic.
How much paper do you need?
Can you confirm that?
It was a waste of money.
Tom's talking to Mary on the phone.
Bring some wine.
I was very proud.
You're very fast.
How about a beer?
I had no idea you guys were so stupid.
They're not alive.
I'm hiding in Japan.
You're a brave man.
Aren't you surprised?
It only costs one coin.
I hope Tom and Mary are wrong.
My spoon is too big!
Give them a moment.
Let's eat together tonight.
I don't expect you to remember.
Put the picture on.
You're my three best friends.
Have you tried talking to him?
Where did you have lunch?
He's the last person who can tell a lie.
June isn't that far either.
Why does he hate Tom so much?
You know who said that?
I'm going to bed early tonight.
He kicked me out of the house.
My shoes got wet.
The key was left in the room.
Are you going to leave me?
Tom always liked you.
Why do you care?
Give him a hand, okay?
You wanted to ask me some questions?
Don't make fun of Tom.
You'll land on your feet.
I took risks.
Two people were killed in a car accident.
You know Tom, right?
It wasn't my idea to hire them.
Last night my grandmother missed without suffering.
I know the reason you're mad at them.
You know Tom likes cars.
She passed the exam.
Tom imitated Mary.
I can easily read Spanish.
Should I use ink?
Don't fall out of the chair.
Tom sent us Christmas gifts.
Can't Tom swim?
Children usually get up early at Christmas.
I will be your guide.
How long do you study English every day?
Why does he look grumpy?
There's nothing I can do for you.
The father is good.
I think they're ready.
Tom will try it again.
What a wonderful woman!
They played a board game.
They all believed him.
It means a huge increase in the use of air conditioning, which uses energy, costs money and creates pollution.
I'm an addict.
Those are crocodile tears.
He might have said something earlier.
Work leaves traces on Tatoeba...
Do you like carrots?
I have labor every 30 minutes.
Tom's a lot older now.
Tom's better.
I think Tom's pessimistic.
You have to help them.
I sometimes write to my mother.
Don't trust anyone.
I regret never being nice to him.
Get Tom to call me.
He didn't change anything.
She's not wearing her hat.
Tom actually apologized to Mary.
Why doesn't he sit with me anymore?
I want you to look for them.
I left the party too early.
I should have eaten more.
Of twenty students, only one read the book.
To love someone means to see him as God had understood him.
You don't lie to them.
Do they live with her?
I don't know how he did this.
I'm not sure George's gonna like this idea.
They're afraid to say it publicly.
Please identify yourself.
Let us go.
It would be nice to spend the summer in the mountains.
I lost him.
I almost dropped the plates.
There's a phone in my room.
Is it bad?
Tom dialed 911.
We are brother and sister.
Are you interested in Buddhism?
This week was great.
You want a tray with that?
You don't know me.
Nobody wants to work.
Please drive slower.
How do we stare at it?
This is last month's magazine.
They're not back yet.
He's about your age, isn't he?
He's back.
We can't let them die.
It's a bundle of nerves.
Tom arrived late.
Tom stayed behind.
This point will be discussed tomorrow.
How did you spend your vacation?
When he left the Army, Roger Miller moved to the country music house in Nashville, Tennessee.
Mary corrected it.
Have you ever talked to him?
I think Tom won't be able to do that.
When did you get back from London?
Tom's always in a good mood.
Can I get you some coffee?
He left the village to study.
I've never seen you dance.
Tom stooped for a closer look.
Can you save them?
So you and Hanna are planning on getting married?
You can drive, right?
They need us to finish the job.
I've been here twice now.
It sounds so fake.
Everyone's dead.
I don't want you in my car.
A cobra bit Tom.
I don't care about her.
Don't say anything!
I'm of the opinion that you're right.
He likes football.
Tom lives next to Mary.
I have to go to Boston next week.
Show them how to do it.
What is his favorite fruit?
Do you like golf?
What's your favorite type of pizza?
He's not very good at his job.
Bob has a lot of books in his room.
They followed Tom.
The ship disappeared on the horizon.
Of course you lied.
Something was going on.
Send it in the mail.
It's interesting, isn't it?
Mary accidentally ran into Tom.
I'm nobody's enemy.
I forgot his number.
The two teams fought very hard.
I think there's a mistake in my account.
Tom didn't talk me into it.
Sami had some painful secrets.
You want me to be frank?
What will you do?
Tom seems tired, take him home, please.
May all your desires come true!
He's already done it.
He's experienced with a word processor.
He was at the gate of death.
You're hurt, aren't you?
Your table's ready.
Is it going to be hot again tomorrow?
Tom and Mary have a car, don't they?
Now let's talk.
I can't solve this problem.
He hit him in the head.
It'll be a lot of fun.
Tom told Mary what not to do.
Mind your own business!
She was extremely scary.
I'm telling a story.
You're homesick, aren't you?
What are you going to eat tomorrow?
I saw the movie earlier.
Sophie, who was hungry, ate everything she could get.
Is this Tom and Mary?
There is no future in his employment.
Tom and I study a lot together.
Tom and Mary are very happy here.
Do you like to travel?
I want to go back to Tom's house.
He has strong principles.
He was buried in this cemetery.
Again, bye.
Lucky to meet you here.

It is disease to be obsessed with victory, it is disease to be obsessed with the use of martial arts, and it is disease to be obsessed with presenting everything you have learned. It is disease to be obsessed with attack, and it is disease also to be obsessed with defense. It is disease also to be obsessed with getting rid of the disease. Stare at the mind obsessively on anything is considered disease.

He chose you.
I'm Mike's friend.
Tom said he didn't want a morosa.
How do you interpret poetry?
I have the honor of working with Tom.
He started working.
Oil is abundant in that country.
You don't have to worry.
I know it sounds silly.
Give me the key to the car, please.
She's not naked.
I'll show you how it works.
Am I slipping?
Please show me another example.
I cut myself with a knife.
Tom will take care of us.
Where did I put my keys?
Have you ever read the Bible?
We tried everything.
"Look at that!", he said, triumphant.
I'll give him some advice.
How's your summer vacation going?
I don't like poker at all.
How's your job search going?
I heard Tom was killed.
I was ready to do it.
Tom's a fool.
Mike came back from the library at five.
I didn't vote Tom.
He was seen crossing the road.
I'm like my brother.
I'll go.
Do you really think that's necessary?
Everyone on the road was surprised.
Here?
Write your name here.
He's very selfish, isn't he?
I could try.
He was lost while walking through the woods.
How long will you stay?
Tom and Mary are really jealous, aren't they?
They gave an answer to every question.
Please fill your forehead.
I came here to learn.
Drink the medicine.
I can see a pattern.
He was unable to attend the party.
Do you still collect stamps?
It's not for them.
They're both good.
He spilled his drink on my tux.
Why aren't you wearing that hat anymore?
The report was soon known throughout the country.
I love your daughter.
Are you as bored as I am?
Mary kissed her father on the cheek.
What kind of beer do you have?
We're used to living in a big city.
They're our closest friends.
In general, Japan’s climate is mild.
I had three exams today.
I had no idea she was coming.
I'm sorry, but I'm not paid enough to worry.
Where do you keep your bottle opener?
Don't you understand yet?
Can you teach me how to play chess?
What time should I wake you up?
There's no one here.
You should apologize to them.
I'd like to buy a dog.
Layla wondered where Sami was.
Take Tom out.
I was happy back then.
I told him I'm not hungry.
Tom's messy, isn't he?
They said they were embarrassed.
Please take them.
Please come home.
I like the pro fight.
Tom's smart.
Don't be so formal, please!
You think that's a clue?
I don't think Tom's jokes are particularly funny.
He does everything very quickly.
Please don't kill me!
I bit my lip.
You're a moralist.
She's always been a hothead.
She likes beans.
I'm having trouble falling asleep.
The relief is instantaneous.
Lida is a close friend of Mary's.
Please don't interrupt me while I'm talking.
I hope to participate.
I never lied to her.
She ate an apple.
Don't judge people by appearance.
She's jealous.
Okay, right, I understand what you mean.
You'll be safe here.
Are you proud of your father?
Tom's grumpy.
You've been to Berlin before.
You're too young to be in love.
Stay awake.
Tom, where did you put my passport?
Now lie down.
He finally decided to get married.
Can I use your phone?
Can't we do anything?
The relationship "A loves B" is not reflective, transient or symmetrical.
Add more salt to the soup.
All you have to do is sweep the floor.
Do not give a child more money than necessary.
Tom thinks Mary lied.
I won't talk about it.
I'm a fucking economist.
Tom wouldn't understand.
Would you like a drink?
I'm here to help them.
He was too drunk to drive home.
I heard voices.
I respected Tom.
So what happened next?
She's ready now.
Go play with him.
Now go brush your teeth.
I can't fire them.
He had a burst of anger.
Don't make any noise while you eat soup.
Please go to the supermarket and buy some fruit.
I realized I wasn't ready.
Mr. White went to Canada.
You think Tom's funny?
She's not sure she's going back to her husband's house.
I've been making a big deal of it right now.
He said he wasn't interested.
What does the note say?
I don't have to account to you for my actions.
Mr. Gomez didn't apologize for my mistake.
Is he a foreigner?
I think you're perfect.
Let's send them all home.
The thermometer scores three degrees below zero.
Although Marcel works hard, he only earns $30,000 Canadian a year.
Where did you give them?
Can you give me a euro?
Tom was the only one who wasn't eating.
I wouldn't want to do anything against the law.
Evaluate your progress.
How many runs do these buses have every hour or so?
She wasn't a very good pianist.
Do you have any cats?
Women like men with moustaches.
He fell from the tree.
It will contribute to this project.
The tree is sick.
Tom's probably bored.
It was a good choice.
The frost caused a lot of damage to the crops.
Tom deserves an explanation.
Just think about it.
Are you ready to study Klingon?
Who wrote "The Prince"?
I'll pretend this never happened.
Sometimes, a little pride is what we need.
Tom lost his money, his family, and his friends.
He lives here completely alone.
He convinced me.
Fortune has nothing to do with it.
You kissed him, didn't you?
Why isn't Tom here today?
That should be interesting.
He moved west to Nashville, Tennessee.
I'll call you back later.
Where do you want to go?
Tom knows exactly how Mary feels.
Have you ever heard Tom sing?
Tom didn't tell you?
He misled me.
Can rabbits swim?
Sami was trying to learn Arabic.
You've grown taller.
Call my wife.
They'll understand.
He read an article.
She couldn't come because of her illness.
Sometimes he's late for school.
My son's brushing his teeth.
I always liked this restaurant.
I couldn't understand anything Tom said.
Dogs are territorial.
Tom's playing in the park.
Can someone open the door, please?
I was just doing my duty.
I want to ask them when their big day is.
Feed the bird.
You know I love Tom, right?
I can't give Mary everything she wants.
He's coming at noon.
He's a busy person, isn't he?
Tom asked everyone to leave.
I'm very frustrated.
She cried when she heard the terrible news.
I'm afraid it's too late to say no.
You're important.
He convinced his wife not to divorce him.
My answer matches yours.
There is no life without electricity and water.
I'm right.
They won't see me without a date.
She kicked her boyfriend out of the house.
Have you ever written Mary a letter?
He behaves very shyly in his presence.
Tom's spoiled.
It's probably a mistake.
He is a famous painter and should be treated as such.
Our cities create serious pollution problems.
Tom's got a job.
How dare you talk to me like that!
Tell him to leave.
I like autumn more than anything.
Tom's suspicious.
The good news is that we will be able to help you.
I usually take a bath before I go to bed.
What I want is a word processor.
What brought you to Boston?
Do I bother you sometimes?
You want me to leave now?
We're outraged.
I hope you had a great day!
I'm feeling stressed out.
Mary giggled.
We all wanted revenge.
Tom will never agree.
I'm diligent.
I'm sure they're talking about us.
I'm lucky today.
He looks like a baboon.
"Do you have a dog?" "No."
He's got a weird temper.
Have faith in God.
Promise me you'll help them.
I wonder why Tom isn't here.
Many people thought he was too young to be president.
Tom wondered if Mary could speak French.
Our train arrived late.
Why is Tom looking at me?
I asked Tom to play the guitar.
What's Tom like when he's angry?
He's so lazy.
Help Tom study.
Do you like to travel?
Do you like Tom?
I don't want to be afraid of Tom anymore.
What's keeping you up so late?
You don't have a wife, do you?
It was sudden.
Just use mine for now.
He risked his life to save her.
We can't be friends anymore.
He didn't give me anything.
His father was right.
Tom is very generous.
Did you let Tom kiss you?
How old could your grandfather be?
They are too indebted to get the loan for small businesses.
Do you have oranges?
Looks like Tom's annoyed.
I know you've spent the last three years in prison.
That's the norm.
The office is deserted.
She sleeps a lot.
Don't keep it backwards.
We must preserve our peaceful constitution.
This is a man dressed like a woman.
Tom is impassive.
Could you call him?
You'd be surprised at what you can learn in a week.
Tom has a house with two rooms.
Don't say stupid things!
Give them the keys.
Could you tell me how to get to the station?
It's already good.
I think Tom's flexible.
We'll wait for Tom in the lobby.
I made a fool of myself.
She was dangerous.
She was satisfied with the new dress.
Do you see this?
Tom doesn't have empathy.
Is Tom busy?
He could die.
It depends too much on him.
Tom's nice to me.
That's not gonna happen.
Tom's home, but Mary's not.
Forget about him.
You're different.
I wasn't angry.
Tom decedé.
I know you hate school.
My morosa's daughters signed up for Facebook.
Sami called Layla for her birthday.
I was very annoyed by him for being so late.
The princess is wearing a gold crown.
He's still shocked, isn't he?
He's a little jealous.
It weighs more than 80 kilos.
You don't drive out of fear of an accident.
Send him that paper.
A couple of red chopsticks broke.
The train arrived in London.
Do your colleagues like their work?
Where do you think we are?
Thirteen Americans were killed.
I was disfigured.
I've been in frequent contact with foreign students.
I have a very nice girlfriend.
I don't see him anymore.
It's unpredictable.
This underwater watch is a little too expensive.
The torch doesn't turn on at the base.
Put your books away.
His days are numbered.
Tom does whatever he wants.
The river flooded the entire region.
You'd better fight your sleep.
It really sucks.
I have to go help her.
Sami waited for me.
Forget his address.
Were you in love with them?
Hey, did you hear that?
Tom went to France two months ago.
I'm pretty weak right now.
Tom couldn't control himself.
You never trust Tom.
I don't look anything like Tom.
Our work never ends.
You know Tom likes Mary.
Why was he so slow?
We've seen three wars.
Flowers bloom.
Let's go find them.
Do you study French?
In 1900 he left England and never returned.
Tom's saving money for college.
The city was abandoned by its inhabitants.
Tom is rich and powerful.
He can't be more than 20 years old.
Have you read Agatha Christie's books?
He deserves a promotion.
I want you to stay where you are.
Was I really boring?
Are we getting pizza?
Tom and Mary visited Scandinavia.
He's the fifth man in the line.
I hate watching TV.
Iran intends to send a monkey into space.
Do you have brothers and sisters?
You didn't listen.
You convinced me.
Layla left Sami.
Are you capable of typing?
Tom's not my dear, he's just a friend.
Tom never apologized for what he did to us.
What method did you use to quit smoking?
The Morales are in the room.
We went to the beach.
I think they'll be late.
Tom's annoyed.
You shouldn't listen to me.
Nothing changes me.
You don't have to change.
Oh, look, they're kissing!
I wish he had attended the conference.
Tom was taken to the emergency room.
I have a question for you.
Tom called at 2:30.
I live in Osaka.
I'm a doctor, Jim, not a lawyer.
I'm keeping this place for you.
Tom didn't know who Mary was.
I won't find a morosa.
Today the weather is beautiful.
Nobody cared.
Are you from Urumqi?
Let me take you to the hospital.
We love what we do.
Together, everything is possible!
I want you to be better.
He didn't come back.
You'd better go help them.
He ordered him not to give orders.
I think Tom's in trouble.
I'd like you to accompany him.
Was he in Cairo?
She must have gone out.
I'm not worried about you.
What do you want to do for work?
We want to meet him.
Do you like songs?
Do you really think Tom is honest?
I'm getting married soon.
They added a woman to the committee.
Tom didn't scare me.
I'm working here.
He can't swim.
You can talk to me, you know?
Are you always busy?
Did he tell you what to do?
You don't fuck her up!
How long did you live in Kobe?
How much do you like your new job?
Tom married the school.
It wasn't that cold yesterday.
I really like Tom.
Tom puked in the bucket.
Sami doesn't celebrate Halloween.
You'll never see them again.
I tried to reach him.
He made room for an elderly woman on the bus.
What are you doing here?
It's a delicate problem.
I went to a movie with Tom after work.
He'll always be there.
I'm trying to avoid them.
No one can understand that.
I'm getting weak!
He's pretty overweight, isn't he?
I never believed him.
I'm not his angel anymore.
Tom probably won't be shy.
He can play poetry.
She locked a door.
I don't want Tom doing it here.
I'm in Rome.
Tom gave Mary a Christmas present.
I can say you're angry.
She passed away yesterday afternoon.
Were you blindfolded?
We're getting help.
This guy tried to kill me.
We arrived in New York at night.
Why did Tom kiss Mary?
Come on, don't be silly.
It's a little late for that, don't you think?
I shouldn't have trusted her.
They all knew you.
Why did you sign the confession?
I know Tom's guilty.
You have only two options.
He seems surprised.
I'll ask around.
I don't remember anything.
Tom speaks French perfectly.
He bought some bread.
Tom started working immediately.
Do you like this flower?
Do you know Mr. Jackson?
I shouldn't have stayed.
Tom's trying to fix his car.
You think Tom's still up?
Why are you giving Tom money?
It might be better.
He really hates that way of thinking.
Don't associate with them.
I speak French.
Here's an even better idea.
We're all done here.
Right now, I don't have a plan.
He calls him a lot.
She's a musicologist.
Why are you giving Tom money?
Children know that, too.
Mary made breakfast for her husband.
I wanted to talk to you about something.
We should have tried harder.
Which one is yours?
I just changed my mind.
I said I was hungry.
I didn't read any of those books.
Liisa was sick of the noise.
Tom was in the garden.
It's touchy, isn't it?
Are you wearing glasses?
Are you sure Tom won't be mad?
Tom will call the cops.
Please fill your forehead.
Tom forgot his umbrella again.
Do you have a cell phone?
Sounds to me like he's honest.
Don't turn off the light.
They still live with their parents.
Who doesn't like that?
They used truth serum.
You're allowed to do that.
I didn't know what to say.
I'm feeling really good.
Give me some.
This is Tony.
He's rich, but he's unpleasant.
Read the book aloud.
I think I'll go get them.
Where did you exchange them?
I asked Tom and Mary for their keys.
He said he'd call me.
He never had a screwdriver in his hand.
I was able to save them.
You think Tom's guilty?
Why would we want to punish you?
We're not disappointed.
Your handwriting is unreadable.
Do you like Tom's tattoos?
Do you have any books on Armenia?
He's as busy as ever.
He called his lawyer.
Are you drunk?
Tom seemed stunned.
I'm tired of singing.
Tom won't buy a new car.
Do you love her?
Tell her we're busy.
Is Tom around?
I need to talk to him now.
I can't see them.
No one will know.
Do you want to do business or not?
He asked for a beer.
