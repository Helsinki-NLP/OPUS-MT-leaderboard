The Prague Stock Exchange finished with fewer points at the end of the day
After the rapid fall of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
EZ stock transactions reached about half the value they have on a normal day.
The Prague Stock Exchange, at the beginning of trading Tuesday, reacted immediately to Monday’s drop when it dropped to about 6%.
The drop this time is due to the fall in stocks on Wall Street.
Also expressed here is the reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the American Assembly of Representatives that refused to support the stabilization plan of the secretary of the financial sector.
Falling Stocks in Asia
Asian stocks fell dramatically on Tuesday, though the index eventually eased some of the losses over the course of the day.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng stock index throughout its trading day hit nearly four percent, though it later eased its losses by reducing the decline by nearly 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which tracks the movements of Chinese shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell 3.8 percent, while markets in Shanghai were closed.
Shares of the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent but, in the end, losses fell to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange, according to the Index Secretary, fell to 3.6 percent.
“The rescue actions planned in the US are unsafe and this influences the financial market around the world,” said the head of the Hong Kong Currency Office, Joseph Yam.
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, it only determines its monetary policy, that is, without dependence on the Central Bank of China.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as those in the United States.
U.S. lawmakers should reconvene as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and approve a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatens that the falls will be felt in other countries.
Bloody Bath of American Stocks
On Monday, the American Assembly of Representatives rejected the aid plan for the financial system, which should be allocated 700 billion dollars (almost 12 trillion crowns).
Lawmakers thus ignored President George Bush’s invitation to support his plan.
For Bush, the plan would solve the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, U.S. stocks took a bloody dip and mainly the stock index picked up the biggest drop in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell to almost seven percent, a similar drop in volume was last recorded in 1987.
The index had already fallen before it was announced, but as soon as it was shown that the proposal of the assembly was not moving forward, the index began to fall freely.
Congress pulls out: U.S. government can inject $700 billion into banking
The highest representatives of Congress and the government, President George W. Bush, agreed to a pact on broad terms of financial aid to the American financial system.
Its vote will take place early next week.
American lawmakers caused a gap in talks over the approval of the rescue plan in its form of aid to the American financial system with the amount of 700 billion dollars (approximately 12 trillion crowns).
However, it is not yet won.
Congressmen must fine-tune some details of the contract before they can make public the final form of the law and have it voted on.
The financial aid plan will be discussed Monday in the House of Representatives.
Barney Frank, chairman of the House Banking and Financial Services Committee, told Reuters on Sunday.
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could take place in the Senate no earlier than Wednesday.
According to economists, the arrival of the ratification of the rescue plan should represent the announcement of a first psychologically significant factor for the revitalization of the financial market.
Then, however, there will be "disenchantment" thanks to the complex mechanisms whose help to the market will also reach in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made a great advance.
We settled our differing opinions on how the market stabilization package should be shaped,” Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still take place on Sunday.
Representatives of lawmakers met Sunday night with Finance Minister Henry Paulson to finalize the government fund.
It should buy from financial corporations the unsold mortgage assets that drive financial firms to severe losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
"We are about to close the agreement on the plan, which will work and must also be effective in the market.
We still need to continue with the sanitation plan, but I think we’re already in it,” Paulson said.
A sign for Asian businesses
The global financial crisis has a clear impact on the fast-moving stock market.
According to Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., lawmakers are doing everything they can to get Congress to definitively pass a deal on Sunday.
They want to reassure investors’ business before the Asian finance market as these are the ones that are in the first time zone and where Congress could influence Monday’s trade.
However, for now there is nothing clear for sure about when the two chambers of Congress will vote and, even, if they will not stagnate at the last moment with some problem.
Lawmakers believe it will pass in the coming days.
The law, however, will undergo a number of changes.
The total amount intended to help the system must be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion needs to be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush requested.
However, Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it has the impression that the program does not fulfill its function, which would be another 100 billion dollars and, later, the last 350 billion dollars.
Bush praised the progress of the meetings.
On the other hand, the president can veto this decision but Congress can overcome its veto by a majority of votes.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the program was to earn financial resources for the repurchase of bad mortgage securities whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not able to finish paying their mortgages.
“We’ve worked everything out.
The Assembly of Representatives should be prepared to vote on the bill on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
President Bush is also pleased with the progress of the meetings.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is pleased with Saturday's move and that he appreciates "the commitment of both sides to stabilize our financial market and protect our economy."
Limitation of the armoured contract
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, the chief negotiator, said lawmakers decided on responsibility for the program’s money to protect taxpayers’ taxes from their losses, an alleviating shutdown of the scheduled financial plan.
The new law must also limit the so-called armored contracts for directors of the companies participating in the program, and creates a committee that will have control of the Fund.
This should be directed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We've worked very hard on it, and we've made a big step toward a deal that will work and be effective for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also counts on helping homeowners who struggle with their payments.
The government would have to agree on the new mortgage payments it buys in order to lower the monthly burden on borrowers’ installment payments and enable them to keep their homes.
Marek: psychological help
The proposed plan is, according to the chief economist of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea that will be realized but quite difficult.
“And this is why it is not known with what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will be bought.
This will be decisive for the division of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week, for the iHNed.cz server.
Whether the plan is approved now or early next week is not, according to Marek, as relevant.
“Much more important is that, already this week, the congressmen agree on their support and give their approval as soon as possible.
This important and psychological agreement to get that approval is, at the moment, the most important thing," Marek insisted.
Armed struggle: the MP3 Player against the mobile.
We advise you how to choose
While almost every mobile plays MP3 files, no MP3 player gets to make calls.
It seems that it is better to buy only the phone.
There are still enough reasons for the man to acquire only the player.
The choice depends practically on the manner of its use and the demand of the future owner.
It will probably be difficult for you to acquire the most modern record player to listen on it the latest album of Maxim Turbulenc.
On the other hand, this type of musical products such as LP records no longer come out, and as far as their quality is concerned, there is not a single objective reason to continue buying them.
If vinyl records with art rock, jazz or blues music crowd your shelves, you are probably dreaming, at least, of this type of record player.
This is the same with music that is on the way, i.e. music compressed, simplified - music in MP3.
And here there are price and quality categories.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, as well as for a Pink Floyd lover who will hardly try twenty-crown market helmets.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for each.
The choice is wide.
It also determines the battery life.
Some of the best players achieve much more than just playing music and even what not even most mobiles.
No device today is as universal as the telephone.
Faced with the most elementary functions such as calling, sending messages, can play music and video, record both, has a better or worse photography device and can even navigate.
And when we take into consideration the Smartphone and the PDAs they will also have in their pocket a small computer.
This is a small miracle since no fridge knows how to make a barbecue and no television can photograph.
The universality of mobiles also brings us disadvantages.
The more features you use on your phone, the sooner the display prompt will light up asking to be recharged.
And music playback is one of the biggest energy swallows.
Few are the mobiles that manage to play music more than ten or twelve hours, most much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest ones) clearly have a higher performance.
Therefore, keep in mind that cheap mobile phones will not play more than two hours.
If in addition to this, above, constantly call still get yourself, for more safety, a charger for work - this applies also to the most expensive appliances.
With the MP3 player this problem will not have it, because even the worst endure at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a load.
Another problem occurs when recording music on mobile.
Unfortunately, only a part of the devices has the universal USB connector and, in addition, not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course it is possible to record music directly on the memory card but only in some unreduced reader units can the small memory cards used in mobile phones be connected.
On players, with some exception (iPod), no special software is needed.
Simply fill the device with music through the USB of the computer.
Most mobiles and players create their order in the music library alone according to the name of the performer, album title, genre or also according to the user rating.
Some devices only show a directory with a tree structure similar to a Windows Finder and some recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
The player tries to serve, the mobile knows more
For the choice of a particular equipment, be interested in the resistance of the accumulator, the capacity of the memory, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the comfort of its handling.
If you listen, above all, to the music as a background and you will listen to it every day only for a while, as in the tram, then it is enough with any mobile that plays.
What virtually any mobile truly achieves.
You should not even be interested in the format in which the mobile or the player play the music.
The MP3 is played by everyone and practically all the music that comes to it will be in this format.
It is among the most widespread and except for him the absolute majority of the devices play music in WMA format.
The least include the AAC format (format used by the company Apple and your iPod).
The best mobile phones also make it possible, for example, to buy music online.
It is enough to visit the competent pages of the operator (or any other service provider) and buy a song or album.
This service could be on its own a compelling argument to acquire a mobile for music.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is miserable and most are limited only to the issues of fleeting success of radios.
Prices are not the lowest either.
However, in general, it is assumed that precisely this way of selling music (whether by GSM, internet or wireless internet) in the future will dominate the music industry.
Most people always carry a mobile phone.
Whenever you want to listen to something, you will find the mobile in your pocket, while the MP3 player will be forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always carry headphones or, at least, handsfree.
If not, you can use a built-in player that has virtually every phone even if it is at least an MP3 player.
Probably the biggest advantage for many of the mobile with music will be its price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand.
Between three and four thousand crowns can already acquire a good walkman.
Most of you will be limited by the absence of a classic headphone jack.
The best, even in terms of the technical part, such as phones equipped with a 3.5 mm input for a classic headphones, cost up to fifteen thousand.
Again, the advantage of the players is nothing more than their easy service.
The simplest players - by no means necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - are really handled by anyone.
The minimal functions, its handling similar to the previous common cassettes or also to the turntables is evident.
It does not represent a threat in the sense that by mistake we connect to the internet with the mobile and, consequently, gigantic account for data download.
Which device to decide on
Even the cheapest mobile phones (for example, the Vodafone 527) usually have a slot to change the memory card (type M2, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of a suitable card you will reach two thousand crowns.
However, be careful.
The basic models are usually equipped with only a card of 2 GB maximum capacity.
Only the most expensive ones have a memory of 8 GB.
If you already have a mobile and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a look at Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on the capacity (maximum 2 GB) it is not necessary to spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you consider yourself among the most demanding music lovers, take advantage of the most specialized mobile-walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent keys for the MP3 which makes a service as comfortable as that of the same player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose phones of the walkman line have almost identical use as that of a separate MP3 player.
The same service and the same category in terms of price, about four thousand crowns, but with a greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and accumulator (normally 15 hours, with a maximum performance of up to 35 hours), the brand mentioned above brings them MP3 players.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Probably
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite developed and our operators offer virtually all services as their Western European partners.
However, here we are still missing something - the virtual operator, which would force those to be cheaper.
Probably won't be long in coming.
That Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe, we have already written on mobil.cz.
The rest was also confirmed by the Czech Telecommunications Office (CTO) which warned that the price of SMS messages in our country is one of the most expensive in the entire Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming rates will probably come to a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators the SMS they send from abroad will be cheaper than if they send them from home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, it lacks competition that really wants to fight.
This probably seems paradoxical to us, since we have three mobile networks and their high coverage is more than 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that in the Czech market there is extreme competition.
The Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (CTO), Pavel Dvosák, has already stated that there is no longer any place in the Czech Republic for any other operator.
It is perhaps true that for a classic operator with its own network it no longer has too many possibilities (for the rest, it would be very difficult to find some frequency).
However, there is still one possibility - the virtual operator.
Precisely the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market brought a significant price decrease, which had to be reacted to by classic operators.
At the same time, even before the entry of sharks such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile into the British market, similar voices were heard both there and here.
It was shown that there is room for such operators and that they can succeed.
No need to look for examples too far.
In February of this year we informed you about the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
Just after half a year, this operator managed to obtain more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator in the neighboring country.
On the other hand, behind Mobilking is the Penta group which, apart from that, in the Czech Republic is the owner of U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of concentrating on many more specific target groups.
In addition, in order for them to function effectively, they need far fewer customers than a classic operator.
They do not carry relatively large costs in the construction, operation and maintenance of the network.
In the world these types of virtual operators are usually profiled with low expenses - they offer cheap calls and SMS messages that however, are often counteracted with the offer of tighter services.
Thus, for example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers SMS at least half as cheap compared to the competition.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a good blow to bet on a trivial target group.
This operator is specifically aimed at man.
“The right man chooses Mobilking – it’s the operator he likes and who can be trusted,” says David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which works this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether such a concept as that of Poland could engage in our country.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav ?epick? said: "The Czech market is relatively small to access by segments on which most virtual operators are based.
Moreover, from the point of view of the supply of services, it is relatively saturated.”
In the Czech Republic there are no possibilities, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
“We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the Czech Republic it does not seem too hopeful.
Rather it is about the launch of Mobilking in other countries in our region," Jana Studniková, a spokeswoman for the Penta financial group, said in a phone conversation to mobil.cz.
He indirectly assured that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic definitely do not bow to this idea.
Rather the opposite, they try to do everything possible so that no potential competition arises.
Interest in the launch of a mobile virtual operator is already shown by the GTS Novera group that would like to take a step forward to become a real competition of Telefónica O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in it, to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telephony services but also mobile telephony.
And the sooner, the better.
With this possibility we have met repeatedly with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them we have made progress in the meetings," said the group's spokesman, Pavel Kaidl.
Then maybe better times are flashing.
It seems that, for unofficial information, the first official operator would have to arrive possibly as early as the end of the year.
But for now his appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At the moment we believe that the situation is ideal for the emergence of a virtual operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market compared to others is a very specific market.
So far no one has approached us with any complex and serious project in this field," said Vlastimil Sr?e?, spokesperson for Telefónica O2.
Other operators are concerned with the specificity of the Czech market.
T-mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová, in exceptional accordance with O2’s opinion, adds: “To date we have not registered any viable commercial project that, bilaterally profitable, can continue to be developed.”
“On the T-Mobile network, it will be difficult to find a virtual carrier until the end of the year.
At this point we should already have on the table some specific contract that was possible to study in such a short horizon."
Vodafone focuses its attention on meeting the requirements of a 3G license.
Miroslav ?epick? adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this in terms of cost-sharing and infrastructure.
We consider it as the greatest contribution from the point of view of the customers.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this field lies in the partner with whom to establish a shared network for fast mobile internet.”
Responsible offices - with toenail and meat operators
The progress of mobile operators can be easily understood, but the entry of another operator would mean increasing competition which would lead to a decrease in prices and with it, a decrease in profits.
So why facilitate entry to the competition?
When operators want to get something, they are able to pull the same rope, proof of that is the grab when U:fon emerged.
Perhaps the biggest pressure on the company was at the time of the entry of U:fon by T-Mobile.
This is attested by the public information accessible on the websites of the “T”.
But precisely now U:fon serves as an argument for why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová adds: "In addition, not long ago the competitive environment in the mobile phone market was opened to a fourth operator.
As far as the character of the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is concerned, it is natural that the entry of another player into the market would mean for him and, above all, for his services great requirements."
This is why this access to mobile operators is tremendously discouraging due to the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory body.
It is not just the position of the EU, which unfortunately has no competence to intervene in commercial tenders, unlike Great Britain and other developed countries.
This belongs purely to the Office for the Protection of Commercial Tenders (OHS).
However, she expressed her typical position on this issue.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible after an agreement was concluded on the rental of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile operator and a virtual operator.
Until today no agreement has been closed since the offer of the potential interested parties was not interesting enough for the classic operators," added Kristián Chalupa, from the foreign relations department of the OHS.
These statements do not surprise the representatives of the operators.
For offices that must represent the interests of consumers it is more than a consideration, apart from this they must observe that no one takes advantage of their position in the market.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Overseas where virtual operators operate normally we can see that their entry into the market contributed to the price drop of mobile phone services"
Obviously, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market means and the fall in prices do not fall within the interest of the OHS.
Really how dramatically shocking in this whole case lies in the dissonant reactions that result from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether it really is a coincidence, offers itself.
It is the same as with the price of gasoline at gas stations because it is clear that it is the work of chance and a hard fight for competition.
"The Office in this regard has found no signs of unfair competition and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position, therefore they do not have a corresponding rise in responsibility for their actions in the market.
The tools needed to open up the mobile phone market to virtual operators, rather, are lacking, as well as telecom regulators,” Chalupa added.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many points of contention.
Obviously there is an analysis of relevant markets prepared by the T according to which telecommunications are from the point of view of commercial bidding a single market.
In this type of market, of course, none of the Czech operators has a dominant position.
However some of the legal experts offer another insight - for a virtual operator to emerge the agreement with the network administrator is always necessary.
And the mobile operator - in all its logic - has a monopoly on its network.
Therefore, in a particular segment it must necessarily be dominant.
And if this argument is not accepted, at least for OHS should represent a warning the fact that three mobile operators ascend strikingly in a similar way.
The current complaints of the interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that in all the negotiations with the operators they encounter many similar impediments.
Charging the responsibility in the t-shirt is a fairly common trick in the field of telecommunications from which the t-shirt washes its hands in all this matter.
We have already met him in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, a new amendment to the telecommunications law was recently introduced to extend the competence of the Commission in the field of commercial tenders which was not implemented, even though a number of specialists promised that the situation would improve.
This must be perfectly known by the representatives of ?OHS, but it is clear that their interests are elsewhere.
All is well, when no one looks
At the same time, something like a pseudo-virtual operator continues to work unnoticed, as there are quite a few in Czech mobile phone networks.
They are companies that put their own prices on mobile phone services that, however, only a part are public.
These are usually companies that are dedicated to multi-level marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
Usually only a select few get the price list from these companies.
The magic is that the company, with respect to the operator, acts as a classic business customer of the same ordering a large number of SIM cards.
As a special customer you will then receive special prices and other offers.
The problem is that commercial conditions in all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
"If cases such as the ones you cite were discovered, you could talk about breach of contract conditions that could result in the end of collaboration with the given society," Martina Kemrová answered the question about this problem.
But it is quite unlikely that an activity of this kind carried out by mobile phone operators did not reach responsible people.
In the case of the three mentioned companies, it can be thousands of customers.
None of the operators are against this procedure.
With the activities of these companies they obtain not negligible profits and, at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - they in no way threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav ?epick? warns us of the possible problems: "the law allows speculation of this kind, however, the services of this company are used only by a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they must accept that the SIM card of their phone is not in their name so they can not absolutely dispose of it as a normal customer of the operators.
Precisely this is what it should seem to the minimally strange T.
There is also a new question for the OHS.
If mobile operators are blindsided by this type of procedure, why are they blocking the virtual operator’s entry?
It is necessary to add that the OHS has enough competence to discover this type of activities and if it is not going to want it should not be content with the explanations of the operators that they have no idea of this story and that their commercial conditions do not allow it.
When will we stop being the most expensive?
As already made clear in the text, the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market brought a significant decrease in the prices of services.
At the same time, in virtually every country where the virtual operator emerged, classic operators more or less tried to protect themselves from this incursion.
The arguments used by these were virtually all identical - too small, a market, eventually, too saturated, problems with the quality of service, etc.
In the most advanced countries, however, the regulatory bodies have intervened at the moment and in none of the cases defended the operators but their customers.
Either with formal measures or informal pressure they managed to get the first virtual operator to emerge and with it others began to emerge.
Unfortunately, the Czech Regulatory Body passes this whole case as if it were a burning nail.
From our experience we cannot help but be impressed that the confusion of attributions in these cases suits them.
But let's not despair.
If this behind-the-scenes information is correct and the virtual operator really comes to these lands, then the Czech mobile market will probably start moving again.
If one of the operators lets in a virtual mobile operator, it will be difficult for the OHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And we may stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four performances of the new version of the Czech official anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the day of Czech official celebrations presented the new official recording of the anthem Where, My Home.
The new anthem was recorded by the National Theatre orchestra under the direction of Ji?í B?lohlávek.
There are four versions available - two versions that are Solos, one to male and one to female, one with Choir and one instrumental.
Singing is done by Kate?ina Kn?ínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the hymn arrangements are Otakar Jeremiá? and Jaroslav Kr?ek.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions.
This national Czech chant is considered one of the most beautiful hymns by B?lohlávek.
Czech Radio has previously said that it intentionally chose for the Solos singers with representatively young voices that are more expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I tried with the two and then, also, with the Choir that they look at the diction so that the text was well understood, so that it had consonance," he said.
The Czech national anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song "Where, My Home" was first performed in 1834 on the stage at the State Theatre in Josef Kajetan Tyl's original Czech play Fidlova?ka and arranged with the music of Franti?ek ?kroup.
It gained popularity and people made it their own.
The first stanza of the song after the rise of Czechoslovakia in 1918 naturally became a part of the official anthem.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
What the “New” Anthem Sounds Like
The Prague MHD takes us on Wednesday for the first time with the chip
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, the date on which the first passengers enter the metro, the tram and the bus with an electronic voucher in their pockets instead of a paper ticket is written in the history of the Prague Transport Company.
It can be purchased right now by almost a hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase the 30-day, 90-day and annual voucher (this will be valid from January 1, 2009) and simultaneously load it on their chip card at the infocenters and stations of the transport company at the Metro stations, Muzeum, M?stek, Nádra?í Hole?ovice, And?l, Roztyly, Let?any, Kobylisy, Rajská?
The bonds can already be purchased on the Internet on the pages of the transport company, www.dpp.cz.
The service, until the afternoon, was used by more than four hundred people.
Those who start using the internet as a form of commerce can definitely start to forget about the ticket stands at metro stations, where until now they had to regularly queue to get a normal ticket.
The voucher is purchased online, and the Opencard is reloaded at one of the thirteen branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places there is available to passengers a window with prepared personnel that helps the interested parties with the purchase online and also with the recharge of the voucher purchased on their card," said the spokesman of the project, Martin Opatrn.
Apart from the library, it will also be possible to top up the electronic voucher on the Opencard in the automatic vending machines found in some metro lobbies.
How are these vending machines?
They are red, they remind us of a ticket-picking machine and travelers will probably have already noticed them at the metro stations of Roztyly, Budajovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
“There are now five in the city, but by the end of the year there should be eighty,” Opatrin said.
The bonus is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
The use of the machine, which will start operating tomorrow, is simple.
Simply enter the Opencard chip card into it and the previously paid bonus will be charged only on it.
Electronic bonds from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, on the ring trains and bus lines from numbers 300 to 499 used mainly by the inhabitants of the localities of central Bohemia.
"On the trains attached to the integrated transport of Prague there are reviewers equipped with a reader card that will help to confirm the validity of the time and the zone of the voucher," explained the control of the tickets, Filip Drápal of the Ropid organization that establishes the schedules of the collective transport of Prague.
The ring buses have their reader cards mounted in the driver's locker.
Upon entering it is necessary not only to show the card to the driver but also it is necessary to accompany it with the Opencard in the place intended for it on the side of the Box.
With this, the driver controls the validity of the voucher.
“If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the vouchers there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information,” Drápal said.
Passengers who do not travel on the ring buses and do not remember when the validity of the voucher ends can go to the vending machines where the cards are recharged.
Here, on the machine screen, you will be shown the information about the validity of your document.
The South East wanted to be part of the U.S. in a referendum
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans called for smoking to be part of the United States.
This is what is extracted from the letter that is kept in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With this wish, presumably, some groups of Sudeten Germans addressed the president of the United States in 1945.
It is the result of letters that are kept in a particular archive and that today are kept in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
The Germans of ?esk? Krumlov request in a letter to the American president not to allow the return of the ?umava land? - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Pact - back to Czechoslovakia.
“We have correctly understood the situation and really want your word that American units are coming to German lands not as oppressors or enemies but as liberators,” the letter, signed with a “people who carry the fate of ?umava in their hearts,” reads.
In view of the fact that the union of Czechoslovakia with the south-eastern Germans presumably presupposes - according to these the Czech national character - a hope only in brutality, inconsideration, incomprehension, pressure and slavery, the authors beg in the letter to the American president to assume for today and forever to ?umava under a protectorate.
“We cannot believe that without considering the opinion of four million people he will hand us over to a foreign state that oppresses and rejects minorities and that in no way collaborates with the victory of the Allies,” the letter said.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is presumably the fear of reprisals from the "Czech oppressors".
If the U.S. president were to presumably doubt this idea of the ?umavo Germans, it would be enough to organize in the ?umava lands a referendum on whether its inhabitants want to be part of the U.S. or live under its patronage.
Although the text of the letter, with the current knowledge of post-war history, may sound a little childish, according to some specialists it accurately paints the expectations of the Germans of the southeast of then.
Although the Czech Germans had to intuit minimally that it was going to be about their expulsion from the republic only a few admitted this possibility.
Some hoped that the United States and Britain would negotiate for the Sudetenland some clear form of autonomy.
Others thought they would stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed even by the Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in Eske Budjovice.
He was in the war, as a German of Budajovice, enlisted in the Baltic navy.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the British and placed in the Holstein prison camp, dozens of Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They thought that when they came home, the Czech would be good for them," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war, according to him, expected that on the basis of the Benes Decrees they would be removed from the Republic.
You don't think - you pay!
Emotive Campaign Attacks Drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
In this way, one could characterize the emotional Campaign that the Ministry of Transport decided to launch on Wednesday in the media.
The office of the minister, Alesebidek, promises that it will deter drivers from dangerous driving behaviour.
The $150 million campaign will be felt on television, radio, film, the internet and in brochures.
It would have to deter the driver from high speed and from alcohol at the wheel.
And also to remind them that before starting, they tie their belts.
It wants to reach the awareness above all of young drivers, motorists, pedestrians and lastly also of professional drivers.
What can we see in the ads?
Fundamentally human stories that impinge on emotions.
And for this we are attested by the "bloody" ads throughout the campaign:
You don't think - you pay!
The word "Don't think" is written in large letters on the license plate.
And in a pool of blood is the word "pays."
This should symbolize that the man in a moment of loss can come to pay with his own life.
The ads will "fear" viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign carried out in Anglo-Saxon lands where strong images of accident victims can be seen.
It promises that in this way it will reduce accidents and the death toll on Czech roads.
The announcements were made by Euro RSCG.
Sugar and whip for drivers
"For drivers, the sugar and whip system is worth it.
Sugar is for him when, for example, he runs a red light and thus saves time.
The whip is threatened with a fine or accident.
Drivers should be reminded of the risks," says Na Homolce hospital transport psychologist Martin Kocan.
And that is why it is necessary an information campaign in the press and mainly a negative publicity, the psychologist specifies.
Less effective, for him, are the panels that warn the driver of the dangers.
"If there is a panel installed warning of any danger, it will probably soon merge with the environment and the driver will not pay much attention to it," Kocan said.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
The president of Israel’s provisional government, Ehud Olmert, ruled on the restitution of virtually all the lands occupied in 1967, namely the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He proposed in the interview that Monday appeared in the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper.
“We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians which means that we will necessarily have to restore almost all (occupied) land if not all,” Olmert told the newspaper.
“Surely we will keep a percentage of these lands, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of the lands of Israel) because without this there will be no peace,” he added.
He admitted that in case of restitution East Jerusalem would also be included.
“He who wants security in Jerusalem and therefore doesn’t want tractors or bulldozers going over his legs like one of my best friends did, then he will have to hand over a part of Jerusalem,” Olmert said, referring to the two July attacks in the city that killed several people and wounded dozens.
According to the president, it will be necessary to find “a special solution for the Temple Hill, a sacred and historical place” that is located inside the ancient city.
“He who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he later insisted.
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights
Olmert also called for Israel’s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which in his view is an inherent condition for concluding a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also mean concrete efforts on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to close the peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from the Golan," he said.
“The Syrians know very well what they will have to part with to win the Golan.
They will have to abandon their current relations with Iran, they will have to abandon their relations with Hezbollah (the Shiite movement), they will have to detach themselves from the permanent support that Hamas (the Shiite movement), Al Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the Holy War) provoke in Iraq.
Post-Accident Questions: Are Hostesses Illegal on Buses?
The law is unknown, you can't walk on a long-distance bus
In relation to the tragic accident of the bus of the company Student Agency near the Italian city of Padova we are asked if the hostesses and passengers can move by the bus during the trip.
"If we wanted to strictly and formally comply with the law, the stewardess' activity is opposed to the road traffic law," said Karel Hanselka, spokesman for the transport ministry.
The accident in which the 22-year-old stewardess died last week was evidently caused by the truck driver only the bus crossed in the road.
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver in the least safe place in the vehicle despite having two other places reserved.
However, the bus can have an accident or brake suddenly, and at the very moment that the hostess distributes the coffee or newspapers.
Here what plays the role is if the bus is equipped, according to the technical permission, with places on foot.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must be seated.
The long-distance buses of the Student Agency have no place to go standing, which the company’s director, Radim Jan?ura, confirmed to Aktuáln?.cz.
"We have solved this with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed.
Finally this was removed and we reached the agreement that passengers can go to the bathroom while the bus is running if they have a seat, "he told us his position.
The stewardess does not know the law
“There is no obvious legal interpretation of the stewardess’ role – no legal provision clarifies this function.
Not even any legal provision prohibits transport agents from performing any service.
The law of road transport only knows the term of Reviewer of vehicles, whose rights and obligations are not defined," adds, less sharply, spokesman Hanselka.
The director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorn, thinks on the contrary that the law sufficiently addresses this problem.
"It depends on whether the bus has the homologation allowed to have foot sites.
That's it," he says.
The buses are divided between urban, where there are places to stand and of limited maximum speed, interurban with places to stand with a greater speed permit and those of long distances without places to go standing, with the greater speed permit and with the seats equipped with a seat belt.
Like on the plane, says the expert.
BESIP’s expert in Transport Safety, Jaroslav Hosín, sees no major problems in terms of the movement of the stewardess on the bus.
"During the development of the trip there is not much threat of danger, the situation can be compared with the service on the planes.
Even here you are not sure that the turbulence is coming and that the stewardess can be hit in the head."
“However, if the bus suddenly brakes, it is evident that the physical laws are valid.
The same as in a city bus or on the tram.
The safety of the hostess must be solved by the internal regulations of the carrier," he says and also thinks that from the point of view of the law this problem is unsolved.
Janura is ready to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only carrier that offers hostess service.
It employs two hundred.
The director, not even after the accident, considers that work risky.
“However, the moment I get the impression that the stewardess post is risky, then I will remove it.
Coffee and newspapers can receive it, passengers, when entering.
It would even save expenses,” he says.
In the interest of safety is why Asiana lacks hostesses in its vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, who runs a small line compared to SA.
“We don’t have hostesses, we are against them from the beginning.
Sooner or later this will end in a fatal accident,” he said less than a year ago for T den.cz.
There was a huge tragedy
In the accident of the line linking Naples a young stewardess of Pilsen who had worked for the company two years died.
A Slovenian truck that probably turned from the parking lane blocking the way to the bus.
His driver tried in a quick maneuver to avoid it, however, he collided with the right front.
Janura denies that the two sites that are reserved for the rest of the hostess were sold.
"These sites are not possible to book for long distance connections, they are blocked."
The company intends to sue the truck driver.
The agency will not wait for the verdict of the trial on the compensation of the girl’s family but expects financial expenses also on the part of the culprit.
Reform of the law?
No, for now.
The reform of the law could bring greater precision on the movement of the stewardess on the bus in which thirty experts members of a group of the Ministry of Transport have been working for a year.
“However, they have not reached any concrete conclusions.
They do not dedicate themselves too much to the buses, but rather to the points system, maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile during the march," says the expert.
“The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the flight attendants something that significantly threatens the safety of passengers,” Hanselka said, adding that control of safety on buses is the responsibility of the police and the Office of Safety at Work.
Dusseldorf's hope rests in Frankfurt
In the letter of the board of directors of the West LB bank for its collaborators there is no lack of great words.
Due to the merger of the units of the Dusseldorf bank with the DEKA bank it can be formed 'a central capital market of the financial group of Sparkassen', as it says in the brief, published on Monday
The bank West LB, breaking the ‘competition block’ with sustainable profit capacity would enter such a business.
In addition, such a merger may be a start for subsequent mergers in the area of regional banks.
This is how he comes to understand the text, when a board of directors wants to show the ability to act in hard times.
As before, the West LB is under enormous pressure.
Not only on the part of the European Union, but also of the federal institute for the surveillance of financial services that has recently made it clear to the government of the North Rhine-Westphalia that there is little time left to find a solution.
For some time now, also on the Frankfurt side, there has been much talk of such a union between the DEKA bank, which Sparkasse clients know for their mutual funds, and the West LB.
Indeed, Franz Waas, the head of DEKA bank, presenting the data after half a year at the end of August let it be known that he does not see any sense in the merger of the bank, located on Mainzer Strasse, with a regional bank such as the Helaba or the West LB.
But DEKA’s board of directors, which is now made up of Sparkassen’s regional banks and associations, tasked the board to start negotiations with West LB on common business activities.
This could be a business in the capital market or parts of it.
Of course, the negotiations have just begun, so it is said on the financial site.
It is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the field of Sparkassen appears the name of the DEKA bank with its 3000 employees is among the most important entrepreneurs on the Frankfurt financial site.
In 2003 at one point the situation seemed so that the DEKA bank could merge with the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and with the Helaba.
This initiative to create a union of three parties was left without results.
As soon as the plans were made public, the Hesse government spoke out against Helaba’s involvement in this project.
The other two banks also did not find the same language.
Instead the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate began the dialogue with the regional bank of Baden-Wurttemberg.
But it was always played again with the idea of merging DEKA bank with other regional banks.
But lastly, Guenther Merl, chairman of Helaba’s board of directors, said he was against plans for coexistence with his bank.
Independent of that it seems to be clearer that the union of the different banks in the field of public law is necessary.
Well, when the Bavarian parliament elections are due to pass, the union of BayernLB with the regional bank of Baden-Wurttemberg could make progress.
For the Helaba that is not necessarily good news.
If the pressure to continue merging will increase, Helaba will lack the partners to do that.
In the south the bank could be just a young partner, although so far it stood out much better from the financial crisis than did the properties of Stuttgart and Munich.
On the other hand the Sparkassen- und Giroverband of Hesse-Thuringia, which owns 85 percent of the Helaba, at the beginning of the year avoided plans for coexistence with the West LB.
In any case, only Nord LB remains.
But such geostrategic reflections form are only one part.
On the other hand, it is about the compatibility of the different banking models.
In June Merl asked a fundamental question about a business model that could secure the future for regional banks, to which the deutsche Sparkassen- und Giro-Verband so far gave no answer.
In the end you can break down the West LB, but that, naturally, is not the bank’s own desire.
Thus, also in the letter of the board of directors of the bank it is said that an attempt would be made to find a complete solution for the entire bank.
As you can combine the coexistence between singular parts of the bank with the DEKA, that will show the time.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "the weekend of the Italians"
For Elena it is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth.
But this time, he’s assisted by Elena as his girlfriend, and that’s why everything seems different, he says.
Behind them, next to a 5-liter keg of Kaiser-branded beer is a huge bear tiger that shows nearly 200 Oktoberfest participants what low-pitched sounds it knows how to produce in their throat.
First Elena gives Luca a pat, then a kiss.
From Bologna they arrived in Verona.
From there, from the parking lot next to the Porta Nuova train station, three buses leave tonight at 11:45 pm, 'towards Munich, the beer party', expected arrival at 6:30 am.
Three buses are provided mostly for Italians, one bus is only for Brazilians.
In one of the corners of the parking lot next to their flag are singing the South Americans, they had already begun to celebrate at night.
With a lot of noise, says Marco Guarda, which is nothing for Italians.
Marco, wearing a long coat with an artificial leather lining and glasses with silver sideburns, owns these buses.
For five years they have been coming to Oktoberfest, considering that this year alone there are three excursions.
At night on the road there, during the day in the meadow, at 22.30 round.
Spending the night there means only unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome reception with a Kaiser beer that was made according to the law of purity of Bavaria, health insurance and the guide in German- Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
At night the buses are already on the way on the highway with the direction "Brenner"
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly the tranquility reigns in the bus, travelers are sleeping.
All right, they'll still need the strength.
It stops at Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian registration make another break on motorway 8 shortly before Munich.
Finally, when Marco’s group is scheduled to arrive at 6.30am in the parking lot next to Teresa’s Prado, there are already around 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others meet, Marco has his last speech on how to proceed.
First, wear a yellow cap.
There, on the left side is written "Oktoberfest", next to it in Gothic letter is the page of Marco's travel office on the internet: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: “When the doors of the tent are opened, that means marching!” screams Marco in the early morning.
"March!" March and occupy the back spots in the campaign tent.
“Don’t take the places in front of you, because we’re going to block you, and everyone with yellow caps doesn’t sit on the same bench, spread out over all space!”
A liter of beer, roars Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
Don't forget the tip
Show the security people that we have a good tone!
As soon as he gets out of his place, he will be occupied!”
Third: "This evening at exactly ten-thirty you have to get here!" Do you understand?
And now everyone's going to Oktoberfest.
One, to mark the way, ties yellow caps on trees, traffic signs and even on an election poster of a large Bavarian People’s Party.
You want to be able to recognize the way back.
It is the second weekend of Oktoberfest that is known as "the weekend of the Italians"
There are no exact data on the number of people; it is 50,000 people who make the trip over the Alps and storm into the tents, 10 percent of all came especially this weekend from Italy.
The Munich police is assisted by seven policemen from the Bolzano Autonomous Province, Italian volunteers help the Bavarian Red Cross which makes a statistic of the nations present, where the Italians, with more than 200 medical assistances, ahead of the English (about 60 assistances) and the Austrians occupy the first place.
The Italians' favourite tent of the campaign is so-called Hofbr?uzelt.
Sleepless Nights for Hypo Real Estate Creditors
Germany’s banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peter Steinbruck stressed last week alone.
Good, that the politician used the word "relatively" and added that the German banking sector will also be affected by critical trends.
And that happened after the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), the real estate financier of Munich, which is listed on the DAX index, receives a loan of one billion from a consortium of German banks to be able to resist turbulence in the market.
On Monday, a person familiar with the situation told Reuters that credit assistance amounted to 35 billion euros.
The part of the capital that the Hypo Real Estate is going to use has to shed interest.
The money comes from private banks as well as from those of public law.
The cause of that is the losses of the subsidiary Depfa.
According to one report, state financiers with the money that was borrowed for long-term projects financed them only for a brief period – which is now, because of distrust in the markets, no longer possible.
In the first half of the year, the bank’s cash capital reserve has fallen by 95 percent, 2.37 million euros, and its equity share has fallen slightly from 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Compared to the same period last year, the continued income from financial investments and net profits from financial operations fell to zero, imputation income for debtors and some securities and those from the dissolution of credit business provisions tended to fall by more than 70 percent, by 5 million euros.
Only thanks to the high and high revenues of the reimbursements of the expenses of compensation of the restructuring of the ex-Depfa group as well as the reimbursement of interest under the federal tax code and the businesses organized for the companies of the consortium, the negative balance could charge a deficit with approximately 16 percent more.
After its privatization in 1990, the former state financier was initially lost in speculations with industrial loans for real estate, which served as reason for the foundation of the Aareal bank.
Since there was not much money to be made from the financing of state projects, Defa began to devote itself intensively to projects in the field of infrastructure and the financing of community projects by private and state investors (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and diversified.
Now the Hypo Real Estate has to make write-downs on the value of the subsidiary that will have an “essential material effect” on the group’s consolidated profit and loss account, it is said very inaccurately.
It is a fact that the dividends have been cancelled.
By 2007 they were canceled at two-thirds.
After the acquisition of the Depfa the Hypo Real Estate became a major state and financial financier in the field of infrastructure.
Since the bank does not own the client deposits, it, compared to other banks, turns out to be more dependent on refinancing in the interbank market.
With the bankruptcy of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers, which happened two weeks ago, the granting of interbank loans fell essentially because banks were saving their liquidity.
Every year the Hypo Real Estate needs almost 50 billion euros to finance a portion of Defa’s credit portfolios from its short-term measures for refinancing.
According to the Hypo Real Estate report, the bank covers with a loan the need for group financing for a short time and the company is assured of “the influence of international money markets that are now essentially unfit to function”
Other sources say that thanks to this money the refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, the chairman of the board of directors of Hypo Real Estate, explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not need money markets for the foreseeable time.
The German central bank and the federal institute for the surveillance of financial services (BaFin) start from the basis that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now assured.
That has to wait for the shareholders and creditors of the bank.
But because of the dynamics and the imponderability of the crisis there is no record.
It is even conceivable that there is no need for financing in its full volume.
But the opposite cannot be excluded.
It was said that in the last hour of Sunday the bank was still almost in insolvency, so temporary salvation can not reassure at least worried people.
The share price fell to 75 percent, 3.30 euros.
The loan courses, on the other hand, are really good.
While priority debts hardly change, the courses of borrowing according to the position in the property registry tend clearly downward.
They are affected above all by the loans of the former subsidiary W?rttemberg Hypo and with good reason the loans whose maturities exceed 2009.
After the remarkable growth of the banking crisis and the acquisition of the Depfa that affected the Hypo Real Estate, the current value of its loans that were previously an investment for speculations must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
While issuing banks, governments and banks that are little affected are still ready to support the system, in the meantime you can start amortizing pensions on time.
Or something will happen, which no one risks imagining – the financial crisis is going to overcome in the next 15 months.
But seeing the cross-news about partial nationalization, now the security that is already at its limit became a justified hope.
That’s going to be one reason, because creditors will spend sleepless nights, breaking their heads over the decision about their isolation from enthusiasm.
Still short-term investors can put an end to and use the new account transport of losses for future profit indemnity tax payments on the change in the future.
Sylvana and the secrets of Bent?-Box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop had to show up at Tachibana High School on the first day, the girls started laughing: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word Mangas - in a report on exchanges she counts Japan.
"The first day at a school in Japan.
I was nervous.
Before I went to school, I was scared.
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the Kawasaki direction and I go by train 40 minutes to Tachibana High School.
I just had to find my way, luckily I didn’t get lost.
It seems that the beginning of classes is not set as rigorously as in my home in Lower Saxony.
From eight in the morning the students come, at nine minus twenty begins a small meeting with the teachers, the 'home room'.
Before the class started, I had to introduce myself.
I am also not a person who speaks with pleasure in the public, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since they still have the school uniform I put on an old skirt from my host family’s mother and also a blouse, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Well, that's how I dressed and went to the pulpit and tried to pronounce everything correctly: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - my name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and in a week it will be my birthday.
At this moment I was very happy because I had already begun to study this language two years ago.
All 31 girls in the class have whispered, laughed and beckoned and all the time I've heard the word "kawaii"
I already knew her from my sleeves.
That belongs to the survival vocabulary of Japanese girls and means "cute, cute."
Then I quickly slipped into my place.
The girl next door had a big smile, for her it was an honor that the exchange girl had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was pretty quiet, but when the gong rang, I really felt assaulted.
They all spoke at the same time, laughed and asked a lot of questions – at the same time it is very difficult to understand Japanese English.
Then at recess everyone took out their Bentos.
The mother of my host family also made a Lanchbox for me - it's something other than boring pieces of German bread.
It had grassy rice, small sausages, cucumber and seaweed salad, fruit and something like tofu meat en masse.
In most cases I have no idea what I like here in Japan.
Things are weird and have a new taste.
What is certain is that everything is very rich.
Well, maybe with the exception of prunes marinated in salt, bufff!
In Japanese schools bentos are not simply a lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl prepares a bento made in a very artistic way for a boy and gives it to him in hopes of getting to know him better during a break.
I read about this in my manga comics.
I am very curious to see if I can see it here as well.
“Why exactly Japan?” my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo for a year of school.
Then he always replied:
"Well, because it fascinates me."
I’ve been reading manga for years.
In order to better understand comics and culture, one day I started to study a little Japanese.
For me it was absolutely certain that one day I will travel there.
Also because I have a skinny by tradition and customs.
Here they have great value.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand it is a harsh, disciplined and traditional country.
As everything is well organized, I still didn’t feel lost here even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen in my life.”
Rats have feelings too.
It is said that a rat or a cockroach feeling the danger flees, why is it also afraid?
Joseph Le Doux, the scientist in the field of neurology is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can we control them if they, behaving in the same way as we do, feel the same way?
The contributions of famous scientists have been published in an online magazine called "Edge" for many years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series the chosen answers to the question What do you think is true without being able to prove it?
I think animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it so far, although we can’t even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case at least we can expect it because all human brains have the same fundamental configuration.
But as soon as we dedicate ourselves to other species and include the questions about sensation and in general about consciousness, we enter the unknown realm because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as other animals: it plays dead, runs away, or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from which some scientists draw conclusions about comparable subjective experience.
Of course I don't think so.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to pass on our subjective experience to that of animals.
First, they almost always include the circuits associated with human consciousness of the lateral prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex (because of their involvement in short memory and executive functions that direct behavior).
This large part is much more developed in the case of people than that of the other primates and seems to be absolutely lacking in other creatures.
Considering at least the aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex, including knowledge about who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to assume that even man differs from the other primates.
Another peculiarity is found in the linguistic nature of man: Since most of his experience is linked with language, it often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals can be excluded.
But even though consciousness would not depend on language, it would influence it so that the consciousness of animals, created however, would in many cases differ from most of our states of consciousness.
This is why it is difficult to explain how the consciousness of other animals works.
If that, as something interesting and subjective, does not allow itself to be measured because it has the special hardware, nor does it allow itself to be analyzed through our experiences, then its research presents us with great problems.
Most of my interventions concern the content of conscious experience, but at the same time there is also another aspect of consciousness that would have to be easier for scientific research.
One could investigate the consciousness processes of animals without taking into account their contents, and that is what happens during primate short memory studies, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach that Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, the essential thing happens rather to the neutral correlates of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: The two can be similar or not.
Interestingly this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex for visualization formation.
And what does that mean for sensations?
I owe it to the fact that in the emotional system a part of the brain is activated that is responsible for that, the same as happens with fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a state of mind that we are in when the activity of the brain occupies a space of the defense system (or its consequences such as the reactions of the body).
Seen from this point of view the sensations are very fixed to part of the cerebral cortex which distinguishes primates and above all man.
From the point of view of linguistic nature they follow classifications of fine sensation because we can differentiate and classify the states with the help of words and grammar to be able to describe the states of others to pair with ourselves.
For example Antonio Damascus, on the other hand, thinks that the sensations derive from the simple activities of the parts of the cerebral cortex responsible for the bodily feelings and the brain stem, the same thinks Jaak Pankseep, but concentrates more on the brain stem.
As this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can absolutely refer to different types and their sensations.
For theoretical reasons I can’t go against that, but I consider it unlikely.
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel as fear, possibly that feels in two cases as well: But how can you control whether rats and men behaving in a similar way feel the same way?
Seeing danger, a cockroach flees, because it is afraid?
I am of the opinion that the similarity of behavior does not yet prove the similarity of experience.
That’s true that neural comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain trunks, cockroaches on the other hand don’t have at least one brain.
Is it the brain stem that is responsible for sensations?
Even if it is possible to test it for men: How can it be tested in the case of rats?
I think rats and other mammals, possibly cockroaches too (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how you can prove it.
I prefer to investigate emotional behavior of rats than emotional sensations because their sensations are supposedly fundamentally distinguished from us (because human consciousness refers to special circuits and language).
In any case, progress in the field of neurology is expected here, as long as the same is measured for rats and men.
Since I do not investigate the language and consciousness of rats, as well as sensations, I do not know if they exist.
It can be said that I do not see beyond my nose, but I prefer to advance than work permanently without results.
I am a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Iwan Wasjunik, the deputy prime minister, said the preparations would soon take place under the direct responsibility of the president and prime minister.
“The government looks to UEFA’s decision in Bordeaux as proof of confidence in Ukraine’s ability to host the European championship alongside Poland,” Wasjunik said.
“But that’s not amnesty for our country.
Now the work is about to begin and in both countries there is much to be done."
The schedule for the construction and reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in the host countries is lame.
Possibly the number of stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste any more time.
Now we have to carry out work with great speed," said the president of a Ukrainian association Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA is not going to take our eyes off us."
A more radical step was agreed upon in Poland.
After numerous scandals the Polish Olympic Committee suspended the management of the Polish association PZPN and replaced it with the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The commission met at the request of Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is “a serious danger that the PZPN is not able to follow the rules,” Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we have assured UEFA President Platini that preparation for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer from that."
Only in the last season many clubs of the first division were condemned because of manipulation down to the lower category, finally also the division council had to be postponed.
Dennis Quaid's Indignant Counterattack
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in an interview about private life – and has trouble with her ex-husband: Hollywood star Meg Ryan appointed her ex-husband as an adulterer.
He gets angry and fights back.
The delayed war of the two roses in the ex-partner of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: eight years after their divorce the two Hollywood actors publicly show an unpleasant fight between them.
Last week in an interview with the American magazine InStyle Meg Ryan spoke for the first time about the reasons for the marriage failure: "Dennis was a long time unfaithful to me, and that was very painful."
She knew the size of her infidelity only after divorce.
The reason for the revelation of private things was Ryan's work with the press for his new film "The Women" - a story of the failure of a marriage is told.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to naming him an unfaithful husband was clear: This is “unheard of as Meg tells the story of our relationship in another version,” the 54-year-old told “New York Daily News.”
Among other things, it is very "regrettable" that Jack, her 16-year-old son, will again "remember in public the pain and the changes, everything a divorce means for a child."
While Ryan lives alone after divorce, Quaid is newly married and recently fathered by twins.
And so he ends with his statements emphasizing: “Whatever my life may be, it continues.
I feel happy because I have a wonderful family that is fine.”
Airline and hotel ticket prices are going down
In the first half of 2008 air tickets and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper compared to last year.
According to a current study, plane tickets in Germany became cheap even up to 50 percent.
Air tickets and overnight stays in hotels became cheap again - these are the results of a study by the travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company has analyzed its reservation data for the first half of 2008 and after the price increase in the first quarter found a big change in the second half.
After prices in the hotel market continued to rise for many years, overnight stays in many places became cheap.
Compared to last year, between January and March prices in 41 of Europe’s 48 different cities rose on average to 6.9 per cent.
From April to June prices already dropped to 3.6 percent compared to last year.
Trends were more noticeable in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay less than the previous year.
According to American Express, the reason for that was the weakened dollar course, which was the cause that “American tourists’ interest in traveling declined.”
The decline in hotel prices is also much more noticeable in financial centers such as Frankfurt or London than in industrial hotspots such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices rose to 26.3 percent, setting a record in Europe.
In the first quarter, airline ticket prices also showed upward trends:
Because of rising kerosene prices, Economy-class travelers had to pay on average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long-haul flights even became more expensive up to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, airline ticket prices in Economy class, compared to the previous quarter, fell on average to 12.5 percent, but price changes for Businessclass and Firstclass were small.
In Germany the price change was more noticeable than in other European countries:
From January to February, prices rose to 11.9 percent in the second half of the year, down to 23.6 percent.
According to one study, prices for domestic flights in Germany even halved.
The cause of the change in prices is on the one hand the increase in the weak economy, explains the company.
In many parts of the airline travel market, demand is falling.
On the other hand there is great competition for the Open-Skies treaty that liberalizes aircraft traffic between the US and Europe.
The sign of the tense situation is the cancellation of flights of non-profit distances in airlines, as well as a large number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 declared bankruptcy - only in Europe were 24 airlines.
HSV wins against Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods the SV of Hamburg becomes the leader.
Luhukay of Borussia to him still does not go out to make the eleventh goal.
Kristoffer Klein presented the hard landing of national team player Marko Martin very well.
The Gladbach player started playing late and failed with a goal.
Everything he wanted to say exactly by reacting to what happened, he could read clearly from his lips.
I just knew he was right.
“We need a second goal,” whistled Hermann Rieger in the cockpit entrance of Hamburg’s stadium.
Nothing special happened in the catacombs, the rest time was over and most of those present were back in their places.
Rieger was for almost three decades a physiotherapist at HSV, and enjoys a very great reputation as one of those who were a part of the group.
That's why his request was noticed by a responsible person.
Cornelius Jol the assistant coach nodded and raised his fingers in nod.
Cornelius is the brother of Martin Jol, the head coach of Hamburg.
His order was the same: Wow, the second goal!
But that wasn't done.
“Not everything was pleasant to watch today,” Marcell Jansen later added.
Bastian Reinhard had also wished to have him "more relaxed".
The 1:0 (1:0) result Hamburg have to thank Mladen Petric (11) with his head impact; and also the situation that the very weak Gladbach team could not show all their strength to the weak Hamburg team.
“That was a dirty victory,” Martin Jol said.
This Monday the SV of Hamburg will turn 121 years old.
On Saturday will be the spectators had already celebrated their own, the blue sky over the stadium and the change of table on the video screen.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to play it," Marcell Jansen said.
It foresees that the partial ratings of the table correspond more to the veleity of the league than to the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its late forced players like Brazilians Neves and Silva, goal scorer Petric as well as Jansen who was taken from FC Bayern need time to get together, but still the team cannot shine with its successes.
“We need more of the feeling and the dribbling,” Jol demands.
After the defeat of the vote
Wall Street is spreading fear.
The first news about the failure of the bank bailout package dropped the Down Jones to 700 points for a certain period.
That was the biggest point loss for a day in their history.
Then the Dow Jones rallied a bit.
At 20:30 one of the most important stock market barometers in the world quoted a deficit of 5 percent at 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq, the electronic stock market, lost more than seven percent to 1,548 points.
At this time the biggest loser in the Dow Jones were American Express which lost nearly 14 percent and Bank of America with a loss of nearly 12 percent.
No title could gain in value.
Shares in Goldmann Sachs were down nearly 10 percent.
Just a few days ago a large investor Warren Buffett had participated financially in the company.
The plan of salvation envisages making available resources to buy so-called “rotten” mortgage stocks.
But the sum is going to be paid all at once but step by step.
As compensation for that, the state has to receive stock option receipts for financial partnerships that during course development can be collected to reduce the financial burden of the state’s cashier.
Stock courses in Europe and the US continue to fall
Billion-dollar aid for banks in Europe and the US does not reassure investors.
The course of the shares of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate lowers and negatively influences the Dax.
Despite the salvation of the state-projected financial market, the US Dow Jones Index continues to fall.
The losses of the speculated shares of the Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank caused the German Dax index to fall into a large deficit.
Despite saving actions by the federal government and private banks, Munich’s real estate financier stock one period of time lost two-thirds of its value, the Comerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
The Dax clearly fell below the psychological limit of 6000 points and traded a 3.7 percent deficit at 5,839 units.
All over the world, financial markets have fallen.
The opening of Wall Street in New York began with notable losses.
Investors fear the $700 billion bailout package from the U.S. government may not be enough to boost financial markets.
In the first hour after opening, the Dow lost 334 points, or 3.3 percent, to 10,809.25.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the salvation bill, the Senate vote may be Oct. 1.
Also the other European balls knew only one trend: at first the FTSE index in London lost 3.2 percent, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the Japanese Nikkei main index after earnings fell to 1.26 percent at 11,743.61.
In Hongkong, the Hang-Seng index fell to 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the Sensex index lost 506.43 points, or 3.9 percent, to 12,595.75.
After the announcement of the capital increase Arcandor shares lost in the MDax.
Private bank Sal. Oppenheim underwritten 23 million new shares.
In addition, the commercial and tourism consortium announced that the stakes in the company Thoms Cook will not be sold.
Dark matter influences the trajectory of space probes
For many years a mysterious phenomenon has puzzled researchers: Dark Matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational assistance to maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s Theory of Relativity may not be so correct.
The space probe "Ulysses" spent almost 18 years flying in the universe.
Because the fuel pipes are freezing now it threatens a death in the cold.
For years a mysterious phenomenon, the anomaly during the gravitational assistance to the maneuver, causes confusion among researchers.
Gravitational assistance is a maneuver of the trajectory of space probes during which they obtain an acceleration using the energy of the gravitational field of a planet, for example of the Earth.
That allows space probes to save fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American space probe used this physical trick as did the Sun Ulysses probe.
But what surprises researchers for many years: Missiles don’t behave 100 percent as expected under the venerable law of gravitation.
Rather they frequent irregularities of speed.
Suddenly the probes have higher or lower speed.
Physicists could not explain this effect until now.
They called it the anomaly during gravitational assistance to the maneuver.
Some experts fear that possibly even Albert Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity that describes the force of attraction of matter by the curvature of space may not be as correct.
Stephen Adler, the American physicist at Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study solemnly believes now as before that Einstein did not confuse and tries to explain the anomaly during gravitational assistance with the help of so-called Dark Matter, in what remained astronomers in the universe.
“The reason for the anomaly may be Dark Matter which may also be very close to Earth,” he writes.
Universe researchers have known about the existence of Dark Matter for only ten years.
Supposedly it possesses the force of attraction and its influence can be observed on other planets.
Dark matter, on the other hand, is completely invisible, which means that it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially any visible light.
According to scientists, dark matter makes up at least one-fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Kidnapped tourists in Egypt are free
As Italy’s foreign minister confirmed, after spending ten days in the hands of kidnappers, tourists kidnapped in Egypt must be freed.
The kidnappers of the Sudan had demanded millions of ransom.
Six kidnappers must be killed in a shootout during the release.
Five Germans are kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Negotiations on the bailout have already begun.
The Germans always fall back into the kidnappers’ spotlight.
The WELT ONLINE newspaper tells about the most important cases.
Apparently European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are freed.
The same information is presented by Egyptian state television, the Arabic television station Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
After news of the release on Italian broadcaster Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, the Italian foreign minister, confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages are freed.
"We now monitor his health," Frattini said.
Five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian companions are doing well and are in security, Egyptian state television reports.
The 19 participants of the desert expedition are on the way to Cairo.
What remains incomprehensible are the reasons for a shooting before the release of the hostages: According to the descriptions of an Egyptian security guard the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping, but the Sudanese army had suddenly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to the rescue," the guard said.
It was only about “taking hostages” when suddenly “this surprise” came.
On Sunday, six hijackers were killed by Sudanese soldiers and two of them were arrested in the border area between the Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers have demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money had to be given to the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom", referring to a German mediator, reported that the release was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers intend to free the female hostages after they have received the ransom.
The men had to be detained until the kidnappers had a safe route to flee.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to take the position on this report.
Stepfather abuse "led to suicide"
According to the court, years of abuse by her stepfather led a woman to kill herself.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians in Cornwall, has been sentenced to five years in prison after admitting eight counts of indecent assault.
The Royal Court of Truro, through an investigative study, learned that he had regularly tied up his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confessional paper, "I feel responsible for his death."
The court heard that Randle committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
At the time the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used to tie her up and blindfold her before performing her sexual acts while her mother was working in a pub.
After the divorce in 1980, Trerise returned to live in Cornwall.
His stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Ms. Randle, who spent much of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was tormented by abuse inflicted on her twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife referred to the court what some friends of Mrs. Rande had said of her, that after having been a great surfer and cyclist, she now seemed “emotionally dead,” as if she had “gone out of life.”
In April 2007 his real father, Terrace Randle, found the woman dead in his Plymouth apartment.
Mrs. Rande is supposed to have killed herself by suffocating through a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter’s stepfather, who wrote a confession letter that is concluded by saying, “I used to tie her up and blindfold her.
It was never a sexual assault.
I feel responsible for his death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen replied to Trerise: "You are a very strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been a gruesome experience, especially when you were only seven years old.
This unpleasant saga ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even clearer, it is that if she hadn’t, the issue probably wouldn’t have ended in court.”
“I’ve noticed the effect that Stephanie’s father and mother’s description of abuse had on her daughter over the years.
Clearly she could have had a promising, successful and happy future.”
An officer charged with data loss
The BBC was informed that a Cabinet official who forgot some secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man, on a working trip by the Ministry of Defence, abandoned two highly classified documents on the train for Waterloo.
The documents were passed on to the BBC before being handed over to police.
This is probably the least serious charge under the law and does not imply any indication of intent to commit a crime.
BBC Defence Correspondent Frank Gardner said the conviction had come as a surprise to many in the English administration.
"They thought it was an internal matter between the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is charged under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause relating to safeguarding information.
The Royal Legal Service said the official should be charged by the Metropolitan Police, because of the highly sensitive entity of his work on the Secret Services Committee.
The forgotten documents contained secret information about al-Qaeda and the security forces’ capabilities in Iraq.
The officer was informed of the decision Monday morning and immediately transferred from his home to a secret location.
Building societies face the price of B&B
In Britain, construction companies could face a price tag of more than 80,000 pounds sterling after the bailout of Bradford and Bingley.
The government, in effect, provided 14 trillion pounds sterling to protect the deposits of the bank’s 2.6 million savers.
The interest on the loan will be paid by all companies that use the money of the savers, including the 59 construction companies.
The general director of the Association of Construction Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers it "humiliating" that the societies and their members have to pay
Eventually, the $14 billion loan should be repaid after the Bradford and Bingley mortgages are redeemed.
However, interest accrued in the interim is assumed to be charged each year to the 700 financial companies that have deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies are included in that number.
It is humiliating that institutions that behaved prudently ... are called upon to pay today the price of institutions that have been far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
That is to say that each of the companies had to pay in proportion to the bank deposits, and that the mediation companies had to pay approximately 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to 450,000 pounds sterling in 2009.
This means that the companies will have to recover 81,000 pounds sterling to face the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, managing director of the Building Societies Trade Association, told the BBC that this situation is unfair.
“It is humiliating that institutions that behaved prudently in the growth of the housing market are called upon to pay the price produced by those that were much less prudent.”
According to the BSA, there is no data to indicate the failure of any society since 1945.
“We will need to examine all aspects of this matter in the coming weeks to find out what options exist to protect building societies and their members from what could be a relevant price,” Mr Cole added.
Interest accrued in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year until March.
In 2010, it will be a full year of enforceable interest, which can be almost twice as much.
Being mutual building societies organizations and having no shareholders, their members will inevitably end up paying the price, either through higher rates or lower interest on their savings.
The price of milk rises by five pence per liter
People on the Jersey stand will have to pay more for their milk.
The newspaper Jersey Dairy has announced that the higher price of dairy products will increase by an extra five pence per liter from next Monday.
It’s the second price increase this year, following a two-pence increase in February and followed by research conducted by a consulting firm.
Merchants can decide for themselves whether they want to apply the price increases for their customers.
The last time the price of milk had increased before February was in 2002.
Ex-Bangladesh Prime Minister Denied Bail
A Bangladeshi court has rejected a request for bail for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, saying she can be taken to jail when she returns home.
Proponents said the court did not grant him bail by charging him with extortion of 50 million taka ($729,700) from a businessman when he was Prime Minister.
This is one of several allegations of corruption in his charge.
His longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina’s return to Bangladesh is supposed to be in the coming weeks, but his party, the Awami League, has demanded that the country’s military-backed government first grant him full freedom.
Correspondents say that while she was given conditional release to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear now what the terms of her release are or whether she will be able to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say they will appeal to the Supreme Court against the High Court’s order.
"The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's request for bail on the grounds that he could not obtain bail because he was already on treatment abroad on parole," his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
"We are going to file an appeal against the Supreme Court's order."
Her advocates argued that she needed bail to return home from abroad and prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina should return to his homeland after Oct. 17, an Awami League leader said Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the army-backed interim government took power, but was released in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all charges they are charged with.
Fears for anti-polio campaign in Afghanistan
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan have not taken advantage of a recent polio vaccination campaign because of Taliban violence.
Last week the United Nations carried out a vaccination program in six provinces of the country.
The organization reports that it was unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the South for safety reasons.
A U.N. spokesman said it happened despite promises made by the Taliban that they would not have attacked or hindered thousands of officials while carrying out the vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal challenge on ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge to the Competition Commission following the decision forcing the company to reduce its stake in rival broadcaster ITV.
BSkyB has been informed by the Competition Appeals Court that it will have to reduce its 17.9% stake in ITV to below 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission said BSkyB’s interests hindered competition and allowed its unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought its stock package in 2006 in a deal that effectively blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Anti-Monopoly Bureau reported that BSkyB’s acquisition of ITV’s stake cast doubt on ITV’s independence, and prompted the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
All, including Virgin chief Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and regulator Ofcom opposed the purchase.
BSkyB commented that the requirement to reduce its package on ITV was unreasonable and constituted a disproportionate remedy, particularly because, BSkyB said, it would have surrendered its voting rights.
New Investigation into the Assumption of American Lawyers
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special counsel to investigate the firing of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
The reason was a report in which the Justice Department inspector general criticized the action by administration officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was prompted by fears that the lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Counsel Nora Dannehy is investigating whether officials questioned during the investigation lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
"Serious allegations of possible criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved," Attorney General Glenn Bellas said in the report.
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to compel witnesses to leave their statements.
The argument began when nine U.S. lawyers were removed from their positions by the Justice Department in December 2006.
At the time, the department motivated the decision by suggesting that the lawyers had been fired for underperformance.
But it was later learned that the lawyers had not been evaluated worse than other their colleagues, and many observers concluded that the dismissals would be motivated by political reasons.
Some of the lawyers in question had worked on prosecuting some Republicans, high-profile members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of voter fraud against the Democrats.
These lawyers investigate and prosecute court cases for the government
They can be fired at any time, but not removed for political reasons.
The next head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure from the layoffs, resigned from his position.
A number of other Justice Department officials did the same.
The Attorney General’s report is highly critical of Mr. Gonzales’ role in the matter, underscoring how he had a “primary responsibility” for the layoffs, which he “abdicated” from his leadership position and was “remarkably uncooperative” in the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, Bush's former aide, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
Meat Loaf's epic of honor
Rock star Meat Loaf will be honored at the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will pick up the special award next week at the ceremony in London, said getting this recognition will be “an honor.”
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of Meat Loaf’s 1977 album.
The Coldplay group are leading the nominations for this year’s awards and ranking all four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said, “There are some songs that transcend time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them.”
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires excellent vocal ability like the one used by Meat Loaf.
A nearly two-minute instrumental section opens the anthem.
The song was first known as a single in the UK in 1979 and peaked at number 15 in the chart.
However, Meat Loaf's Bat Out Of Hell remained in the rankings for about nine years and went on to sell more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including surgery for his cardiac arrhythmia in 2003, after a collapse during a concert.
In 2007, an acute laryngitis forced him to cancel some concerts.
It later emerged that he had a cyst on his vocal cord.
Dark city street, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other roads, some famous, others simply service.
However, many people, including veteran taxi drivers and long-time local residents, find it difficult to pinpoint the location of the Extra Place, especially since many of them have never heard of this street.
The small street is located in the East Village and extends north of First Street – before I found Second Street – between Bowery and Second Avenue.
This little alleyway, roughly 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, resembles a dusty alleyway more than one active thoroughfare.
No sign.
It is almost impossible to find in an atlas.
The street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the company that has recently built luxury buildings on Primera Calle
who wants to resurface Extra Place and create a clean aisle to the shops and boutiques that are expected to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include longtime neighbors who commented on being delighted by the truncated lane simply because it is one of the last remnants of the block's past before appropriating the buildings.
However, the city’s Department of Housing, Preservation and Development, which is in control of the street, has no interest in owning it.
At this month’s meeting of the Vencidad Community Committee for Land Use, representatives from the Avalon agency outlined a proposal to buy the street.
However, the committee, preferring the street to remain in the city, called for a new plan to be presented next month, as said Susan Stetzer, the district manager of Community No. 3.
"The city owns very few spaces today and we would like it to continue to own Extra Place," said Ms.
"We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage the space, but we also want to ensure public access to the street."
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that it wanted to repair the small street and install some seats, including some to be used as coffee, in the hope of renting the spaces.
The idea that Avalon could buy the street first came up during this month’s meeting
But Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that even though the company wanted to use the street, it didn’t necessarily want to own it.
“Avalon Bay’s primary concern is the renovation of this abandoned alleyway and the possibility of turning it into a public area,” he said, adding that the sale proposal came from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Preservation Committee, confirmed that it was the city's desire to sell the street and noted that the agency's mission is to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful surroundings, those of the Bowery, Extra Place has left an imprint on history.
Some believe he got his name in 1802, when the large estate owned by Philip Minthorne was divided between his sons and this narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The CBGB’s back door, the punk rock memorial that closed in 2006, opens at Extra Place, but the street is perhaps best known for the establishment’s photography that comes out on the cover of the Ramones album “Rocket to Russia.”
"The setting was magnificent," said Danny Fields, the Ramones' manager, who took the picture in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, pieces of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that public goods, even modest ones, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare, virtually unchanged piece, a slice of the city that should be guarded.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitle, "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), has made available part of a talk of the city's history on Extra Place, published by The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a somewhat narrow and dead-end alley, dark also by day and marked by rusty iron warehouse doors and counter-windows, with old week-old newspapers blown along gutters."
With few exceptions, the street looked pretty much the same on a recent afternoon.
A rat was curated through the back of the street and stood near the door that was used to enter the CBGB and that now houses a luxury clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls and an empty beer bottle of about 22-oz were near a new batch of discarded newspapers.
Some interns said they rarely paid attention at Extra Place, but suggested it might be cleaned up.
Mr Fields, for his part, noted that some people underestimate the attractive power of the street in its current state.
"I spent the best years of my life," he said, "in dark, damp, disgusting places."
The Bilingualism Debate: Immersion in the English Language
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss candidates’ positions on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a longtime associate in California studies and director of studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice."
Effectively calling Hispanic voters is a tough business.
Barack Obama’s education proposals are an example of that.
Mr. Obama’s campaign notes that “African-Americans and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,” and this is a very true consideration.
To combat such differences in learning events, Obama’s education plan specifically advocates, among other things, “transitional bilingual education” for English-students.
However, the open question for Mr. Obama is whether the commitment of bilingual education, which prefers classroom instruction in languages other than English, is effective in undoing the gap in the final results.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an officially recognized elementary school in the eastern region of Los Angeles County.
In this school the vast majority of students are Hispanic and from low-income families:
More than a third of students, many of whom are newcomers, are learning the English language.
However, an incredible 100 percent of fourth-year students have been positively evaluated on the 2008 math test.
and almost equally staggering 93 percent have mastered the English language and arts test.
This incredible success has been achieved using a different ingredient that was favored by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street emphasizes review and practice, constant assessment of competencies and does not tolerate some attitude of excuses.
In addition, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the principal of Sixth Street, the school’s focus for English instruction to students is on “full immersion.”
Immersion in English means the almost exclusive use of the language in the treatment of the contents of the instruction.
Ms. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, “We’ve had extraordinary successes with students like the latter who have come from Mexico and that, if you walked into the classroom 12 months later, you wouldn’t be able to pick up what was.”
"It works," he said, "we think it works."
Will Mr. Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model to replicate for other schools with large Hispanic-English student populations?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubt about the answer, but the idea of his party’s politicians on the issue of education (the Associations for National Education have long been advocates of bilingual education) and his same constant support for obscure bilingual education predicted Mr. Obama’s answer.
While it is that immigrants should learn English, recently Mr. Obama has trivialized the issue by letting people stop worrying about legislation that is only written in English.
and instead, he said, "you should make sure your child can speak Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to improve the system and close loopholes, he should carefully consider education models that work well, rather than scorn or trivialize them.
Oil prices fall sharply after renewed economic fears
The price of oil fell sharply on Monday on concerns that the U.S. bailout for financial markets may not be able to revive the economy.
Crude oil stocks fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel in the morning trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has fallen by more than $20 a barrel since last Monday.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been rocked by the financial crisis on Wall Street and a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.29 a barrel in July, prices had fallen to nearly $90 a barrel earlier this month, before falling back once again due to huge uncertainty in financial markets.
Anxiety gripped investors once again on Monday, despite congressional leaders saying they had reached a deal over the weekend on the bailout, the largest in history.
The news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis would be far from over.
The latest evolution of the merger process confirms that Citigroup will buy the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation, according to what the government said on Monday.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said that over the frenetic weekend, the negotiations that led to the bailout deal “seem to have failed to revive market sentiment.”
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to decline.
“The outlook for global equity, interest rate and exchange rates is going to be increasingly uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
“We believe that commodities will not be able to escape this contagion.
From a products perspective, our most pressing concern is the assessment of whether the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China.”
Analysts at the bank have lowered their expectations for next year, as oil consumption falls due to the crisis in economic growth and the forecast for oil and gas price reduction is 20 percent for 2009.
Second Quarter Madness: Team Sets Record
Having spent, for the past eight seasons, more time than anyone else in Jets' uniform, playing defense, Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen it all.
Then he watched things unfold in the second quarter on Sunday, when the Jets turned a non-scoring game into a deflating game.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second quarter started after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals had played lazily under the bleak clouds.
At this point it happened that quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles making a goal of 12 yards and suggesting the perfect omen for an afternoon, in which the evolution of relationship between the players had a great leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more goals in the fourth, one of these when a cornerback fell and another came in with 10 seconds in the middle.
"I didn't get out of my way," Favre said of all the steps going to Coles.
"He's a devil of a player.
Our communication has been great, regardless of what people may think."
While Favre and Coles were at the dam, the Cardinals' defense beat up quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a walking shot and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith hit another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens was fouled by Warner.
In the last turn, the fouls forced by Bowens, could have been the best.
The Cardinals had taken possession with 10 seconds available, and after the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely kicked it 20 yards to win a final 34-0.
Those are the biggest points the Jets ever made in a quarter.
The coach of the team, Eric Mangini, asked him to describe the madness of this moment, he said: "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When both were answered -- the Jets allowed 21 unanswered points in the third quarter -- Mangini said, "I can say I liked the second quarter a lot better than the third.
They’ve gained a lot of points in a very short period of time.”
Rested Gebrselassie tops his world record
Once again, Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has shown why many consider him the greatest runner in history, breaking his own world record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person capable of running the 26.2 mile race in 2 hours 4 minutes.
After winning a comfortable 2:03:59 in the opener, Gebrselassie broke his previous record of 2:04:26 set last year in Berlin by 27 seconds.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie has set the 26th world record in a race of impressive length so he has set a world championship or world record for any distance from the time trial to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie did not take part in the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect - that air pollution would aggravate her asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up to run in Berlin.
In virtually perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start of the race, 55 degrees at the end - Gebrselassie won this Sunday, using on average a sharp 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners like Kenya’s Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat have become long-distance runners, the marathon record has dropped by more than two minutes in the last decade, as Brazil’s Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday’s victory, Gebrselassie told reporters he had suffered calf cramps two weeks earlier and had missed a week of training.
It is evident that the suspension left it fresh, not rusty.
"I'm very happy," Gebrselassie told reporters.
“Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I had some doubts, but in the end everything went well."
The athlete has been the subject of some criticism - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's Afro-Eastern rival - for the style of orchestrating his careers too much, in general, avoiding the encounter with many stars of the world marathon, based on pacemakers as if it were a race track, and putting the records ahead of the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie's abilities as a runner.
This Sunday, at the march of four Kenyans, Gebrselassie reached the middle of the race in 1:02:04.
Two elite Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, started challenging Gebrselassie after his pacemakers declined.
But just three miles from home, Gebrselassie picked up one last push to break away from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his personal best by nearly five minutes.
Kamathi came in third place in 2:07:48.
In the women’s race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan but now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning in 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in history.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36, came as a surprise and won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She also did not take part in the Beijing Games for what was described as a back injury, but recovered to win in Berlin and set her personal best record at nearly five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
He made a smart calculation run, leaving a quartet of Kenyan and Ethiopian runners to do head-on and then retrieving them after 18 1/2 miles.
Ethiopia’s Askale Tafa Magarsa won second in 2:21.31, while Kenya’s Elena Kiprop finished third in 2:25:01.
In a city apart, the pride and trials of color life
Hidden away by the park’s sprawling theme of big Orlando, a few miles from the bright, noisy, colossal city, lies a quiet town, where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are all too evident.
Eatonville, the first completely black-inhabited city incorporated into the country and childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: “the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 colored men, 300 good swimmers, many guavas, two schools and not a jail.”
It is now a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Fair in Eatonville to pay tribute to Mrs. Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, in many ways, the city she described – making it also a tourist stage by including it in the Florida travel guide produced by the Depression Season Federal Writers Project – remains a separate place.
The city remains independent, dignified, and private as it was in the 1930s, when Ms. Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resist sharing their true ideas with the white man, who “knows so little about us and doesn’t know what he’s missing.”
Even now, in the year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has drawn attention to start a dialogue on the issue of race, many remain cautious in the face of the outsider.
“We’re very cautious about the way our story is told,” said Jones Hortense, 59, a lifelong resident and member of the city’s oldest church.
"It has to be right."
Eatonville has always been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is at the same time a historic model of Black affirmation and a community of nearly 2,400 people living under a poverty level twice the national average.
It is a literary center, but also a repaired example of the rural culture of the Black South - sometimes scorned, sometimes praised - that was born out of slavery in America.
No wonder, if those who reside here are both proud and reserved.
And the preoccupation with Eatonville's image really started with Zora, as no one here calls her Mrs. Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through her profound books in dialect such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in Florida’s guidebook transformed the city, just off Route 17, a highway that runs through central Florida often forgotten in the history of blacks and human drama.
Bearing a cement face both in life and in literature, Ms. Hurston took her readers to the shop owned by Eatonville’s first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then into more private areas.
“Off the road on the left,” he wrote, “there is the modern Maron public school with its white finishes, its well-maintained gardens and playgrounds, tended by Howard Miller, as he can barely read and write.”
She also mentions widow Dash's new husband and writes that Glenn Lee "sells drinks of all kinds and anything goes with transient rooms."
Thus, in just a few hundred words, Mrs. Hurston puts Eatonville in relation to self-government, but also to illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Obviously, this Fodor did not.
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait.
“Zora described it as it was,” said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of the Johnson girls Ms. Hurston immortalized by quoting men singing colorless songs about her beauty.
He added: “Some people didn’t like that.”
Ms. Hurston is still remembered here as a vivacious eccentric who returned frequently after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77, remembers that when Mrs. Hurston arrived in town, she did so without warning in a large Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that still prides itself on dressing with dignity.
Most residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many laughed sarcastically.
“People were always very happy to see Zora,” Mr. Franklin continues.
But, she adds, swaying in her chair in a backyard overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Mrs. Hurston was probably baptized, “she never stayed too long.”
When Mrs. Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were no longer in print.
Like most of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten about her.
Although she was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only woman of color at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had been living.
In Eatonville, there were no large memorial ceremonies, no large public readings.
"I don't think her contribution to the world or her heritage was understood," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography of Mrs. Hurston published in 2003.
A certain turn came in the '80s.
Orange County officials wanted to put a five-lane road through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the labor community’s main two-lane street.
The expansion of the Orlando area had already pushed Interstate 4 across the city’s western edge.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had ended him relatively idyllic isolation from the community.
In the 1950s, the struggle for racial mixing brought hatred about the community.
“During that season, a group of white boys would go around the city throwing oranges and everything at the people sitting next to them,” Mr. Franklin said.
"They killed a girl once, too.
They threw him against a car watermelon."
In a 1955 letter to Mrs. Hurston, she wrote to The Orlando Sentinel, criticizing the forced integration by the Supreme Court that, in Brown v. Board of Education, "insulted rather than honored my race."
Residents say today that the desegregation of schools, positive in some respects, had weakened Eatonville’s cohesion and undermined the confidence of its young people.
“Black kids were used to being hugged – I remember this – they used to hug the teacher in the morning and at night,” said N.Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins’ daughter and executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a nonprofit organization.
This lasted, he added, until the teachers and students did not come from the same place.
“I wasn’t hugging your teacher because I was white – there’s a cultural gap there,” Ms. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped create space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors and artists who passed over prejudices, just like she did, with buoyant, confident and lines like: “How can anyone deny himself the pleasure of my company!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Mrs. Hurston’s anonymous grave and began to struggle to resurrect her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Mrs. Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in bookstores, reintroducing her into American canons.
The road project came just as Eatonville’s most famous daughter was back in the spotlight.
And this time, Mrs. Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community began planning a fair for Mrs. Hurston to show what the county could ruin with that road.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the celebration.
After several years, the county has abandoned its road proposal.
“The resurrected idea of the five-way road would have been to put on what you would call bending speed, a real civic pride,” Ms. Nathiri said.
Mrs. Boyd said it more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road project has helped to change the image of the same city.
Outsiders like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started coming to church here in 1993, started showing up in large numbers, and residents started revisiting the past.
Eatonville entered the National Historic Register in 1998.
A new library (named Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a resurfaced and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still an anomaly in Florida: just six miles from downtown Orlando, you can sometimes feel like a street from the past in a summer rain, in a city as small as the one that was founded by just 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 percent of people are black today.)
Outsiders who come in search of the Eatonville story, of its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A permit in advance is necessary to do most of the interviews, and some things – such as the murals in Eatonville’s oldest church, painted by a white man and showing black men working in the field – cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Mrs. Jones, a brave and convinced teacher who has a weakness for bright red, still fear that her island community might be misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston festival has expanded, a higher level of home pride has also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville the way Mrs. Hurston saw her entire race: beauty, and all problems, not better, not worse, and equally the other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, hardworking, silly, and mixed.
It is a sincere civic sense that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin’s nephew Edwin Harvey, 18, who is planning to return to Eatonville after college to work in local government or by the Police Department, which he said might need some help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
“Most people, in case they dare to go this far, will have to think, ‘Oh, this city is nothing compared to any other,’” Kenon says after going to church on a recent Sunday.
“But if you really stand up and take a moment to look at its history, it’s a very nice city.”
Here in New York, everyone is talking about finance.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the kiosks and giant TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn’t realize they were in the eye of the hurricane.
They could never imagine that behind the glass facade of the honeycomb offices above their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York are faced daily with the worst “bad office day” since the crash of 1929.
Home delivery guys keep ringing their metal tea carts across the sidewalks and carrying breakfast meeting muffin trays.
Latino men continue to crawl between overcrowded apartment buildings, as do human mules, with 50 eccentric print shirts hanging to a yoke across their shoulders. Office workers still wait in line for their morning takeout, and it remains impossible to catch a taxi between 4 and 7 p.m. on business days.
Employees still wait in line for their bagel at the vendors’ carts, and it’s still impossible to find a taxi between four and five in the afternoon on weekdays.
It seemed to me as if there was no crisis at all, until, this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimistic forecasts out there, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had calculated the time needed for the operation to coincide with the calm of the late afternoon at my local JP Morgan Chase subsidiary, a queue of about 20 people was already waiting.
And not in front of the employee’s window, to withdraw their cash or make a deposit, but in front of the customer service bank, where lifelong customers order their checkbooks, tourists look for instructions to go to Macy’s department stores and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people preceded me, I was later informed by Starr, my “trusted personal banker”, and they were in line for the same reason as me.
Unlike me, still, they had already withdrawn their savings from the smaller banks in places from which they had commuted them, places like New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They had taken their money from the so-called savings associations (a bit like a construction society), credit unions and savings banks in their hometown whose branches only work within the state of belonging, and who claim to treat clients as their family.
Over the past year, 15 of these banks have quietly failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went bankrupt, and as New Yorkers headed home Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with a $440 billion savings deposits, was looking for a bailout buyer.
The office and store workers who stood in front of me, fearing another collapse, were moving their money to a bank to what is considered a safe haven, which most bailouts on Wall Street are doing.
Ordinary New Yorkers have become financial experts in recent weeks.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, was referring to Lehman Brothers, the failed bank, and its grieving-looking CEO, Dick Fuld, was commenting on the matter with familiarity as if complaining about a colleague’s inactivity.
And Lyn, fifty-something janitor in uniform in my apartment block, has changed the normal course of our conversations about Brad and Angelina or my shopping to the grocer.
He told me, after my visit to the bank, that “I now have all my savings in money market funds.
The commutation is done, I'm not taking any risks."
Muslim graves desecrated as Austria approaches right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the left wing of the far-right party for Austria’s freedom, and Filip Dewinter from Belgium, affiliated with the far-right party Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization “Cities Against Islamization” in Antwerp, Thursday, Jan. 17, 2008.
They carry road signs depicting mosques with a red line running through them.
Police are blaming far-right extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend that far-right political parties made huge gains in the country’s general election.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged at Traun Cemetery, near Linz, sometime between Friday night and this morning, in what police believe was an organized action.
Criminals sprayed Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David, over some of the graves, but researchers think this may have happened because of the attempt to hide the real motives of extremists driven by hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident was in any way election-related.
A spokesman for the local Islamic Community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the desecration, which reached Muslim religious as the month of Ramadan was ending.
Meanwhile, Austria is gearing up for a round of introspection after the turn to the right in yesterday’s parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that hoarded nearly 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for Austria’s Future, had led a campaign focused on anti-immigration vehemence and some of their slogans were considered xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party that won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against headscarves and burqas, and also expressed opposition to foods considered to be related to Islam.
At his last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a “European brotherhood” to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both parties intend to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they were symbols of the ongoing Islamization policy in Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which have confirmed the far right as the strongest political bloc in the country, indicate that the change came mainly from young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Banning travel abroad for Gary Glitter
Courts have barred Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, from traveling to France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed surveillance authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
Kent police formulated the travel ban last Thursday after magistrates had produced evidence of Glitter’s previous convictions for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at Ashford Magistrates Court in Kent, but was represented by attorney Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: "On Thursday 25 September in Ashford Magistrates' Court in Kent, police requested a provision to prevent Mr Paul Gadd's travel abroad as he did to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd did not attend in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed authorities that he wanted to travel abroad, by virtue of being under the sex offender registry.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
and it is also necessary that you inform the police of the expected date seven days in advance of your departure.
Kent police said they would not discuss the individual case or Glitter’s possible whereabouts in the county.
A Kent Police spokesman said: “Kent Police will do everything possible to protect children in this country, or abroad.
A Kent Police spokesman said: “Kent Police will do everything possible to protect children in this country, or abroad.
“From our point of view, it is easier to keep an eye on someone who remains in the UK because here we have the systems to manage all possible risks more effectively.
“Protecting Kentians is the primary concern of Kent Police and we work closely together to monitor the behaviour of registered sex offenders in the county and minimise any risks that may exist to the public.”
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese jail for the abuse of two girls, aged between 10 and 11.
When he was released Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he took a flight to London.
However, he said he felt ill and refused to fly to London.
Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through passport control and he eventually flew to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted he return to Britain.
He probably arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on 22 August and remained there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Magistrates Court, west London, after Scotland Yard had successfully enforced the order to register as a sex offender.
Glitter had been jailed in the UK for four months in 1999 for possession of child abuse footage.
A Home Office source reported that Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, was reassured and glad to learn that Glitter had been banned from traveling to France and Spain.
"Captured the master out of the scene to extract his character" Gónther Bauer-Photographer
No heels, no frills, no premiere suits.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration on interpretation to get the relaxed look of the man or the woman.
On one side is the artist.
The other, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, in those moments outside the public, when to find the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of a few hands, carefree because they will not go on stage.
The German Gónther Bauer alternates in "Flamenco-people" the theatricality of some stagings with singers, dancers and guitarists with that lesser known side of these masters.
With this proposal, the photographer collects the particular iconography of flamenco from different areas.
Included in the program of Flemish Photography Month, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, increasing every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco-people" can be anyone but, when viewing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists on stage.
These people portrayed "on the street" are artists capable of transmitting passion, sadness, joy... captivating the audience.
To capture the personality of these artists you do not have to take photos of the stage.
They carry their personality and character inside.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the greats of flamenco.
With the flavor of the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer began in 1997 a long journey to portray singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
They are portraits that, due to the selection of the camera and the material, are reminiscent of classical photography.
The application of different stylistic media breaks with the classical basis of the image, giving it modernity, an idea that reflects how Bauer himself understands flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots, that evolves and surprises every day".
It is not the action of dancing, singing or playing itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, that captivates the public with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essential, with the elf that becomes visible in a way of feeling, of being and of being are and have been the constant of this work that is presented these days in the gallery El Fotomata.
Known flamenco figures as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, make up this selection of almost seventy photographed artists.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited in the exhibition.
Bauer’s passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with “Portraits of Veteran Athletes” (“SportARTproject”).
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "I love to portray people, meet them and be able to enter an instant in their life, whether a long or short moment.
I think that within photography, portraiture is the most difficult genre.
You encounter or confront people, characters, that sometimes you do not even know, or that leave you only a few minutes to take the photo.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true.”
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco that is entitled "Flamenco-people" is exhibited in the El Fotomata Gallery, located at number 20 of Calle de la Mata, parallel to the Alameda de Hércules, where it can be visited until next October 16.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "a temerity"
It is set in places he does not yet know and deals with unknown matters, but still, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to carry out the new project in which he works, a novel that has as its protagonist Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and went through the Amazon.
The always favorite for the Nobel Prize in Literature confessed yesterday in his passage through the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that occupies him today "is a temerity" and that "everything indicates that he should not write" the novel.
"If it were sensible, I would not do it, but I will do it and I hope to finish it sometime," he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas, thought and words that for four days has seen pass through the city of the Aqueduct a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the leading figures of the third edition of the word party and fulfilled the forecasts.
Vargas Llosa, who has won the Hay Festival award for being the writer most voted by the participants - an old edition of Dickens's "Our mutual friend" - filled the capacity of the Juan Bravo theater.
Presented by Félix Romeo, he found before him a dedicated audience that was made very short the hour in which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with large doses of humor, reviewed how his literary vocation was born in him, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "pleasure of reading" and "living more than he lived"; how he writes in a "disciplined way" about his "lack of inspiration" with an intense work.
The Spanish-American novelist recognized that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," stressed Vargas Llosa, who said that this "has effects" and "makes people more dissatisfied," so he asked writers "not to abandon themselves to frivolity" and "take responsibility" for their vocation.
The climatology reduces the fair of Pozoblanco that also runs out of corners
The festivity of rejones that closed the fertilizer of the fair of Pozoblanco was suspended yesterday morning, after checking the rejoneadores announced that the floor of the square was not in the best conditions.
In this way, the company, according to Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
The inclement weather has been primed with this fair, since finally two of its three celebrations have not been able to be celebrated.
On Saturday it was rain that prevented the celebration of the second bullfight planned.
The poster was composed by José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who were going to face a lockdown in Castilblanco
Only on Friday was there a celebration.
In it, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and came out on his shoulders, after leaving passages with taste and aesthetics.
That same afternoon Alejandro Talavante left his two astados with greetings and an ear, which granted more to the outstretched than his bullfight.
Of course, even worse was El Juli, who passed through the Los Llanos without sorrow or glory.
In his second bull, after a task of relief he won the anger of a large part of the public.
They skip a control in Álava in a van with two thousand kilos of hashish
Five minus ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the Ertzaintza in the municipality of Armiñón (Álava).
The agents stop the two occupants of a van and they go on the run.
His load, more than two tons of hashish, was not enough to stop.
Officers chased and detained one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old male, identified as A.A.J., the Basque Government’s Interior Department said in a statement.
The arrested individual has been charged with drug trafficking and forgery of a public document.
The incident was recorded when several officials of the Traffic Unit of Álava carried out a transport control on the N-1, as it passed through the municipality of Armiñón.
They were about to stop a van for inspection when the driver disobeyed orders, sped up and skipped control.
Officers began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped a couple of kilometers later on the shoulder, when its two occupants alighted to flee to the race through a wooded area.
The ertzainas finally reached one of them and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The back of the vehicle was loaded with bundles of hashish, so they proceeded to move it to police stations for a thorough inspection and weighing of the drug.
In addition, the officials verified that the license plate had been “doubled” since it did not match the collection in the documentation of the van, so the arrested person has also been charged with a crime of forging a public document.
The Ertzaintza continues with the investigation to proceed with the arrest of the other suspect, who managed to escape to the race as mentioned, and to determine the origin of the seized drug.
The detainee, A.A.J., 28, was transferred to police units to carry out the corresponding proceedings and will go to court in the coming hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of a drug
The actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the series Melrose Place, has been arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the effects of some medication.
A witness saw her perform strange maneuvers while trying to get out of her parking lot in Montecito, a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol told People magazine.
The witness detailed that at about 4.30 pm, Locklear "was stepping on the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the parking lot back and forth, and in reverse went several times over his sunglasses."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who apparently had not initially recognized the actress, saw Locklear stop on a nearby highway and exit the vehicle.
This person was the one who alerted the emergency services because “she was worried about Locklear’s life.”
When police arrived, they found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
“She seemed disoriented,” so agents took her to the drug and alcohol center for a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and the excess alcohol was discarded from the first moment, although "as officers observed at first glance, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some medication."
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of some substance that has not been specified and entered the local prison at about 19.00 hours but was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear walked out of an Arizona treatment clinic where he was recovering from an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian federation of IU to assume its powers in the Silva case
The general coordinator of IU and deputy of Izquierda Unida, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it will be the regional federation of the formation that will have to make a decision on the case of the former councilor of Youth and Sports of the City of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after he was accused of making favor deals with relatives.
"I am a very federalist for these things, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its powers," said Llamazares about the action that the party must adopt with the one that until now councilor in the Sevillian consistory.
However, the leader of IU defended that the need for “transparency” is present in the possible investigations on the irregularities that Silva could have committed: “IU has always defended that these types of matters have the maximum degree of transparency.”
He also stressed that the training has "strict ethical codes for all public positions."
'Blood of May', Garci's epic bet
Inspired by the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous uprising of the Spaniards against the French in Blood of May, which is the most ambitious film in his filmography with about 15 million euros of budget.
In this way, the filmmaker has tried to "illustrate the torrent of characters and social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the well-known novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of a wide cast of performers.
Sangre de mayo, with more than two and a half hours of footage, opens this Friday in cinemas, to become in the future a miniseries for Telemadrid of more than four hours duration.
A great admirer of the literature of Galdós, José Luis Garci claims to have fulfilled this filming "a childhood dream", which should thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid commissioned him three years ago to shoot a commemorative film for the second centenary of May 2 Madrid, something that he accepted as long as the story was based on the National Episodes.
The 15 million budget that the Community of Madrid has contributed in its entirety constitutes for Garci a "unique opportunity" to set with the decorations and the appropriate costumes the portrait of "a foolish Spain that was wrong to fight for, since the struggle for independence led the people to a huge delay with the reign of Fernando VII", he said.
But the filmmaker regrets not having had a financing such as Alatriste or The Ghosts of Goya - more than twice that of Blood of May -, so he has not been able to shoot some scenes embodied in a script signed with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has collaborated in almost his entire career.
Therefore, the director of Go Back to Start, has influenced what is his usual way of working, the staging with the actors, with whom he usually rehearses before starting filming and those who do not cast, for it seems "humiliating" and consider that "part of the director's job is to go to the theater and the cinema to know what happens in the industry in which he works."
Many of the interpreters with whom he coincides in Sangre de Mayo repeat before his camera, as is the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
A four-time Oscar contender - of which he won one - Garci believes that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the May Blood itself, Seven French pool tables and the finally selected, The Blind Sunflowers, do not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema, "which is the one that must be made known," he said.
With this film Garci does not expect awards.
“In the beginning you think you work for posterity, then you realize that you only work for prosperity, and now you settle for making one more movie,” explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabel Bayón recovers the essence of the Sevillian dancer Tortola Valencia
A Sevillian dancer will pay tribute to a Sevillian dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, a Catalan father (Floren? Tórtola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana neighborhood and when she was three years old she moved to London with her family.
She was a free dance dancer and specialist in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, a pioneer of women’s liberation, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was a Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated the abolition of the corset that impeded women’s free movement.
The life of this woman who marked a dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe between wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me and I found it incredible.”
According to the dancer, "we do not intend to tell her life but to collect her spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested flamenco sticks.
Thus, "the dance of the butterfly" suggested me a guajira, or "the dance of the snake" some tangos.
His dance was sensual and I have been told that my dance is also within this aesthetic," he says.
The montage has two exceptional collaborations: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing Isabel again in one of his shows, as she did in "La puerta abierta"; and with the teacher Matilde Coral, who has exceptionally wanted to collaborate with who was her student.
"Matilde plays Tortola as an adult, the character of maturity.
I’m happy that I’ve agreed to perform in my play and I’m very honored by that.”
The assembly also has the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga and Moi de Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of this type of artists who were divas in all their extension, and who are always in love with them."
The work also tells in some way the life of this woman who developed in places as far away, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, as well as throughout Europe, since she habitually resided in London.
“I wanted to remember her because I think she is one of those women who have an enormous influence at a given time and now nobody knows, much less values her work,” Bayón says.
The show will begin today at 8.30 pm at the Lope de Vega Theater.
The publication of the "Diary of a newly married poet" also closes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diary of a Newly Married Poet" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities scheduled by the Ministry of Culture of the Junta de Andalucía to celebrate the "Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium" (2006-2008), organized with the purpose of commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the awarding of the Nobel Prize.
In this way, the "Trienio Zenobia y Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the reissue of this work, with the International Congress that has been held in New York, with the restoration of the House Museum of the Nobel and with the itinerant exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: A poplar of light", which was inaugurated last May and that, after traveling through the different Andalusian provinces, is expected to travel to New York during the Congress.
Likewise, the Ministry of Culture of the Junta de Andalucía has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diary of a Newlywed Poet", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the most universal Andalusian poets.
America likes less without Paul Newman
Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.”
The phrase is from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him on “Absence of Malice,” and gives the idea of the helplessness of American cinema, and of all America, before the shocking idea that Newman is gone.
Look, it took them a while to get an Oscar.
He has been retired since 2007.
And that he was known to be very ill.
Still, it's been a sledgehammer for everyone.
“Sometimes what you feel is beyond expression, and I have now lost a great friend,” cried Robert Redford, “my life and my country were better because of their existence.”
No one was afraid to make a fool of themselves or exaggerate.
A father of cinema and the homeland had died in a particularly dark moment, in fear of terrorists and markets, with American self-esteem on the ground, desperately looking for reasons for dignity.
When time is so hard and without virtue men and very few beings to admire you have left, it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
It embodied for everyone an almost Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was a formal enemy of Richard Nixon and champion of lost and won causes, from the foundation to fight drugs created in honor of his firstborn died of overdose to his brand of homemade and organic food.
A gift to a country that has struggled to overcome a suicidal food culture.
The shockwave of admiration swept Hollywood without regard to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, stated that not a man has died but an era.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was the pinnacle of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
“He has set the bar high for us all,” said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dares to try to live as Paul Newman lived: keeping the requirement of probity high and having a serious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today’s media jungle.
But there are those who try, and Paul Newman is their example.
He divorced once, but then was married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful when he surely had plenty of opportunities not to be.
“But why am I going to eat hamburger out of the house, if I have steak inside?” he used to joke himself.
In heaven he is proud that on earth his daughters coincide with his fans, something not so common in America.
“Of all the great roles he played, none was as proud as that of devoted husband, loving father, caring grandfather and dedicated philanthropist,” they say.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that an Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday’s race, I say no!
The perfect race they called it, and in my opinion it’s been the worst race I’ve ever been in.
A heap of nonsense that, of course, if it were taken into account as an evaluation and I examined it, would be a very clear suspense.
But let’s go in parts and from the beginning.
The nonsense begins with the collection of the dorsal, which makes you have to go before.
Which doesn’t seem bad to me, but if they already make you go they give it everything (including the chip to avoid queues in the race).
Well, no.
Here they only made you go to pick up the number (first nonsense, go only for that) and (after the relevant tail), surprise!, there was only size 'S' for the shirt (second nonsense, because I need a size XL)
What world do we live in?
Or is it that because of the crisis they have decided to buy only small t-shirts with fewer and cheaper fabrics?
Well, things like this are a minutiae compared to race day.
Apart from having to go very soon to pick up the chip, the queue upon arrival is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, something incomprehensible for a race where more than 11,000 people are expected.
Then, as expected, the race began and we had not yet left the backpack, although once achieved, the collection was worse.
In addition, the rain enlivened the wait of more than 40 minutes, which was coupled with conatus of popular rebellion and assault on the house.
I think that about 500 people will surely have pneumonia tomorrow, and some like me will not even appear with the right time in the classification, due to the chip they gave me that, I imagine, did not mark the exit correctly.
Of course, if I were asked about the perfect career, it would not enter my thoughts.
So I think we will continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft looking for receptionist (virtual)
At the Emerging Technologies conference at MIT, Microsoft has shown an advance of a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of Artificial Intelligence without much intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move around the company’s campus) attending to what you hear in the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a form and face recognition system, this “receptionist” can know how many people are in the room, who they are – even remember what they’re wearing – and hear and understand the keywords of their conversations.
Also group those present according to the conversation groups.
In the sample video the receptionist detects a third person but understands that he does not belong to the group that is talking to him and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks if he is there to visit someone and tells him that he will attend to him shortly.
All without a blue screen.
Awesome.
But that, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example in the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week has been talked about well above a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and won’t have as many programs associated with it.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if computers came with the essentials instead of loaded with commercial junk, they would go five times faster – man, Steve, it will be for less.
A finding considering that Microsoft, version after version, has added features and "extras" to Windows.
The change of course is appreciated.
Microsfot is right, the operating system is losing importance, and so is the software.
When Google Chrome came out, I was one of those who joined the theory that it was Google’s first step to compete with Windows.
Many rightly pointed out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the essential layer for the Hardware and Software to be understood.
It performs the same function as your wife or husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never go away, but we must think of the “death” of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but as a relative one.
What Ballmer has said this week is confirmation of this idea.
People pay less and less attention to the operating system, and more and more to the web browser.
The computer is booted only to run Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time browsing than in the windows environment.
What are half of the applications that come into the system for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less, than Vista.
Less heavy, less recharged, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services and that they are finally an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I bring a small example.
I took the photo of this post in one of Microsoft’s employee break rooms in Redmond earlier this month.
On the soft drink machine, a sign asks them to use their search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the web.
Last week, by the way, a delay was also confirmed in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not arrive at the beginning of 2009 but at the end, rather by 2010.
Microsoft will surely be looking for the joint release of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is more and more computer.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the street, is going to take its toll.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Cote d’Azur, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick’s ‘Blood Diamond’, the same as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola’s ‘The Godfather’ and is part of the muscular gay parish uniform.
And if we start to list stellar appearances, we can go back to the image of that forceful pointy moustache that lifted weights in a traveling circus.
In essence, it is nothing more than the typical men's cotton t-shirt, snug and sleeveless.
The 'tank', which the Anglo-speakers call, but le Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles stands out above all others.
First, by its bombastic name - although it is familiarly known as 'Marcel' - which has to do with the sport because it is named, according to legend, the boxer Marcel Cerdan, lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' stands out above the others for its excellent cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive shield and for the small Belgian flag (barely recognizable) that the most emblematic t-shirt models wear as a detail on the neck.
And attention, because the production of the Belgian firm is not only focused on its tank tops.
It also includes college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, marine shirts, babies, mini shorts...
Clothing designed for underwear comfort.
Although it is a shame to leave them as underwear.
They have too much charm.
"I want to be a young mom; the candidate doesn't worry me"
His great resemblance to his sister has not prevented him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Today, the Cruz sisters take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful and famous girls who lend their name.
He has been in Paris in the promotion that Mango makes in its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house sponsors.
Warm and shy, she wins at short distances.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have devised for Mango in this new autumn-winter season, in addition to attending the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner of the Opera in honor of Valentino.
A very intense day, but at the same time exciting.
What is your new collection for Mango based on this fourth season working for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I love the cinema of the 50s and 60s; from there we get many references.
Then, I really like to get lost in a city and watch the women as they are dressed, as they combine and mix their clothes, I do it a lot.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very multifaceted woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end, everything comes together and they have a lot of ties in common.
Since I was little, I liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother’s house to rummage through my aunt’s closets and see her clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, as a dancer, I always tried to take care of how I dressed.
You know that dancers like to make our styles for classes and rehearsals, to look at us in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress when they give you the costumes is when you actually find the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for the designers and professionalism.
You turned 30 not too long ago, have you had a crisis?
No way.
I feel better than ever, I like 30.
I find that woman is made, has experience and savors life with fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn’t scare me.
I have done the things I wanted since childhood and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, do you think about being a mother or not?
Of course, I know that I’m going to be a mother because my body asks me to be a mother, and I also want to be a young mother; I don’t want to miss this.
As for the candidate, I’m not worried.
What I will do is give a lot of happiness to my son and educate him with a lot of love.
As for the film, you are aware of several premieres that you shot last year.
That's right, and I'm looking forward to seeing the light.
I, who am a woman who comes from the theater, I am very impatient and restless, I want everything for now and of course, it can not be.
I’m looking forward to ‘The Last Hour’ and ‘In Search of the Tomb of Christ.’
Thank you so much for...
A few days ago you debuted on a catwalk with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, well, don't say that.
It's not like I'm getting on a catwalk to be a model.
I was simply called by Naomi Campbell, who I have known for a long time, to invite me to go to London to participate in a charity parade for her organization ‘Women for a Better World’ and the clothes we displayed – I took two pieces out of our collection for Mango – was auctioned off to raise money for this Naomi NGO.
People don't know Naomi's tender heart.
So many things are said about her that, I who know her, I would tell you that many are not true.
Besides, I'm left with that good part that she gets involved in.
He asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if he asks me to do the pine tree, well, too.
To benefit the women of the third world, whatever it takes.
Repeated drivers for breathalyzers must install the 'alcolock'
Interior wants the driver with three administrative penalties for breathalyzer, to install in his vehicle a system that prevents starting the drunk vehicle, or if it does not blow.
The initiative was announced last June and is now included in the annual report of the Attorney General’s Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will last one year.
Its purpose is the reinsertion of the driver, so that he will also receive a road re-education course.
In the experience, in addition to the Attorney General of Road Safety, the General Directorate of Traffic (DGT) and the Technological Institute Foundation for Automobile Safety (FITSA) will participate.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists reported more than once for drunk driving retake the car.
The alcolock would avoid it since it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in exhaled air and prevents starting the car if the driver does not blow; or when a concentration of alcohol is detected is higher than allowed.
Its cost is more than 1,000 euros and would be borne by the sanctioned.
In this sense, a study carried out in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduce violations by up to 65% during the first year of implementation.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people each year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: addressing those behaviors before they lead to criminal offenses.
And facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done by ordinary means, and, however, the necessary reform by criminal means requires a reform in an organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial mode, although it has already been implemented experimentally in some commercial and public service vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote tomorrow on an initiative of the PSOE in which it proposes to install this system on school buses, as has been carried out in France.
In Mexico and without "peep-toes"
With British punctuality, at 17.40, the scheduled time in the program, the Spanish air force plane in which the Princes of Asturias were traveling landed in the presidential hangar of the Benito Juárez airport in Mexico City.
The sun was receding but its rays still forced him to use his hand as a visor to watch the royal couple descend from the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
Hours before, he had asked the taxi driver if he knew that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very good, then you can not go to the airport to charge at that time... She is from here or so...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, very good...
But the Mexican press does know very well who the Princes of Asturias are and the importance of the trip.
There are many waiting in the airport hangar next to the red carpet and a military fence formed by 27 marines who interpret the salvo of honors.
The Prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the Princess, mane to the wind, very sober, does not use her usual 'peep-toes', perhaps she had been told that in the DF threatened storm.
They give a smile and a brief stop to the photographers before moving on to the room where the official entourage awaits.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the big four in the city, a reporter from Mexican television awaits them.
Fashion's Best Gifted Award
Possibly there is no place in the world more appropriate to present a fashion award, that Paris and possibly there is no living designer more exquisite and bont live than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of The Button-Mango Fashion Awards, to boost the international projection of new talents in fashion.
It is endowed with a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her designs in the Mango shop window at number 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried with emotion.
By the way, it is the second largest store of the firm in Europe and has just opened with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first is in London.
So many events, together with the desire to thank the designer Valentino who presided over the jury of the contest, made us end up at a luxury dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
With the proximity of the most exquisite Chagals, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango, looked even more spectacular.
Nati, with a broken heart of sorrow and making of guts heart, by the recent death of his brother, put on a suit of the House and some dressings of ELAH, that cut the breath, and of the arm of his son Luis - a cannon of almost two meters in length - he accompanied Valentino in the presidency of his tribute dinner.
Andik, the owner and lord of Mango, did the honors and is such a gentleman that he finished, next to the Baron of Rotchil, without a jacket, because both had lent them to two ladies.
Mónica Cruz, who came to the store with pants and shirt - of her own design - and for dinner she was transformed with a long black sexy dress, was excited when in the night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the ballet rehearsal room and she, remembering other times, grabbed one of the bars and made a look of 'grand fold'.
Inés Sastre did not stay for a walk around the palace, but before that she showed us photos of her son on the mobile phone.
The next morning we could rejoice with the presence of Olivier Martínez - another cannon that moves by motorcycle - and by John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having previously asked, that there were no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh la lla, c'est la vie.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not 1000 but 1000 more ways to forget the chaotic and frenetic everyday life.
And as if that were not enough, they are all gathered in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock almost punishes when it rings every morning at 7 in the morning, but it is even worse to imagine oneself wrapped in the hectic rhythm imposed by current life.
The office is called tension and the computer back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one or two methods to combat daily burnout and problems of disconnection with the world of work.
No, the number amounts to, nothing more and nothing less, 1001.
Apart from the yoga positions, the classic massage or the spa treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together in the pages of a book a whole 'menu' of possibilities adapted to the taste and minutes of each one.
The anti-stress work is called '1001 Ways to Relax' and its calm will reach the bookstores of Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone considers that it is not possible to achieve tranquility in areas such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' belies such a belief.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as being in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline no longer runs through your veins to restore body balance and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, unplug your mind and focus on reading.
Talking asleep
Some children talk at night.
I am not referring to these who wake up very awake telling us something that happened the day before, but to children who speak while asleep.
The first time it happens you may be scared, but it doesn’t really matter.
It’s a benign sleep disturbance called somnilochiae.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure more than one of you have been told that you spoke at night.
This phenomenon can appear very sporadically (once in a lifetime for example associated with an episode of high fever), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the next day the child does not remember anything.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They are often related to other sleep disturbances such as nightmares, night terrors, nocturnal enuresis (sleep peeing) or sleepwalking, but it does not have to be that way.
As we have already mentioned, they can also be associated with very high fever, stress or overexcitation.
It is an understudied phenomenon anyway.
The intensity with which it appears is also highly variable.
It could be that he speaks in a calm tone of voice, loose words, a murmur or the opposite (screams, cries, long speeches...).
In cases where the manifestation is very intense it would be convenient to observe the child and consult with a specialist, to check if there is an issue that is generating a lot of anxiety and gives way in this way.
We have said that it is a benign alteration, therefore it has no treatment, unless it is associated with another sleep alteration that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with sleep apnea or a picture of stress).
What can be done is to take into account a series of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to get the child too excited before going to sleep.
So look for quiet games and avoid programs or TV series that are scary or a little violent.
With children who are very nervous and have a hard time relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them acquire some inner calm.
This will help the child to have a calmer sleep.
Once the somniloquias appear, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember anything that has happened.
Useful tips
Don't wake him up.
It is useless, because he is not conscious, and you will break his sleep.
Even though he's talking, he's sleeping and so he's resting.
Remember that if you are very distressed during several episodes, it is advisable to consult or find out what generates so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not the most common), do not fall into the temptation of asking him for an interrogation to extract information from him.
You will achieve nothing, because when he is asleep he is not conscious enough to organize his thought.
Besides, you will hear what he says, but you do not know what he is dreaming to say that, so be very careful in how you interpret the information and with the conclusions you draw.
Never tell the child that you can interrogate him at night to find out his secrets.
Not even kidding.
That creates a lot of anxiety.
In short, do not worry, it is not a bad thing, it is an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern at last!
The football club, Illhaeusern, finally found the way to victory on their pitch after a long period of scarcity.
Without having made a good match, the team created many chances of goal and was able to score a goal to win the match.
The pace was not very constant during this encounter in which the aggressors had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann skimming the squadron with a shot from afar, Illhaeusern was almost going to take the "power" and by turn Fonderflick from afar, then with Hirn up, Romain with the toe or also Diebold came to prevent the defense of Dannemarie.
In front, we would not let the midfielder pass and left only Riahi in attack position.
The start of the second half was crucial, first with two Riahi and Temporale goals for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhousiens with Marais' goal, well placed to pick up the rejected ball in a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But goal scorer Illhousiens won’t be able to taste his happiness for long and will be forced to return to the locker room a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not take advantage of the opportunity and will not be a problem for the eleven illhousiens who retreated a little to "compress" their defense, except in the last seconds of play during which, after a major spoof, the ball passed very close to the transverse field.
Sarkozy finds fishermen furious
Before taking off for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour around Brittany.
Faced with the manifestation of resistance on the part of the fishermen who strongly disturbed the entrances of several Breton and Norman ports last Monday, the president of the Republic decided to go last Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère, to find there their representatives.
They promised to welcome him “in a constructive spirit” and hoped that he would “come up with concrete proposals”.
This presidential visit coincides with the general meeting of the " crisis committee " created by the Breton fishermen to get measures against the increase in diesel prices, which sets a record by reaching 1.14 euros per liter.
According to Elysee spokesman David Martinon, the president “will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies become competitive again and to save seafarers’ conditions of employment and remuneration.”
Fishermen wait for Nicolas Sarkozy on firm foot.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out operations to reduce circulation in the Morbihan and Calvados, which have caused traffic jams of almost 10 km.
The marina of Quiberon has also been blocked, but connections to Belle-Ile have not been stopped.
" A filtering barrier " has been placed on the Quiberon peninsula.
Sailors on Monday showed their determination by burning tires and wooden pallets in front of fuel tanks at the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the Channel, such as in Les Sables d'Olonne, in Vandea, where the bous stayed in the port, or in Le Havre, where some twenty ships blocked the movements of the trading ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantic region, stopped in the afternoon the blockade of the important Total de Donges refinery.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until Wednesday’s meeting that will take place at the ministry to think about possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the " crisis committee " will have to think on Tuesday about the development of the movement and its participation in the meeting planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by heads of the national fisheries committee, which did not sustain their movement.
"The strike will continue "because " fishermen did not abandon " and " do not want to move to Paris ", announced for example Liliane Cariou, the chairman of the fishing committee of Lorient.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but consider that the financial break-even point of a boat can be reached only with a diesel with a price below 0.30 euro per litre.

The unforgettable performer of “Two Men and a Fate” has died from cancer, aged 83, at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and also Sam Mendes saluted the film legend and engaged actor, Paul Newman, who has passed away at 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecast for 2008
The Brazilian aeronautics company has 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threats of recession that weigh on the world economy.
The world’s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, maintains its delivery forecast for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, said Fredrico Fleury Curado, President of Embraer.
During the first semester, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer relies heavily on the Chinese market particularly to sell aircraft ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
Today, Embraer delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG intends to sell more than 15% of its assets
The insurer American International Group, which has been bailed out thanks to the American monetary authorities, aims to sell more than 15% of its assets with the aim of repaying its $85 billion loan, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is willing to consider selling most of its services beyond its international life insurance and U.S. retirement insurance.
AIG’s board of directors met last Sunday afternoon to examine eventual sales, according to the Financial Times.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets of which AIG intends to divest include its air leasing subsidiary, International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in insurer Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate portfolio and its investments in private equity.
No final decision has been made on these sales, the Financial Times pursues.
AIG must quickly cash in to repay its $85 billion loan granted to it by the Federal Reserve at the risk of seeing the American authorities take 80% of its capital, diluting it with due proportion among the current shareholders.
Analysis of the historic session of the Paris Stock Exchange
The New York Stock Exchange posted a historic drop last Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson plan to save the banks: the Dow lost 6.98 percent, a loss never seen on the stock market of nearly 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14 percent.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell from 777.68 to 10,365.45 points.
In terms of points, the most important drop in its history (684.81 points) had been recorded in the past on September 17, 2001, that is, the day on which the exchanges began again after the terrorist attacks of September 11.
The Nasdaq index, which is technologically dominant, fell 199.61 points to 1,983.73 and the Standard & Poor's 500 widened by 8.81% (or 106.85 points), to 1,106.55, according to the final figures of the close.
Already depressed by the crisis at the beginning of the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the plan to save the banks that would have allowed to recover some stability in the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favor, the representatives denied U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he asked for.
About two Republicans out of three rejected his plan.
“That’s not a good signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"This shows how far the market had come with this plan," added Lindsey Piegza, fearing that a project adopted within several days will come "too late."
“If the project is truly moribund ... the Fed and other central banks will quickly take over (the U.S. central bank, Network No.) to manage the crisis, which would tighten credit conditions further,” said Brian Bethune, head of economics and finance at Global Insight.
And further accentuating the sense of urgency, “every day that passes announces the downfall of a financial institution” in the United States, Ms. Piegza stressed.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual last Friday, authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia’s banking activities by rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis accelerated dramatically, prompting emergency interventions to the benefit of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, showing that markets are facing “not only a crisis in the US but a global crisis,” the FTN Financial analyst added.
The bond market has risen dramatically.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond fell 3.632 percent, versus 3.827 percent on Friday afternoon, and the 30-year bond fell 4.161 percent, versus 4.357 percent the day before.
Obama wins first televised match
The first debate on Friday between the two candidates in the White House was another to know who has triumphed between Juan McCain and Barack Obama.
No surprise, Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this televised duel that has been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen said McCain's performance, while honorable, was not "brilliant enough" to allow him to halt his five-week runoff from the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion poll released on Saturday gives Obama a five-point lead (49% vs. 44% for McCain), judges that it is the Democrat who did well.
Among undecided voters, who count, Obama won with 39 percent of those polled, while 25 percent of them conceded victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll.
Obama could confirm his advantage on Thursday with the expected good performance of his member of the same candidacy, José Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin.
“It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
He has good instincts,” Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
McCain highlighted his indisputable foreign policy experience, underscoring the “naiveté” of his adversary on these issues that were at the heart of this first confrontation.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." he accused on several occasions.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and the knowledge to be president,” he said.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in Republican televised advertisements.
Obama said it represented the future.
Unbewildered, he was concise and precise.
He enhanced his ability to make good decisions, and to restore America’s image in the world.
“McCain hasn’t understood yet, while Obama has already,” a Democratic television advertisement this weekend retorted, blaming the Republican for not having considered the importance of the impact of the crisis on Americans.
“During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama said yesterday in front of 20,000 people who had gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina in heavy rain.
He did not utter the words “middle class” or “workers.” “Financial defeat clearly favors Obama, who is considered by Americans to be the most capable character to save the economy that is on the brink.
“Next week could be a watershed episode,” said influential Democrat Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration member, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
According to the Democratic candidate, the current financial disaster “is the final consequence of eight years of poor economic policy implemented by George Bush and sustained by Senator McCain.”
Reaffirming that he would nevertheless reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite Wall Street shocks, the Illinois senator also pointed out that the realization of an eventual energy independence of the country thanks to the promotion of renewable energies was his first priority, with the creation of a safety and health system.
McCain wants to build a park of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Prudent, both candidates dodged issues that related to the $700 billion (470 billion euros) financial rescue plan adopted yesterday afternoon by Congress and extremely unpopular.
" In Minsk, " Have you noticed the elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents demonstrated last Sunday afternoon in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject in advance the results of the legislatures.
Hundreds of Belarusians gathered on Sunday afternoon after polling stations in Minsk’s central square closed to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislative elections.
While no result had yet been announced, numerous young people had come to demonstrate against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "the dictator, he has to resign".
Some acknowledge not having voted: “for what, since they will do what they want with my vote,” says one young man.
They do not believe that the regime that put a good face on foreign observers in order to renew contact with the European Union is willing to effect democratic change.
Sanctions, including the interdiction of visas for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were deemed clean for observers.
They were not, according to the opposition.
"We have been put on the side of the electoral commissions and our observers were not able to participate in the counting of the votes," lamented Iouri Potemkine, the spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous regroupment of twelve parties.
"It's a cosmetic change," said Alexandre Milinkievitch, a former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, "because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in our house, it's the executive branch.
If some opposition MPs enter parliament, it is because they will have been appointed but not elected.
" But their entry into parliament can mean television appearances, meetings in the regions and proposals for legislation. "
The opposition must therefore get into the political game because " dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which has many debts in front of Russia, goes into crisis, and if we do not reform, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process will not recognize the validity of the vote.
He stressed that the turnout figures seemed too high, and that the generalization of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) favored manipulations.
"Have you noticed the elections?" he asks the social democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one at the polling stations.
And there will be at most five deputies from the opposition to parliament, those who are best suited to power.”
The silence of the night returns again in the October square.
On television, President Loukachenko and members of the Central Election Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
The Interview - Blood Is Safe Again
Héma-Québec celebrated its 10th anniversary yesterday, and its president, Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, because Héma-Québec has once again become one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, it reconquered the public’s confidence that had seriously been wavered by the tainted blood scandal of the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, the national blood stocks administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service have been contaminated by Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
Faced with this drama and public discontent, the government of Canada conducted a public inquiry in February 1994, presided over by Judge Horacio Krever, aimed at clarifying the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and making recommendations so that such a disaster would no longer recur.
While Judge Krever was late in filing their relationship, certain provinces then created a committee that aimed to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee fulfilled this mission.
Following reports from Gélineau and Krever, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Héma-Québec to supply Quebec and the Canadian Society of Blood to supply all other provinces and both territories.
“In 1998, when Héma-Québec began its activities, almost 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec,” Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
Having made many efforts to improve the safety of blood products and much work over the years that followed, we have regained the public’s trust,” he says before proudly stating that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the Quebec population had henceforth confidence in Héma-Québec.
Dr Décary recalls however that "trust is something extremely fragile".
Since its creation on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At the time, we were witnessing the birth in Europe of numerous cases of the human variant of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Décary says.
And we didn’t know if this disease could be transmitted by blood.
Then we rely on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, according to which when we do not know and when a serious disease can emanate from that, in this case the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, we establish exclusion measures.
In April 1999, we denied the blood of people who had been in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
But, a few years ago, it has been proven beyond doubt that this disease is transmitted by the blood.
This episode thus showed us that the precautionary principle that was applied made sense."
In 1999, a much more sensitive technique of HIV detection appeared on the market: nucleic acid tests that allow the presence of the virus and not antibodies against the virus to be detected directly in the blood of donors, on which the tests used until now were based.
Nucleid acid tests allowed shortening the period between when the person has been infected and when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
We were able to reduce this period by less than a week.
This substantially reduces the risk that certain donors will be unknowingly infected and that we will not be able to detect them.
These improvements significantly lowered the risk of contracting AIDS from a blood transfusion.
Today, one person in 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
“That means 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will be more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission by a blood product occurs.
I believe that you can receive or prescribe a blood transfusion today to regain your health without worry,” says the head of the Héma-Québec leadership.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to keep our products safe.
It is never known which pathogen could emerge in the system.
Last year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on Reunion Island, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We must be constantly vigilant,” Dr. Décary says before stressing that in addition to a safe supply, Héma-Québec must also provide for an adequate supply.
“Needs are increasing because the population is getting older.
Since the most aggressive anti-cancer treatments, patients often need an injection of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences for the network of blood donors, which groups on average only 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation. "
All persons in good health, who are 18 years of age and who meet the eligibility criteria, may nevertheless donate blood every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who propose their blood are not accepted, because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they traveled in a country where malaria reigns, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
“With this 3%, we managed to maintain an inventory that covers the needs of hospitals.
The hardships are very rare.
But the members of this donor network need to be renewed as they get older and can no longer donate their blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to donate their blood, but above all to retain them and incite them to be a regular donor.
Since current life is very unbridled, we rarely find the time to spend an hour to donate your blood,” said Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, transformed and frozen before being stored at Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was once considered biomedical waste is filled with a rich blood of stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukemia.
"We celebrated a few weeks ago, the banking of our thousandth sample of cord blood and it is expected to draw more than a thousand of these per year.
We would have to start proposing it for grafts at the beginning of next year,” says Dr. Décary, who describes this cord blood collection program as very popular.
“Many moms are disappointed that they can’t enjoy this,” since Héma-Québec has no resources to propose this complex and expensive program in all of Quebec’s hospitals.
Softball - The Impact in the semifinals
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semifinals of the USL First Division heats, thanks to a 3-1 (4-3 in short ends) win at the expense of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during the second and decisive game of the quarterfinal series, at Saputo Stadium.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After the first goalless time from nowhere, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino created many scoring chances.
Roger Levesque was the only one to upset Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Recall that during the first game of the round-trip series, on Friday, Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at Starfire Complex in Tukwila, in the suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will be measured against the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semi-final.
On Saturday afternoon at Minnesota, the Thunder lost 3-1 in the second leg to take it 4-3, but the Whitecaps nevertheless agreed in the semifinals 5-4.
Impact should face Whitecaps next Friday and Sunday, but details of the series will be confirmed today.
In short – Kovalev’s victorious goal
The Canadian's number-one trio is set to embark on the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn encouraged the Canadian's 3-2 win on barrier free throws against the Florida Panthers last night at Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec accumulated two assists, and Kovalev picked up a pass in this win, the fourth of Tricolor in six preparatory matches.
Kovalev gave the victory by scoring the only goal.
"I'm not ready yet, the Russian warned.
"I need another game to feel comfortable."
He tried to play his best in the first half, Guido Carbonneau scored.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a beautiful ovation.”
Charest takes care of the North
The Prime Minister does not exclude from launching elections before the end of the year
As soon as the general council of the Liberal Party ends, Jean Charest was yesterday in Juan-Talon, in Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), tries to get himself elected during today’s by-election.
Reject the limits of our last great northern frontier”: such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual strength staying in the big lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, were projected images.
They paraded, in three immense screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric reservoirs, mining, Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Major media such as during the election period.
The prime minister thinks that the elections will take place this fall, although he showed that his schedule was very full.
The "Northern Plane" is the fourth side of a "vision" that the prime minister intends to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which comprises an agreement on manpower with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmonies with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the prime minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory to the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister limited himself however to explaining why the North was "a jewel to immense potential", but gave no term, investment amounts, nor precise priority on future projects.
What could above all be more developed are: particularly hydroelectricity, the forest, but above all the mining sector, doped by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructures.
The North contains “nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamond,” according to Mr. Charest’s enumeration.
This "twice large territory like France", is our home, it's in Quebec.
Not only is it our home, but it is in us,” he insisted, as if to show that he was requesting a national founding myth.
Quebec was built a lot thanks to its relationship with the North, he stressed: the flood towards gold in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It belongs to us, it's our future," he added, after pausing theatrically to contemplate the vast map behind it.
The North, 70% of Quebec territory, comprises a part of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister said during the press conference.
“It is a traditional position that all governments reiterated.
There is a border line on which they have not agreed for a long time and, when the occasion arises, I reiterate that position on the part of the government,” he said.
In addition, "with climate changes, we have to rethink our view of the North," he said, speaking of the Northwest Passage, which will open each year due to melting ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister considers that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The prime minister said the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly young people.
Two former ministers who come from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former deputy of the Quebec party of Ungava), have already started consultations around thirty communities.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoit Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important role began some work.
The prime minister does not exclude an important meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a meeting in which "a common vision will be given".
The development of the North would be in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan "will be concerted, orderly and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this “vision” as one that is in continuity with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
" Like the liberals who preceded us, we have thought differently to transform challenges into new opportunities for growth and development. "
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a great cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s arrival to the party’s power.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Central in Adélard-Godbout Reservoir.
“De Godbout, who created HydroQuebec, in Lesage who made the Revolution quiet and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, in Bourassa who made James Bay our party knew how to forge the future,” declared Juan Charest.
At the press conference, he invoked another reference, that conservative one, the "Roads to the North" program of John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
On the subject of the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Mr. Charest stressed that its commissioning is planned for 2012.
“This stays with us, but I expect to be there,” he confided to his militants, drawing applause.
Indeed, the prime minister, who said in April that elections would not take place in 2008 and certainly not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of launching a vote this fall, which the law allows.
He stresses that his schedule is nonetheless full, particularly because of a federation council mission in China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend general council provided the Liberal chief with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, particularly " constitutional aspirations " which had no problem being accepted: the Quebec Liberal Party calls in particular for the recognition of the " specificity of Quebec " in the Constitution.
He also hoped that Quebec would appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that they would have a veto over decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, we welcomed the broad lines of the Northern Plan with skepticism.
Quebec party chief Pauline Marois highlighted the Northern Québec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal government, coming to power in 2003, renounced implementing it.
Had he done so, "we would make progress today," said Ms Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (vote held today), Francoise Mercure.
Quebec Democratic Action appeared to support the adoption of a Plan North by the government.
“But what you want, is for this not to be a fair show,” commented frontman Sebastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returns from vacation today.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
It is Mr. Vic Toews, former minister of "Justice" (oh irony!) in the Harper cabinet, who was allowed last summer to say that Luisa Arbour was a "shame" for Canada.
To dishonor this woman who waged an unrelenting fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration for what she says about the relations of the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper.
We are facing a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated its national who is locked up in the concentration camp of Guantánamo.
It is a government that does not take into account in any way the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the facts that are recriminated against him occurred.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, reneges on its promise and lets a child-soldier live in inhumane conditions.
The only one who cheats with a false justice to evaluate the guilt of the accused.
Let us recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Lawyers Association, in particular, support the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that he may enjoy the benefit of a fair trial in Canada.
It is this government that closes its eyes on torture: it cares little that a young adult is psychologically destroyed, certainly forever after so many years of exactions.
We don’t realize that yet, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom, and our “democracy,” that’s the word Harper keeps repeating and it doesn’t make sense.
The time has come when no morals exist anymore: we can mistreat, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen as the minority head of government so far wants (what will happen after October 14th?).
Many voters believe they will find salvation in a party that commends Virtue, Law, and Order: they don’t see this government giving up what made our country’s reputation and dignity.
Mr. Toews the shame is brought on by this resignation and nothing else.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
In its Sept. 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice president and director of Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold claims that the largest gold company in the world tried a six million euro libel suit against three authors and a small publishing house in order to provoke a “transparent public debate”.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of defamation persecutions, but the law.
No surprise, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Why, according to Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to harm anyone who dares to hold a position contrary to their own?
The outcome of the lawsuit is of little importance, the authors and the editor of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums in order to prepare their defense and to fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers sustained by the almost bottomless pockets of the mining company.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose an amicable settlement that will muzzle the opposition as well as frighten anyone who dares to re-examine the issue.
If Barrick Gold had really wanted a public debate, it is in front of the public that he would have had to present his view of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in several countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are usually made by the change of ideas and not by clubbing.
It was therefore enough for the mining company to open its books, its files and establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and the financing of independent search teams that could have clarified the issue.
But Barrick Gold appears not to trust the public and rejects the petitions and letters of support for the authors of Noir Canada.
Could Mr. Garver possibly explain how he can call for a “public” debate by despising the views of the latter?
According to the vice president, it seems that this word designates only highly paid lawyers and not for all Canadians; that represents a very limited view of the concept.
In democracy, detractors also have the right to speak out.
What he doesn’t understand – or what he doesn’t want to understand – Barrick Gold, is that the public that holds the authors and editors of Noir Canada does so mostly because it rejects the mining company’s brutal manner.
This audience is willing to listen to Barrick and judge him, but based on civilized changes of arguments, and not within the framework of what many people perceive as a persecution-gag (pursuing the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just placed a requirement regarding the authors of Noir Canada urging them not to use this word anymore).
In addition to Mr. Garver’s surreal speech, the Barrick Gold process is a direct attack on freedom of university pursuit and truth, essential to all democratic societies.
It denies the right to cite credible sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which represent the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that displease the rich companies of this world in a country like Canada, under pain of many persecutions, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold truly wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do so by following the scientific standards used by the Noir Canada authors.
You have a right of reply.
The university world, to which we belong, has long known how to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s unconscionable persecution clearly shows that, contrary to what he claims, he does not feel like having a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, but also for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place devices that limit this kind of abusive persecution.
Wall Street rescue operation - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most important economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan that aims to curb the financial crisis that has shaken Wall Street for months has yet to be confirmed by both houses of Congress.
It foresees in particular: a better control on the part of the elected ones of its implementation, of new mechanisms that aim to ensure the reimbursement of the public money invested, of the new provisions to contain the number of houses foreclosed the non-payment, as well as a right of inspection on the salaries paid to the leaders of the companies assisted.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Sen. Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, at the end of a marathon of negotiations that lasted two days.
"We are making great progress toward an agreement that will be effective in the markets," Bush administration representative Henry Paulson said.
“Everything has been done to put the economy and ordinary Americans on the back burner of the current crisis on Wall Street,” she said.
“It’s the bottom line: If we don’t do this, the trauma, chaos, and disruptions to Americans’ daily lives will be immense,” said Republican Rep. Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had ended very quickly in the last few hours because they feared the effect that a new failure in the mood of investors would cause.
The last time they had set themselves was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates in the American presidential elections, who have adhered late to the negotiations, were rather favorable for the agreement, without forgetting however to express their discontent of being forced to reach this tip.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama was granted certain provisions to reach the agreement, particularly that it would allow owners to keep their domicile and that on the salary of the leaders of the companies survived by the state.
" When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is no need to congratulate themselves.
But these measures are necessary,” he commented on American television.
His Republican opponent, John McCain, asked on another network if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied: "I'd like to see the details, but I hope to vote for it."
"The important points I read [show] that it is something that we will have to digest and with which we will be able to advance.
He said the option of doing nothing is not acceptable.”
The $700 billion plan aims to buy up with taxpayers’ money the dubious debts, risk-taking and unsaleable assets of American financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis caused by the bursting of a housing bubble that first led to the collapse of risky mortgage loans before spreading to other more common forms of credit securities (PCAA) and causing a liquidity freeze and a disbandment of banks and financial institutions.
It's a group of elected Republicans who had the first draft deal changed last week.
We believe we have emerged from the impasse since Democrats agreed that certain “toxic” assets of distressed companies are only government-insured, rather than purchased.
In order to smooth over the rough edges for everyone in Congress, we also added a provision that if the government had to take losses for five years with this program, it could impose new rates that would pretend to help it recover money.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first part of $250 billion to which another $100 billion may be added if the president deems it necessary.
The payment of another $350 billion would have to be confirmed by another vote by Congress.
In exchange for his help, Washington will get stakes in the rescued companies that will earn him dividends in case of profits and that he can sell again when the storm will be passed.
The federal government will have the possibility to delay foreclosure proceedings involving homes obtained with real estate loans under this plan, as well as to set limits on remuneration and cash compensation paid to the leaders of companies affected by the crisis.
The architects of the plan would like to see it submitted to the House of Representatives vote today and to the Senate vote next Wednesday.
Despite all your efforts, you are still not sure that your plan will be approved.
Some people continued to protest this bill yesterday, both from Republicans and Democrats.
Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told his constituents that “Washington clearly doesn’t want to understand.”
“We have a very serious financial problem.
There are solutions.
But not the one about profiting from taxpayers.”
Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman, who is an animator for a small group in Congress, presents the problems differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred professors of economics, including three Nobel Laureates, wrote to tell us: we ask Congress not to rush and carefully examine the path to be taken,” he declared yesterday.
At this very moment, in Europe, we again had proof of the global nature of the crisis.
After an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was giving up buying its bankrupt competitor since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion dollars) during the crisis of risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and ten largest insurers.
"This is not money lost," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
Instead, we regain a voting right in the bank and influence.
It is just something that savers and families will appreciate now that times are uncertain.”
During this time, on the other side of the Channel, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank suffering from the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over all outstanding loans at the Bradford and Bringley bank and more than 41 billion euros ($75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it is the one that would buy the branches and bank accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize from the start of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a Compromised Icon
His blue eyes represented his triumph for so long.
Had the American actor with a charming smile freed himself from his narcissistic side?
Yes and no.
His modesty, his sensitivity and a talent that was evident will also have distanced him from the power record that the true sacred monsters have.
But what a great background runner!
Paul Newman, who died Friday at age 83 from lung cancer at his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the hard years.
He is less phenomenal than Brando, whom he closely resembled and who was long regarded as a rival in the cinema, wiser in his game, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the bursting of dramatic covenants.
Mixed bloods often make magnificent children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, to a German Jewish father and a mother of Hungarian origin.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, last mark of quality.
Because in it was projected a whole country in love with the self-made man, the combatant of the Pacific war, wounded in combat, who at the beginning of the 50s studied the dramatic art at Yale, then frequented the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing in the theater, on television and soon in the cinema.
This man who campaigned for civil rights was also the car driver who qualified for second place in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1979, dubbed by a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The secret sides of this secret, discreet and committed star, allergic to the scandals of show business that we do not know very well, also disappear with him.
He is an honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman caused vertigo to moviegoers this weekend, while their big roles clash on the black screen of memories.
More than a half-century of American art in perpetual flux parades through it.
Many memories come back to mind as the charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejects his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the Zinc Roof adapted from Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we evoke his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
Others like Paul Newman have gone down in film history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Robert Wise's Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role intended for James Dean, reprised after his death, that truly launched Newman in 1956.
This likeable mangant in the sumptuous film The Sting, Oscar for best film in 1973.
Bitter billiard player and avenger in the magnificent film The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961), he will repeat the character in The Color of Money by Martin Scorsese, which earned him in 1987 his only Oscar among nine nominations.
This face that changes over the years, was him.
Still him.
Times change during his career.
Young people know him mostly thanks to George Roy Hill's Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans saw him again in 1994 in The Coen Brothers' The Hudsucker Proxy.
With a final role as godfather to the Irish mafia in Sam Mendes’ Road to Perdition in 2003, the curl was curly.
Contrary to several legends of cinema who left quite early in the career, Newman stayed a lot in the world of cinema, denouncing Hollywood, its golds, its fasts and its concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier regarded it, humorously, " as a challenge that lives in " underplaying " and that judges its benefits too supported.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the papers came for a long time without doing anything.
However, he played the role of young heartthrob less often than marginal: neurotics, alcoholics, bastards or desperate, whose features reflected the rebellions.
As a filmmaker, Newman revealed sides of his true pudic sensibility not well known.
His film Raquel, Raquel, in 1968 (according to the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the title role, described a female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott to overdose dedicated his film Harry and Son in 1984, a work of modesty and sadness.
" Among the many tributes that were unleashed yesterday for Newman, his great friend and former comrade in arms Robert Redford (they had worked together on The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very saddened: " my life and my country were better thanks to their existence "
Generosity, love of existence are important traits of the deceased actor.
On the other side of his legendary career, there is also a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a contestant against the excesses of Hollywood.
We will have seen his face reign over vinaigrette sauce cans, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging this method as a method of bad taste, although it began as a gag.
Profits from these sales were given to his Foundation for Childhood in Difficulty.
Newman, rather than contenting himself with his myth, will have committed himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter that contained these phrases: "Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there.”
And a privilege for us to have followed the career of such a lucid and generous American artist.
In short, a model citizen.
What did they produce at the Zuschlag invoice factory & Co. ?
Very soon, on October 8, criminal proceedings will begin against János Zuschlag and his accomplices.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of committing frauds of significant damage, in a business way, continuously and in an organized way in addition to other crimes, including the falsification of documents.
According to the Prosecutor’s Office, they used for their own purposes the funds obtained in the public tenders, justifying on many occasions the fulfillment of the tasks with false invoices.
The public funds and that of the municipalities - in their entirety about 65 million HUF - stopped partly in the treasury of the Fiatal Baloldal organization and partly in the pocket of private individuals.
The method, which was also disclosed by the researchers, was to justify the collection of funds obtained in public tenders with false invoices behind which there was no real execution, the different associations never fulfilled their assumed obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the bills were false.
To do this they obtained the checkbooks in the market of the Józsefváros District and the circular seals were manufactured in the city of Kiskunhalas.
And the question that in the name of which company the counterfeit invoice was to be made was decided among others on that tour of the Upper Region of the Balaton to which János Zuschlag sent István Lados.
The latter confessed that for this purpose he had to choose hostels and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for his consumption and these served as a model to prepare the invoices that they presented among others in the competitions of the Ministry of Youth and Sports Affairs, in the Ministry of Social and Labor Affairs, as well as in the City Council of the Capital.
These invoices were signed mostly by István Lados and his accomplice András’ri, who according to our information rather wrote the necessary reports to obtain the public subsidies.
During one of his "study trips" Sides chose a brewery.
According to two invoices issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and his accomplices, this gastronomic center provided food for a group of ninety people of the Biztos Pont Egyeslet Association.
However - according to the manager of the center - so many people do not fit at the same time in that place.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 for the Jobb J?v?ért Foundation - later called Egy?tt to Harmadik Évezredr?t - was full of formal and contextual errors.
As a hostel in the town of Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms and more than ten people could not stay there in one night, however the bill consisted of one hundred and thirty people.
But the manufacturers of great fantasy invoice also exaggerated when they pointed to the gastronomic center Pigal Kft. because in the bookstore of the same - according to the information given to the Prosecutor's Office - there were no documents in the name of Jobb Jovért and Hoppa.
The company’s manager, Gyuzu Farkas, informed hvg.hu that when he was summoned by the prosecution and shown the invoices, he already knew that these were false documents.
"On the stamp our company name and NIF appeared in the wrong place."
He added: in addition to the formal problems, it also did not agree that according to the bill a hundred people were accommodated, since they have only eleven rooms in which so many people do not fit.
In addition, meals were also included in the bill, while the restaurant has not worked for a long time.
The enthusiastic invoice makers were also not informed that the chosen travel agency in Budapest exclusively organizes trips abroad, so that in the cash payment invoice they foolishly indicated as a service a trip within Hungary, which also did not coincide with the practice of issuing invoices of the agency.
In addition, as was known during the investigation, they included VAT in the document as well, despite the fact that trips outside the territory of the European Union were exempt from taxes.
Among other things, the measure of VAT was also incorrect in the four documents issued by the Hotel Révf?l?p Kft. for the Jobb J?v?ért foundation, since the services of that company are not charged with 25 but only 15 percent of VAT, in addition the hotel employees only extended invoices made by machine however the invoice was manual.
In addition, the "consignors" made other mistakes as well, as in the case of a company in which they put on the bill as an activity carried out by road transport to which - it was known during the investigations of the prosecution - the company founded as an investment consultant does not perform.
Likewise, due to formal differences -inappropriate format of the invoice, false stamp- it was known that the invoices issued to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, to XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyes?let and to Biztos Pont are false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose representatives denied having issued those invoices.
The counterfeiters also did not pay attention to the fact that when the group of Fiatal Városért Egyes-let ate there (2001) the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in liquidation process, that is why the person in charge of the liquidation process - according to our information - denied having issued such a document.
Consciously Issued Invoices
Another group of fake invoice manufacturers consists of those who were aware that they were required to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation, at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, issued an invoice worth about four million HUF on behalf of the Egy?tt Foundation to Harmadik Évezredért.
The manager of Collab Kft., according to the indictment, was convinced by one of the defendants, Ludovic Gyorfi, to issue fictitious invoices.
In the same way, he collaborated with Zuschlag and his accomplices the Biogate Kft., currently under liquidation process, which in 2003 supplied invoices amounting to approximately five million HUF to the Jobb J?v?ért Alapítvány foundation, to the Atlasz Egyes?let association and to the V?r?sfeny? Egyes?let association, with no real economic activity behind it.
There was no movement of capital either, because later they canceled the prepared invoices but forgot to include this entity in their documents.
The next group of fake invoice manufacturers includes those that have some connection with the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was the defendant of the Ukrainian manager of the fictional Delta Trio SL based in Budapest, which dealt with the fuel and vehicle trade.
This company issued numerous invoices amounting to approximately HUF 18 million in October, November and December 2005 on the sale of computer media.
According to the data of the investigation, these invoices were purchased by the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which since 14 September 2005 is under liquidation.
The manager of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov should have also sent the documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued invoices on behalf of the company for the Atlasz, for the Hoppa and for Egyatt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány charging the amount himself.
The Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and the Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian masons at the express request of Ivan Kubatov.
However, none of the companies actually worked because - according to the defendant - they did not receive a job.
But he took advantage of these companies, since at the request of his accomplice the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who prepared the registration documents of the company, they issued invoices in the name of the companies for the organizations linked to Zuschlag: for the Atlasz and for the Y-Generació.
Kubatov on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave a total of 15 invoices to different entities worth HUF 14.2 million.
The Prosecutor’s Office considered that Kubatov received the VAT and 10% of the amount of the invoices.
That man even took advantage of the Szi-Beri limited partnership to issue fictitious invoices used in the Biztos Pont contest.
In January 2006, the Y-Generació and Sz vetség a Modern Magyarországért presented a contest to Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA), a public utility entity of the Socialist Party.
Of the contest they obtained 500 thousand HUF respectively, but they did not use the money for the objectives of the contest.
To prevent this from being discovered, five fictitious invoices received from the Works Team Kft were presented to the TMA.
These were the invoices found during the search of the office that Árpád Kemecsei had at the headquarters of the Ministry of Education.
Some of the defendants will probably recount at trial - just as they did at the prosecution - the course of falsifying the invoices.
The most interesting thing may be the confession of the main defendant János Zuschlag himself, if he decides to dismantle everything.
For his confessions so far have not been very detailed and although he repeatedly promised to talk about everything, this has not been done until the present.
The question is: what is the interest in doing so?, because perhaps in exchange for the return of most of the money - fifty million HUF - the socialists reached an agreement with him so that Zusi will assume all the responsibilities.
Who, on the other hand, for these days could even be offended, since to alleviate his prison conditions he requested house arrest, but was repeatedly denied.
While the numerous perpetrators of economic crimes of far superior value, who never returned the money, walk freely or at least can wait in their own home for the sentence, he has no chance for that.
Overlap psychology: Why do we spend more money?
Auction participants are likely to spend more money and overvalue the product.
Neurologists and economists at New York University discovered the neurological-economic underpinnings of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to the study published in the journal Science, people do not want to lose out in competitions such as eBay auctions, so they prefer to pay even an excessive price.
The scientists tried to establish the neurological scheme of this “game” through experimental auctions.
One of the groups of volunteers played the lottery, the other participated in an auction and meanwhile the active areas of the brain of the participants in the experiment were examined by means of the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) system.
In both games the participants could earn money, but during the auctions, where it is a fundamental element to bet more than the other, losing the game intensified the operation of the complex called stratum located below the cerebral cortex.
This area of the brain, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the “self-prize” mechanism of the nervous system.
Thus, according to scientists, the increase in bets is explained as a prevention so as not to provoke an intense reaction of the stratum.
To substantiate their theory, the economists of the scientific group also carried out a financial follow-up study.
In this experiment three groups bet against one person under different circumstances.
The control group was simply told the real value of the product in question, and its members bet.
Another group was also promised that if they win, they would receive an additional $15 in prize money.
Instead, the third group received exactly $15 before the auction, but in case of losing the auction the members of the group lost even that money.
Thus the only difference between the two groups was that for one the triumph was highlighted and for the other the failure.
However, testing the neurologists' hypothesis, the members of the group who played "against failure" were willing to bet even more than the members of the control group and the "winner" group.
"These results cannot be inferred from any previously existing economic theory.
For those until now explained the phenomena of auctions only with the joy of winning and with the prevention of risks.
Only visual neurological methods helped resolve this contradiction between the two theories, so we now come to a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, a professor at New York University's faculty of economics.
Hepatitis: When should you go to the doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary chronic liver disease is considered one of the leading causes of death.
The number of people infected in this country is estimated at 100,000, but only 7,000 receive treatment because many of the sick do not know that they are infected.
The name hepatitis is the common name for different liver diseases caused by viruses.
The symptoms are very similar; liver infection and jaundice are characteristic, but their pathogens and the diseases caused are very different.
Hepatitis viruses depending on the pathogen are spread by two main forms: food-borne hepatitis A and E (e.g. with water or food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body humors (sperm, vaginal humor, saliva).
Travelers are advised to protect themselves by vaccination against virus A and B, there are no vaccines against C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after consuming the infected food, manifesting through poor general condition, weakness, abdominal pain, and nausea.
After that appear on the skin and in the whites of the eyes jaundice, the stool becomes light, dark-colored urine and healing can last as long as two - three weeks.
One million people worldwide die annually from cancer and cirrhosis of the liver caused by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this disease.
The main reason for this is that according to calculations, only one in ten infected people receive pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: without treatment it can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and even cancer.
Most infected people do not know that they are sick because this pathological agent gradually destroys liver cells and many times the first symptoms only appear 20-30 years later.
Therefore it is very important the premature examination, the systematic medical monitoring.
It is much more frequent in three groups: people who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and those who wear tattoos.
There are currently about 200 million people in the world suffering from chronic hepatitis C.
As this disease can be discovered with a routine laboratory control as well, it is worth consulting with the family doctor when experiencing any unknown symptoms.
The disease has a cure if it is discovered in time, it is possible to exterminate the virus from the body, so it can suppress the infection and prevent cancer.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, which was first organized in 2004 by organizations representing the sick.
It aims to draw attention to the causes of chronic liver infections caused by viruses and the importance of their early recognition.
Does it hurt less to those who believe in God?
According to the result of a recent investigation, religious faith has a calming effect that also alleviated the death of the martyrs of Catholicism.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment: they analyzed that religious belief in how it influences human pain - reported the British newspaper Telegraph.
In this unique experiment, 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists were subjected to electric shock, while all were looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to the technique of scanning the human brain, it was possible to verify that Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for the regulation of pain.
This experiment is the first in a series of investigations in which scientists, philosophers and theologians from the different departments of the University also participate.
The analysis occurred as follows; they attached a sparkling instrument to the patient’s left hand, which applied the electric shock.
The researchers asked experiment participants to fix their gaze on two paintings; Sassoferrato’s 17th-century Virgin Mary and Leonardo da Vinci’s 15th-century Lady of the Ermine.
The researchers had hoped that the Virgin Mary spectacle would provoke a certain religious mood among the faithful, while they chose Leonardo’s oil because it was not too different from the other, and thought it had a reassuring effect.
Patients spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, receiving 20 electric shocks in four successive parts while observing the religious-themed painting or the other.
Catholics claimed that when they looked at the Virgin Mary they felt “safe” as “protected” people, “they were reassured and peace reigned in their hearts.”
When they looked at the religious picture, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they looked at Leonardo’s work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias who also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any image so shocking you can get a similar effect with atheists too, you just have to find the right image.
"We should find the portrait of a person for whom they feel very positively, such as for a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the outcome of the inquiry.
“The exercise of faith should and in many cases does change our personality,” Wright said.
After these formidable results there remains only one question: what effect would it have on the regulation of pain if Leonardo’s Madonna or another painter of his stature were shown to the faithful?
Would the vision of a high-quality Virgin Mary yield even better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On its tenth birthday, Google can say: it can be found both in people’s pockets and in the sky above their heads; it knows where they spent their holidays, which doctors they visit and what they are interested in.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company’s executives, this still isn’t enough.
On the other hand, skeptics who parallel the Orwellian view do not see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main goal is to gather as much personal data as possible about its users, and this is necessary to be able to fulfill the original objectives of the founders of Google: “Let’s gather all the information in the world into one system!”
According to the leader of Google, the company even after ten years of work that stirred the World is still in the initial phase of the effort to be able to treat all the information.
When asked what will happen five years from now, Schmidt said, “I want Google to be able to answer questions like ‘What to do tomorrow?’ or ‘What would be the best job for me?’ – but software won’t be able to answer seemingly simple questions as long as there isn’t enough user information.”
Not all Internet users are aware that during their navigation on the Internet, the searched keywords, IP addresses and pages to which they went when they finished the search are accurately stored.
Thanks for example to Personalized Search that debuted two years ago, users can store their own browsing history, they can re-check what they were looking for before, what they opened and thanks to this history will generate much more personalized searches -on this same logic will be based Recommendations, on which the system will offer products and services based on the preferences previously defined and stored.
What will happen if they take advantage of my data against myself, if they collect information about my activities? - ask those users who worry about seeing the information monopoly of Google.
In most cases rather the potential represented by the company is what can be fearful and not remorse, fear for punishment, longing for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is a fact already confirmed that they not only retain, but in justifiable cases also cede to third parties all the expressions sought, in these cases there is nothing that protects the personal rights of Internet users.
The most debated example in recent times was perhaps the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, when Google handed over to the Brazilian government the information on its website, called Orkut, to identify pedophiles.
Instead, netizens who care about people’s rights in May were relieved when the company along with the EFF, an organization for the defense of electronic rights, successfully demonstrated to the court that it was right in its litigation with the FBI: according to the ruling, Google cannot be forced, by any of the points of the constitution, to supply any type of information secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time the federal government managed to get under the pretext of strengthening the child protection law passed years ago, about fifty thousand Web addresses and about a thousand searched phrases, but without getting the search lists of individual users, nor the complete lists of Web pages and keywords of the last two months.)
So the opinion about Google is quite contradictory: it is criticized by those who fear providing their personal data because they think that their privacy is damaged, their private life when they start using Google services, and they rebel against it as against multinational companies of conservative image.
Meanwhile, the North American geek culture and its enthusiastic followers, Internet users and users from other countries, see in them the future generation, the “avant-garde corporation”, not so their rival, Microsoft, cataloged by its Windows as conqueror of the World, however much both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask users for any identification code, nor money for its applications, the code is open and the free program package, constantly updated and seems more youthful, more collaborative than the practice of the official software giant.
But it may also be because geeks see precisely the very problematic relationship between people’s rights and the Internet that was produced precisely by one of the most mentioned keywords in recent years: Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about collaboration, about leaving intentional footprints behind us and taking advantage of the communication channels available, and while the measurements of these vary individually, the essence remains the same: to show ourselves.
A normal young person can have a profile on numerous collective pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and can even join them with other services, such as Twitter or the last.fm that offers a list of their music habits, then they can include them in a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, they can also have a blog, in which the most recent photo galleries that are stored in the Flickr or in the Picasa automatically appear.
We can know numerous cases from which it follows that for example the bride, seeing the flow of photographs of the next morning of common friends, finds out who her fraudulent boyfriend spent the previous night with or they can dismiss the employee of a company because he writes his sincere opinion on his blog about the direction of the company: one thing is sure, the definition of private life was completely revalued.
A person's "on-line" life is what he shows of himself - this is the definition behind the behavior of today's youth.
And the one who wants to hide something, or at least wants to dodge Google’s monopoly, can do it (starting for example with the Scroogle that uses Google’s search system, but leaves no traces).
There are many people who do not want to register on the collective pages to prevent them from being found, but you can replace Google's "online" applications, from word-writing software to image and news-reading applications with alternative versions which do not connect with gigantic servers or prepare the most perfect possible profile about us.
Public opinion almost expects it openly the day that Google shows its true face.
The company with its current value of $156 billion is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising surfaces threaten the revenue of ad agencies, while services that are being introduced more and more quickly cause serious headaches not only for Microsoft, but also for numerous other software development companies.
Critical observers, however, will find the contradictions alarming as well: for example the top management flatly rejected the employees’ protest after doubling the price of the company’s nursery, deemed the unlimited number of employees’ feeding too expensive, but all this is nothing compared to the fact that in 2006 Google gave in to pressure from the Chinese government and the company under the agreement leaked any information that violated the good morals and interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the internal regulations of the company says that they will not announce any new service in advance, but only when it is ready to work, what is certain is that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years may stir the World: while some believe that the project of scanning and archiving books and magazines of Google will acquire such dimensions that the company will soon be cited by the Supreme Court of the United States, others fear our own health system, because in it we can create our own problems.
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database, will be able to provide a good raw material for the writers of works of science fiction, the Scroogled, novel of the popular Cory Doctorow, describes in Orwellian form that future, in which a man only from the data of Google can be described alarmingly well.
Two minors helped to erase the fingerprints of the author of the double murder of the city of ?zd.
Police questioned two juveniles about the double murder of Ozd who, they suspect, helped erase the traces of the crime - the spokesman for Borsod province's General Police said on Tuesday.
The young women recognized the crime that was charged, and they are currently accused of being the perpetrators of the crime.
The two children - according to information from the Hungarian News Agency - will be able to defend themselves in freedom.
For complicity they can receive up to 5 years in prison.
The defendant in the double murder of Ozd - a 23-year-old man - has been in pre-trial detention since Sunday.
He is accused of murdering several people with premeditation and out of greed.
During the investigations it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed a large sum to a 53-year-old man.
The defendant did not want to pay his debt, so on Wednesday last week he summoned his creditor to the headquarters of a company in Ozd, where he killed him and then also killed the 9-year-old daughter of the victim.
According to the MTI, the young man prepared much earlier to perpetrate the crime, because he committed the murder with a weapon previously hidden at the crime site.
The police discuss with an expert the weapon and the circumstances of its use.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange presented an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros – about five billion Czech crowns – for one hundred percent of the shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange confirmed the offer made by the Poles, even though the Czechs have previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99 percent of the shares are held by the Polish state, which within a few months wants to sell 60 percent of them.
The Czech economic daily E15 reported that the offer of the Poles has been the highest among those offered by those interested in the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, so far the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Boerse have all bid.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange stated last week that among those interested the worst new owner would be the Warsaw Stock Exchange and did not rule out the possibility that with it, in the future the Prague Stock Exchange disappears.
Experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at about 5 to 10 billion kroner.
Under the shareholders’ agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The majority owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with a share of approximately 25 percent, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 percent and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
Major European newspapers in their Tuesday comments on the deepening international financial crisis speak of a “second 9/11.”
The global financial catastrophe is due to the American president - according to The Republic of Rome - the president has not even been able to get the support of his own party for the bill made in haste, whose objective is to give a solution to this desperate situation...
Instead of a new “Pearl Habor,” which billionaire investor Warren Buffett was talking about, it’s more correct to talk about a “second 9/11.”
According to one part of the Madrid press, Washington is the scapegoat.
In El Mundo’s view, it was the mistake of US political leadership that brought the world economy to the brink.
The danger of the collapse of the American monetary system is growing more and more and this will later have an impact on the entire world.
Although Bush’s plan was not perfect, after the congressional vote there is a danger that Washington does not offer a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air – just as one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism takes place.
This threat cannot be ignored - points out the Geneva Tages-Anzeiger.
Some states today can still throw a lifebelt at wobbly financial institutions, thus saving them from bankruptcy with taxpayer money.
But if as the dominoes crumble more bank still, then neither the new funds nor the new improvisations will be enough.
In the long run, EU member states need to put aside their nationalistic egoism and centralize control over fragmented financial markets.
Financial institutions in crisis received more than 100 billion euros on Monday alone - recalls the Viennese Der Standard, adding that concerns are becoming more real that, as Americans did, European taxpayers will also have to pay a lot of money to solve the crisis.
The EU has so far not seriously dealt with the crisis that is passing like a thunderbolt through the Old Continent.
The “saviors” will not have to immediately submit hundreds of millions of euros, but it would be good if they defined: in what cases is it justified to use taxpayer funds to avoid a greater evil?
The smart car mimics the bumblebee's flight
What would be the best method to develop technologies in order to avoid collisions, if not mimicking the obstacle sensors existing in nature?
For example, the bumblebees.
In a surprising project presented at Japan’s CEATEC, bumblebees provided the starting point for Nissan engineers to design the next generation of collision avoidance systems.
Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the nature-mimicking BR23C robotic steering system, which was given the characteristics of bumblebees, with the ultimate goal of creating a system that can dodge all collisions.
During the flight each bumblebee creates its own particular oval space that actually looks a lot like our protective safety capsule - explained in the exhibition Kazuhhiro Doi, CTO of RP and development and research.
They play an important role in the compound eyes of bumblebees that are able to see in all directions at an angle greater than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of compound eyes, the engineers used the laser length measurement system.
It identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C within a distance of 2 meters, at an angle of 180 degrees, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the vehicle’s microprocessor that immediately transforms into a maneuver to avoid collision.
In a fraction of seconds the obstacle is identified, then the robot of the vehicle imitating the movements of the bumblebees, modifies the direction by turning as necessary the wheels.
Unlike any existing system today, this maneuver is entirely instinctive.
“If it wasn’t, the robot in the vehicle wouldn’t be able to react quickly enough to dodge obstacles,” said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Lab and the vehicle robot project.
It must react immediately and instinctively, since this technology corresponds to the inner most vulnerable layer of the protective safety capsule, in a layer within which all kinds of collisions are currently considered inevitable.
The whole process should reflect what a bumblebee does to dodge other bumblebees.
This process should be done in the blink of an eye.
However, unlike bumblebees, the movement cannot be directed up, down or diagonally, but can only be two-dimensional and exclusively in the direction of rotation of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities that exist for bumblebees to dodge other bumblebees, here they only used as a possibility for the robot of the car the rotary movement and acceleration in addition to braking.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy density, meaning they have a longer life span than lithium-ion batteries.
According to Andoh, the important thing is the instinctive and intelligent reaction and not the data processing capacity, much less the storage.
This device in every second only has to process some input signals and react according to the case.
It is not necessary to store this data or react with an instinctive logic based on the data of the previous maneuvers, so it uses only a few tens of kilobytes of memory.
No gigabyte or megabyte memory is needed.
This is the first step in developing the technology to immediately avoid obstacles, which according to Nissan calculations, will be able to be incorporated into mass-produced models within ten years.
Another possibility for its application is to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to his destination, avoiding the existing obstacles in his path.
This dear child already has a name.
The law’s written version of the $700 billion bailout package has been prepared to be implemented in several phases in order to buy bad loans from banks.
Half of the money will be spent in the first phase.
According to East Coast time during the new consultations that lasted until after midnight on Saturday, congressional leaders reached an agreement around the $700 billion bailout package in total, after several days of discussion - Reuters reported.
We have made significant progress - said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic president of the US Congress, stating that it is only necessary to formalize the agreement in a document.
The compromise on the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, the Finance Minister, speaking about the outcome of the compromise said: this program will work and be efficient but more measures are needed. According to Pelosi, it is not about saving Wall Street, but about turning the car of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets, that is, on Sunday before 8 p.m., according to Washington time (that is, before 2 a.m. on Monday, according to Central European time), without causing a spectacular jump in the stock markets.
On the so-called emergency bill for economic stabilization of 2008, the U.S. Congress will first vote on Monday and then the Senate.
President George W. Bush on Saturday night consulted with Pelosi and then the White House also celebrated the news about the deal.
"We are pleased with the progress made overnight and highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
The program is different from the Bush administration’s original proposal to spend all of the $700 billion to buy shoddy credit fund securities.
Now only half of the $700 billion can be spent, using $250 billion immediately after Congress votes, probably on Monday, of this sum the Finance Ministry will buy credit-fund securities, badly rated and the fate of another $100 billion depends on the president’s decision.
This program will be controlled by a special agency, in which the president of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The other half of the $700 billion can be spent after a new congressional decision.
According to the law the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic: it will be able to simultaneously buy bad loans, mortgages and securities of credit fund, in addition to other credits of "poisonous" type as well.
The purchase can be made in auctions or directly - informed competent people of the ministry.
The law allows affected companies to participate in an insurance program where the finance portfolio guarantees the worrying elements, for which the companies will pay the amount corresponding to the foreseeable damages.
Henry Paulson: The law ensures the necessary financial means, which can even reach 700 billion dollars to meet the urgent needs of the American financial system, whether it is the purchase of bad financial means, its insurance or the prevention of risks that could cause the collapse of some large financial institutions.
We do everything necessary to be ready to introduce the law as soon as they sign it - it added.
On the other hand, the heads of the banks who are in trouble and waiting for the help of the State will be able to count on the official limitation of their compensation, which the American slang calls simply a golden parachute.
Only in certain cases will payments be limited, and the limitations depend on the form of help from the Ministry of Finance.
The limitation means that if the ministry buys in the framework of an auction, an extra tax will be imposed on the gold parachutes, unless the bank’s failed boss retires.
By buying the bad loans directly, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the bosses’ compensations are not overstated.
In addition to the above, existing gold parachute contracts will not be changed, the limitations relate only to new contracts to stimulate participation in the program as well.
This is the first case in U.S. history that a legal cap on CEO revenues will be in place, said Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the congressional committee responsible for financial services.
The State will also have the right to acquire shares of the banks participating in the program, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, since ultimately they can even obtain profits with the transaction as soon as the economy recovers and with it the bank.
Under the bill over the next five years, the president will have to submit to Congress a proposal on how to repay taxpayers for financial sector losses.
On both sides, of course, there were those who expressed reservations about the project.
This is not what the American people entrusted us with, that is, they are not protecting taxpayer dollars,” said California Republican Congressman Darrell Issa.
Her fellow Ohio Democrat, Mary Kaptur, said the measures were urged by those responsible for the Wall Street crash.

The domestic sales prices of the processing industry sectors increased minimally, with 0.1 percent compared to July.
The largest increase in the magnitude of prices occurred in August 2008, in the leather and footwear production sector (2.8 percent), primarily due to the 4.6 percent monthly increase in bags and belts and the 2.5 percent increase in footwear.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical base materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in prices for the chemical production branch (1.6 percent).
There was a decrease in price in the petrochemical sector (1.4 percent), in the production of electrical machines and instruments (0.9 percent), as well as - to a minimum - in the wood processing sectors (0.1 percent).
The prices of papermaking, publishing and printing did not change.
In the rest of the processing industry sectors there was an increase in prices between 0.2 and 0.9 percent.
In the supply of electricity, gas, heat and water that represent a significant weight within domestic trade, an increase of 0.3 percent was recorded in the month of August, first as a result of the effect of the increase in official prices from July 1.
In a comparison of a twelve-month period – in domestic sales of the processing industry sectors – the highest price increase was recorded in the petrochemical sector (32.4 percent).
In the metalworking sector there was an increase of 13.2 percent, while in the food, beverages and tobacco industry, of decisive weight, there was an increase of 11 percent.
There was a decrease in prices in the textile industry (2.5 percent), as well as in the manufacture of electrical machines and instruments (0.3 percent).
In the rest of the processing sectors, the pace of price growth was between 0.6 and 9.1 percent.
During the past year in the global processing industry, prices increased by 10.2 percent.
Prices for electricity, gas, heat and water supply topped 18.7 percent the previous year’s prices.
In August, among the different sectors of domestic trade, the largest monthly increase in prices (0.7%) was registered in the investment goods sectors.
In the consumer goods sectors, prices increased by 0.3 percent, in the energy sector and in the intermediary sectors there was no change compared to the previous month.
In August 2008, with respect to the same month of the previous year, the highest price increase occurred in the energy sectors and in the intermediate industry (16.8 percent).
In the branches that produce consumer goods, there was a decrease of 6.8 percent and in investment goods, 1.4 percent.
Industry export prices calculated at HUF increased 1.1 percent from the previous month, and compared to 12 months, there was a decrease of 3.9 percent.
The price of our national currency in a month was reduced by 1.7 percent against the euro and 7.1 percent against the dollar, compared to August 2007 strengthened by 7.5 percent against the euro and 15.9 percent against the dollar.
Will I not need a visa to travel to the United States next year?
Kinga Guncz believes that there is a good chance that the US-Hungarian visa waiver agreement will come into force around January 12 - the foreign minister spoke about it in Chicago, before the Hungarians living there.
“Virtually everything depends on the electronic access and control system being built on the other side of the Atlantic in time.”
At the same time, he warned that in the new system the entry fee will disappear, but tourists before leaving the country of origin must register.
As of today the head of Hungarian diplomacy is holding talks in Washington.
He will meet with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice by handing her the Middle Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary and will hold negotiations with the international policy advisers of the presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favor of the banks’ bailout package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both candidates for the presidency of the two major U.S. parties on Sunday secured their support for the administration’s $700 million bank aid program, but there are politicians demanding the resignation of the finance minister.
Representatives of Congress and the administration, after several days of marathon negotiations, in the early hours of Sunday announced: an agreement of principles was reached on the financial rescue package of the banks.
The financial package aimed at solving the Wall Street crisis and unfreezing the frozen credit market became the central theme of the presidential election campaign.
Both Obama and McCain want to show that they are more capable than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, when economic issues came to the fore, Obama again gained some advantage and the advantage McCain had gained after the Republican convention with Sarah Palin’s candidacy for vice president disappeared.
At a campaign rally in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed hope that Congress would quickly pass the law on the $700 billion package.
He stressed that the proposal includes those points of consumer protection, which he himself supported.
"We have to act now and responsibly (...) it is in danger of employment, saving you also entire industries and the stability of the entire economy" - he told a crowd of 35 thousand people.
He did not miss the opportunity to call McCain’s economic concepts obsolete.
In an interview with ABC McCain explained that "we will all swallow this up with difficulty ... but doing nothing is simply not a viable path."
The Republican senator said that the proposal includes the establishment of a commission of control to the minister of fines and the limitation of compensation of executives, he was the one who insisted on that.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not play any major role in the consultations, instead he consulted daily with the minister.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that Congressmen will likely vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking area
The right-wing group is intact, only that within the group itself became the most conscious voters - says Der Spiegel on the weak electoral result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider and his supporters are ready to govern in Austria to prevent a red-and-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the electronic edition of the German left-wing magazine Franz Walter, in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution devours its parents" he analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU had begun long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber had taken office.
The Social-Christians for several decades were developing in Bavaria - and now it is precisely these modern citizens who turn their backs on it.
The change of an era is at the same time a problem of the whole of Christian democracy, as well as of Angela Merkel.
The failure was not totally surprising for the CSU, but on Sunday a process that was already foreseen for almost ten years was finished: the indisputable hegemony of a state party disappeared.
Ten years ago, in 1998 the CSU gained 47.7 percent, for the first time below 50 percent since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago, in the 2005 Bundestag elections, i.e. even during the much-mentioned Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the consequent modernization of the CSU in the devouring province of its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but at the same time they made a lot of mistakes; however, the secularization, the results of the education and the settlement of the North Germans in the developed regions of Bavaria had their negative consequences on the loyalty of the voters of the CSU.
With modernization, the possibilities are also increased and this also has political consequences.
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group itself became the most conscious, the most critical and the most stubborn voters.
It is surprising that in recent weeks it was precisely the conventional groups of citizens who moved further away from the CSU; the self-employed, the small industrialists, those who have a baccalaureate and the graduates.
This reduced CSU support to less than 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The conservative daily Vienna: "Who with whom?" in its article titled "Party presidents are very secretive on coalition issues" - deals with the confusing domestic political situation after the Austrian elections.
The SP wants to negotiate with the VP.
The VP prohibits the SP from meddling in its internal affairs.
The BZ is open in all directions to negotiate, the Greens do not yet wish to consult on the coalition.
The elections were already held, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, the leaders of the parties barely showed anything of their decks.
Werner Faymann, the president of the SP, confirmed that he wants to negotiate with the VP.
The SPU wants to show that collaboration between the two parties is possible - it already exists in some provinces and social associations.
Fayman left open the question of whether he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the VP, in the post of vice chancellor.
He claimed that in any case they disapproved of the era of Schossel-Molterer.
This political trend cannot be followed.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
He said cooperation will surely not be successful if Faymann tries to meddle in the VP’s internal affairs.
It is still open in the party if they will choose the opposition or enter the coalition, these issues must be discussed without a doubt, within the ?VP itself.
The president of the BZU, J.Rg Haider, was open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition, we are ready to take responsibility for the government," Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities has begun in Paris, its host is France, which this year is also president of the European Union.
Lívia Járóka, deputy of the European People’s Party for Fidesz, in her message to the plenary, as one of the main speakers of this professional meeting, drew attention to segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations that afflict Roma children and is also the greatest obstacle to the prevalence of their interests.
This high-level conference was opened - on behalf of the French presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner responsible for jobs, social affairs and equal opportunities.
The meeting was attended by representatives of governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European organizations for the protection of social rights.
Járóka - according to the press office of the Fidesz group of deputies in the European Parliament - warned that in addition to discrimination in employment, Roma are left out of the labor market in the first place because of their low level of schooling.
“Most young Roma have not finished secondary school and due to the poor quality of basic education, only a negligible part can obtain a university diploma.”
Járóka also stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, has a decisive role in the prevalence of other human rights as well.
Investing in the education of Roma children at an early age can strengthen the economy of EU Member States.
According to the MEP, there is a need to raise awareness of these issues widely among both Roma and non-Gypsies.
For the earlier a gypsy student starts school, the more chances they will have to become an active member of the labor market; through income and consumption taxes they will also contribute to the national budget.
"Gypsies, as citizens of the European Union, must be guaranteed the right to quality education and ensure the abolition of segregated and low-level education" - said Lívia Járóka.
According to the MEP, the objective and active unity of the European Union is necessary to immediately accelerate the processes of school desegregation, for that it is of fundamental importance the correct compliance with the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, we must offer Roma children the possibility that guarantees the democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens" - demanded Járóka.
The objective of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, organised annually since last year’s Berlin meeting under the banner of the “European Year of Equal Opportunities”, is to ensure a unique forum to promote the abolition of discrimination and equal opportunities at European level and at Member State level.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
At the end of October, a decision will be made on the fate of the failed duo Huber-Beckstein.
Despite the serious electoral defeat, heads have not yet been cut off at the tops of the Bavarian CSU, so far the debate on personal issues has been postponed.
Erwin Huber, the party’s chairman, and Guenther Beckstein, the provincial prime minister, remain in their posts, but it is not known how long the grace will last.
The fate of the duo, which suffered a catastrophic 17 percent electoral defeat, will be decided at the party’s extraordinary congress to be held the last weekend of October.
The members of the much criticized duo hinted: they do not cling so much to their positions.
This was intended to reassure the angry members of his parliamentary group and his grassroots organization, who a day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences due to the loss of an absolute majority.
Five years ago – although under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber who was at the peak of his career – the Christian social union reached 60.7 percent, instead now, a year after the heisted coup against Stoiber, they got only 43.4 percent.
The CSU for 46 years had "monopoly" in Bavaria that gives 18 percent of German GDP.
Although in the southern province, of key importance to the Hungarian economy, conservatives continue to predominate, in the future they will undoubtedly have to make a coalition with someone.
As a first sign of the party’s restructuring, Vice President Horst Seehofer, federal minister of agriculture, one of Huber’s possible successors, also holds a seat in the small intelligence group that begins negotiations with the liberal FDP and the right-wing Free Electors over a possible government coalition in Munich.
The strange thing about fate is that in the list of the Free Electors enters the parliament that Gabriele Pauli, whose performance against Stoiber was exploited for the coup of the duo Huber-Beckstein and then cruelly erased from the stage the ambitious local politics.
The CSU’s top leaders are now investing all their energies to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition will receive an active role Stoiber also that until now was moving the strings in the background, the former provincial head of government and former president of the CSU qualified September 28 as the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday Huber made some critical remarks to the CDU, in his opinion they would have deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and to Angela Merkel herself as well.
After the September 2009 elections of the Bundestag, Merkel will not be able to be chancellor if they are not able to enhance together the CSU that played a momentous role in the successes of the 2005 national elections.
According to Merkel, who could barely hide her disappointment at the failure, the CSU’s losses will not have a negative impact on the Berlin grand coalition.
This is of course relative: it will not be easier to deal with the wounded CSU and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
The SPD with its 18.6 percent achieved its worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
Lukashenko's opposition: 110-0
Following Sunday’s elections, there will be no opposition MPs in the Belarusian parliament.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by the well-being and stability that Alexandr Lukashenko guarantees in the country, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained rather by the violations of the law committed during the vote count.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election result.
Although the country’s legislature of 10 million people, made up of 100 million and 10 deputies, has been unopposed for more than a decade, before yesterday’s elections the united opposition under the name of United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) hoped that Lukashenko, who for the fourth time renewed his mandate after the 2006 elections of dubious legitimacy, as a result of the amendment of the Constitution this time would “allow” the entry of some deputies of the opposition.
Thus ODSZ suppressed the boycott it originally wanted to do.
At the heart of the opposition’s expectations was that Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia – which took credit for moderating Russia’s increasingly expensive natural gas import and contributed to Russia’s sale of the Beltransgaz, owner of the gas pipeline passing through the country – wished to improve its relations with the European Union, which does not give Lukashenko and other high-level politicians permission to enter because it has an anti-democratic regime.
It was a sign of détente when the OSCE, in evaluating the election campaign, placed more emphasis on positive phenomena and not on mistakes – such as the ban on participation imposed on one-third of opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE’s primary report on Monday criticized even the campaign itself – in which opposition candidates could not appear in the press – and especially that the opposition could not be present in the vote count.
With all this in the opinion of the opposition there is an improvement in the political climate: the political prisoners were released and Minsk is willing to a small confrontation with Moscow, denying the recognition of the separation of South Ossetia and Abhasia from Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus theoretically constitutes a federal state - already a month ago that considers the two regions as independent.
- We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has begun - Alexandr Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable to maintain this situation, despite the fact that “the regime fears allowing even one opponent into that weightless parliament.”
The opposition does not plan to organize protest demonstrations when they see the results, but rather tries to get the message to voters about the need for economic reforms.
- This clearly causes us many problems because we must print the opposition press in Russia, the local authorities are struggling with its distribution, but even so I see that there are more and more those who support the change among the adults as well - said Milinkevich, alluding to the fact that the Lukashenko regime, which believes that its main result is the creation of social security, is not considered adequate even by the retired, who are officially the most subsidized.
Due to the indebtedness of the country and the increase in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time the decomposition of social security that "looks like the silence of cemeteries" - opined Milinkevich.
Russian observers, unlike the opposition politician, described the elections as democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told Russia’s Ria Novosti news agency: “People don’t believe in words but in deeds,” so the lack of opposition is nothing more than testimony to the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on you have breakfast before you start working"
It has never happened in the history of Chigi Palace that they put automatic doors to control the entry and exit of personnel.
but from today begins with this measure against who signs and then goes to the bar to have a coffee during working hours.
This novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta and by the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"Automatic doors - Brunetta says - are an instrument to work better, with greater productivity, more presence and more services" the minister specifies.
“Now a new season of accountability and transparency opens.
This is Reformism,” Brunetta stresses again.
The Chigi Palace completes the installation in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of automatic doors is also important from the symbolic point of view".
No resistance has been found on the part of the employees, says the general secretary: "it has been a change shared by the workers and there was the collaboration of them".
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee and crescents.
Brunetta’s word, which suggests, smiling, “a good cappuccino at 7 o’clock in the morning is a holy hand.”
During a convention at the Higher School of Public Administration
In three months, absences due to illness of public employees have been reduced by 50%, which means 60,000 more people to work in a year.
And he adds that it is necessary to render the Public Administration more effective
The Italian minister explains that “wage dynamics in the last 8-10 years have been double in relation to the private sector and well above the inflation rate”.
By now millions of public employees have joined to oppose the rules of the Brunetta decree adhering to the petition supported by the Codacons.
"While the minister of the Civil Service shows the numbers, the absence of work due to illness - writes the association of consumators - the people of the 'lazy workers' is continuously increasing.
Millions in Italy are indeed the right and productive employees of the public administration who have joined together to declare war on the illegitimate norms of the decree."
In particular, in the Tar the exclusion of economic treatments added due to illness due to service; the extension of the hourly belts in which the medical control visits of the sick employee are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions willed by the minister.
Workplace Accidents, Napolitano: "Crucial Prevention"
Every day in Italy, 2,500 accidents are verified at work, 3 people die and 27 are permanently invalid.
As of 2007, the Inail data effectively confirms that white deaths have been approximately 1,200.
Figures that testify to the seriousness of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths compared to homicides.
To draw the attention of the institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic issue, today the Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th national day for the victims of accidents at work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data disseminated by the Anmil and the same tragic news of these days confirm how crucial is the issue of prevention at work," said President Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the president of the Anmil, National Association mutilated and disabled by work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his "great appreciation for the constant efforts of associations in favor of prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, assistance to the families of the victims and awareness of public opinion."
"It has been manifested, a 'enough', sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, due to their dimensions, arouse the clamor of the media and the participation of public opinion, instead the daily reality proposes dramatic cases, even repeated in its dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly a problem of resources: it is decisive to invest in training and information.
The numerous initiatives promoted in the school environment for a more direct awareness on the part of young people entering the world of work take particular significance.
It is a duty to keep the attention alive to the phenomenon, not to stop the alarm about the social gravity, to apply and improve the legislative norms.
For his part, the president of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini stressed "how the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each one of us and imposes on all institutions a determined commitment to put an end urgently."
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not mean that the number of white deaths is equally impressive," said the president of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
We do not want this “decreasing tendency” to translate into less attention, because it is precisely when attention diminishes that tragedy explodes.
“We believe that at a general level too little is still done to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the remedy can be exercised through multiple actions.
They are necessary, in our opinion - it has emphasized Mercandelli - greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of the workers, and this starting from the world of the school".
"It serves a further effort - it has added - insofar as it concerns the communication and the sensitization of the public opinion.
But above all, there is a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that represents a social emergency.”
Mercandelli has denounced "the progressive deterioration of the level of subsidiary guardianship foreseen for the victims of work" and the "assistance derivation towards which the system is heading in recent years".
"The objective is to restore to the worker the guarantee of insurance - it has added - because the fate of those who are injured does not have to depend on the gift arranged by the legislator each time".
MP3 Readers Under Accuses, Put Hearing at Risk
Listening to music at high volume for a long period of time using portable musical devices such as Mp3 readers can cause permanent injury to hearing.
It is what the European Commission refers, which in a statement released in Bruxel cites the opinion of the Scientific Commission of the emerging and recently identified health risk (Csrseri) of the EU, published today.
"From this scientific opinion - it reads in the note - it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than an hour a day having the device at high volume risk a permanent loss of hearing."
“I am concerned that such a high number of young people who frequently use portable musical devices and high-acoustic cell phones can unconsciously ruin their ears in an irremediable way,” says Meglena Kuneva.
"From the scientific evidence - it follows the responsibility Ue - emerges a clear risk and we must react quickly.
What counts, is to raise awareness among consumers and render this information in the public domain.
We must also re-examine the existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion, so that they are broadly effective and keep pace with the new technology.”
Bruxel had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the large use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise it causes.
"The scientists - concludes the executive Ue - confirm that it is a cause for concern and the European Commission will now examine together with the member states and stakeholders what measures could eventually be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical devices and related devices."
Currently, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical devices to 100 dB, but concern increases as the hearing damage that can result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit this damage a lot by using solutions such as reducing levels and reducing the time of exposure to noise.
In its view, the Scientific Committee points out that users of portable musical devices listen at high volume (more than 89 decibels)music for only 5 hours a week exceed the limit currently in force regarding the maximum noise allowed in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk permanent loss of hearing after a period of 5 years.
It means that it affects 5-10% of the users of such devices and the number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno gives way to the Commission for the future of the capital
Today it starts, in March it closes, in June the accounts will be made.
This is the schedule set by the Municipality and for the workers of the "Commission for the future of the capital of Rome", which has been established this morning in its new headquarters behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will deliberate the main points for Rome.
Once the doors closed in March, the board and the communal council will evaluate analysis and projects, in order to present in June the Strategic Piano for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Municipality and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all political, social and cultural ideas - it tends to emphasize Alemanno - It will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome in which those who decide politically, the board and the municipal council, can later be endorsed.
There is no spare position of roles, only the will to have a place to elaborate a great project for Rome.
In March finished the works will disappear, because this experience must have a precise temporary end.
In June – announces the mayor – we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome.
To whom the Commission accuses of being useless, since its opinions are not binding, Alemanno responds: "Everything depends on the work that will be able to carry out the Commission and the quality of its proposals.
If quality will be present, as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am also sure in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
Almost always the policy is crushed in the ordinary management and in emergencies that return in return are manifested.
We, on the contrary, want to look beyond and in the long term, in a deeper perspective, working seriously to the development of Rome and its future.
The mayor of Rome also tends to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless nor a banality: it is absolutely free, it does not cost a euro to the Roman citizens and will serve to involve and reason the best minds that the capital squeezes. "
For Alemanno, in fact, "it is necessary to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed or immobile, to allow our city to make an authentic level jump, of which we have absolute need, thinking with a united spirit to its future."
A future that, according to the mayor of Rome, "will not be limited only to the current communal confines but will look beyond" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital but also "considering the role that Rome can and must play as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American president.
He has written an American political note that he is interested in going independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions reduced the U.S. economy and had relations (as he does today also gives private citizen) with the enemy Islam.
Attacks on Obama are on the rise as the election date approaches.
A Miami woman wrote on a website: “This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a great stone face: he believes he will win the highest office in the nation that has been held by two governors and five black senators!”
They’re attacks that don’t say much; they’re attacks that are clearly racial in nature and don’t answer the voters’ question: Will he be a good president? And then there’s the polls; everyone says Obama won and with a good lead.
In this case, too, there are those who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the bowels of the southern United States, has written an editorial: once in the voting booth we will know well to whom the American patriot will give his vote.
One side of the American mentality is covered to the last.
“Say what you want, we’ll think later where to put the cross, whether it’s on Obama or McCain.”
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave America.
things never said before, which seems almost certain the success of the black candidate.
Yet despite all these arguments, the winning weapon for Democrats is George Bush.
They have asked 1500 people: what have been the mistakes made by Bush during his tenure? 89 percent have answered: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and they sent her home to kick her in the ass.
In Iraq there are 4,500 soldiers who have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack their bags.
Iraq, for the most part, has been Bush’s weak point.
Whoever takes over as George W. will have a huge duty to perform.
Use, the economic collapse is also felt for journalists: in the newspapers it is time for cuts. Many blame the Internet, "murderer" of printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists have been questioned by PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mind control for the future.
Journalists today are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, journalists have not openly stated that they feel less concerned about credibility.
They don’t feel isolated like once.
The problem for American journalists is money.
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a crisis of destroyed economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the room where the editors work to make the newspaper, is a big problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism as understood by the majority of the public is not to be substantially reduced.
A clear but complex pessimism prevails today over the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executives are convinced that journalism at the national level is following a wrong path.
In the local field the executive group is 65%.
Printed against issue.
It’s not hard for journalists to see where the web is going.
The largest publishing houses open a breach in the Internet, for many viewed as the "killer" of the printed letter.
The “economic pressure” that journalists warn of has risen to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope that it will “do some good” for journalism.
The biggest break in American journalism today is between who runs the newspapers – the editors – and the journalists who work for them.
56% of executives nationwide are sure that their journalists share the same values, while at the local level the percentage drops to 23%.
For some this has to do with “work safety”.
Executives who plan to lose their jobs in 3 years are 47% nationwide.
For the journalistic staff it is 30%.
The issue of "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always the order of the day.
Only 13% of journalists work with a contract.
In a vast nation like the U.S., with 300 million people and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want and it becomes a matter of “take it or leave it.”
Directors are almost always paid well, while copywriters can earn up to $10,000 a month, plus retirement and social insurance.
For the holidays, the reasoning becomes complicated: a total of days the first year, another after the third to reach 15 full days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by his admission, are "sick" followed throughout the year.
It's all a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: COURT OF ROME, DANILO COPPOLA STAYS IN GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the instance of the real estate Danilo Coppola who had asked to be able to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in the context of the investigation into the counter-agreement on the Unipol-Bnl escalation.
In the course of the arrest process in his charge, last week, he has obtained home release, transforming it into mandatory residence to Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate company can travel the route of the city of the province to a room in the capital.
According to the court, these trips (for which the PM has voted against) would allow him to influence his society and access the evidence that accuses him.
Elites in Danger
The phenomenon had already manifested a few days ago with the vote of the camera of the representatives against the plan of salvation of 700 million dollars launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and this, more interested in punishing Wall Street than to save the economy.
It gives us a confirmation from yesterday’s New York Times that the ongoing crisis is disarming the Republican party, ever more divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, pro-federal and pro-business community, and its new soul, instead, conservative, hostile to “those in Washington” and the world of finance, strong especially in the Central and Southern states.
The soul, in fact, that has become arrogant with the vote of the one who spoke at the beginning.
This just quoted is just one example of the mutations, of the great mutations, that the ongoing economic earthquake announces: not only in the United States but in all the West and not only here only.
Whether in the United States or in Europe for a long time the crisis seems to work as an accelerator of incubation phenomena that with the new climate solidify and come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary reactivation, of the double state-sovereignty category in relation to a type of re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking-finance institutions which have, yes, strong financial relations with the outside world, but above all the balance sheets of families living in a single country and in a single state are much more compromised.
The one that immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulty and protests of those people and those families who, on the other hand, are electors.
The crisis appears economically worldwide but is politically and exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems substantially out of the question or they don’t have much to say: the crucial test is the European Union, which as always divided between different interests and different state strategies fails to decide on any common policy.
It is from the government of each state that everyone expects an intervention, rescue and reactivation plans, new rules and above all the subsidy of funds: from the moment that the cut is reached it is only the state that possesses the economic resources and the mass of financial resources to remedy things.
And they also have the necessary means and the legitimization to use them: two resources of incalculable value, values in certain circumstances in which no market probably and no organization can ever dispose to the same extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the nation-state is in perfect harmony, with the greatest importance provided that the new development of the economy tends to attribute to a factor very much linked to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the network of the ever more sophisticated technology, of the immaterial, while we were convinced that global finance was already destined to dominate the world, we realized that our future will instead have to account more and more for the little immaterial things like water, crops and oil.
All things that, you see, can certainly be transported from one place to another on earth but are equally united in an absolute way in a circumscribed space, a territory.
So the one who finds himself as sovereign certainly has many more letters regarding the one who is not, and the one who has the misfortune of living in a position without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novelty that but foreshadows a fracture.
Whoever says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics and Leadership.
In this sense, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, the objective awareness of the need for leadership, the request of someone who knows how to take the situation in hand.
On the other hand a wave of discredit for the existing leaderships, of economic species relieved inadequate with many dark areas.
And together something deeper and in a certain unsettling sense: a discredit, an intolerance, an inadequate image, a sense of remoteness, which tends to involve the entire ruling class of the countries of the West in an increasing number.
It seems to advance more and more, in various places of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same as those of the social elites hitherto booming, the same way of feeling and of being, their culture in the comprehensive exception of the end, to have made their own time and to be stranger to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in short, feeds underground a branched but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, manifested in an electoral "revolt" or in the sudden changes of collective moods of recent times, from the conservative exit in Austria-Bavaria to the collapse of the social-democratic consensus in Britain, to the rebellion of the men of the American Congress against Bush (and also layers with the victory of the conservative in Austria-Bavaria).
There is the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, always make it more difficult to understand and then to represent, what from today that is taking shape are the deep strata of Western society and that the economic crisis renews, increases and potentially stirs in excess.
Faced with all this talk of a "mass rebellion" today is frankly exaggerated.
But having your eyes open certainly isn’t.
The super glue to walk on the walls
Beat the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future walk on the walls like spider man.
It is the target of several American research centers and now a team of four institutes has come quite close.
With an adhesive of only 2.5 square centimeters, scientists have been able to glue a body of 100 kilos on a vertical wall.
The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is an evolution of existing ones that use a particular structure of carbon, called carbon nanotubes.
“The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes ordered like a stack of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that can ensure perfect adhesion to the animal.
Tests done on different materials, such as glass, Teflon and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of this reptile and at the same time "removes easily from the walls", explains Liming Dai, researcher at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Dayton.
“This material could be useful as a transient adhesive,” Liming Dai adds.
Layers to walk around walls exactly like spiderman? Layers yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electrical current.
Other applications could have to do with aerospace engineering.
No superheroes at the moment.
Other research - The University of California at Berkeley is also looking for a new adhesive.
In an article in the journal American Chemical Society, Californian scholars have presented an adhesive made of microfibers like hair that self-clean from dust during movement on a surface to always maintain perfect adhesion.
Drugs: Never with fruit juice
Attention to grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in summer because they are refreshing and rich in vitamins, if taken contemporaneously with some drugs, their absorption is altered amplifying or decreasing, as the case may be, the efficiency with serious consequences for health.
To repeat the risk of fruit juices be packaged that fresh associated with the assumption of some medicinal David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who from the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society underway in Philadelphia sends a new alarm: just a glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice to reduce the absorption of some drugs, nullifying the beneficial effects and putting health at risk.
Grapefruit juice was already under charge because it was held responsible for increasing to toxic levels some medicinal anti-arrhythmics, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines and neurological.
The same Italian agency of the drug had given the news in a bulletin two years ago alarming doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger that derived from this mixture and to pay attention to what is drunk in the case is assuming a drug such as Diasepam or Metatone.
NOT JUST POMELO – According to experts, orange and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
A long list of the active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Hence the call of Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology at the State University of Milan: "These discoveries in general are pointed to the various international and national drug agencies that eventually provide to change the informative notes of the same.
That is why we must always read the illustrative brochures of the medicines that are assumed and if there is something that is not clear to us, do not be impressed, ask the doctor or pharmacist clearly,” stressed the expert of the Ansa agency.
The Economics Novel by Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics has been awarded to American Paul Krugman for his studies, his models of trade and on the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a noted New York Times editorialist.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration’s decisions on the economy and foreign policy.
A few months after the September 11th, 2001, Enron was bankrupt, Krugman had predicted in an editorial published by the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in the end of consequence for the United States.
A forecast that triggered a lot of controversy and that for several years came reproached to the economy, but that has now been revealed accurate.
“I’m shocked and a little upset that the memory of the Enron and Worldcom collapse scandal has quickly disappeared from public attention,” Krugman said.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of Europe’s central banking executive committee, Krugman is a “high-value economist” but also a “very aggressive, particularly critical of the excesses of the Bush administration’s liberalism.”
Open Office, echo the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the day of the launch of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to attract more users, from home to office to public administration professionals, as a free alternative to the well-known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year of work by volunteer developers, whose backs are monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several new features: the welcome screen and the less rude magazine interface, other more consistent ones are added, such as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF(Open Document Format) 1.2 format, the latest standard version.
Attention also put to multi operation with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific functions of some modules such as the one that allows reducing the size of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example, to send it electronically, or the possibility of importing the PDF file into the graphic elaboration module, preserving the original appearance of the page.
Always on this front you can create "Hybrid PDF" documents, which accumulate the typical graphics of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received different improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet they can intervene in different users, avoiding the conflicts of the modifications, in the elaboration of texts, each collaborator is given a color in the comment for a better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice functions to the Web (on the cloud, over the clouds), and in the coming weeks they should give the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and added to the English version found in the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usually the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request the installation CD can also be sent home or to work.
And if the theme of the free one can be a hook for dissemination in the houses, it is in the business area that Open Office the suite tests, tries the big bet, being able to already count on several projects carried out in the public administration and in the schools.
And there is not even a lack of realities that offer an ideal training, consultation and assistance service for small and medium-sized companies, in which business prospects could be opened.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for video writing the corresponding Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that replaces Excel; Impress, for the presentation of Powerpoint; Dbase, as in the case of the well-known Access is the program that consents to work on the base data; and finally Draw the graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that until today we have reached almost 3.6 million, with the release of the new version it is likely that the expected figure can be exceeded.
Kohl is also positive is the fourth case of doping
New positive case in the Tour de France: this is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, of the Gerolsteiner team, third place and winner of the best climber’s shirt.
To give the news is the site of the newspaper L'Equipe.
Kohl, 26, is the fourth Epo-positive rider of the third generation, after Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, also of the Gerolsteiner.
Analysis of Kohl’s blood champions is among those conducted in recent weeks at the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry lab.
If the counter-tests confirm that it is positive, the Austrian will lose third place to the Tour and anger against the two-year canonical disqualification.
Confirming the news of Kohl's positive doping to the third-generation Epo is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who has told the Associated Press that he notified Austrian authorities of the news.
The 26-year-old Austrian has positioned himself on the podium behind Spaniard Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, winning the best climber shirt.
IMMIGRANTS:NEW YORK TIMES ASKS, IS ITALY RACISTA?
Italy, a country of emigrants, has only recently become a privileged destination for “hostile” immigrants.
This is transforming the beautiful country into a nation of racists, as the New York Times asks in a long article dedicated to the debate on the issue of racism in Italy, based on the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, originally from Burkina Faso, who was murdered last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case evidences what the New York Times defines as the "northern paradox": the northern regions are at the same time those where there is "more integration and more work" but also the highest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the highest support in the Northern league.
As confirmed by the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times has also cited episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not alone.
Also the new legislation intended by the Lega tightens the brake on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegals is cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
“Giorgio Napolitano meeting Benedetto XVI in Congress has called for the state and the church to work together to combat racism.”
Students victims of expensive rent, up to 900 euros for a room
The rental market for university students does not know the crisis.
According to the latest survey by Sunia, the tenants’ union, renting a single room can cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"the phenomenon has already assumed very serious characteristics to the point of excluding the right to study a large part of young people because of the very high costs that the family would have to sustain - explains the head of the Sunia studies office, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand has totally distorted the market to the point of triggering a process of generalized increase even for the residents".
Apart from that in most cases the rental offers contain a series of violations: free, unregistered type contracts, no limit of fee, linked sub rentals.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions are necessary that, through the review of tax, prices can be regulated.
Looking at the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in Brianza area, they serve approximately 450 euros; for a single room from a minimum of 650 (Bande Nere area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate area, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 (in Victoria area).
In Florence a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room approximately 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in the areas near the University, they serve 250/280 euros for a bed in a double room and from 370 to 500 for a single.
In Rome in the central areas near the University (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) they ask you for approximately 600 euros for a single room and 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros for a single room) in areas near other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
Economy is made only if you change peripheral area: 300 euros for a bed and 450 for a single room in Prenestina area, Centocelle and surroundings.
In Naples for a bed you are served 300/450 euros, for a room you spend from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Polyclinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari for a bed you get 250/350 euro, at least 350 for a single.
In smaller cities the prices are lower in absolute terms, but it has a greater weight in the economy of the city.
In cities such as Perugia, where the phenomenon of student and non-EU rents is more frequent, there is a further anomaly: an increase of 25/30% in the fee for foreign students compared to Italians.
Farewell to the old Paradiso cinema, the cities cancel the historic halls
Historic movie theaters close favoring the Multiplex.
“A city without cinemas in a blind city is like a face without eyes.”
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore photographer with effectively what is happening in the large Italian urban centers and also in the provincial cities.
The process of marginalization of the cinemas, which with the birth of the big meticons in the periphery and the consequent disappearance of the mono theaters in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and indisputable event with all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear are almost always historical places, full of memory, "it is as if a friend died, an acquaintance with whom a piece of place and so much emotion was shared", observes the director of the new Paradiso cinema, the film that twenty years ago won the cousin Oscar and the grand prize of the jury to Cannes, which told the poetry of a provincial cinema and nostalgia for the way of living the cinema that perhaps lost forever.
The figures given by Anec, the main association of merchants, speak clearly: in the last five years they have closed 316 traditional cinemas, and to pay most are all the rooms of the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures are Emilia-Romagna with 82 fewer cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
It is a demonstration that the multiplex is responsible for its disappearance, these three Italian regions are the ones that have registered the largest number of new meticone cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany than in Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian exercise has developed irrationally," observes Paolo Protti, president of Anec, "it would be useful to build new structures but it would be necessary to guarantee the permanence of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all its frequenters are willing to transfer to the meticons.
Not to mention the lack of funds in favor of traders: the previous debt of the state is approximately 10 million euros.
It is shameful from the ethical and moral point of view that the government does not respect the laws that exist.
To sustain the sector would serve between 16 and 18 million euros a year.”
Interestingly, Bologna, the first Italian city concerned about the closures, decided to repair itself with the signing of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy to promote and protect single-room cinema in the historic center than on the outskirts.
Among the planned rules there are mediations of tax facilitation in favor of the managers and advantages for the public in mobility finishes: spectators will be able to enter the limited traffic area and will have special rates for parking.
"It's an initiative that I like" observes Giuseppe Tornatore"and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by putting other measures in place.
It is true that to contrast the extra power of meticons, traditional rooms have to improve the quality of sound and image because the public today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a subject that was always important to me: the closure of the cinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make the "New Paradiso cinema", which I already thought of for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass the Rialto or the Quirinale of Via Nazionale already closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, so as not to see the posters blackened by the dust, I turn the other way.
Tie between politics and 'ndrangheta, the mayor of Gioia Tauro has been arrested
"Mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to uniform the Municipality elections for those interested to cosca Piromalli".
The accusations that the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria give to the mayor and vice mayor of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione e Rosario Schiavone, and to the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning by mafia association, are heavy.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the elderly mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson, a lawyer of the same name, already convicted of criminal mafia association and to compensate 10 million euros, were also arrested.
“Disregarding any legal and moral norm, and in good sense,” the prosecutors write, the two local administrations had expressed a willingness to pay consultations to lawyer Piromalli.
"It would have been allowed to the mafia family - the judges write - to officially enter the interior of the municipality facilitating the great possibility of control and command of the public administration."
The president of the Calabrian regional board Agazio Loiero does not hide that "agreements between the bad organized life there is a lot" in his region: "There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of the ‘ndrangheta, heroes who stay clean.”
Those arrested this morning are added to those of last July after the police had announced the cutting of heads of the Piromalli mafia family.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, already in 1991 and always due to alleged conditioning between organized crime and the local administration, local politicians had been solemnized from the charge of administering the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the Udc at the time of the dissolution, after the ballot in May 2006, had been elected as head of a center-right coalition.
A scandal exploded when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
I call on the Deputy Minister of the Interior who was Marco Minniti at the time, accusing him of having organized everything on a political issue, but the judges in the arrest warrant signed this morning explain that Piromalli had even gone so far as to ask for the variation of the A3 road project.
From the environmental interceptions made to Dal Torrione, the judges write, “the willingness to favor the demands of an entrepreneur, representative of a group very close to the Piromalli clan, uniforming the elections of the public administration over the interests of the mafia families” emerges.
When the energy is born from the waves, the big ones come down to the stage.
It is an exterminated field that occupies more than 70% of the planet’s surface and is now being discovered by the world’s largest energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which the great ones like Chevron look.
The possibility of collecting energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for a hundred years and in the 70s along with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell in 1980, the idea of harnessing marine energy was pushed aside, but now that environmental cases and the new rise of oil give momentum to the sector.
London’s World Energy Council (WEC) has estimated by 2007 that 15 percent of the world’s electricity need could be covered by implants that exploit the motion of sea waves.
This amount would be double that currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And then there would be the currents and the tides.
Giants on the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy has been Enersis, which in 2005 has sealed an agreement to build an implant in the North of Portugal.
When the intention was announced it seemed like a revolutionary step.
Two years away to bet on marine energy are always more and among these companies have always voted for traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying the technology on ocean energy - the spokesman of a company associated with ha to the U.S. oil giant told the Wall Street Journal - and is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question is about obtaining a permit from the U.S. Energy Commission to conduct a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It’s a pretty important sign, considering that in Alaska the U.S. continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has activated a plan to drill further.
In addition to Chevron is Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey to follow the path of energy coming from the sea, the total invested so far, although not detailed indicate an increasing interest.
technology to develop.
Experts talk about a technology still at the beginning, because marine energy has a great environmental impact.
For now, impacts such as those in Portugal or Scotland are small and do not seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, a technology with a higher environmental impact must be used.
And the options are several: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of boas joined together.
The force of the waves, which causes the boas to move up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders inside them.
The pressure spins a turbine which in turn powers a generator.
Electricity is sent to shore via submarine cables.
For now there are four implants of this type under development, waiting only for federal approval, apart from energy, could serve for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces power for a shopping mall and a parking lot, using underwater turbines on New York’s East River.
The movement of the water when there are tides, rotates the blades of the turbines, creating a rotary movement that feeds the generator.
Verdant has said it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to use the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say at the Institute for the Development of Electric Power, right now merits the potential of tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, tides are more preventable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is mostly about tidal energy that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others approaching the coast, have invested $7 and a half million in 2008 and an investment of $35 million is planned for 2009.
