Assembly Members (AMs) in Wales worry about "looking like muppets"
Some Members of the Assembly are puzzled by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP).
This confusion stems from plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Assembly members from across the political spectrum are concerned that this could be ridiculed.
One Member of the Labour Party Assembly stated that his group was concerned "that he rhymed with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means fool and pwp means poop.
A Welsh Party Assembly Member commented that his entire group was "disgruntled" and has suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party claimed that their group was "open" to the name change, but noted that the pronunciation jump from MWP to muppet was small.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh is similar to that of the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name change, states: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element of the name of the Members of the Assembly will be a matter for the Members themselves."
The Welsh Government’s 2017 law gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals which revealed broad support for calling the Assembly the Parliament of Wales.
On the question of the title of Members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred Members of the Welsh Parliament (or WMP), but the MWP option won most of the support in a public consultation.
Members of the Assembly are apparently suggesting alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus could lead Assembly Speaker Elin Jones to submit the bill on the changes in a few weeks’ time.
Reform legislation will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on disqualification of Assembly Members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will have the final say on the question of what they should be called when deliberating on legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls to vote on a referendum on the country’s name change
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether their country's name will be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular vote was called in an attempt to resolve a decades-old conflict with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim on its territory and has repeatedly opposed its candidacy for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the name change plebiscite, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin are silent because of the difficulties of the churches of Harlem
“Historically, the older people I’ve spoken to say there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Mr. Adams says.
"Today, there is neither one thing nor the other."
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“Now people socialize in a different way,” he says.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms of neighborhoods that neighbors go to regularly."
With regard to churches, he worries that the money earned from selling goods will not last as long as the leaders hope and that “sooner or later, they will return to the starting point.”
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings filled with the kind of people who won’t help the remaining sanctuaries in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people,” he said, “and will therefore accelerate the closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these apartments will end up being members of these churches.”
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A black congregation worshiping nearby acquired the building.
A black congregation took the reins of St. Martin, under the direction of Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who resisted hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire left the building badly damaged and, while Father Johnson’s parishioners were making plans for its reconstruction, they also commissioned the carillon.
The Rev. David Johnson, Father Johnson’s son and successor on St. Martin, proudly called it “the campaigns of the poor.”
In July, the expert who played the carillon called it “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument.”
In addition, the expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, pointed out that it was the first carillon in the world used by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who left to play the carillon of Riverside Church, larger, 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather commented that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in St. Martin in recent months has been a complicated history of architects and contractors, some brought by lay church leaders and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish board, the parish’s governing body of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July commenting on its concern that the diocese would “try to pass on the costs” to the board, although it had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old boy who was diving for lobsters in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy Saturday while diving for lobsters in California on the day lobster season opened, authorities said.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon’s Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV of San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy begging for help, so he reached out with a group to get him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought he was just excited about catching a lobster, but then realized he was “screaming that he had been bitten.”
,
He had a broken collarbone," Hammel observed when he arrived at the boy's side.
"I yelled at everyone to get out of the water because there was a shark," Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to Rady Children’s Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The first responder, Captain Larry Giles, told a news conference that a shark had been sighted in the area a few weeks earlier but had not been considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim showed traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities closed access to the beach, from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami Beach in Encinitas, for 48 hours to investigate and for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans boost UK beauty market
Sainsbury’s acquires Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many employees specializing in the hallways of their style and beauty establishments.
In order to significantly boost the UK beauty market, which is valued at 2.8 trillion pounds and growing compared to falling sales in fashion and homewares, the biggest beauty aisles will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if successfully exceeded, the same will be done in more stores next year.
The investment in beauty comes at the same time that this supermarket chain is looking for ways to use the shelf space that used to be allocated to televisions, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury’s said it would double its beauty offering with up to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, more space will be given to the existing ranges of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees, with areas similar to those of other establishments, such as Boots.
The chain will also relaunch its Boutique makeup range with a majority of animal-friendly products, something increasingly demanded by younger customers.
Fragrance Shop will also test its concessions at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first recently opened in Croydon, south London, last week and the second opening at Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online stores and the shift to buying small amounts of food daily from local stores force supermarkets to work hard to convince people to visit.
Mike Coupe, Sainsbury’s chief executive, said stores will increasingly resemble shopping malls as the supermarket chain tries to crack down on discount stores Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos discount outlets into hundreds of stores and introduced several Habitats since its purchase of these chains two years ago. This is considered to have boosted grocery sales and further profited from these acquisitions.
The supermarket chain’s previous attempt to renovate its beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury’s tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a discussion on how to split revenue from pharmaceutical outlets in its supermarkets.
The new strategy follows the sale of all 281 Sainsbury’s pharmaceutical establishments to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
Lloyds is said to be participating in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer at Sainsbury’s, said: “We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles in a way that enhances the environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in a specialized staff that will be available to offer advice.
Our brand offering is designed to fit every need, and an attractive environment and comfortable location make us an irresistible destination for beauty products, challenging the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones is ‘angry’ after Holly Willoughby breaks an 11-million-pound deal
Peter Jones, the star of Dragon’s Den, went “furious” after TV host Holly Willoughby broke an 11 million pound deal with her lifestyle business line to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn’t have time to devote to the truly fashion and accessories brand.
This business had compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning host announced she was leaving the business on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has angered Dragon’s Den star Peter Jones by abandoning his lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on his extraordinary new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the sources, Jones was "furious" when the golden girl of television admitted that her new deals, valued at up to 1.5 million pounds, did not leave time to devote to Truly, her fashion and accessories brand, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, in Buckinghamshire.
The business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and was shaping up to double Willoughby’s fortune of about 11 million pounds.
As Willoughby, 37, announced he was leaving the business on Instagram, Jones was leaving Britain for one of his holiday homes.
A source said: “Truly was by far Holly’s top priority.
It was going to be her long-term future, which would hold her for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left everyone involved utterly stunned.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to launch.
There’s a warehouse full of merchandise at Marlow’s headquarters, products ready to go on sale.”
Experts believe that the departure of the host of This Morning, one of Britain’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions due to the significant investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing, and possibly further delay its launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents to three children and have been in a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couples went on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of I’m A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said that last night "there was no talk of business issues."
A difficult conversation "and then we fall in love"
He joked about the criticism he receives from the media for making a comment that some would consider “unpresidential” and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump commented in his mocking voice as a “news anchor.”
"I haven't given up on anything."
He said Kim is interested in meeting him again after Trump praised the first meeting held in June in Singapore, which he saw as a major step toward denuclearizing North Korea.
However, negotiations for denuclearization have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, explained to world leaders gathered at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that his country does not see an “adequate response” from the US to the first steps towards North Korea’s disarmament.
On the contrary, he noted, the US continues to apply sanctions in order to keep up the pressure.
Trump’s outlook was far more optimistic in the speech he gave during his rally.
“We got along great with North Korea,” he said.
"We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: an end to missile tests, help freeing hostages and bringing the remains of U.S. soldiers back home.
He also defended his unusual approach when discussing relations with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this packed stadium, we’d have about 200 people right here,” Trump said, pointing to people right in front of him.
Indonesia tsunami and earthquake devastate island, leaving hundreds dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population had been displaced, it was not declared a national emergency, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not seek international assistance, which complicates things a bit,” explains Ms. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team to send to Palu, they are still unsure if foreign staff can work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national emergency agency, said authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organisations were allowed to provide help.
Considering that the land is constantly moving in Indonesia, the country remains incredibly unprepared when nature unleashes its wrath.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, not as many are seen in other coastal areas.
It is likely that the apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, even though there was prior warning, contributed to the loss of life.
At best, travelling from one island in Indonesia to another is a challenge.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital ship that was in Lombok to care for earthquake victims is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the enclave of the new catastrophe.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia’s worn-out infrastructure the centerpiece of his election campaign, and has poured a lot of money into roads and rail lines.
However, the lack of funding has affected Mr Joko’s administration, which faces re-election next year.
In addition, it must cope with the pressure of persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands had to leave their homes as gangs of Christians and Muslims fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other rudimentary weapons.
Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge equals score against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with an 89th-minute goal on Saturday at London’s Stamford Bridge.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri just over 27 metres from Chelsea's goal when the score was 1-0.
He placed the ball on his left foot with a tap before throwing it into the second stick.
The action sent him over the area and toward the top right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball passed over Kepa Arrizabalaga who tried to stop it with a jump and fell into the net.
"I was trying to put myself in that position to get the ball and players like Shaq always play very forward, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming up and I tapped him. I didn't think about it too much, I just threw the shot."
Chelsea were winning 1-0 in the first half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues midfielder made a heel pass to Mateo Kovacic on that play, before turning around dribbling near midfield and entering Liverpool's field.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball and ran out in midfield.
Afterward, he made a nice pass to the space that brought Hazard to the area.
Hazard stood in front of the defense and shot the ball into the net of the second post with a left foot kick that Liverpool’s Alisson Becker couldn’t stop.
On Wednesday at 15:00, Liverpool play Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League. The match will be held at the San Paolo Stadium, in Naples (Italy).
Chelsea face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country’s emergency agency said early Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed during Friday's 7.5-magnitude earthquake that unleashed waves as high as six meters, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with the remains of collapsed buildings.
Police Arrest 32-Year-Old Man on Murder Suspect After Woman Was Stabbed to Death
A murder investigation has been opened after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews on John Street, arresting a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged people in the area who have seen or heard something to go to the police.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in the early stages, but I would encourage anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
In addition, I would recommend anyone, especially taxi drivers, who has been able to catch something on dashcam to contact us, as they may have vital information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon some people who think they know the woman arrived at the crime scene to find out where they had found her this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have reported that they are in the process of informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has tried to re-enter his flat, but police tell him no one can enter or leave the building.
He was stunned when he discovered what had happened.
Now, residents are informed that they will be allowed back in in a few hours.
Someone heard an officer tell a man that the entire area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene in tears.
He keeps repeating, "It's terrible."
At two in the afternoon, there were two police vans inside the cordon and one more outside.
Several agents remained standing inside the cordon controlling the block of floors.
Anyone with information is asked to send an e-mail to D.M., call 101, or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, registration 247 Sept. 30.
Cromwell's Statue of Parliament Becomes Latest Commemorative Success for 'Rewriting History'
Its prohibition would be an act of poetic justice for this Taliban-style destruction of so many cultural and religious objects of England carried out by its fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestions as "insanity" and an "attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, commented: “In the current debate over the removal of statues, it was inevitable that removing the figure of Oliver Cromwell from the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
The wrong Cromwell may be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, during the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft by Cromwell is a testament to 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure many consider worthy of celebration.
As Mr Goldsmith pointed out to The Sunday Telegraph: “Many consider Cromwell, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, a defender of parliament in the face of external pressure, in this case, it is clear, monarchy.
If it is a completely accurate description, it is a matter of continuing the historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure who represents a face of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
Killer Pig Attacks Chinese Farmer
A pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwest China, according to local media.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan," was found dead with a severed artery covered in blood near a pigsty at Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs from a pig pen in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He apparently traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door to a nearby pigsty was open.
He said there was a big pig with blood in its mouth in the pigsty.
Forensic examination confirmed that the nearly 250-kilogram pig had attacked the farmer to death, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and shattered,” the cousin, who is addressed by his last name, “Wu,” told The Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told The Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else, as police gathered evidence at the scene.
It appears that Yuan’s family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although they are rare, this is not the first time a pig has attacked a person.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm, leaving the man seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a nearly 200-pound pig cornered a farmer on his tractor until his wife scared the animal away.
After pigs ate an Oregon farmer in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs aren’t usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a “trigger.”
"They're just playing.
They are like children, very curious... their intention is not to hurt.
What you have to do is have the right respect for them,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will leave widespread heavy rains in the southwestern U.S.
As planned, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder waters off Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will leave torrential rains all over northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. in the coming days.
Rosa caused wind gusts of more than 136 km / h, a category 1 hurricane, from Sunday at five in the morning (Eastern time) and was located almost 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, low pressures are beginning to build in the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward toward the West Coast of the U.S. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will begin to push the intense tropical rains northward toward the southwest of the U.S.
Rosa will leave more than 25 centimeters of rain in some areas of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, when the tropical rain hits the approaching low pressure, there will be widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 2 and 10 centimeters of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical rains will cause rainfall of nearly 5 to 8 centimeters per hour in specific areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Due to the scattered nature of tropical rains, flash flooding is possible with rapidly worsening conditions.
Due to this threat of tropical torrential rains, it is not recommended to venture into the desert on foot at all.
Heavy rains could turn canyons into raging rivers and storms will cause gusty winds and dust clouds locally.
The approaching low pressures will leave heavy rains in particular parts of the southern California coast.
Torrential rains may leave as much as two centimeters of water, which could cause small flows of debris and make roads slippery.
It would be the region’s first torrential rains during the wet season.
Some scattered tropical downpours will start approaching Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before rain becomes widespread late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and throughout Wednesday.
In October, some intense temperature changes in the U.S. can be observed due to the cooling of the Arctic and the warmth of the tropics.
Sometimes this involves drastic temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of these temperature differences is what will happen across the central U.S. on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 7 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the prolonged summer heat will try to recover and re-expand.
A large portion of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to see a warm start to October, with widespread temperatures hovering around 26 degrees from the Southern Plain to parts of the Northeast.
On Tuesday, temperatures in New York could reach as high as 26 degrees, about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast indicates high odds of above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh appear
More than 20 million people followed the harrowing testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s, on six television networks Thursday.
Meanwhile, the policy remained deadlocked and the media disrupted its usual programming to broadcast Friday’s latest developments: an agreement designed by Arizona Sen. Jeff Blake for the FBI to conduct a weeklong investigation of the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is absolutely certain Kavanaugh touched her intoxicated and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
During his impassioned testimony, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely certain that had not happened.
More than 20.4 million people Nielsen was commenting on Friday are likely to have seen it.
The company counted the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other channels that broadcasted it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen often has some trouble figuring out how many people see something in the office.
To put it in perspective, it’s an audience similar to that of a playoff football game or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose members have strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, was the leading channel, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during an all-day appearance, Nielsen said.
ABC took second place, with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
After the appearance, he continued to show great interest.
Flake was the central character in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement saying it would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught protesters shouting at him as he tried to get into an elevator to attend a hearing before the Judiciary Committee on Friday morning.
While receiving these reproaches, broadcast live on CNN, he was dejected.
"Looking at my face," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
He continued, “You have power when there are so many women who don’t.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator doors closed, that he would tell more in his appearance before the Commission.
Cable and broadcast networks broadcast it all live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee had to vote to propose Kavanaugh’s candidacy to the Senate for a vote.
However, Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated allegations made against the candidate over the next week, which some Democrats had been asking for.
Flake was convinced, in part, by conversations he had had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s decision was critical, as it became clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to pass Kavanaugh without that investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'making politics' with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "making politics" with Britain's future and undermining the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for a Conservative Party Congress to be held in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview published alongside his on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, insisted on his attack on Chequers’ alleged Brexit plan, claiming that a proposal for Britain and the EU to collect each other’s tariffs was “totally absurd.”
Wayde murder: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson as suspect in LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from LSU, during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed on a second-degree murder charge, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA in them, according to CBS affiliate WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police say he admitted to shooting Wayde.
A $350,000 bond has been set, according to the defense.
The Baton Rouge District Court of Instruction released a preliminary report Friday that said the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head.
The department recognizes the merits of the fugitive unit of the Louisiana State Police, the state police crime lab, Southern University police, and citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the area’s police forces for their “diligence and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He had averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in a game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade declared that his team is “devastated” and “shocked” by Wayde’s death.
"These are the things people always care about," Wade said.
A volcano spews ash in Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the neighborhoods located south of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the crater showed activity and recorded 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The center recorded several tremors and jolts.
On social media, the images showed thin layers of ash coating the windshields of vehicles in Mexico City neighborhoods, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity at the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence referendum anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police as thousands took part in opposition demonstrations coinciding with the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarized referendum on secession.
A group of hooded separatists who had been cut off by riot police threw eggs and powder paint at them, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets, which are normally filled with tourists.
Clashes also occurred in later hours and police used batons to contain the fight.
For several hours, pro-independence groups, with messages such as “neither forget nor forgive”, confronted unionist protesters to the cry of “Viva España”.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in this region a year after the October 1 vote, considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters overwhelmingly chose independence, though turnout was low, as people who were against secession largely boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent voting at polling stations across the region, where violent clashes took place.
Pro-independence groups camped out Friday night to avoid a rally in support of the National Police.
The demonstration went ahead, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who was attending the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope of Catalonia becoming independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy about being able to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite achieving a vital, albeit narrow, victory in last December’s regional elections, pro-Catalan parties have struggled to retain momentum this year, as many of their best-known leaders, whether in self-imposed exile or in detention, are awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of police on his phone, said the conflict had been stoked by politicians from both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pretrial detention since late last year, announced he would take part in next year’s European Parliament elections.
"Being a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested for ramming a house with a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly ramming a Londonderry home with a car.
The incident occurred on Thursday around 19:30 in Ballynagard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was caused to the entrances and to the building itself.
At some point, the car may have been shot with a crossbow.
Menga attack gives Livingston 1-0 win against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the victory
A promoted Livingston impressed the Rangers by taking Steven Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as Ibrox club coach.
Dolly Menga's attack made all the difference; Gary Holt's moved up one spot, with Hibernian in second place.
This season, Gerrard’s team has yet to claim any away victories and next Sunday they face Hearts, leaders of the table with eight points of advantage.
Earlier, the Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston extend their winning streak in the division to six games. Holt, head coach, has yet to savor defeat since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities in front of a forceful visitor
Holt's team had to have been one step ahead long before scoring, causing all sorts of problems for the Rangers for their direct play.
Scott Robinson overtook the defense, but missed his attempt in front of the goal, then Alan Lithgow had the shot deflected after going inside to finish off Craig Halkett's head midfield in front of the goal.
The host team was content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for the visitors with the stopped ball plays.
That’s how the decisive goal came about.
The Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston sought an inning, with Declan Gallagher's and Robinson's combined play for Menga, who hit the ball and scored from the center of the area.
At the time, the Rangers dominated possession, but failed to pass the defense of the host and goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, was quite calm.
That game continued until the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a stop by Kelly.
Rangers goalie Allan McGregor shot back Scott Pittman, and Lithgow was far from another Livingston play.
Long passes entered the Livingston area constantly, but were always cleared. Two penalty requests were rejected, one after a Halkett inning over backup Glenn Middleton and one by a hand.
Livingston's "Phenomenal" (analysis)
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
The unanimous opinion is that they made an excellent game that continued to exceed expectations of an upward trajectory.
His playing style and roster have barely undergone changes since his promotion, but this is largely due to Holt for the way he has bolstered the team since his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the team captain, was huge and led a superbly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall alert at all times.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had very good times with Gerrard, they fell short.
They missed materializing the plays, since they only managed to enter the opposite field once, which is a wake-up call to the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has received an ambiguous reception in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and a blue sky during the breakfast of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It is the final day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have discussed issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Afterwards, Erdogan headed to Cologne to inaugurate a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
Police claimed security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters came nearby to see its president.
Hundreds of Erdogan’s opponents, many of them Kurds, were also heard condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
These demonstrations reflect how divisive this visitor is, welcomed as a hero by some German Turks and considered an autocrat by others.
Deptford traffic accident: Cyclist dies after collision with vehicle
A cyclist has died in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred near the junction of Bestwookd Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, at about 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was treated by paramedics, but he died right there.
The accident comes after another cyclist died after being hit by a vehicle that went on the run on Childers Street, nearly two kilometers from the crash site on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roads have been cut and buses diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Injured After Riots
Six prison officials have been injured in an altercation at a high-security prison for men, according to the prison management.
The riots began at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Specialists from an elite team (called "Tornado") are in charge of controlling the altercations, in which eight inmates participate and that affect a pavilion.
Officers were assisted for minor injuries to the face at the scene.
A prison service spokesperson comments: “Specialised prison staff have been deployed to deal with the ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members have received health care for injuries.
Violence is not tolerated in our prisons and we made it clear that those responsible will be placed in the hands of the police and could spend more time behind bars.”
Long Lartin prison is home to more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had received hospital medical assistance after being attacked by an inmate.
In addition, in October last year, riot police were asked to come to the prison to deal with a serious altercation in which prison staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flash flooding (arid areas could benefit)
It’s unusual for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that’s exactly what could happen early next week when the last few bites of Hurricane Rosa pass through the southwest of the desert, with the risk of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada and southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving rain late Monday.
The National Weather Service of Phoenix said in a tweet that only "ten hurricanes had retained their tropical storm or depression status within a 321-kilometer radius of Phoenix since 1950.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina approached nearly 65 kilometers from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center foresee between 5 and 10 centimeters of torrential rain, which can reach 15 centimeters in isolated areas of the Mogollon Escarpment in Arizona.
Between 2 and 5 centimeters of rain is likely to fall, with the possibility of reaching 10 in isolated places, in other areas of the southwest of the desert, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin.
In places that are not at risk of flash floods, Rosa rains can be considered a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although a flood is a very serious issue, some of these torrential rains are likely to be beneficial due to the drought conditions currently being experienced in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is suffering from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, as reported on weather.com.
First, the itinerary of Hurricane Rosa will hit Mexico’s Baja California Peninsula.
Rosa, which on Sunday morning will still have a hurricane force with maximum gusts of 136 kilometers per hour, is 619 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moves north at 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it is losing strength.
Thus, it is expected to land in Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm throughout Monday afternoon.
Heavy torrential rains could fall in some parts of Mexico, which are at considerable risk of flooding.
Torrential rains of between 7 and 15 centimeters are expected from Baja California to northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching 25 centimeters.
Rosa will then head northward from Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, then move across Arizona toward southern Utah late Tuesday night.
“The main danger of Rosa or her remains is heavy torrential rain in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and southwestern U.S. desert,” the National Hurricane Center notes.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous flash floods and debris flows in deserts, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old have been arrested on suspicion of an attempted murder after another 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4 a.m.
He was taken to a hospital, where he remains "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested the same night in the Radstock area of Avon, according to Somerset Police.
The agents have appealed to anyone who may have recorded what happened with the mobile.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffered the pettiness and anger" of the Democratic Party
“To vote for Judge Kavanaugh is to vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has "suffered the pettiness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress Thursday, energetically and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that she had sexually assaulted her decades earlier as a teenager.
Ford also testified at the hearing about this allegation.
On Saturday, the president said that, on that day, "Americans saw the cunning, quality and bravery" of Kavanaugh.
“To vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is to vote to confirm one of the most accomplished legalists of our day, a jurist with an admirable record of serving the public,” he told supporters in West Virginia.
The president made indirect references to Kavanaugh’s candidacy by talking about the importance of Republican turnout in midterm elections.
"Five weeks to go until one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not running, but it's a race," he said.
“That’s why I go from place to place fighting to get great candidates.”
Trump alleged that Democrats are embarking on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s appointment is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior Republican Party leadership official told CNN.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake, tsunami, rising
At least 384 people have died and many have been swept away by huge waves plaguing beaches after a strong earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered to celebrate a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when waves of up to six meters reached the coast at dusk, dragging many to death and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami occurred after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When a tsunami was warned yesterday, people were still on the beach and didn’t flee immediately, that’s why they were victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s National Agency for Disaster Management (BNPB), told a news conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it ravaged everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching shore.
He added that some people had climbed trees to escape the tsunami and had survived.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, broken and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s major earthquake was 200 times higher than the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
He added that the geography of the city, which sits at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "important" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, and 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be higher along the 300km coastline north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the quake’s epicenter.
The communications "were totally paralyzed and there was no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
“More than 300,000 people live there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could be much worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the agency received a lot of criticism for failing to report that a tsunami had hit Palu, though officials say the waves had already reached shore when the alert was issued.
In a recording captured by an amateur and shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building can be heard telling people on the street that a tsunami was approaching.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately validate the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major blackout that cut communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, officials say, but evacuees still need food and other necessities.
The city’s airport has been reopened only for relief work and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit Paul’s evacuation centers on Sunday.
The death toll from Indonesia’s tsunami is more than 800.
It's a very bad thing.
Although World Vision staff from Donggala have arrived safely in Palu City, where employees are sheltering under tarpaulins installed in their office garden, they have seen a devastating panorama on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they had seen a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
It's a very bad thing.
Even as aid groups set in motion the gears of disaster relief, some people complained that experienced aid workers were not being allowed to travel to Palu.
Under Indonesian law, foreign funding, supplies and staffing can only be used if the affected site is declared a national disaster area.
And that hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a catastrophe at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a Red Cross spokeswoman in Indonesia.
“As soon as the government says it considers it a national disaster, we can start providing international aid, but it hasn’t happened yet.”
As the second night fell in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those still missing were still hopeful that their loved ones would be the miracles that would shed some light on the heartbreaking stories of natural catastrophes.
On Saturday, a young boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, an instructor with Indonesia’s national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which concluded earlier that month in Indonesia.
Others who were trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“From my experience in the paragliding field, I carry my own emotional charge,” he said.
Mr. Gendon recalled how, in the hours following the news that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed in the paragliding community, he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to Palu’s competitors, who were participating in the festival held on the beach.
However, their messages only showed one check mark in gray, not two in blue.
“I think that means the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Thieves take $26,750 during ATM reload in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, burglars robbed a Brink employee who was recharging an ATM in Newport on the Levee, taking $26,750, according to a Newport Police Department news release.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an ATM located in the entertainment center and was preparing to recharge it with more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the note.
While he was busy, another man “ran up behind Brink’s employee” and stole a bag of money intended for reloading.
According to the note, witnesses saw several suspects leaving the scene, but police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Kanye West is going to be called Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: “The person formerly known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has long been nicknamed Ye, the name he used as the title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who had to cancel her performance for "emotional reasons," as the show's creator commented.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously said that the word was of religious importance to him.
"I think it's the most used word in the Bible, where it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year while discussing the album's title with radio host Big Boy.
"It's you, it's us, it means us.
He went from being Kanye, which means ‘the one’, to Ye, a reflection of our good, bad, and confusing things, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of the many famous rappers who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, has used his name in upper or lower case, with or without a hyphen.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use army against civilian population
Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador has vowed never to use the military against the civilian population, as the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students in the country approaches.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador vowed in Plaza Tlatelolco that he would “never use the military to repress the people of Mexico.”
On October 2, 1968, troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were taking hold throughout Latin America.
López Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to those who study and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and a lack of educational opportunities led young people to join criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double funding for I.A.
Now that China is more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its investment in AI research, says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow announcements regarding A.I. from various parts of the U.S. government, even when, in general, the U.S. lacks an official A.I. strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: it aims to become No. 1 in innovation in I.A. by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for A.I. research would be a good start, given that all other countries lag far behind the U.S. We’re looking at the next breakthrough in the A.I. field,” Lee says.
Double funding means twice the chance that the next big achievement in A.I. will be achieved in the U.S., as Lee stated in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s top A.I. companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an A.I. system that beat Othello’s best American player. He was later an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google’s China subsidiary.
Lee recognized previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would identify the next generation of visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers often have to work hard to get government grants, Lee said.
“It’s not China that’s taking away academic leaders; it’s corporations,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired top people from universities to work at I.A.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. step up its efforts in A.I.
"I think A.I. doctors should have permanent residency cards automatically," he said.
The State Council of China presented its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China funds people from academic institutions just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations fund American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to attract industry and academic partners, while the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the National Science Foundation, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in A.I. research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that sought to create a National Artificial Intelligence Security Commission has failed to take any action in months.
Macedonians decide in referendum whether to change their country's name
The people of Macedonia decided in a referendum on Sunday whether their name would be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia," a gesture that would resolve a decades-old conflict with Greece, which had blocked their bid to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that its northern neighbor’s name is a claim to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments reached agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic population, mostly in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the turnout will reach the minimum 50% required for the referendum to be considered valid.
The referendum ballot posed the following question: "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the breakup of Yugoslavia, to try to gain access to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it will not be legally binding, quite a few Members of Parliament have said they will respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission stated that, by 1 p.m., no irregularities had been reported.
However, turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% of the last parliamentary elections held in 2016, when 66% of registered voters cast their ballots.
“I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who was voting in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their vote in Macedonia’s referendum on a name change of the country that would open the way for joining NATO and the European Union in Strumica (Macedonia) on September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and removing chairs in front of the tents planted by those who were going to boycott the referendum.
“We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads held high, not through the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want us to enter like Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, like China and Russia, and be part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is above 20%.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour, as more than 80% of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a positive result would be a “confirmation of our future.”
In a poll published on Monday by the Institute for Policy Research, it was ensured that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, which means a lower than required turnout.
Another poll by Telma TV in Macedonia found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote for it.
For the referendum to be considered a success, turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
Should it fail, it would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it came to power in May last year.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero dodges all of Brighton's defence to score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke through Brighton's defence in Manchester City's 2-0 win Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
For Aguero, it was ridiculously easy to score a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine midfielder received a pass in the midfield at the beginning of the play.
He ran between Brighton's three defenders before going into the open.
Once there, he was surrounded by four green T-shirts.
He dodged a defender before overtaking several others on the edge of the Brighton area.
He made a pass to the left, where Sterling was.
The English forward used his first touch in the area to return the ball to Aguero, who hit him with his right foot to avoid goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot that reached the right side of the net.
"Aguero has some foot problems," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about playing between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the time.”
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the early lead in the Premier League contest.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
On that play, Aguero received the ball deep inside Brighton's territory.
He made a nice ball pass to the left flank for Leroy Sane.
Sane tapped him before leading Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues striker threw the ball into the net just before it went out of bounds.
City face Hoffenheim in a Champions League group match on Tuesday at 12:55 at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to throw the Rockies a party
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoff race, there was no reason to force another start.
Still, the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to step on the mound Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if they, the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West, still have playoff opportunities.
The Rockies secured at least one wildcard spot thanks to a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still chasing their first division title.
“While we don’t play anything, at least we can step on the rubber with the certainty that the Denver crowd will be cheering and that the other team will probably play at the highest level I’ve ever faced this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate?”
The Nationals have yet to announce a starting pitcher for Sunday, but they seem inclined to let Scherzer pitch in that situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, did a practice session on Thursday and will return to his normal rest on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander’s record is 18 wins and 7 losses, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts with 2/3 in 220 innings.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The president made indirect references to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his Supreme Court pick, when talking about the importance of Republican turnout in midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
It's five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
It is one of the most important. I do not run, but it is a race, that is why I go from one place to another fighting to get great candidates, "he said.
He continued, “We have this terrible radical group of Democrats, it’s happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by all means necessary, you see pettiness, evil.
They don’t care who they hurt or who they have to go over to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, and we’re not going to give it to them.”
Democrats, he said, are on a “resistance and obstruction” mission.
“We’ve seen it these last four days,” he said, saying Democrats “were furious, they were bad, they were horrible and they were fake.”
He referenced the Senate Judiciary Committee by appointing Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who received the boos from the public.
"Do you remember his answer?
Do you filter the document?
Mmm, Mmm, what?
No, no, I'm waiting for an answer. Her body language was terrible, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party already embraces a wide range of views.
Is intolerant of people who say what they think
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the last in a line of Labour MPs who are told they are not welcome, and just to say what we think.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received similar treatment as being categorically against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
I disagreed with the importance of responsible economic policy, in terms of national security, over Europe. Ironically, these were issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
As stated in the notice of the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday, “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of the eight years that I have been a Member of Parliament for the local Labour Party, that is exactly what the Friday evening meetings of the General Committee have been.
Unfortunately, this is not the current tone of many meetings and the promise of a “kinder and kinder” policy is already more than forgotten, if at all.
It is becoming increasingly clear that dissenting opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that every opinion is judged on whether or not party leaders consider it acceptable.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues with whom he previously thought he shared a similar political vision began to expect him to radically change his mind and adopt positions with which he would never have agreed, either on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, regardless of what I say, there is a tirade of insults on social media demanding my withdrawal, denouncing the policies of the centre, telling me that I should not be in the Labour Party.
I’m not the only one who has experienced it.
Sure enough, I know I’m luckier than some of my colleagues, as comments about me tend to be political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist insults on a daily basis, but never run away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have that wide range of opinions and, with every “no-confidence” motion or every change in the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower.
Over the past two years, I’ve received a lot of advice that recommended keeping my head down and not making me hear as much and that I’d be fine.
But I didn’t go into politics to do that.
Since 32 years ago I joined the Labour Party as a high school student, motivated by the negligence of the Thatcher government that left my comprehensive school classroom literally in shambles, I have tried to support the improvement of public services for those who need them most, either as a councilor or as a government minister.
I have never hidden my political ideas, nor in the last election.
It is impossible for anyone in Nottingham East to be unaware of my political stances or the areas in which I disagreed with current leaders.
The only thing I would say to those who promoted Friday’s motion is that I don’t understand this desire to waste time and energy with questions about my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party when the country is heading for a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services.
The real message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to voters, whether Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of withdrawal and no political opportunism will prevent me from acting on what I believe is best for all of you.

Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: an undefeated Ayr climbs to the top
Two rehearsals at the end of the match may have decided to some extent the final result, but, without a doubt, Ayr deserved the victory in this very entertaining match of the day of the Tennent's Premiership.
They now top the table and are the only undefeated team of the ten participating.
In the end, it was the superiority of his defense, as well as his ability to take better advantage of the opportunities, that gave the home team the victory, so coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"We've been tested in every game and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Melrose’s Robyn Christie said: “Ayr deserve the recognition, they took advantage of the opportunities better than we did.
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute try, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead; but a yellow card to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, loaned by the Warriors for the game, allowed Melrose to take advantage of this opponent's disadvantage and Jason Baggot got an unconverted try.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a penalty kick. Earlier, right at halftime, he scored and converted a solo try, which left the score at 17-5 in favour of Ayr at halftime.
However, the Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's rehearsal, converted by Baggot, reduced this difference to five points.
Then there was a long interruption due to a serious injury from Ruaridh Knott, which they had to take out on a stretcher, and, as the game resumed, Ayr went ahead with a rehearsal of Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
The yellow card to Blair Macpherson, captain of the Ayr, allowed the Melrose to take advantage again that they had one more man with an unconverted rehearsal of Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of enormous pressure.
However, the locals recovered and, when Struan Hutchinson was shown the yellow card for shooting Climo without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson did a rehearsal when he was in the back of the advancing maul.
Climo converted him, as he had been doing almost since the game resumed, after Kyle Rowe received the ball sent by David Armstrong from a kick and sent wing Gregor Henry to the bottom to take the fifth practice of the locals.
The protagonist of Still Game wants to orient his career towards the catering sector
Ford Kieran, star of Still Game, seems determined to move to the restaurant sector after it is revealed that he has been appointed director of a restaurant chain.
The 56-year-old actor is Jack Jarvis on the famous BBC show, who writes and co-stars with his long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the ninth season will be the last in the series, and it seems Kiernan is making plans for his life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, though a Scottish Sun source said Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "flourishing catering market."
‘The sea belongs to us’: landlocked Bolivia hopes court reopens Pacific route
Sailors guard a naval headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings they wave navy blue flags.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, naval bases display the motto: "The sea belongs to us by right,
Getting it back is a duty.”
All over Bolivia, a land without a sea, they still vividly remember the coast lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources that took place in the 19th century, in addition to the longing to sail again through the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be the highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice by October 1, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the drive, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, is waiting for the result with a positive vision,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice ruling on large screens scattered across the country, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favor of Bolivia’s claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile has an obligation to negotiate to grant Bolivia a sovereign outlet to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, who is waging a controversial re-election battle next year, also has a lot to say about Monday’s resolution.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia and that the situation would change little if it did so.
The Netherlands-based U.N. body has no power to adjudicate Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of potential talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice’s ruling comes just six months after the closing arguments indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
Far from promoting Bolivia’s cause, the past four years may have hindered it.
“The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,” Zárate said.
He further suggested that Morales’ belligerent rhetoric has undermined any residual Chilean goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold talks after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision-making was unusually swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will be offered “an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile” and the possibility of “putting an end to 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits,” he said.
Likewise, Calzadilla denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The resolution is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can trust U.S.
Ri Yong Ho, North Korea’s foreign minister, says his nation will never be the first to carry out nuclear disarmament if it can’t trust Washington.
Ri addressed the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to deliver on promises made during a summit held in Singapore between rival leaders.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears poised to resume nuclear diplomatic talks stalled more than three months after this summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong U.
Ri points out that the continuation of continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War to subdue the North is a “chimera.”
Washington is wary of accepting the statement without Pyongyang making any significant disarmament moves first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold another summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang’s seriousness in giving up an arsenal that the country likely sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo is scheduled to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for another summit between the leaders.
Paris fashion shows reveal the last line of huge hats that are about to land on a shopping street near you
If you want to increase your collection of hats or totally protect yourself from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a set of eccentric oversized hats for their spring summer 2019 collection on the runway, dazzling the style of Paris Fashion Week.
Impossible hats have flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have brought their spectacular creations to the catwalk.
Valentino’s most prominent piece was a beige hat with a broad feathered brim that wrapped the models’ heads.
Other oversized accessories were watermelons with jewelry, a sorcerer’s hat, and even a pineapple, but they’re not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of quirky masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and were more reminiscent of Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation resembled a complete scuba gear, snorkeling and goggles included, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
If you like oversized fashion, you’re in luck.
Style hunters predict that huge hats could start to be seen on store streets.
The big hats come stomping from the hand of "The Bomb", with a straw hat with a wing of more than 60 centimeters worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind this so impractical hat that flooded social networks presented another great creation on the catwalk: a straw beach bag as large as the swimsuit model that wore it.
The dark orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, was the main piece of Jacquemus’ La Riviera collection for the spring-summer 2019 season at Paris Fashion Week.
As celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "Next summer, I expect to see huge hats and beach bags on the shopping streets. Since the designer has had such an impact, it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized add-ons."
John Edward: Language skills are fundamental for the citizens of the world
Scotland’s independent schools have a track record of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding test scores that is bolstered by individual and collective successes in the fields of sport, art, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these centres, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the best level of service to pupils and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students to continue their studies of higher education, for the career they choose and for the place they occupy as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an adapted curriculum, it is observed that modern languages remain a popular and desired subject in schools.
As Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message comes to his head.
If you speak to him in his tongue, it reaches his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that if you want to build relationships and build trust with people in other countries, you can’t rely on English alone.
If we take into account the recent results of this year’s exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the ranking tables, with the highest pass rates in independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained an A, the highest grade.
The data, collected from the 74 schools that are part of the SCIS, showed that 72% of students obtained an A in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also obtained an A.
This shows that Scotland’s independent schools support foreign languages as a fundamental competence that both children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, it is considered that, as a subject, languages are at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and everywhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK’s Employment and Skills Commission found that, of the reasons employers gave for the difficulties they encountered in filling jobs, 17% were attributed to a shortage of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly indispensable to prepare young people for their future careers.
Potential job opportunities that require languages are on the rise, so these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career that someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future thanks to a competition like this, which will last a lifetime.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically allow that person to get ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% of them did not speak a foreign language well enough to carry on a conversation, and the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15%, was French.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is now important for today’s children.
If they know several languages, especially those of developing economies, children will be equipped to have better opportunities to find quality employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some centres will focus on the most classic modern languages, while others will teach the languages considered most important for the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of a child, in independent schools you can always choose between several languages taught by teaching staff specialized in this subject.
Independent schools in Scotland devote all their efforts to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future holds.
At the moment, it is undeniable that, in a global business environment, languages continue to be of vital importance for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered "competences for international communication".
Independent schools will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
I wish he would do well.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Colleges.
LeBron makes his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego
The wait for fans hoping to see LeBron James make his debut in his first game with the Los Angeles Lakers is about to end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced James will play Sunday's preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it remains to be determined how many minutes he will play.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James was likely to play a few limited minutes.
After a training session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers’ six-game preseason program.
"At this stage of my career I don't need pre-season games to prepare," he said.
Time for Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It’s the first of Trump’s five scheduled rallies for next week, including stops at places with supporters, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With his nominee’s confirmation vote to fill the Supreme Court vacancy on hold, Trump aims to garner support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump’s rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. tonight, Saturday, Sept. 29, 2018.
You can watch it online through a live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week’s appearances of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which were strained over allegations of sexual misconduct and have put an early Senate confirmation vote on hold for at most a week as the FBI investigates them.
However, the main goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans facing the November elections gain momentum.
President Trump’s campaign said the five rallies next week are intended to “encourage volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they retain in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Control of Congress is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we go into the campaign,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Scheduled at Wheeling's Wesbanco Arena, tonight's rally could draw supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as coverage in the Pittsburgh media," as reported by the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican Senate candidate from West Virginia, who is lagging in the polls.
“For Morrisey, it’s not a good sign that the president has to come and push him in the polls,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA proves it dares to fight to keep hope alive ahead of Sunday’s singles matches.
After three individual sessions, Saturday afternoon’s foursomes may be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The momentum swinging pendulum is a completely invented sporting concept, but players really believe in it, even more so in competitions like these.
So where would you say the momentum is now?
“They were six points ahead and now they’re four, so I guess that’s a little bit of a boost,” Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe has an advantage, of course: four points ahead with twelve more up for grabs.
As Spieth points out, Americans feel they have some wind going for them and reasons to be encouraged, among other reasons for the Spieth-Justin Thomas pair, who played together all day and scored three points out of four each.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and leads by example.
The celebratory guttural screams went up in volume as his round progressed, introducing a vital putt to tie Game 4 as he and Thomas went two down after two holes.
The putt that gave them the game in the 15th was received with a similar cry, of those who transmit that they believe that the American team has not yet been left out.
"What we need to do is redouble our efforts and focus on the game," Spieth said.
That’s what these players have done.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange and adorable couple from Europe wears four out of four and nothing can go wrong with them.
"Moliwood" was the only couple not to do a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That streak and the way its energy flows with the buzzing crowd make it clear that these are the players to beat on Sunday, and that there won’t be other players as popular as Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun sets at Le Golf National.
Preferably, the two at the same time in different holes.
Even so, it is still premature to speak of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dispatched Sergio Garcia, the hero of the four-ball morning, after teaming up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they could not get out.
But on Sunday there will be no help getting out of the holes.
Fourballs and foursomes are fascinating to see up close because you appreciate the interactions between partners, the advice they give and don’t give, and how a strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and takes a big advantage heading into the last day, but this foursome session also showed that the US team dares to fight, something that some, especially the Americans, were hesitant to do.
Europe is ahead 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe starts with a good lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup, after finishing fourballs and foursomes with a result of 10-6 over the United States.
The motivated duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the race with two wins over a struggling Tiger Woods, overtaking Le Golf National by four points.
European Thomas Bjorn, trying to preserve the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that made many mistakes during the morning fourballs, which finished 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning two games, but failed to shorten distances.
American Jim Furyk needs to score eight points from Sunday's 12 individual games to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four straight points, and he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points in their first four Ryder Cup games.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, their magnificent union served to beat a discouraged Woods and the American rookie Bryson Decahmbeau by a resounding 5-4.
Woods, who hadn’t excelled much in both games on Saturday, had occasional moments of brilliance but has now lost 19 of his 29 fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning fourballs, returned to be Henrik Stenson's partner in the foursomes, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, world number one and number three respectively, with a 2-1 result.
Although the day was pleasant and quiet in southwest Paris, Europe didn’t have it all on its side.
The three-time winner, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas served as a reference to the Americans, scoring two points on Saturday.
They got an exciting 2-1 win against Ian Poulter and Spanish Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes after losing the opening two holes.
In Ryder Cup history, a team recovering from a four-point gap in singles matches has only happened twice, although Furyk, as the trophy holder, only needs one draw to keep it.
Although they have been second best for two days, it seems that carrying out a counterattack on Sunday is beyond their means.
North Korea says ‘there is no chance’ they will disarm unilaterally first if they don’t have confidence
On Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations that continued sanctions deepened his distrust of the United States and that there was no chance his country would unilaterally give up nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important steps of goodwill" over the past year, such as ceasing to conduct nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing facilities and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“However, we did not receive any similar response from the United States,” he said.
“If we don’t have confidence in the United States, we can’t have confidence with respect to our national security, and, in those circumstances, there’s no chance we’ll disarm unilaterally first.”
Although Ri repeated North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” denuclearization formula that rewards the country as it takes gradual steps, his statement is important, as he did not simply reject unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referenced a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump following the first summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim pledged to work toward the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula” and Trump guaranteed North Korea’s security.
North Korea has pursued the official end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States has insisted on denuclearization in the first place and increased pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its purpose coercively, including by objecting to a declaration of war termination,” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a pipe dream of people who don’t know us.
The problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our mistrust.”
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, announced with fanfare by the U.S. leader at the United Nations earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings held between Kim and Moon Jae, South Korea’s leader, over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea had been the party interested in denuclearization rather than the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a stalemate.”
Even so, the tone of Ri’s speech was radically different from last year’s speech, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that it was inevitable to direct North Korea’s missiles toward U.S. soil after “malign President” Trump, on a suicide mission, called Kim a “rocket man.”
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his bravery in moving toward disarmament, but said much remained to be done and sanctions needed to continue until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no set deadline for this: “We can take two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia say the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its progress.
However, as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reported to the U.N. Security Council on Thursday, “The imposition of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without non-compliance until we realize definitive and fully verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to cut off funding for Pyongyang’s ballistic missile and nuclear programs.
Pompeo spoke with Ri outside the U.N. General Assembly and later said he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, but, a few hours later, North Korea denounced his "demands as those of a mobster."
In a meeting with Moon earlier this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States applied "corresponding measures."
He said Kim had told him that the “corresponding measures” he was seeking were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
Thanks to a new course being taught this year at Harvard University, all college students are getting more sleep in an attempt to fight the burgeoning macho culture of studying all night drinking caffeine.
One professor found that students at the world’s number one university often have no idea about basic self-care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital designed the course, believed to be the first of its kind in the US.
His motivation for launching the course came after giving a talk about how sleep deprivation affects learning.
“At the end of the course, a girl came up to me and asked me why she just found out about this now, in her senior year.
He said no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
The course, first taught this year, explains to students the basics about how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performance, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students barely slept through the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books that inform them of the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of sleep deprivation on athletic performance and the importance of establishing a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are informed of how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then, a campus icon with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know it’s not going to change student behavior instantly.
However, we believe they have a right to know, just as anyone has a right to know the health effects of smoking tobacco," added Professor Czeisler.
He said the culture of pride in "sleeping out" still exists and added that modern technology and the increasing pressure students are subjected to meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Getting enough sleep and good quality sleep should be students’ “secret weapon” for combating stress, tiredness and anxiety; even to avoid gaining weight, as sleep deprivation causes the brain to generate a feeling of hunger, which is why they want to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes the previous year during his freshman year at Harvard.
He noted that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to expand it to the entire campus.
He hopes the next step will be to ask all graduate students to complete a similar program of study before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler’s recommendation is that students think about setting an alarm to go to bed and another to wake up, and that they are aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by the screens of electrical appliances and LEDs, which can alter circadian rhythms, so they would end up having problems falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal kills Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another bout of depression away from home, when Dolly Menga's attack banished Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
Ibrox wanted their first away win since the Feb. 4-1 win at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team beat Gerrard for the second time in 18 games as coach, leaving his team eight points behind the Hearts, the runaway leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga’s attack came minutes before halftime and the Rangers’ uninspired lineup didn’t measure up at any point.
Now, the Rangers move down to sixth, Livingston climbs to third, behind Hibernian for the goal difference.
The Rangers may run into more trouble, as line judge Calum Spence had to receive medical assistance for a head injury after someone allegedly threw an object from the visiting background.
Gerrard switched to eight of the starters who won the match against Ayr, entering the Scottish League Cup semi-finals.
For his part, Holt took out the 11 players from Livingston who started a point to the Hearts last week and would have been happy with the way his very organized team drowned the opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingston took better advantage of the ball when it did.
They should have scored within two minutes of the start, when Menga made a space pass for Scott Pittman who passed between the defense, leaving him alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder sent her out.
Keaghan Jacobs took an in-depth foul for captain Craig Halket, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, could only send her out by the long stick.
The Rangers regained control, but there seemed to be more hope than conviction about their game in the final third.
There is no doubt that Alfredo Morelos felt that he had been penalized in the 15th minute of the match, when he and Steven Lawless collided, but referee Steven Thomson turned a deaf ear to the Colombian’s request.
The Rangers made two shots at goal in the first half, but Ibrox's former keeper Liam Kelly barely struggled to cope with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's boring pitch.
Although the goal scored in the 34th minute by Livingston came against all odds, no one can deny that they deserved it for the dedicated effort.
Again, the Rangers failed to cope with Jacobs' deep stoppage.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fitted the ball for Scott Robinson, who remained calm and passed it to Menga to score the goal.
At halftime, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which had an almost immediate impact, as the steering wheel was passed to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly went off his line to block it.
Still, Livingston kept taking visitors to exactly the type of game it likes, with Lithgow and Halkett clearing one long pass after another.
Holt's might have taken more advantage in the final stages, but McGregor held firm to push back Jacobs before Lithgow finished off a no-go corner.
Rangers substitute Glen Middleton claimed a penalty toward the end of the game after a run-in with Jacobs, but, again, Thomson looked the other way.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from the Almanac section of "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and COUNTING... was born in Germany the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that culminated in the device known as a Geiger counter.
The accountant Geiger, who has since become a pillar of science, also became a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "The Bells of Coronado," with actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the seemingly incompatible roles of cowboy scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, it's used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put the headphones on, you can hear the effect of the waves emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals.”
Evans: "It's like a radio!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, when he was about to turn 63.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to ‘See’ Malignant Cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” malignant cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells.
The method requires the removal of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
Thus, they can “see” a protein common to many cancers and reinject them.
A vaccine trial is yielding promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method requires removing immune cells from a patient and altering them in the lab so they can “see” a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, commented: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes the growth of different types of cancer," such as breast, ovarian, lung or colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and “teaching” them to attack cancer cells has worked in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a pro-Trump tirade wearing a MAGA cap after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed at the Saturday Night Live studio after an erratic performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for election in 2020.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he wore the Make America Great Again cap, he began ranting at Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“A lot of times I talk to someone white and they ask me how I like Trump if he’s racist.
Well, if I was worried about racism I would have left the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began Matt Damon’s sketch show in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh’s statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, comedian Chris Rock uploaded the recording of West's anger to social media.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to ridicule West with the post.
In addition, West told the audience that he had a hard time backstage wearing that cap.
“They messed with me.
They told me not to go out with my hat on.
They messed with me!
And then they tell me I'm asleep," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Do you want to see how asleep I am?” and added that he “was going to put on his superman cape, because that meant no one could tell him what to do.
Try it with love.”
His comments received boos from the public on at least two occasions and SNL members appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person telling the magazine, "The studio went totally silent."
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West baffled many when he went onstage to sing I Love It dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted, "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR RESISTING TO THE MUCHEDUMBER."
Karen Hunter, a talk show host, tweeted that West was simply “being himself and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
“But I choose NOT to reward someone (buying their music or clothing, or supporting their art) who I believe is embracing and spreading an ideology dangerous to my community.
He's free.
So do we,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed the name, saying he was now “the person formerly known as Kanye West.”
He is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg has also been called Snoop Lion, not forgetting the missing music legend, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charge of attempted murder by stabbing at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in an east Belfast restaurant on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendant is expected to appear Monday in Belfast Magistrates Court.
Prosecutors will review the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for his role as Jon Snow in HBO’s violent medieval fantasy series, Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor has attacked the male hero stereotype, saying those on-screen roles often conveyed to young boys that they had to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes “something has gone wrong” and questioned how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the ?MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted she finds it “pretty important” to address this issue.
“Personally, I think it’s pretty important right now, where have we gotten masculinity wrong?” he said.
“What have we been teaching men as they grew up, thinking about the problems you see now?”
Kit believes that television may bear some of the responsibility for the growing toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
He continued, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television, and on the street, that makes young people feel they have to be this concrete form of man?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time. How do we change it?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong in the education of young people.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any Game of Thrones prequels or sequels when the series ends next summer, stating that he is “fed up with battlefields and horses.”
Starting in November, Kit will star in Sam Shepard’s play True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he believes meeting his wife Rose is the best thing he’s gotten out of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on the show, so in that sense, she’s given me my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose represented Ygritte, the love interest of Kit’s character Jon Snow, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on a Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% more new cases
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, according to health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of these were sexually transmitted, a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people who contract HIV in this way has been reduced in its entirety, the Chinese health authorities declared at a congress held in Yunnan province.
Each year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by about 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a serious problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the LGBT community suffers a lot of discrimination.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that between 70% and 90% of men who have sex with men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of disease are by not using adequate protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, China’s government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of an attempt to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of her staff leaked data from GOP senators and claims that these are "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday criticized allegations that a staffer had posted the personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on Wikipedia pages about lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat said those allegations were fueled by commentators and "far-right" websites.
"Lies, lies and more vile lies," Waters said in a Twitter post.
Allegedly, the information released included the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
On Thursday, an unknown person on Capitol Hill posted the information online during a Senate panel session regarding sexual misconduct allegations made against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak was made sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters’ office and made the data of a Waters staffer public, according to the Capitol.
“This baseless allegation is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations, was not at all responsible for the leak of this information.
This unsubstantiated allegation is completely false and an outright lie.”
Waters’ statement drew immediate criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"He belies this information angrily," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests not the temperance necessary to be a Member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t get angry.
He must not rebel.
You must not question the accuser’s motives.
You must remain calm and serene.”
Fleischer appeared to want to compare Waters’ reaction to Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, whom critics accused of looking too angry during Thursday’s appearance.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who intends to unseat Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's very serious," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted “relevant authorities and law enforcement entities to these fraudulent allegations.”
“We will make sure the perpetrators are discovered and held legally responsible for all these destructive and dangerous actions by all members of my staff.”
Johnny English review: Rowan Atkinson's spy spoof falls short again
It has now become a tradition to look for nods to Brexit in any new film with a British focus. It seems that this is what corresponds to do with this new installment of the parodic action-comedy franchise Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Will this ironic self-satire be about how clearly foolish we are the nation’s new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his bulging eyes and expressionless face, has renewed his license to screw up a second time. Only his name already gives clues that, more than anything, it is a comic creation designed for non-English-speaking movie territories.
Of course, it’s the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to splurge on glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a hint of that guy who played a single note on the theme of Chariots of Fire that was played at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
In addition, it was originally based on the mysterious traveler and international man represented years ago by Atkinson in Barclaycard’s already forgotten television ads, sowing chaos behind him.
In this last installment, there are one or two good moments.
I loved watching Johnny English approach a helicopter dressed in medieval armor as the propellers hit the hull.
Atkinson’s gift for physical comedy is obvious, but the humor falls pretty short and is strangely superfluous, especially now that “serious” movie franchises like 007 and Mission Impossible add comical ingredients seamlessly.
Humor seems more aimed at children than adults and, to me, Johnny English’s absurd misadventures are not as witty and wise as Atkinson’s silent jokes in the role of Mr. Bean.
Now, the repeated argument of today is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated Britain’s super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all his agents in action to the consternation of the agent in service, a woefully small role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the last straw for the prime minister, a pompous, cornered character who’s watching her political popularity sink in: Emma Thompson gives her best in this character who’s almost like Theresa May, but the script doesn’t leave much room for work.
His intelligence advisors inform him that, since all active spies are in danger, he will have to turn to one who is retired.
That has to be the clumsy Johnny English, who now teaches in a posh school, although he gives unofficial classes on how to be a secret agent: there are some good jokes, since it is a spy academy similar to that of the School of rock.
English is flown to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and meets with his long-suffering former sidekick Bough, represented again by Ben Miller.
Now, Bough is a man married to a submarine captain, a nice role for which Vicki Pepperdine is not taken advantage of enough.
Thus, the Batman and Robin who do things terribly wrong in Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, with the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova, represented by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling into the dangerous clutches of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd situations: they disguise themselves as waiters, set fire to an elegant French restaurant, unleash chaos by hiding on Volta’s luxurious yacht; in addition, English becomes pure anarchy by trying to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta’s house.
Definitely, they were used thoroughly in that last sequence, but, as funny and noisy as it is, the set continues to transmit a somewhat childish feeling.
A fairly regular product.
As with Johnny English’s other films, I couldn’t help but wonder if the British film industry couldn’t give Rowan Atkinson a role that does real justice to his talent.
Labour denies it is drawing up a plan for Britons to work four days a week, but charge five
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is going to think of a radical plan that the British would work with four days a week, but charge five.
Allegedly, the party wants business owners to allocate savings made from the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers, giving them an extra day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend for the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea would "fit" into the party's plans and economic agenda of tilting the country in favor of workers.
This shift to a four-day week has received support from the Trade Union Congress, as it is a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
As a senior Labour official told The Sunday Times: An announcement of a review of the directive is expected before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but the four-day workweek is definitely an issue the party hopes to incorporate to rebalance the pro-worker economy as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to back such ideas, as the Green Party has already promised a four-day working week in its campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, at the moment, not all Labour supports this decision.
A Labour spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not part of party policy and will not be discussed at this time.
Shadow Finance Minister John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference last week to expound on his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was willing to regain powers of “anonymous directors” and “harnessed” in charge of companies that provide public services.
The Shadow Minister’s plans also include the idea that the current shareholders of water companies will not recover their full stake, since a Labour government could apply deductions that corresponded to perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed its intention to include workers on the boards of companies and create inclusive ownership funds in which 10% of the shares of companies in the private sector must be allocated to employees, which would mean annual dividends of up to 500 euros.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk on "60 Minutes" about the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh and whether he could change their minds
The FBI’s ongoing investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his confirmation as a Supreme Court justice by at least a week and raised the question of whether the results that are concluded could influence any Republican senator who ultimately decides to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican senators, John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham discussing whether the FBI could release information that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Sure, of course," Kennedy said.
“I was in favor of proceeding with the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after all this happened, after the allegation came out, and I said, 'Did you?'
He was firm, resolute, resolute.”
Graham’s vote, however, seems unshakeable.
“I have a decision already made about Brett Kavanaugh and I would ignore the accusation,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I do know this: Brett flatly denied it,” Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people she appoints have been able to confirm it.
36 years ago.
It’s always the same, I don’t see anything new in this case.”
What is the "Global Citizen Festival"? Have you managed to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival, where an impressive lineup of stars gathers for an equally impressive mission: ending poverty in the world.
This year, in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people travel to the Great Lawn of Central Park to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the event’s real goal: to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international awareness-raising group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
If you want to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you can afford a VIP ticket), concert goers have had to complete a number of tasks or “actions,” such as volunteering, sending emails to a world leader, making a phone call, or anything else that serves to raise awareness about your goal of ending poverty.
However, what has the Global Citizen achieved within 12 years of reaching its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding with a free concert a genuine way of persuading people to take action or is it nothing more than a form of so-called “clicktivism,” which is called the stance we take when we think we’re doing something really useful by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million “actions” by its supporters in favor of a large number of diverse goals.
Thanks to these actions, they claim to have gotten world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements that emerged from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that secured funds have directly influenced nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the most important commitments is “The Power of Nutrition,” a UK-based partnership of investors and executors united in a common commitment to “help children grow and develop to their full potential.” To this end, they have proposed to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end the country’s malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens contributors.
“Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens supporters like you, we can mark a small milestone in the history of social injustice from malnutrition,” Tracey Ullman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told the crowd during an April 2018 concert in London.
The group also said that, after having carried out more than 5,000 actions to try to improve nutrition in the United Kingdom for mothers and children, the government announced the financing of a project, Power of Nutrition, with which 5 million women and children will benefit from nutrition-related interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on its website about what we believe can be done to remedy extreme poverty,
A Global Citizen contributor responded: “It will be a long and hard road and, on many occasions, we will stumble and fall.
But, as human rights and anti-apartheid movements have achieved before, we will achieve our goals, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the performances we will have at this year’s New York event, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use Navy to carry out blockade on Russia's energy exports - Interior Ministry
“If necessary,” Washington could use its Navy to prevent Russian energy from shaking markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said in the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s alliance with Syria, particularly where it operates at the behest of the legitimate government, is nothing more than a pretext for expansion into new markets.
"I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, as they do with Eastern Europe, becoming the southernmost supplier in Europe," he said.
In addition, according to official information, there are ways and methods of addressing this issue.
“The United States, with its Navy, has the ability to ensure that sea lanes remain open and, if necessary, could even block them to ensure that energy does not end up on the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed people attending an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that calls itself the “voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
In it, he compared the approaches that Washington maintains in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they are, in fact, the same.
“The economic alternative in Iran and Russia is basically to take advantage of and replace fuels,” he warned while indicating that Russia only knows one thing, which is to base its economy on fossil fuels.
These claims come as the Trump administration has been trying to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and relieve Russia of its role, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
To this end, members of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which Trump says will make Berlin hostage to Moscow.
Moscow has consistently insisted that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which is intended to double the pipeline’s current capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is purely economic and is yet another example of unfair competition.
“I think we all share the idea that energy cannot become a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after holding a meeting with Rick Perry, the U.S. Energy Secretary, last September in Moscow.
The American position has met, however, with the rejection of Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading industry organisation in Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US not to intervene in EU energy policy or bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“It’s a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a hard look at running for president in 2020, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she will consider joining the presidential race after the midterm elections.
During a town hall appearance in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that this challenge was being posed.
“It’s time for women to come to Washington to mend our broken government and finally have women among the leaders,” she said, according to The Hill.
“After November 6, I’m going to seriously consider running for president.”
Warren gave her opinion on President Donald Trump during a town hall appearance and claimed he was “leading the country down the wrong path.”
“I’m really concerned about the damage Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren spoke bluntly about Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet last Friday, Warren said that “it is absolutely necessary for the FBI to investigate what happened before the vote.”
A poll was released Thursday in which, however, a majority of Warren’s own voters do not believe he should run for the 2020 election.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts “possible” voters said the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
However, 32% of the respondents did support his candidacy.
The survey showed greater support for the previous governor, Deval Patrick, with 38% support for a possible candidacy and 48% against.
Other well-known Democratic Party members spoke about the possible 2020 candidacy of former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin on Track Palin’s PTSD at Donald Trump Rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
Last Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“The situation my son is going through, from everything that has happened since he came back, is well known to the other families who are suffering from the effects of PTSD and other injuries that our soldiers are coming back with,” he told the crowd at a pro-Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to this arrest as the big taboo no one wants to talk about, commenting on her son and other war veterans who “come back with different behavior, hardened, wondering if there really is that respect for what their fellow soldiers and airmen, as well as all the other members of the military, have given to their country.”
On Monday, he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, charged with an episode of domestic violence against a woman that interferes with a report of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of drugs or alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge to achieve a new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a judicial appeal of the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing domestic or gang violence.
Representatives from all 18 states and the district filed a “friendly” brief Friday in Washington to show their support for an asylum seeker facing the current directive, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff’s full name has not been revealed in the August “Grace v. Sessions” case filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) against federal policy.
She said her partner “and her children, who are members of a violent gang,” abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum claim on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Attorneys representing these states defending Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum claims to the U.S., as nations facing widespread problems related to domestic and gang violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum in this country.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of international, federal and state law."
“Under federal law, all asylum claims must be adjudicated under the particular facts and circumstances of the claim and, instead, this exception violates that principle,” the amicus curiae states.
The lawyers also said in the letter that the policy that denies entry to immigrants harms the U.S. economy by claiming that they tend to become entrepreneurs more often and “represent a necessary workforce.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
“Individuals who leave their home countries on the basis of persecution or threats based on race, religion, nationality, or membership of a particular social group or political opinion may apply for asylum,” Sessions said in announcing the directive on June 11.
Asylum was never created as a measure to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems, that people around the world face on a daily basis.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll rises in race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was increasingly dire.
“The situation is very tense,” Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told us as she tried to comfort her fevered baby at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute ambulances arrive with more bodies.
And clean water is scarce.”
Some residents have returned to their destroyed homes to rummage through the few flooded belongings they have left in an effort to recover what they can.
Hundreds of people are injured and hospitals, also damaged by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake, are overflowing.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who has a broken back and shoulder, rested outside Palu Army Hospital, where patients were being treated outside the building due to ongoing, also very strong aftershocks.
He couldn’t help but cry when he told us about the violent earthquake he experienced while on the 5th floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to get to safety.
I got caught in the wreckage of the collapsed wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, and he and his family were in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife ask for help and then a tremendous silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're okay."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper touting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread its propaganda.
On Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump referenced the China Daily payment supplement in the Des Moines Register, Iowa’s best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of wanting to meddle in the Nov. 6 congressional election, something China flatly denies.
Trump’s indictment of Beijing’s attempt to influence the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials indicated to Reuters as a new phase in a growing campaign initiated by Washington to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to run ads to promote their trade activities, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war that has led them to raise import tariff levels on both sides.
China’s countervailing tariffs at the start of the trade war were meant to fall on exporters from states like Iowa, which backed Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former governor of Iowa, which is one of the top exporters of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
As Branstad wrote in an op-ed in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, China “is further intensifying that pressure with ad postings in our free press.”
“To try to spread its propaganda, China’s government uses America’s cherished tradition of free speech and free press by attempting to publish a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“Instead, in the street kiosk where we are here in Beijing, only a few dissenting voices are seen and no real reflection of the disparate views that people in China may have on the worrying trajectory that their country’s economy is taking, as the media is controlled by firm pressure from the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of the most relevant newspapers in China sidestepped the offer to publish" his article, although he did not specify which newspaper it was.
Analysts say Republicans are distancing themselves from women ahead of midterm vote with Kavanaugh debacle
With many big-name Republicans closing ranks in favor of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of sexual assault allegations, analysts have warned there could be a pushback, especially from women, in upcoming midterms.
The emotions surrounding this fact have been very intense and there are many Republicans who have said that they want to move forward with the vote.
“In these kinds of matters it is not possible to back down,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in a paper that was published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Sen. Jeff Flake’s latest attempt to take a stand in favor of the FBI’s investigation would be enough to calm disgruntled voters.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday; they are not going to forget it tomorrow or in November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, said Friday, according to the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters gathered outside the Senate chanted “November is coming!” as Republicans who controlled the Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh’s candidacy, despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the mic reported.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats goes out of the blue,” Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the news site.
“People say the repercussion is already very relevant and indeed it is.
But it could be even older, especially among undecided suburban women and younger voters, ages 18 to 29, who don’t usually vote even if they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony detailing his sexual abuse allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts said there could be a backlash if Republicans went ahead with confirmation.
“This issue has become a big mess for the Republican Party,” Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, NBC News reported.
“It’s no longer just a question of the committee vote or the final vote, or even whether Kavanaugh is on the bench; it’s also a question of how Republicans have handled all of this and how they’ve treated her,” said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA.
Yet Americans seem divided; they don’t know who they should believe after Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimony, though a few more side with the latter.
A new YouGov survey indicates that 41 percent of respondents definitely or likely believe Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent say they definitely or likely believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh likely or definitely lied during his testimony, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s push, the FBI is currently investigating Ford’s statements, as well as those of at least one other whistleblower, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week and said Kavanaugh raped her while drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez alleged that the Supreme Court nominee showed him his genitals at a party while he was studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is considering starting a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a start-up that is trying to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the latest project from the tech legend. A company that builds on Berners-Lee’s Solid open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people will have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is to “dominate the world.”
“It has to be now,” he said of the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology so users can create their own “personal online data storage” or a POD.
It can contain lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser at the same time.
Something that is unique in personal online data storage is that the user is the one who completely decides who can access what type of information.
The company calls it “personal training through data.”
Inrupt’s idea, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, is to incorporate the resources, processes and skills necessary for Solid to reach everyone.
At the moment, the company is formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that IBM bought, some of the developers included in the staff who were hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, tech developers around the world could create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team aren’t talking to “Facebook and Google about whether or not they’re going to make a radical change where all of their business models are completely modified from one day to the next.
"We're not going to ask permission."
In a Medium post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrupt that “his mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid website.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has played a very influential role in the net neutrality debate.
Despite even launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next web age," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The Clergyman Who Won a Victory Cross in World War I
The only Church of England clergyman to win a Victoria Cross during World War I as a combatant has been honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt. Col. Bernard Vann was awarded this decoration on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a sniper killed him four days later and he never knew he had been awarded the highest British military honor.
On Saturday, her two grandchildren discovered a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was “of special symbolism” that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that earned him the decoration for his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann guided his battalion down the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a thick fog and under intense fire from machine guns and cannons".
He then ran to the line of fire and, with the "greatest bravery", advanced the line before reaching a single-handed cannon and shooting down three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just one month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "so big I can never get to his height, but they were very sobering."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid down a wreath after the parade, which featured the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said "it was a privilege for him to be part of the parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is evident when shown such a large support."
MMA fans were up all night for Bellator 206, but only saw Peppa Pig
Imagine staying up all night to watch the entire Bellator 206 so you won’t be allowed to watch the main event in the end.
The San Jose cartel had 13 fights, six included on the main card, and in the UK it was going to be broadcast live at night on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to face off, UK viewers were stunned when the show switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were not surprised after having to stay up until early in the morning just to watch the fight.
A follower on Twitter described the switch to cartoons as “a joke.”
“There’s a government regulation that regulates content that airs after 6 a.m. and it wasn’t appropriate, so they had to switch to children’s programming,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communication, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig, yes."
Bellator chairman Scott Coker said the show would be modified to include British viewers in upcoming editions.
“When I think about the broadcast option, I think it can work,” Coker said.
“But it’s 6 a.m. on a Sunday, so we wouldn’t be able to do it until Sunday at our time, which would already be Monday for them.
We're looking at how to do it.
Believe me, when the programming was changed, a lot of messages were received and not everyone was kind, precisely.
We tried to fix it, because at first we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn’t, it was a government problem.
I can promise next time it won't happen.
We’ll narrow it down to five fights instead of six, which are the ones we’ve normally done. We tried to offer more than usual so that the fans were happy and we passed.
It’s a very unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to the rest because of his sexuality, although this, in turn, was what motivated him to become a winner.
At age 24, she told us she didn’t realize until she got to high school that “they weren’t all like me.”
On Radio 4’s first Desert Island Discs show, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said his intention in talking about gay rights was to broadcast “hope” to other people.
He also told us that becoming a father made him start to downplay the fact of winning in the Olympics.
The usual host of this mythical program, Kirsty Young, will be absent for a few months due to illness.
On Laverne’s first show, Daley, who portrayed himself as an outcast, commented that he felt “inferior” to the rest during his childhood, because “you weren’t socially accepted to like boys and girls.”
He said, “Until today, that feeling of inferiority and being different has really been what has given me the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so he wasn’t disappointed when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medal winner has become a prominent profile of the LGBT movement and his image has been used at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he told it because he felt lucky to live in freedom, without reprisals, and wanted to convey that “hope” to other people.
The three-time world champion said it was also a surprise for him to fall in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, though he specified that the age difference had never been an issue.
“When you live so long from so young” (he went to his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later), it’s hard to find someone the same age who has gone through the same highs and lows as you.
The couple had a son in June who they named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said their “global outlook” had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, all the answers would have been 'I have to win a gold medal,'" he said.
“But you know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is undoubtedly Robbie.”
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and, in fact, one of the last things he asked is if they had the passes for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I wasn’t able to tell him I wasn’t going to be in the front row,” he said.
“I had his hand between mine when he stopped breathing and it wasn’t until that very moment that he stopped breathing and died that I realized he wasn’t invincible,” she said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“At the time I knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life: competing in the pool in front of mine at an Olympic Games, there was nothing better,” he said.
This was also what inspired him when choosing his first song, Proud by Heather Small, which accompanied him in the preparation phase of the Olympic Games. He still got goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, in low form, stayed on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but will have to reverse his form if he wants to prevent it from becoming a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who played in the biannual event to set a record for the 12th time, was ousted by captain Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has done so many times for the United States, the five-time major champion had to settle for cheering in some moments and, in others, trying to perfect his game on the field and thus be able to rectify what ails him.
Never the most direct of drivers, even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not at his best for the Le Golf National course, where the long rough continuously punishes with wrong strokes.
And, if the field is no longer daunting enough, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth game, faces brilliant British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games they’ve played this week.
If the Americans, who were four points lower at the start of the 12 individual games, started impressively, Mickelson’s game could have been decisive.
Furyk showed confidence in his partner, he couldn’t say much more either.
“He understood perfectly the role I had today, slapped me on the back and, surrounding me with his arm, said he would be prepared tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He’s in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably couldn’t imagine playing two games.
I thought it would be more, but that's how it came out and that's how we thought it had to be.
He wants to be there, like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo’s mark of most Ryder Cup games played.
It could be the latest in a Ryder Cup trajectory that has never matched the levels of its individual brand so clearly.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 equals, although Furyk said his presence brought many more intangible values to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to make fun of others; it’s great to have him on the team,” she explained.
“I think younger players have loved to have it as a support, also this week; it was fun.
It brings so much more than just play.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that leadership may soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows very well that, even if you enter with a substantial advantage in the final days of the Ryder Cup, it can easily turn into an uncomfortable tournament.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where one side captained by Seve Ballesteros held a five-point lead over the Americans, but in the end only managed to finish the others off by a minimal margin, winning 141-2-131-2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we did a great tournament in Valderrama; we also did it in Brookline and we lost, we did it in Valderrama and we won, but by far,” Bjorn said, portrayed, after seeing the 2018 generation win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday lead it with a 10-6 at Le Golf National.
History will teach me and everyone that this team is not finished.
You have to give it your all tomorrow.
Get out there and do what you have to do.
This does not end until the points are on the scoreboard.
We have one goal to achieve, which is to win this trophy, and that’s all we have to think about.
I say it all the time, I focus on the 12 players on our team, but we’re very aware of what’s on the other side where they are, no less than the best players in the world.”
Proud of what his players have done on a very tough golf course, Bjorn added: “I wouldn’t want to go ahead.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What prevails tomorrow is individual performances and this is different.
It’s great to share what happens with a teammate when things are going well, but when you’re there alone, you put your full capacity as a golfer to the test.
That’s the message you have to convey to the players, bring out the best in yourself tomorrow.
Now it’s time to put your partner aside, go and get the best out of yourself.”
In front of Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will try to make his players do better individually than they did as pairs, with the exceptions being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been on both ends in the final days of those big tournaments and has been part of the team that was winning at Brookline and then ended up losing when Europe carried out the "Miracle of Medinah".
“I remember every word,” he told us when we asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, managed to motivate his players on the last day.
“We have 12 super important games tomorrow, but we have to start as well as we did at Brookline, as you saw at Medinah.
When we all move in one direction, all the pressure falls on those intermediate parties.
We defined our strategy and made them come out with the feeling that we were going to try to do something magical tomorrow.”
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the fight and face Rory McIlroy in the main match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the second half of the list.
“I went with this group of guys in this order because I think they cover the whole course,” Bjorn said of his individual selections.
Germany's new warship postponed again
The new German Navy frigate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era ships, but it won’t be made until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the ship that heads the new frigates of the Baden-Wurttemberg class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit a statement from a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery annoyed the conclusion of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that the Navy requested in 2007 will replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
We know that they will include a powerful cannon, an array of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies, such as radar, infrared and acoustic signals very reduced.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, so they can be deployed for up to two years away from home ports.
However, ongoing delays have meant that the innovative ships (which were supposed to allow Germany to project its power overseas) will be out of date by the time they start serving, Die Zeit notes.
The ill-fated F125 made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipyard after its delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware flaws" that left the ship virtually useless if sent on a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly significant, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors: half the personnel on the former Bremen-class frigates.
The ship was also found to be overweight, reducing its performance and limiting the Navy’s ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice as heavy as other similar-class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the price of the entire project, including crew training, has also been a problem.
It is believed to have reached ?3.1 billion (US$3.6 billion), instead of the initial ?2.2 billion.
The problems ascribed to the new frigates are of particular relevance in light of recent warnings about reducing Germany’s naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defense committee, acknowledged that the Navy is “running out of ships capable of deployment.”
The officer said the problem has worsened over time, because the old boats were decommissioned, but have not been replaced with others.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates had been able to join the Navy.
The National Trust Spying on the Secret Life of Bats
This new research, which has been conducted in a state of the Scottish Highlands, attempts to discover how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that all that is found will shed more light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and help guide upcoming conservation activities.
The study, conducted by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common bats and sopranos, as well as riverine Daubenton and long-eared brown bats from Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at strategic locations on the property to track the bats’ activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations with portable detectors.
Experts will analyze the sounds picked up in the recordings to find out how often bats call and what species do it.
A habitat report and map will then be produced to create a detailed picture of the environment and its behaviour.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation advisor for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of grasslands and how forests should be maintained for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the UK have declined considerably in the last century.
They are under threat from construction and development affecting their nests and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and electrical wiring can also pose a risk to them, as can insecticidal papers and other chemical treatments of building materials or attacks from domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind,
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes in achieving their goal.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique that locates ants and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the bat issue very seriously.
It has ten trained experts in the field, who regularly conduct surveys, nest inspections, and sometimes rescues.
The organisation has even opened Scotland’s first and only dedicated bat reserve in the state of Threeve in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says it’s the ideal territory for them.
“Here, in Threave, we have a fantastic area for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of veteran trees and all the right habitat.
However, there’s still a lot unknown about bats, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to develop.”
It emphasizes the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance tasks within the properties, since a breeding colony can be unintentionally destroyed and 400 females and offspring could be killed, which would mean annihilating an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or molest them, as well as destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish officer in charge of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to collaborate.
He said: “We still have a lot to learn about bats and many other species that we don’t know how their populations evolve.”
Ronaldo denies rape allegations as his lawyers pursue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape allegations “fake news,” saying people “want to make themselves known” at the expense of their name.
His lawyers have been instructed to denounce the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which was where the statements were published.
The Portugal and Juventus forward is accused of raping an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He is accused of paying her $375,000 to cover up the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
With an Instagram Live video that has already amassed 142 million followers a few hours after the news was published, Ronaldo, 33, branded the report as “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they’ve said today is false,” the five-time Ballon d’Or winner says looking into the camera.
"They just want publicity at the expense of my name.
It's the same old story.
They want to become famous just by mentioning me, but I can’t help it.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” added the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel over allegations that appear in what they have called "an inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy," Reuters reports.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for "moral damages in an amount commensurate with the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident reportedly took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player’s room and there he allegedly anally raped her, according to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga stated that Ronaldo knelt after the alleged incident and told him that he was in a "99 percent" a "good guy" and that he had let him down that "one percent" remaining.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that they took photographs of the wounds in the hospital, but later agreed to reach an out-of-court settlement because she was “terrified of reprisals” and worried “being humiliated in public.”
The 34-year-old says she is trying to annul the deal, as she remains traumatized by the events.
At the time of the alleged assault, Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer he has switched to Juve, an Italian football great for a contract of 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK would always regret losing automakers
The UK would “repent for a lifetime” if it lost its position as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Industry Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "disturbing" that Toyota UK would tell the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, production at its Burnaston factory near Derby would be temporarily halted.
“We need a deal,” Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer said the impact of customs delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could result in job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which makes Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that if Britain breaks with the EU at the end of March, there will be production shutdowns at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive officer in Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers have voiced fears about leaving the EU without a deal, notably in relation to cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns carmakers are referring to revolve around issues that could arise in assembly lines in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is based on the “just-in-time” mode, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU to make cars on demand.
If the UK leaves the European Union without a deal on March 29, there could be a disruption at the border that, according to the sector, could lead to delays and parts shortages.
Toyota would be unable to house the amount of material equivalent to more than a day’s worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and in that case production would be halted.
Mr Clark said Theresa May’s Chequers plan, which sets out future relations with the EU, is “precisely calibrated to avoid such checks at border crossings”.
"We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that not only allows us to get right on track right now but we have to seize the opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
“The evidence from Toyota, among many other manufacturers, is that we need to be able to continue what, so far, has been a tremendously successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota has not been able to say for how long production would stop, but warned that in the long run, added costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite union manager at the plant, said its members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, once those jobs are lost, they never recover.”
A government spokesman said: “We have put in place a precise and convincing plan that outlines our future relations with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump's high-stakes meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could "be postponed another week," as the dispute over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating interference in the Russian election, links between Trump’s aid and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Expectation about whether Trump decides to fire the deputy attorney general or not and thus compromise Mueller’s independence has fueled Washington’s gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein recorded conversations he had with Trump with a microphone he was carrying to try to relegate the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied it was true.
However, last Monday he went to the White House, among news where it is claimed that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump (who at the time was at the United Nations in New York) for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein but the meeting had to be postponed to avoid a conflict with the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh for a week, although this would delay the vote of the full Senate.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared Sunday on Fox News.
Asked about Rosenstein’s meeting, he said: “No date has been set, it could be this week or another could be postponed, considering everything that’s happening with the Supreme Court.
We will decide on the march and I will inform the press, as I usually do."
Some journalists would refute that claim: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since Sept. 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked what the reasons were.
Sanders said the shortage of press conferences was not due to an aversion to TV journalists who act grandiloquently, though he said, "I didn't disagree with the fact that they brag."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
“The president conducts more question-and-answer sessions than any president before him,” he said, while quoting without evidence: “We’ve contrasted those numbers.”
Press conferences will continue, Sanders said, but "if the press has the option of asking the president of the United States directly, I think it's much better than doing them to me.
We tried to do it many times and you’ve seen us do it many times in the last few weeks, so this would replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in public sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him only happen on very rare occasions.
In fact, this week in New York, the president demonstrated why it was so, where he made a light-hearted and sometimes bizarre appearance before the journalists who were gathered there.
Secretary of State for Health writes to NHS Scotland EU workers about their fears of Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health has written to the EU staff working at HHS Scotland to express the country’s gratitude and desire for them to stay with them after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter just six months before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to covering the cost of citizenship applications for EU members working in non-centrally dependent public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "Over the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on exit have continued in which the expected decisions were chosen to be taken this autumn.
However, the UK government has also stepped up preparations around a possible no-deal scenario.
I know all this must be very disconcerting for you.
And that is why I would like to reiterate now how much I value the contribution of each staff member, regardless of nationality.
Professionals across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and enhance the work of the health service, benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is, without a doubt, your home and we would love to continue to count on you.”
Christion Abercrombie is having emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers player Christion Abercrombie had emergency surgery after suffering a head injury on Saturday when they lost 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before the break.
“He came to the band and collapsed right there,” Reed said.
Both trainers and medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie in the band line before placing him on a stretcher and taking him for an in-depth examination.
A Tennessee State staffer told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there were no details about the type of injury yet or the damage caused" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when it happened.
Abercrombie, redshirt sophomore, is playing his first season with Tennessee State after being traded from Illinois.
He made five tackles on Saturday before leaving the field, totaling 18 for the entire season.
Foreigners will be subject to a higher estate transfer tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreigners will be subject to a higher farm transfer tax when they buy a property in the UK and the extra money raised from this measure will be used to shelter the homeless, according to new plans by the Conservatives.
The change will neutralize the success garnered by Corbyn’s offensive to appeal to younger voters.
Increased estate transfer tax will be imposed on those who are not paying taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to 120 million euros per year to be allocated to the "homeless"
Additional money raised by raising the estate transfer tax to foreign buyers of property in the UK will go towards aid to the “homeless”, Theresa May announced today.
The move is meant as an attempt to neutralize the success Jeremy Corbyn is reaping with his promises to provide more affordable housing to appeal to younger voters and harass those with higher incomes.
The increase in the farm transfer tax will be levied on people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK and that money will go towards incentivising government policy to combat the problem of begging on the streets.
The surcharge, which is a supplement to the current transmission tax, including the increase in levels that was introduced two years ago on second-hand homes and the “buy-to-let” system, could be up to 3%.
The Treasury expects to raise up to 120 million euros a year with this change.
An estimated 13% of London’s new-build properties are bought by non-UK residents, driving up prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to access affordable housing.
Many of the wealthiest areas of the country (especially in the capital) have become “ghost cities” due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the transmission tax in order to help young people buy their first home.
He accused big construction companies of maintaining very high prices on properties by greedily buying land with no intention of using it and urged Mrs May to eliminate quotas on affordable housing to solve the “shameful housing problem” in Britain.
Mr Corbyn has announced a number of very attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to wrongful evictions.
It also proposes to give local powers more powers to build new housing.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my position as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving the lives of every new generation.
And that means fixing the housing market, which is so devastated.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that people who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, can buy homes more easily than the British working class.
The dream of having a home has become too elusive for many people and the humiliation of having to sleep on the street is still too real.”
Jack Ross: 'My main goal is to run Scotland'
The Sunderland coach says his "primary goal" is to become Scotland coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is excited about the prospect of revitalising the north-east club, which is currently in third place in League One, three points behind the first.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after bringing St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I only got a B cap,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father as a kid and it’s something that has always made me want to come back.
That opportunity will only become a reality, however, if I manage to run a club successfully.”
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he didn't feel any fear when he switched to such established names at such a big club, after rejecting proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Right now, success for me is measured by whether I can bring this club back to the Premier League.
"The structure and facilities of this club certainly correspond to those of the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to achieve, but I could only consider that I have achieved my goal here when I can get the club back to where it needs to be."
Ross has only been a coach for three years, after a stint as an assistant at Dumbarton and a 15-month stint on the Hearts coaching staff.
Afterwards, he helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third division and made St. Mirren go from being on the verge of relegation to winning the championship the following season.
In fact, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever before during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real crossroads,” he recalled in reference to when he took over the Alloa.
“I always believed that direction was what was best for me, much more than playing.
It may sound weird, because it was good, I was able to make a very good living with it and I enjoyed some epic moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to face a lot of things every week.
I still suffer from the stress and pressure of that job; however, in the direction I feel good.
I always wanted to train and now I have managed to do it, it is the time of my adult life in which I have felt better, without a doubt.

According to a survey, the perfect time for a pint is 5.30 p.m. on Saturday
The summer heat wave has boosted profits in British pubs struggling to survive, but concentrated all the pressure on restaurant chains.
Pub and bar groups saw their sales rise 2.7 percent in July, while restaurant profits fell 4.8 percent, the figures showed.
Peter Martin, from CGA, which compiled the figures, said: “The heat of the day and the fact that England are still in the World Cup have still kept the pattern from the previous month of June, when pubs increased their profits by 2.8%, although restaurants have fallen even more.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant business in June was even worse in July.
Pubs and bars serving mostly drinks had their strongest month, compared to most restaurants, where they cut profits.
Pubs serving mostly meals also suffered from the heat, though not as drastically as restaurant operators.
It seems that people just want to go out and drink.
In managed bars and pubs, beverage sales rose by up to 6.6% during the month, while meals fell by 3%.
Paul Newman of RSM’s hospitality and leisure analysts said: “These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of very important social or sporting events remain the most relevant factors when it comes to sales in the market for activities outside the home.
Not surprisingly, restaurant groups continue to struggle, although the 4.8 percent drop in sales compared to last year is going to be especially painful in the face of continued cost pressures.
The long, hot summer couldn’t have come at a worse time for food operators and time will tell if the milder temperatures we’ve had in August will provide the relief they need.
The overall increase in sales at pubs and restaurants, including new ones that have opened, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slow decline in brand introductions.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which oversees sales in the UK restaurant, bar and pub sector, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of more than EUR 9 billion and is the market benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts behind their parents’ backs
One in five children (some as young as 11) have secret social media accounts behind the backs of their parents and teachers, a survey reveals.
Survey of 20,000 high school students reveals growth in fake Instagram pages
The news has heightened fears that sexual content will be published.
20% of students claimed to have a “primary” account that they show to their parents
One in five children (some as young as 11) create social media accounts that hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid growth that has been experienced in fake Instagram accounts, a reference site for sharing photos.
The news has heightened fears of sexual content being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they had a healthy “primary” account that they showed to their parents, while they had private ones.
A mother who chanced upon her 13-year-old daughter’s secret site watched as a teenager encouraged others to “rape me.”
The research, conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40% of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: “It’s alarming that so many teens are tempted to create spaces on the Internet where their parents and teachers can’t find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" in the directive of the athletics federation of Scotland
Eilidh Doyle has been chosen to serve on the board of Scotland’s athletics federation as a non-executive director at the management body’s annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most awarded track and field athlete and its president, Ian Beattie, described the change as a great opportunity for those who want the sport to benefit from her great experience internationally over the past decade.
“Eilidh is recognised and respected across the athletics community in Scotland, the UK and around the world, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit enormously from having her on board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I like being the spokesperson for the athletes and I look forward to being able to contribute things and help develop the sport in Scotland.
The American, who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta among the four golds he won and is now a regular BBC expert, suffered a transient ischemic attack that left him unable to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to doctors, only time would determine whether or to what extent I would recover.
It has been exhausting, but I managed to recover completely, I had to learn to walk again and I am currently doing agility exercises.
Thank you for the messages and words of encouragement!”
The announcement of the breast pump where mothers are compared to cows divides opinion on the Internet
A breast-feeding company has divided public opinion on the Internet with an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers to cows they milk.
To mark the launch of what is in theory the “world’s first silent breast pump,” consumer technology company Elvie ran an ad inspired by a somewhat ironic music video showing mothers counting on the freedom the new breast pump gives them.
Four real women dance in a barn filled with hay as a dance floor, along with some cows, with lyrics such as: "Yes, I milk myself, but I have no tail" and "Just in case you haven't noticed, they are not udders, they are my breasts".
The chorus goes on to say, “Order them, milk them, I’m feeding your babies, milk them, milk them, I’m milking my women.”
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, has created a lot of controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions from all kinds of people who have seen it, where many say it manages to focus on the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
"A very unfortunate decision to put cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant before giving birth to be able to produce milk, with the exception that they take away their babies days after giving birth,” one person wrote.
The Elvie breast pump fits discreetly in a lactation bra (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented: “Traumatic for the mother and for the baby.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who do stay with their babies?”
Another comment was, "What a wild ad."
However, other people defended the ad, such as a woman who admitted that the song was "funky."
“I think it’s a great idea.
If I still sucked, I'm sure I'd have one.
Using the pump, I felt totally like a cow.
The announcement is a little crazy, but I don’t think about it anymore.
It’s a product genius,” one woman told us.
Another person told us: “It’s a funny ad aimed at mothers who use a lactation pump (sometimes in the workplace or in public toilets), which makes them feel like cows.
The announcement neither praises nor judges the dairy sector."
At the end of the video, the group of women show that they have been dancing with the discreet bombs placed inside the bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the perception that many women who pump their milk say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is totally silent, has no wires or tubes, and discreetly engages inside the breastfeeding bra, which makes its users able to move around, hold their babies and even go outside with the pump running.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, comments: “The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative release.
Showing the parallels between expressive women and dairy cows, we aimed to draw attention to the use of lactation pumps and their challenges, while demonstrating in an entertaining and forthcoming way the incredible feeling of freedom offered by the new pump.
This is not the first time the Elvie bomb has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two walked down the runway for designer Marta Jakubowski while wearing the product.
Hundreds of Immigrant Children Discreetly Displaced at Texas Border Camp
The number of immigrant children in detention has increased significantly, despite the fact that the monthly influx at the border has remained almost at the usual levels, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration are complicating the possibility of sponsoring these children.
Traditionally, most godparents, who were also undocumented immigrants at the time, feared that proposing to take in a child would jeopardize their own stay in the country.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that prospective sponsors and other adult members of their families should submit their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with government immigration entities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who requested to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
“About 80 percent of the sponsors or their family members are in the country illegally, and a large portion of them are criminal immigrants.
So, we continue to pursue these people,” Albence said.
In their efforts to prosecute children faster, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than 60 days, which was the previous rule, according to the shelter workers.
Many of them will testify by videoconference, rather than in person, to defend their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those deemed unfit for amparo will be deported as soon as possible.
According to shelter workers and the system reports that have emerged in recent months, the longer they remain in custody, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent outbursts or attempted escapes.
According to advocates, these concerns are further heightened in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where signs of discomfort in these children are more likely to be overlooked because of their size.
Also, moving to the camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could cause them a trauma that many are already suffering.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish "occupation forces" to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homes, despite the country’s war being in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that the issue “will be dealt with accordingly.”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and several million have been uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight this holy battle until we purge all Syrian territories” from both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The US has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly providing training and advice to Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the conditions were right for them to return and blamed “some Western countries” for “sowing irrational fears” that the refugees would decide to stay out of the country.
“We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have already warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib’s last major rebel stronghold has created an opportunity to force political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a full-scale assault by Syrian and Russian forces in the province, home to three million people.
However, Moualem has made clear that the deal had "clear deadlines" and has expressed hope that military action will focus on jihadists, including fighters of the Nusra Front (linked to Al-Qaeda), who "will be eradicated."
Staffan de Mistura, a U.N. special envoy, hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for an election.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, arguing that the panel’s work should be restricted “to reviewing the articles of the current constitution” and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
By that logic, Trump would win reelection in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers will surely expect, an impeachment or a scandal prematurely ends his presidency.
This would be without a doubt "The most dramatic end to a presidency ever seen!"
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the spectators.
Since 2014, prime time ratings have doubled to 1.05 million for CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million primetime viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” has topped cable ratings with 3.5 million viewers for top nightly news programs.
“It’s a strange attraction that we still can’t understand,” says Neal Baer, author-producer of “Designated Survivor,” an ABC drama series about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club,” has another theory.
He remembers a taxi ride he made in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told him he would vote for Trump.
Why? he asked.
"Because it makes me laugh," was Scovell's response.
Chaos is always on the rise in the entertainment world.
Obviously, and unlike anything else seen on television, the arguments coming out of Washington could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, the possibility that immigrant families might be reunited, or the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
However, the information pushes the boundaries when you realize that you’ve been watching a panel of experts for six hours debating the use of “deep-back” sources used by Bob Woodward for his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich leather jacket (“a garment of unconscionable pride,” in the words of The Washington Post) and the implications of Trumpy Daniels’ ludicrous descriptions.
As far as I'm concerned, I'll never see Super Mario the same way again.
“Offering something new every night, it’s partly what makes everything look like a reality show,” says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” when he tells us about the alternate cast of Trump’s show and its daily plot twists (either getting into a fight with the NFL or praising Kim Jong-un).
You can’t afford to miss an episode if you don’t want to be left behind.
When I went to speak with Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a sunny 27-degree day on the north coast of Kauai, but he was holed up inside watching MSNBC while filming CNN.
He couldn’t get off the TV, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
“I remember back in the day we were doing all these crazy programs and people were telling us that was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss tells me.
“I thought it was all a joke, but in the end it turned out they were right.”

Foreign money flows in the House’s tightest midterm elections
It’s no surprise the influx of money is coming to Pennsylvania’s 17th district, thanks to the restructuring of a congressional district with two candidates seeking re-election to the same seat.
This newly redesigned residential district has Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another candidate for re-election, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania’s former 12th district, a district that largely overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former districts had been unconstitutionally rigged in favor of Republicans.
The race for the new 17 has triggered a campaign finance contest between the main financial arms of the parties, the National Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb’s name became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a special election held in March for Pennsylvania’s 18th Congressional District.
That seat had been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political pundits have given Democrats a slight edge.
The U.S. considered penalizing El Salvador for its support for China, though it later backed down.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight rejection by Washington.
Trump had an affable meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and occupied a hotel in Panama until associates evicted the Trump Organization management team.
State Department officials decided to return the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “recent decisions to cease recognizing Taiwan,” Heather Nauert, the department’s spokeswoman, said in a statement this month.
But it was only decided to sanction El Salvador, which had already received aid of around 140 million U.S. dollars 2017 for, among other issues, drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial aid and restrictions on certain visas, would have been very painful for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and crime.
As internal meetings progressed, U.S. and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent emigration to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made clear their intention was for the conference to go ahead, ending any sanctions consideration for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October and which, he said, is seen as a sign of the importance the administration has given to the meeting.
The three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further threats or punishment from Washington.
A Bolton White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.
His explanations were corroborated by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next step envisaged could be special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, of which considerable evidence is already in the public record.
Mueller is also thought to be leading this investigation into the possibility that the Trump campaign worked in parallel with Russia in its attack on our election.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will be held accountable to that chamber, just as he prepares to run again before voters, and perhaps eventually before a jury of his peers.
This is a lot of conditionals, and with it I don’t suggest that Trump’s downfall is inevitable, nor that of his counterparts in Europe.
We will all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the duration of the contest.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, only the West had to resist him and support the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these tipping points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans now face several of these tipping points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been at a good one since this newspaper reported that last year he had suggested secretly recording the president and had speculated about his inability to hold office.
Rosenstein says The Times’ explanation is not accurate.
“How will we respond if the new investigation the F.B.I. has requested into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if his position on the Supreme Court is confirmed despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
On top of all this, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will be accountable to Trump?
If we fail these tests, we will face a long winter for democracy.
But, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I think we will not fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my ambassador’s home.
He managed to survive, he emigrated to the United States, and 60 years later he sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the same table adorned with a swastika.
With that heritage, how am I not going to be optimistic about our future?”

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistic against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will play on Thursday at home against Rapid Vienna, knowing that a win over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier in the month, will put them in a strong position to qualify in Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until a 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for bigger things.
“We managed to get a good point, as Villarreal are a good team,” the 31-year-old said.
“We started the game believing we could get something and came away with a point.
Maybe we could have achieved the victory in the end, but overall the draw was perhaps a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but after the break we went all out and we were the best team.
This Thursday we will have another great European night.
I hope that we can achieve all three points, but it will be a difficult match because they already got a good result in the previous match. But, with all the public supporting us, I am sure that we will be able to move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough with my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but now you can feel a general atmosphere that everything will be fine.
The team is doing well, the guys are enjoying a lot and we are having a good workout.
I’m hopeful that we can move forward, leave last season behind and achieve success.”
The fear of retirement savings is making some women lose sleep
Despite the fact that survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people talk about this with their family members.
About half of the people who took part in the Nationwide study said they did talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they’re not taking the steps to have this conversation,” Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance company Nationwide, tells us.
This is the way to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You won’t be able to prepare your family to care for you if you don’t express your wishes well in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to talk about where and how to get care, as those options can be a factor in determining cost.
Incorporate in the conversion to your financial advisor, as it can also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Your long-term care financing options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash value hybrid life insurance policy to help you cover expenses or insure yourself with your own savings, as long as you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents – get ahead of legal battles.
Take care of obtaining a health care power of attorney to appoint a trusted person to oversee your health care and make sure that professionals comply with their own wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
You can also prepare a power of attorney for your finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure your bills are paid if you become incapacitated.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine your aging father has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Describe all these details in a written plan so that you are always ready.
“It’s not just finances that are at stake: Which doctors do you have to deal with?” asks Martin.
"What medications are you taking?
Who will take care of the dog?
You have to have everything planned.”
Man with carbine shot multiple times in Ilfracombe
A man with a carbine has been shot several times as he walked home after leaving at night.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which occurred around 2:30 a.m., as a “random act.”
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not fatal and the police have appealed to potential witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
With communications blocked, aid officials have been unable to obtain any information from the regency of Donggala, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here you can see some important details about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, which lies at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency that extends along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, which is a hierarchically inferior administrative region to the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the mainstays of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, an area of high seismic activity, and often suffers earthquakes frequently.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of Indonesia’s Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami on 26 December that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast. More than half of the victims occurred in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
There were hundreds of fatalities on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coastline, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands near Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters that tore apart dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as he recalled the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time it did not cause any tsunami, but the collapse of buildings caused the death of more than 100 people.
2018: The tourist island of Lombok (Indonesia) had a series of large earthquakes that killed more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake devastated thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily evicted.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to the report released Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance of his tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone away from her.
Palin has been ordered remanded in custody at Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on an unsecured $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pleaded "definitely innocent" when asked to testify, the network reported.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, meaning he could spend up to a year in prison and be fined $250,000.
He has also been charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interfering in reporting a crime of domestic violence and possessing a weapon in a state of drunkenness, in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed he punched him in the face.
Veterans groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have fallen and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck just off central Sulawesi, which lies northeast of Jakarta, Indonesia’s capital.
There are several videos circulating on social networks that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Exceptionally Seek Death Penalty for Terror Attack Suspect in New York
New York federal prosecutors are seeking capital punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people, an exceptional punishment that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental van to carry out a bike lane attack on Lower Manhattan’s West Side Highway last October, knocking down pedestrians and cyclists in his path.
To justify a death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and “intentionally” caused serious bodily injury, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges carry a possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury presented Saipov with a 22-count indictment that included eight counts of murder with the help of organized crime, often used by federal prosecutors in these cases, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation," according to prosecutors, who described the way Saipov carried it out as "heinous, cruel and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since the Southern District of New York last prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. This marriage was executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, demonstrated his lack of remorse during the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
According to police, he told investigators he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that for his attack he was inspired by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also requested that the ISIS flag be raised in his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to the 22-count indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defense attorneys representing Saipov, said they are “obviously disappointed” with the prosecution’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a life sentence without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for everyone involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should take over Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to “mobilize the people’s army” today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians had to “feel the heat” from eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May’s MPs suggested he should take over negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that the UK would have “already left” if Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But Prime Minister May’s challenge to reconcile her divided ranks has been further highlighted when a group of pro-remain Tories have joined an opposing anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep up the compromise plan that was signed at Chequers amid attacks from Brexiteers, her opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted that they will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the backlash, and force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between their package and “chaos”.
Deputy Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to reject Chequers’ plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been given a responsible seat in the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have come out by now,” he said.
This Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: “I’m going to defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers.”
In his statement of opposition to the EU, he said: “We have not fought in world wars to be subservient.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and we want to stay in the European Union is completely false.”
Pro-Brexit Tory Andrea Jenkyns was also at the rally, where she told reporters: “I only say one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The general public doesn’t like the Chequers plan, the opposition isn’t going to vote for it, and it’s not popular with our party and our activists, who are the ones who actually take to the streets and vote for us in the first place.
Forget about Chequers and start listening."
In a message to May, he added: “Prime Ministers hold their posts when they deliver on their promises.”
Farage told the rallies that politicians would have to be made to “feel the heat” if it were to be seen that they would betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They are trying to betray Brexit and today we are here to tell them that we will not let them get away with it.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
“We will mobilize the people’s army of this country that gave us the victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, pro-stayers toured the streets of Birmingham ahead of the two-hour rally in the city center.
Some activists waved Tories Against Brexit banners after the group’s unveiling this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they had with a party app during the opening of the conference.
“These are the same people who tell us that they can deploy the IT systems and all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, for borders in harmony, for borderless free trade in Ireland.”
“It’s a total farce.
There is nothing that can be considered a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren considers every possibility of running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "consider every possibility of running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a town hall meeting held Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican state Rep., who was co-chairman of Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There has been considerable speculation that Warren will face Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon’s event in Holyoke was his thirty-sixth meeting with voters using the municipal format since Trump took office.
An assistant asked him if he planned to run for president.
Warren responded that the time has come for “women to go to Washington to fix our irregular government, and that includes a woman at the top.”
One Arrested for Gun Murder of LSU Sims Player
Baton Rouge police announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, the LSU basketball player, on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at a news conference at 11 a.m.
They had posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying a man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that ultimately led to his death," Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday, for 247sports.
Wayde went to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
During questioning, Simpson admitted to having been at the crime scene, in possession of a gun and to having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and was arrested at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 1.98-meter-tall Baton Rouge native, played in 32 games last season, starting 10 of them, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after team orders hand him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team’s orders would have an important role in the race.
From pole, Bottas got off to a good start and almost threw Hamilton into oblivion by defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his team-mate.
Vettel was the first to pit and let Hamilton race in the group queue, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes came out hard one lap later and got behind Vettel, but Hamilton got ahead after an action with the wheels almost glued together that caused the Ferrari driver to reluctantly leave the interior free at the risk of resisting after a double move to defend himself in turn three.
Max Verstappen, who turned 21 that day, started from the back row of the grid and placed seventh at the end of the first lap.
He then led a large part of the race as he clung to his tyres to achieve a quick finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth position.
Finally, he pits on lap 44, but was unable to increase his pace on the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen regained fourth position.
It’s been a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman to let me through.
The team has done an exceptional job to get a perfect match," Hamilton said.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Sen. Dianne Feinstein at a rally Saturday for her insistence that she didn’t leak Christine Blasey Ford’s letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, commenting that what was happening in the Senate showed that there are people who are “bad, disgusting, and false.”
“The only thing that could happen, and the good thing that’s happening these last few days in the Senate, is when you see the rage, when you see people who are bad, disgusting, and false,” he said.
“When you read the posts and the leaks, and then they say, ‘But I didn’t.
I didn't."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember his answer... did you leak the document? - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't filter it."
Well, wait a minute.
No, we haven't leaked it," he added while imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford in July and leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied the leak came from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't leak her story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
“She asked me to keep it confidential and so I did.”
But his refusal did not seem to sit well with the president, who during Saturday night’s rally commented: “I’ll tell you one thing: that’s been really bad body language.”
Maybe he didn’t, but that’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested Democrats were using the allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
You see evil and disgust, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars repaired Friday's Elite League loss to the Belfast Giants by winning the second leg on Saturday 5-3 at Dundee.
The Giants got a two-goal lead thanks to attacks by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie won the home tie before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured his victory.
This was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe’s men, who were coming off beating Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth game of the season between the two teams, of which the Giants won the previous three games.
Dwyer’s first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) thanks to an assist from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford provided the assistance for Beauvillier to double the lead four minutes later.
In what can be considered a very lively opening period, Sullivan put the home team back up to play in the 13:10 minute before Matt Marquardt attended Cownie to equal the match in the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took advantage before the first half when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard once again matched the match with a goal in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game by reaching the end of the second half and secured the victory with their team’s fifth goal as the end neared.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play Milton Keynes at home in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies so hundreds can escape in earthquake plane
An Indonesian air traffic controller is being hailed as a hero after he died after making sure a plane carrying hundreds of people was able to safely take off.
More than 800 people were killed and many are missing after a large-scale earthquake struck Sulawesi island on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to batter the area and many are trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
Despite fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu control tower.
It stood firm to make sure Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian broadcaster ABC News reported.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, he passed away this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“Our hearts are broken upon hearing this,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach several thousand people, with the national disaster mitigation agency saying access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“It is believed that the number of victims will continue to increase, since there were still many bodies under the ruins and many people could not be contacted,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves as high as six meters have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass burial on Sunday.
Aid and supplies are being brought in on military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance arrives with more bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini-markets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help the survivors as much as possible, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could have been much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask everyone to work day and night to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?” reported CNN.
Indonesia had already been hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now says man missing after plane crash in lagoon
The airline, which operates a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says one man has disappeared, having said all 47 passengers and crew had evacuated the sinking plane safely.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon it could not account for a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats were used to help rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said Friday that seven people had been taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had passed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane arrived very low.
“That’s an extremely good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes says he and other travelers made it through waist-high water to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said flight attendants panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors doing nearby dock improvement work also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to ferry people ashore before the plane sank about 100 feet underwater.
Aviation safety net data indicates that 111 people have died in airline crashes registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
An analyst presents the chronology of the night a woman was burned alive
Prosecutors wrapped up their arguments Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He exposed to the jury how he used mobile phone records to chain the movements of Quinton Tellis, the 29-year-old defendant, and Jessica Chambers, the 19-year-old victim, the night she died.
Rowlett said she received location data from several mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, thus contradicting her previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his mobile phone had been with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford took the stand on Saturday and testified that he had not been to the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in the Sanford van that night, Sanford said he was “lying, because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had met Chambers about two weeks before his death.
Mobile phone records indicated they met only a week earlier.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
“He erased it from his life,” Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would be left to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
A hip hop trio wants to fill their music with positive messages to challenge the genre’s negative image.
Bristol’s The High Breed says hip hop has moved away from its origins in political messaging and social issues.
They want to get back to their roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Performers such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
New York nanny sues couple for firing her after ‘racist’ text
A New York nanny is going to sue a couple for discriminatory dismissal after mistakenly receiving a text message from the mother complaining that she was “another black person.”
The couple denies it is racist and likens the lawsuit to a case of “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dismay when she discovered that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black on her first day of work in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OTHER BLACK PERSON," Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing her blunder, an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice claiming that her previous nanny, who was African-American, had done a lousy job and was instead expecting a Filipina, the New York Post reported.
Maurice was paid for the day’s work and sent home at Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for compensation for dismissal with intent to receive compensation of $350 a day for the six-month internal work position for which he had been hired, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show you that things are not done that way,” he told The Post on Friday, adding that “I know it’s a case of discrimination.”
The couple responded to claims that they are racist by saying that the termination of Maurice's employment was most reasonable, as they feared they would not be able to trust her after they had offended her.
“My wife had sent him something she didn’t want to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racists," husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you leave your children in the hands of someone with whom you have been rude, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn?
Come on!"
Comparing the lawsuit as an “extortion,” Plasco said his wife had given birth to the baby two months earlier and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Are you going to go for someone like that?
That’s not a very decent thing,” the investment banker added.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion has rushed to denounce the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and their logic.
Paddington editors feared readers wouldn’t identify with a talking bear, new letter reveals
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It was hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone reading it for the first time before it was published.
It’s funny to know now what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
Saying his father, who had previously worked as a BBC cameraman for a toy teddy bear to write the children's book, was confident his work would be rejected, he said the 60th anniversary of the books' publication was "bittersweet" after his death last year.
Of Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of our family,” she added that her father was very proud of his ultimate success.
“He was a very calm man and he didn’t like to brag,” she said.
“But since Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who achieved something important: you’re proud of him, even if it’s not really your credit.
I think he saw Paddington’s success that way.
Although it was his creation and the product of his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“Nad was calling regularly to say that the situation was really bad, that he wasn’t expected to make it,” Ms. Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got a call from Nad to tell me I was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And so I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors had given him to keep his heart pumping slowly depleted and left his system.
She had died prematurely and everything was turning off.
I could only sit there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn’t howl, scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I really had to stand firm.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering from the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, oblivious to the terrible experience she was going through.
“No one knew,” he said.
“I bowed my head and tears fell on me all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but it was on the flight that I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
I needed all my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her.”
Women in mourning put cards to prevent suicides is a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicides are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at age 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I feel every day,” he said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said his smile lit up anywhere.”
However, he quit the job before he died, as he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found him after taking his own life.
Ms. Davis said, "I am continually concerned that it may have repercussions."
Davis created the cards “so people know that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t sit in silence, you have to talk about it.”
Ms. Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner with whom she had been with for 15 years, shortly after her mother’s death.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed or anything like that,” she says.
“A couple of days before Christmas we noticed his change of attitude.
Christmas Day reached its lowest point: when the children opened their presents, he didn’t even look at them.”
He said his death was a great trauma for them, but that they have to overcome it: “It leaves a void in the whole family.
He has left us shattered.
But we all have to keep fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as FBI probe begins
“I thought if we could really get something like what I was requesting (a time-limited, limited-scope investigation), maybe we could bring some unity,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was “going downhill” amid a partisan standstill.
Why didn’t Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI investigation to take place?
Its refusal is due entirely to chronology.
With only five weeks until the midterm elections on Nov. 6, if Republicans are expected to do poorly, their attempts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country will be severely weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling senators, pressuring them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife Ashley, who was the President’s personal secretary.
What happens once the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It’s not yet clear whether Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm it for the Supreme Court.
Numbers of North Korean defectors 'fall' with Kim
The number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker has said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern Unification Ministry, said there were 1,127 defections last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China, and high fees charged by human traffickers, have been key factors.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly on the matter.
The vast majority of northern defectors are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers defectors to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees, and they are often repatriated.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on denuclearization negotiations.
This came after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, who broadly agreed to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress.
“Without U.S. confidence, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will by no means be the first to unilaterally disarm,” Ri said in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and says he’s unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh a “hysterical” and unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but think that if a woman had acted that way, they would have said she’s hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh used emotion to deny allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when the two were teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and choking as he talked about his family and his high school years.
On the committee, he also explicitly condemned Democrats, calling the allegations against him "grotesque and clearly coordinated smears" organized by some angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that, in her opinion, Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court, because it showed his bias against Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with those statements with and the way he has persecuted the Clintons and Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi objected when asked if she would challenge Kavanaugh if he was confirmed in office and Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll just say one thing: if he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he won’t be fit not only to be on the Supreme Court, he won’t even be fit to be on the court he’s in now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the Washington D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible sentences against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as he is considered to be a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time for a hysterical, impartial person to go to court and expect us to think it’s all right,” Pelosi said.
And women have to take it.
It’s a justified diatribe, it’s months and years of fury overflowing, and she can’t let go without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s that weird, right?”
He went on to say, “I was really helped by a woman who was an executive at a company and who told me that she was crying when she got angry too, but that she had developed a technique that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, ‘Maybe you think I’m sad because I’m crying.
No, I’m angry.”
And then I went on with what I was doing.
I thought it was great."
Tears are allowed as a way out for rabies in part because they are basically not well understood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, was once I found myself crying with inexpressible rage. An older woman, a serious manager of whom I had always had a slight fear, grabbed me by the butt and dragged me to a staircase.
“Don’t let them ever see you cry,” he told me.
"They have no idea you're furious.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be glad because they think you’ve been cornered.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential races.
In 1987, when Hart was caught on an extramarital affair aboard a ship called Monkey Business for which she had to withdraw from the presidential race, it occurred to Schroeder, deeply frustrated, that there was no reason not to explore the idea of her running for president herself.
“It wasn’t a well-premeditated decision,” he told me with a laugh 30 years later.
“There were already seven candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was one more candidate.
Someone referred to us as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
As the campaign was already well advanced, he fell behind in fundraising, so he was promised that he would not re-enter the race unless he raised $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to the men, gave her only $250.
“Do you think I have a discount?” he asked.
When she delivered her speech to announce that she would not have a formal campaign, she was so overcome by emotions (gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration over a system that made it difficult to raise funds and focused on attracting voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism), that she choked.
“The logical thing would have been to think that he had had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder said, recalling the press reaction.
“You might have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are you going to put on my tombstone?
"Did he cry?"
US-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The first salvos of the U.S.-China trade war were deafening, and while the battle is far from over, a break between the countries could benefit Beijing, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by slapping tariffs on major Chinese exports such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion ($150 billion) in goods, taxing half of the goods entering the United States from China.
On all occasions, Beijing has retaliated by imposing tariffs of five to ten percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to match U.S. attacks, and the world’s second-most powerful economy is unlikely to loosen anytime soon.
Getting Washington to back down would mean bowing to demands, but publicly submitting to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressures of the U.S. trade war could positively help China in the long run by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick policy decision in Washington or Beijing can set the stage for a plummeting economy in either country is actually far more dangerous than viewers have recognized so far,” said Abigail Grace, Asia-focused research associate at the Center for New American Security.
Syria ready for refugees to return, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild a country devastated by a war that has been raging for more than seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country’s conditions were improving.
“The situation on the ground today is more stable and secure thanks to the progress that has been made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to try to restore normalcy.
All the conditions for the voluntary return to the country of refugees who had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods are already in place.
The UN estimates that, since the war began in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
There are another six million people still living in the country who are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem acknowledged that the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he also stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that promoted the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the North American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, just outside Paris (France).
The U.S. now has six straight losses on European soil since it last won a Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight for most of the tournament, threw his point of exit to the water in the hole 16 par 3, thus admitting his defeat to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all his rounds, becoming one of only four players to ever score a 5-0-0 since the tournament’s current format began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5 and 4 against the player with the lowest classification of the European team, the Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
World number one Dustin Johnson fell 2-1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
Sergio Garcia, a veteran who already has eight Ryder Cups, became the European with the most victories of the tournament of all time, with 25.5 points in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t help it today.
It's been a tough year.
I am totally grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very, very happy that I was able to get the cup back.
It is an achievement for the whole team and I am very happy to have been able to help," said an excited Garcia after the victory of the European team.
Now he passes the torch to his compatriot John Rahm, who already defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods by 2 and 1 in a singles match on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, as I’ve grown up watching this man,” said 23-year-old golfer John Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in his Ryder Cup career.
This is a strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, trailing only Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had to fight all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance: "I'm very proud of these guys, they've never stopped fighting.
There was a moment this morning when we warmed up the situation in Europe.
But we spoiled it.
I want to congratulate Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players have played a very good game.
We will regroup, meet with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and move forward.
I love these 12 guys very much and I am proud to be their captain.
Now it's our turn to bow our heads.
They have overtaken us.”
