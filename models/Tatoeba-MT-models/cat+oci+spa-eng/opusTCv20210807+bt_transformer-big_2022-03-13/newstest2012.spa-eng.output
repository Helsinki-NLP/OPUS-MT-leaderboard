Parliament did not support an amendment to release Tymoshenko
Ukraine’s parliament has rejected a proposal to repeal the amendment to the section of the penal code condemning opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment would open the doors to the release of the former prime minister, but parliamentarians rejected the proposal to reduce penalties for economic crimes in the second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for allegedly signing a disadvantageous agreement with Russia for Ukraine on the purchase of natural gas.
The sentence is not yet final, the appeals court has an obligation to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that it was a political revenge of the regime, and even in the West doubts have arisen about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Criminal Code condemning the former prime minister was supported by 147 deputies in the vote.
For its approval, 226 votes were required.
The victory of Libya
The history of the Libyan liberation, or the Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him there is no war.
It remains to be determined who is the winner.
As usual in the region, the Islamists won the elections, but now it is a question of whether they are moderates or radicals.
The National Transitional Council has brought into force the traditional Sharia law, which we already know in a way.
Libya will become a crime-free country, because thieves will have their hands cut off.
Women can already forget to emancipate themselves and apostates waiting for their execution and so on.
Instead of the dictator’s person, the society, composed of warrior tribes, will be united by the Koran.
In Libya, an order will be established that we cannot imagine and certainly cannot.
However, our way of life is neither the only nor objectively the best and probably did not suit the Libyans already mentioned.
The truth is that it is not surprising that Islamic fighters gratefully accepted the help of infidel dogs.
The only justification was that, from their point of view, the NATO attacks were not directed by an American general, but great is Allah, whose greatness they celebrated after each of the successful interventions.
When looking for winners in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are caught in a shootout used by Islamists and our politicians to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally with no guarantees of profit.
After the recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we did not occupy Libya militarily.
In this case, the locals do not have a problem expelling the "crusaders"
But, without occupation, will the oil companies get hold of Libyan black gold only with good words?
It is quite possible not, but it may be that finally the West can boast of protecting human rights.
As long as the followers of Shariah do not cross over to us.
A new era of crisis begins
France and the rest of Europe are on the hunt for investors
A statistical whirlwind has spread across Europe
Individual states have published their GDP data for Q3.
The Czech economy in the quarter-on-quarter period has stagnated, while France and Germany have grown.
However, the bond market today has broken records.
Investors are no longer focused only on Italy, but also on Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical bureaus of the Eurozone, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries have already published their preliminary estimates of economic growth in the third quarter.
Germany’s GDP grew by 0.5%, France’s by 0.4%
Both countries have made public the data for the second quarter, in Germany it has improved more than expected (0.3% growth instead of the expected 0.1%), although in France there was a slight reduction of 0.1% (the original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew year-on-year by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year.
However, in the quarter-on-quarter period, gross domestic product (GDP) has stagnated, and according to the YES, the gradual slowdown in economic development growth is shaping up.
The results are even worse than analysts’ forecasts.
Main events:
Year-on-year, the Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year, but has stagnated quarterly.
In the third quarter, the German economy, according to previous data and recalculated seasonally, grew by 0.5%.
The economy of the Eurozone and also of the European Union, between July and September and compared to the previous quarter, grew by 0.2%, which is in line with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy has fallen year-on-year by 5.2%.
The interest on its ten-year bonds is 28.45%.
Interest in Italian and Spanish bonds has grown to critical limits.
The problematic situation also begins to affect Austria, Holland, France, Belgium, etc.
Interest on Czech ten-year bonds remains at 4%, although the situation in the area is getting worse.
In Germany, voices are rising that the ECB should ultimately lend.
Czechs qualify for Euro.
They won 1:0 and celebrate the ranking with a premium of 200 million.
The football team fulfills the most difficult task of the whole season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the excellent ?ech and the brilliant goalkeeper Petr Jirá?ek, the victory was given by 1:0.
The Czech team, together with a good dose of luck in the second half, defended fantastically from the attacks of the home team, so that it will not miss the European championship appointment.
IHNED.cz followed the development of the party in detail in a detailed report.
There was almost no excitement in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the collapse of the home team towards the end, and also to the excellent game of ?ech and the heroic Jirá?ek, won by 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates its passage to the European Championship.
Because of the correct Czech defense, the Montenegrins did not push until the second half.
The two losers of the match were Damjanovi? and Vu?ini?, who let two great occasions pass.
In addition, thanks to the great Petr’ech, the Czech eleven will not miss the appointment of the European Cup, so that the coffers of national football will receive an approximate reward of 200 million crowns.
From the first few minutes, there was a good offensive game.
Both teams just kept the lines and just played around midfield.
There was no pressure from the local players in the first half, kicks to the other field on defense, precisely what the Czech defense knew how to avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They formed a human shield.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around nuclear facilities in Iran.
With their gesture they want to express their support for their country’s nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students began praying Tuesday at noon outside the facility and then chanted death slogans to the U.S. and Israel.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around the nuclear technology center in the Iranian city of Isfahan on Tuesday.
They want to show that they are willing to defend their country’s nuclear program with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in a recent report, found that Iran, by all indications, is striving for nuclear weapons.
In Israel there is talk of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students began praying at noon before the nuclear facilities in Isfahan and then hurled death slogans at the US and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at crippling Iran’s nuclear program, not only the Isfahan power plant, but also the Natanz facility, where uranium is enriched, would be reached, according to Israeli sources.
Daily menu of an obese child: no breakfast and dinner sausages
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have problems with overweight, where overweight affects 9% of the school population and obesity 5%.
Obese children mostly come from families with unhealthy lifestyles, current research shows.
It shows again what is the importance of the environment where it grows for a healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as reference.
Obsessed children feed on sausages at least twice as often as children from normal-weight families.
For dinner, more than 19% of the obese had dined fries the day before the test, which is linked to the "Obesity is not a coincidence" prevention program.
In families of overweight children there is no custom of playing sports, which is applicable to most families today, where only 15% of children responded that their parents, at least once a week, find time for physical exercise.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of last school year and nearly 900 Basic Education children from all over the Czech Republic participated in it.
It was already the second edition of the program "Obesity is not a coincidence", which supports the General Health Insurance Company and the company Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 children have participated in the project from the 4th to the 8th year.
A proper diet and enough exercise in the family are determining factors, which significantly reduce the number of overweight and even obese children.
“Only half of the children surveyed have answered that they have five meals a day depending on the diet: breakfast, lunch, lunch, snack and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet,” the study said.
No breakfast but with sausage for dinner
Specialists warn that, in a healthy development, the details are also important, which also count, such as having a fixed time for breakfast as a family.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23% of school families eat breakfast at the same time.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast alone.
But the worst thing was to discover that in 10% of households nothing is eaten for breakfast.
Breakfast is, however, the basis of a correct daily diet.
The study shows that unhealthy fries are consumed much more frequently in families of obese children.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet soft drinks daily (70%).
As a general rule, more than 40% of the children surveyed do sports, however, among their parents this result is reduced to less than half, only 15%.
Make your diet
The next phase of the study allowed the chosen kids (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to create their own diets from all possible offers according to their tastes and opinions.
"The food preferences of Czech children aged between 12 and 15 years, from the point of view of healthy eating, are far from ideal."
Among his favorite foods are pasta, meat and sweets.
“The popularity of soft drinks is especially alarming,” the study’s final report warns.
As a main meal, the palm takes the pasta and the poultry closely follows.
Practically, children always reject legume and the taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Switch to healthy habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive fair information.
"In the control group of the study participants, who filled out the questionnaire after finishing the prevention program "Obesity is not a coincidence", there was in many cases an important change in favor of the principles of healthy eating," says the study results.
Attention is drawn, for example, to sweet sodas, where many children would begin to prefer ordinary water.
Children would also more often choose poultry and fish for the main meal in the questionnaire and restrict consumption of sweet foods and flour products.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, professionals say.
In the introductory article, How Stylists Learn, I already complained a bit that the initial lessons were already quite loaded.
I had no idea how that would go.
Lectures by three professionals in the field, how to dress problematic characters and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in show business.
And it'll be worse.
The closer the final exams are, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And although the course runs every Saturday and Sunday, there is no longer a pin.
We have studied with the director, Alena, (in the course there is no man) on how to dress the woman who does not have perfect symmetry.
And so is the vast majority.
Someone is short-necked, someone has a stylized figure without the right curves and someone is overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically soften wide shoulders, lengthen a neck or recreate the necessary curves.
We have been given some tricks on how to make the body of women of the type of Jennifer Lopez stand out, with huge breasts and hips but narrow waist and at the same time not dress it in a way too challenging
If, for example, the difference between the waist and hips is so large that the skirt or pants do not fit, it is worth getting at least one extra piece of fabric sewn to size.
You will certainly not regret it, because clothing that feels perfectly is priceless.
With a tailored skirt you will feel much better than with one that does not stop moving, getting up, dancing at the waist, etc.
The stylized body can be allowed to wear clothes with folds, ornaments, embroidery or drapes.
There are certainly many different types of information and bodies, so I am happy that I have all week to get all this information in my head.
And even so, I'm afraid with the task assigned, I already have more than enough.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two celebrities, to whom you must design two costumes: one for the day and one for the night.
You have to take into account the current appearance, the fashion style that suits the person in question.
I've had to "dress" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
I scream inside, for me it is much better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who lately will have gained a hundred kilos (please take into account the exaggeration), or the very young Selena Gomez.
The dresses have to be cut out of magazines or searched on the internet and printed, and then made graphically.
The moodboard, which is what the full result is called, also expresses our personal style and our relationship with graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic part of the styling.
The stylist, therefore, not only dresses physically, but also deals, for example, with the pages of products in magazines (of specific topics, such as trends, bags, coats, etc.).
All of this was discussed by stylist and designer Mario Kameník.
But all of this is over by Sunday.
The stylist must have a global vision.
The three invited specialists animated Saturday’s conference with information on all kinds of bodies.
Fashion designer Jakub Polanka, stylist Honza Pokorn and fashion photographer Ben Ren.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to take advantage of this.
And a good stylist knows how to work with the same garment in different ways.
Variability is, in this case, fundamental.
Thus, this trench coat (or as they say in English, trench-coat) can be dressed to the classic with jeans and t-shirt, but it also serves to dress the naked body with high-heeled shoes and photograph it as if it were actually a dress.
Or just roll it up and raise your neck to get a totally different image.
“Play with it,” he insisted.
What I value the most is the following advice: "To start working, you need to know all the rules first."
“Then you can break them,” Jakub said.
It is finally clear to me why we memorize all these formulas, what is combined with what, why, if later it turns out that in fashion magazines we find different results.
Not to mention the parades.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have more types of clothes in stock than he intends to photograph.
Thus, for a fashion story that has ten pages (therefore, ten outfits), you have to have prepared, ready to use, at least fifteen.
And besides that the photos the clothes work in combination with other garments, all of them different from those used in reality.
All this must be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorn assured us that the image and the style represent themselves, in many cases, half of the success.
It is enough to look at Madonna, who is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and the marketing have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, at the moment, there is not yet a clear tendency to use the services of stylists.
Even famous people find it useless (my abilities are enough, my physical appearance is not so important).
And when someone asks us for our services, we must bear in mind that it is very likely that they indicate a very different size from their real (lesser).
Then it is only left to guggle and find out if the magazines of the heart have already written on the subject, if a certain celebrity has gained/thinned, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted that the stylist is not enough to orient himself in fashion, but has to understand outfit.
During your work, you should especially communicate with the people you saw, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
He knows how to value people, he does not miss them, he defends their opinions.
“When a director hires you to sort her wardrobe and complete it with nice clothes, you can’t take and throw everything away and say, ‘Fuck off.’ ”
“Find at least a couple of things you can ponder and recommend so someone can put them on,” says Mario.
He himself also showed us that everything must fit into the so-called "placovka", that is, the job board.
This is fixed around the waist and you have all the necessary tools there.
There is also nylon thread (which serves the stylist during the photo shoot of products such as bags or hats), special clothespins in front, if this is larger (pins and other hooks are not allowed, they could damage the fabric), or a sewing set.
In order not to stay in passive listening and put something into practice, we have learned to coat the soles of the shoes.
Even during photo shoots in the studio, on a flat surface, you could damage the sole and much more outside.
And we did nothing but clothe and clothe.
We could not touch the shoes with the scissors so as not to damage them by accident.
So you had to be very skilled.
Mario has given me a joy in praising my work unreservedly.
The truth is, I'm not very good at those skills.
This is just a small part of everything we’ve heard all weekend, in the second part of the course.
I’ve already realized that professional hairstyling isn’t a pink road, but I don’t care what people say.
Need for Speed: The Run is racing across America.
Review
A journey, at first carefree, is complicated by a series of carelessness unbecoming of a routine journey during tomorrow’s shift.
To some extent it was possible to meet expectations, but this is of no use, if, in reality, nothing extraordinary was intended.
The new installment, to which the title is added, aroused great expectations already before its premiere.
It promised that it would give new airs to the old saga of races Need for Speed and, as a result of what was shown, it appears as a game that should not end up again being an action genre without more.
We were also curious to know what the inserted scenes would look like, where the main character descends from the car and walks on his own foot.
As often happens in the NFS series, the results do not vary much from what we expected.
There are races that can be considered acceptable, but in the total calculation points are lost due to absurd failures, which have already appeared in the series for years.
In reality they cannot even be called errors, but rather it is the incomprehensible reluctance of the programmers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are introduced to a story, whose protagonist, Jack, has certain personal problems; to solve them, he is offered to participate in an illegal race across America.
You sit behind the wheel on the West Coast in San Francisco, and your mission is to get the first ones to New York.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages and then more than fifty races.
It follows that each race takes place along a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.
In this way, one does not even remotely have the feeling that the game always offers the same.
Some of the environments are even pleasing to the eye, although the technical level of the chart is equivalent to that of previous installments in the series.
It is nothing of the other world.
But the walk through the desert, the autumnal landscape or the high snow-covered mountains produce a very pleasant visual effect.
In addition, races are diversified from time to time by an atypical element.
So, for example, in the desert you find a sandstorm that decreases visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains you have to be careful so that an avalanche does not bury you.
According to that, each of the races is very well developed.
There are only a couple of models, but that’s enough.
For a moment, you try to overtake a required amount of opponents (normal in a classic race), then you try to gain time (timed classic duel) and then a duel against a single opponent awaits you.
In the midst of all this, the police sometimes appear, which only makes things more difficult.
What’s new is the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to escape from someone and you have to help him, always pressing the button just at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
It’s surprising, however, that there are far fewer landscapes in the game than you’d expect (specifically there are only three).
But the end result is positive, because this element does not become annoying and, in the aforementioned context, it is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of previous episodes.
That means that today it is no longer a big thing, but it cannot be said that it is bad.
If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you can look elsewhere.
But a race conceived with enough action suits this style of driving, although we can find something better among the games of the competition.
So far, all in order.
But problems arise after a certain time.
Unlike the correctness of the driving models, the same is no longer true with collisions.
Of games of this type you can not expect it to recreate deformations and complicated collisions, but in fact before a blow against any object, you can not predict how your car will react, so not everything is in order.
It is typical that, when doing a very tight overtaking or driving the car with normal traffic, there are only slight frictions, but in other almost identical situations, your car ends up doing uncontrolled pirouettes.
Or even completely destroyed.
Thanks to the reset system, no big problems arise, but it can put you in a bad mood.
Resets are programmed in such a way that, when you suffer an accident or get off the track, the game returns you to the last rescue point on the track.
However, only five resets are available for each race.
If you consume them all, you have to restart the race from the beginning.
So it is nothing more than a help in case something does not go well, but it is not very reliable.
Sometimes, not even reset helps, it only helps to learn the given stage by heart.
A big disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, you have to enter in a specific way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Other times you find somewhere "civilian" vehicles always with the same configuration, even if you are the first, fifth or arrive five minutes before or after.
This makes rage especially in situations, when you see that two cars that are going to meet in opposite directions, your opponent advances without problems, but when you arrive, you must turn or brake.
It is the same when you arrive, because it is programmed because the "surprise" will always happen in front of your nose.
Opponents also have one more advantage.
Throughout the game you will arrive at places where, regardless of the moment, the same opponent will always overtake you in the same place.
This also happens at the end of the game, on a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must come before you, at any price.
When it goes in front of you, it makes it difficult for you to see the cars coming from the front, so at first you can mush the car.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspense and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that you will surely be disappointed right away.
And it’s a shame, because although the model of the journey is simple, the game is fun and action-packed, so it’s often not possible to follow in detail what happens or where.
And it really doesn’t matter, whether the merit gets the idea with fifty exclusive tracks or qualifying in the race so it doesn’t fit boredom, or anything else.
An unusual idea is the change of cars during races.
You have to keep an eye on the gas pumps next to the road, because right there you have to change cars, although in the vast majority of cases what you have will be enough.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for urban areas, American strong cars for straight highways and exotic supercars for technical driving, for example on curved mountain roads.
In addition, the main narrative thread also appears a parallel thread of challenges, that is, there are races in specific places that you will know by the stories.
Here you will get not only medals, but also experience points for your profile, which serves both the challenges and the stories.
Upon reaching the top level, the driver opens several possibilities, starting with the car and ending with funds for the profile.
At the same time, an online Autolog feature is connected, which compares your results with those of other players and makes other community features available.
One of the most difficult elements to understand is how the last race in history is made.
With the car you reach the subway tunnel (passage), where you start to run in the dark along the tracks (passage).
The speedometer marks you between 150 and 200 km / h (pass) and, suddenly, from behind you the convoy of the metro arrives and takes you ahead without more.
In the newsroom we will surely have a discussion about this for several days, about whether during the programming of the game none thought even a little or if the authors really take us for a panda of fools.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the overall visual effects are in most cases pleasant, sometimes even superb.
Well, it is a pity that, in the most tense moments, the image quality is reduced and, sometimes, in a serious way.
This mainly affects accidents where there are many participants involved, when the continuous image quality is no longer valid.
The audio is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In order to please most of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the category "each of his father and his mother", but it can be assumed that no one would buy the game just for his music.
The final feel of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore quite confusing.
If the game avoided absolutely silly mistakes, we would have trouble claiming that The Run is the best NFS game of recent years.
It feels like the game is not over.
The fun is guaranteed, but be prepared because mistakes will hit you in the eyes with the force of airport reflectors.

The Ambassador to the EU, Vicenová:
Czechs have a reputation for being negative and Eurosceptic.
"The Lisbon Treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions"
“I didn’t expect an all-out war to be mounted.”
"It will take five, six years, before the situation stabilizes a little, calms down and new players get used to their new roles," Czech Ambassador to the EU Milena Vicenová began her lecture at the Faculty of Law with conviction.
How not to take seriously his motto "clear and open about Europe", which he said already in the first part of his lecture, when he managed to describe each EU body and its relations with such precision and clarity, because it would be the envy of many lecturers of the Faculty of Law of the U. Carolina.
Vicenová also considered the work of the new permanent president of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
"The first comes criticism, which if it is bland, a gray official, able to assume any role, but I have to say that it left everyone baffled, because it assumes their roles perfectly."
“He is a man who knows how to listen to the members of the 27 states, communicate with them and has a clear vision of where the EU should go.”
The new position of representative of Foreign and Security Policy is explained by the question: "Who is this EU? What number can I call it?" It is therefore an important step towards the unification and clarification of political union in the face of states such as China or India.
No one wants to ban Olomouc cheese
Vicenová has also dealt with the agenda followed, followed and will follow the European Council in the near future.
The Czech presidency two years ago was a success.
The Czechs dealt with the emerging economic crisis, resolved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at that time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected the Czech Republic.
Czech representation in the EU so far has many commitments.
In the words of the ambassador: "a good uproar", not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is being dealt with now.
On the other hand, the EU’s seven-year budget, caused by the current much more complicated economic situation, must be approved.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, which sectors will have priority, which countries will receive greater support and which less? That is something that will be on the agenda of the next meeting.
The ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she came to Europe: "About Europe clearly".
“The truth is, I don’t like ugly abbreviations, foreignness, or jargon that people don’t understand.”
"How can a citizen understand that in Brussels cucumbers are not really invented curved or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes or that nobody is going to ban us from Olomouc cheese?"
It also aims to take more advantage of the EU environment and bring more Czech citizens closer to the European institutions.
The Europe of Speeds is waiting for us
According to the ambassador, Czechs have a reputation as Eurosceptics and people perceive the negatives rather than the positives.
In addition, he lamented the low participation of Czechs in European institutions.
The fault lies in a multitude of factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational messages, but also the lack of support from Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech presidency, he highlighted the strength and collaboration of the Visegrad Group.
“Believe me, when a Pole and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak comes to me, a Frenchman next to me says, ‘What, are you guys from the Visegrad Group?’
In the future, the EU, according to Vicenová, will face tough new budgetary policy rules for the Member States.
It is perceived as very real the concept of two speeds, if not more, in Europe, than the new "European Federation".
“We have countries in the eurozone and countries outside the eurozone.”
“We have the Schengen area and we also have the enhanced cooperation procedure.”
“It was said for the first time that only the countries that want to cooperate and those that don’t, that they stay out.”
“These procedures will become more and more and reinforce the two-speed Europe,” Vicenová is expected.
In this regard, he also highlighted the role of the Czech Republic and Herman van Rompuy in the application of the principle, according to which all issues affecting the entire EU should be discussed among member states, not only among members of the Eurozone.
Brand story:
The innovative IBM begins its second century of existence
If someone were to look for a term that very precisely defined IBM’s strategy, the closest one would be “long-term.”
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and yet a hundred years have passed since its founding.
The foundation of this long-term character was laid by the firm’s first boss, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He has already coined the slogan that many problems in the world have a solution if people are willing to think.
His motto "Think!" became his label, around which the life of the giant future will be built (it was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
Watson was also the basis of a carefully constructed company culture.
“For us, IBM implies long-term thinking, a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM has survived and thrived for a hundred years for that reason, because it stayed true to its core principles, but without fearing the changes around it.
That has allowed us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We hope to thrive even more in our second century,” said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company’s current director.
A sophisticated system
Watson, as early as the 1930s, cared for his employees as the Czech entrepreneur in Baca (IBM employees were among the first American operators to enjoy paid vacations, insurance, elegant uniforms, and a sophisticated remuneration system that rewarded the best inventors and salespeople).
The same long-term sophistication is maintained by IBM in the customer relationship.
From the beginning, the company was able to discover talent (being one of the first global companies to end any type of discrimination, it could choose without problems).
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy is the current plan of IBM, by which Palmisano will be replaced next year by a woman: Virginia Rometty.
She has been working at IBM for 30 years, where she has been head of sales, marketing and strategy.
During the last years IBM has participated in the so-called virtual meetings, online brainstorming, from which many future strategies and innovations arise.
It’s no surprise that they come up with ideas, since almost half a million people work at the firm.
An institution with a good reputation
The fixed position in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
“From the beginning, IBM maintained a concept of institution rather than technology enterprise,” says Harvard Business School professor economist and author of the IBM book Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
“IBM is not a technology company, but a company that tries to solve business problems for technology users,” said George Colony of Forrester Research.
As the company itself says there is a difference between entering the business and directly creating a business.
IBM - or the "Big Green" - as it is known in the U.S. familiarly because of its logo, has become in the last hundred years one of the largest companies in the world.
It is arguably the most versatile technology company (develops both equipment and programs, infrastructures and web hosting services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
It holds the highest number of patents of all American technology companies and five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Among his inventions are the ATM, payment cards, financial swaps, barcodes and floppy disks.
IBM is expected to make $220 billion this year, becoming the second-biggest technology firm by market capitalization (the first being Apple), when it first surpassed Microsoft in 1996.
Looking to the future
Not all products and innovations have just satisfied the taste of customers and the moment (IBM did not bet on its own operating system, OS/2, Prodigy online services or IBM PCjr computers).
“If your business is about moving forward, you can’t anchor yourself emotionally in the past,” Samuel J. Palmisano said.
That’s why IBM has no problem building its bases on other platforms (and equally, if they don’t work, it abandons them).
And this is the difference of the competition, Microsoft, which basically remains and always falls exclusively with Windows.
Technology of the future
In terms of sales, IBM is mainly dedicated to services, of which approximately one fifth are programs and another fifth equipment.
However, even in 1990, equipment accounted for more than half of suppliers’ share.
As of 2000, IBM has sold $15 billion worth of underperforming assets. During the same period, it has invested $58 billion in buying future technology.
Investments have continued since 2008, when the modern global financial crisis first manifested itself.
IBM acts on the premises of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis of 1929 increased investments.
It seems that IBM has managed to weather the crisis so far.
The value of IBM shares since the beginning of 2008 has grown stratospherically up to 120%, the net profit of the company has not stopped increasing.
The currency of IBM is to change everything, except its value.
One can therefore expect that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will endure.
IBM History: From Cheese Cutter to Spaceflight
The company IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, being its original name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was adopted as early as 1924 – originally it was a brand used in branches in Canada and South America.
The foundation that gave rise to IBM stems from the merger of four companies dating back to the 1880s.
He had inventions such as the famous "sign clock", which allows to control the entry and exit of employees.
The architect of the new venture was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also chaired its supervisory board.
Flint hired the head of a competing company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
The new leader eclipsed the founder of IBM (Watson’s ideas remain the firm foundation on which corporate culture and identity are based).
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, started with the production and sale of all kinds of devices for businesses, from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers.
During the first four years Watson led the company, turnover doubled by $9 million and the company’s expansion across continents began.
Watson was so crucial to the company that, after nearly forty years in the chief's chair, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his direction, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM staff and computers helped NASA guide flights into space (to Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "fish", which established the standard of computers of that time, came to the market with the name of IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, in turn, acquired the consulting part of the company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to offer comprehensive advice and high value-added services.
The strategy IBM has paid for over the past three years is the Smarter Planet concept.
Its objective is to make more rational use of technology, although the areas have not yet been planned and the circumstances have not improved, for example, in relation to transport and city administration.
For the commerce sector, IBM recently introduced the “Smart Commerce” platform that allows retailers to manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
As early as 1932 he opened a branch in Czechoslovakia, the first country to have it in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM’R also operates the strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is in Prague. Also here is a world-famous research team working with voice recognition.
Rychtaová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, stay with that donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtacheva (53) said it's over!
After her husband Josef Rychta (53) had become the sole protector of Iveta Bartosová (45), but also her lover, Darina continued to hope that Josef would wake up from his pink dream and return home.
However it will no longer wait and has established clear rules for life in the future.
"Pepe can come home, but not as my partner anymore," Rychtácová explained.
When Darina Rychtaová welcomed Bartota into her home during the summer, she could not imagine how her marriage would end.
Despite the request, Iveta hadn't moved thirty days after the song and Pepe didn't abandon the singer.
He even publicly stated that he loved her.
Eventually, Darina became resigned, seemingly accepting her husband's relationship and even saying goodbye to him forever.
Rychytá? doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
If one day Rychta broke up with Bartosová, his wife would not wait for him at home with open arms.
He is the biological father of my children and, if he wants to live the rest of his life in our house, no one will kick him out.”
“But here I would live not as my dear old donkey who was wrong, but as a man to whom certain ties bind me,” Rychtacheva said, adding that she had already disengaged from her husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
Josef doesn't care if his wife has locked his back door.
"I accept my wife's decision."
"I will be with Iveta and there is no change possible."
“My wife established this as a marriage on paper and I respect that.”
“The company is still in place, I make house arrangements, I take care of the garden, the home, I do the shopping.”
“Darina and I talk to each other normally, the only thing is that we don’t share a bed,” Rychta said.
If Rychtarov found a new love, he would not object.
“We don’t sleep together and she doesn’t interest me, or where she’s going or if she has a boyfriend.
I know it’s my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility,” Josef concludes.
Women’s worst vices: Do they also refer to you?
If you ask men to be able to cite some typical vices of women, in general each of them will name them without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize yourselves in the following lines, where certain feminine vices are cited that manage to boil the blood of men?
Go shopping
Do you blame your half-orange who is dependent on shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one rag a week?
Do you like to buy often on sale?
Then in your case it can be said that shopping has become a vice.
Some women realize that they should appease their passion for shopping, at least a little.
But what woman could resist the temptation to walk around the clothing stores, look for well-fitting clothes and then try them all on in the tester (ideally in all different colors)?
Although for most women shopping is a hobby, for men it can practically become hell.
Just remember how many times you’ve already told your partner to best wait for you in front of the door.
Constant Dissatisfaction
"Aren't I too fat?"
"I would need to lose at least five kilos - should I start exercising?"
"Do you really like me?"
Don't these phrases ring a bell?
You do?
So she's one of those women who's obsessed with her looks.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but many men are allergic to hearing their partner complain all the time about their physical appearance.
Strong sex also agrees that the more the frequency of complaints increases, the more annoying women become.
Order and cleanliness first
It's like an infinite merry-go-round.
Clean the windows, vacuum, scrub the floor, dust, scrub the tub, and all that at least twice a week.
Do you reproach your partner for stepping on the clean floor with a dirty foot, your children who have soiled a freshly cleaned sink and a shelf with glass doors that cost you so much to clean?
In case you suffer this “deviation”, try to be aware that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness surely should not occupy paramount in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness could threaten your relationships and family well-being.
Making Unpleasant Comments
"Used underpants are left with dirty clothes."
"You want to wear those used socks tomorrow too."
"The wet rag is not left on the ground!"
If you make those comments to your partner more times a day, know that this will get him out of their boxes.
You don't want to say anything bad, you just want to get everything in order.
Perhaps, if men knew this, women, for their part, would not make as many comments.
Slanders and gossip
Some women also have slander, gossip, but also offenses and conspiracy against someone.
Women focus on relationships, which is why they like to talk about who, where, with whom, how and why together.
Maybe each of us sometimes misses a little harmless gossip.
With the hand on the heart, this is typical of almost all women.
On the other hand, there are gossipy women of those who do not control themselves, who love to gossip and do it often, despise everyone and are dangerous for those around them, especially in a women’s work team.
Jágr and Vorásek helped with their assists to beat Philadelphia
Hockey forward Jaromír Jágr took part in the NHL game on Monday with two assists that brought victory over Philadelphia 5:3 on Carolina’s court and put Czech players back at the forefront of the competition.
In both cases, Claude Giroux took advantage of the 39-year-old’s move and went one step further and was declared best player of the match.
He was awarded two assists in the match and also Jágr's teammate, Jakub Vorásek.
After the meeting, Jágr told reporters overseas that Giroux had predicted a great night.
"I told him before the game that I would make a triplet."
"I sensed it."
“Sometimes they look like they’re ambushed,” Jágr explained, after his performance gave Giroux a goal, in the wake of the Flyers’ first blow.
A while later also the second intervention of the team had a Czech trace.
Vorásek took the puck behind the Hurricanes’ goal and moved it through the circles to Maxim Talbot, who scored.
A second before the first break a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was sent off, but from the beginning of the second half they already dominated the Flyers.
Specifically, Giroux.
After collaborating with Jágr he scored the third goal, after his shot slipped through the fourth of Wayne Simmonds' goal.
“I love playing with him.”
"I don't want to say he's the best player on the court, but he's definitely in the top three," Jágr said.
“It would never have occurred to me that at the end of my career I was going to play with an athlete like him.”
“I’m very pleased with that.”
“I want to play for him.”
All these years in the NHL, my teammates were playing for me, and that now produces results,” Jágr adds.
Carolina still turned the match into a drama, with Tuom Ruutu's goal and then Dwyer's penalty kick again, until he got a goal away.
Matt Read did not allow any more complications, although they ended up outnumbered two-on-one.
“Pronger had a good performance in our field.”
"He cleared the record, I picked up speed and Read went to the far end."
"I tried to hit the record and I'm happy because I did it," Vorasek described the last goal of the match as he lived it.
With his win, Philadelphia has taken the lead in the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal, Jaroslav ?pa?ek, did not play until the end of the game against Buffalo, in the second third he retired due to an injury to the upper body.
Canadiens not only lost a player with a lot of experience in defense, but also by a difference of two goals, 2:3.
Plekanec was unable to take advantage of one of the shots.
More than the points lost to the local coach lamented the large number of injured in the last row, and play the game with only five defenders.
"That's bad."
"We played the game with only one veteran player, the rest were first-timers."
“Finally, but against that you can’t do anything, we have to deal with it,” Jacques Martin said.
“So much rotating the players turned against us, we couldn’t resist it.”
"We had to simplify the game even more, take the disc off our field."
“And that’s how we leave holes,” explained one of the defenders, P. K. Subban.
Goalkeeper Ond?ej Pavelec contributed thirty Winnipeg interventions in the 5:2 win over Tampa Bay.
Jets' goals were scored by five players who ended a series of losses that already lasted five games.
How Travel Prices Have Evolved Since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five authorized state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia at that time: ?edok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel agencies of that time sold in most cases only trips to the socialist bloc, since trips to the West were very restricted.
Czech tourists therefore went on holiday to the beaches of the GDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union (Sochi in Crimea on the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (both on the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when one could travel to Yugoslavia, however, after the Yugoslav regime leaned to the west and the travel of Czech tourists was then quite restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also the Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely and individually even through the socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed a letter of invitation, otherwise individual travel was not possible.
Travel agencies at the time also offered trips to the West, but one had to queue up with a sleeping bag and spend the night like this, or have "good acquaintances" in the agency.
Still, not everything was won.
The so-called "promise of change" that was the condition for trips to the West, was not granted to the "politically unreliable people", who thus could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency and, with no guarantee of exchange, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the Western currency) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, so there were a large number of cottages and summer houses, which the Czechs acquired. This custom still persists.
The Czech way of travelling has undergone a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 for us it was no longer going to spend holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million holiday trips to countries around the world.
It is a great paradox, of which we are no longer aware today, that the current favourite destination, Croatia, until 1989 could not travel freely, because it was part of Yugoslavia at that time.
In the early 1990s, visa-free travel to neighbouring Western European States was imposed, resulting in a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovaks, for a long time, were not tired of excursions to the West, everyone wanted to see it at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris groups of Czechs slept in the parks in tents, since our income back then did not allow us to pay a hotel or pension.
A typical feature of Czechs at the time was taking food with them (canned food, cold meats, etc.) to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech crown, so that our tourists could finally, after decades, freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living increased and with it also average wages, which around 1997 caused an increase in the demand for travel.
With the increase in demand for travel, agencies began to regularly prepare trips using the connections of charter flights, which made travel prices incredibly lower compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts for the volume of passengers.
By the late 1990s, Czechs were traveling visa-free to almost every developed country except the US, further simplifying our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism happened as early as 2000, when the first direct flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country was organized, thanks to enormous demand, and went to Thailand.
Since that year, direct charter flights with Czech tourists to distant and hot countries depart every year. This winter will already be flown directly from the Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are currently visited by close to 100,000 Czechs a year.
Another interesting moment of this era, symbolizing our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the US eliminated visas for Czech tourists, making our country among the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008 Czechs, for the first time in their history, have spent more than half of their holiday abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, more than 15 thousand Czech crowns per head have been spent on trips abroad, including expenses at the site of stay.
Convened Ordinary General Assembly to elect the president, which could end again in stalemate.
For almost five months Czech football has been without a president and it is likely that the successor of Ivan Ha?ek as President of the Czech Football Federation (FA?R), will not be known even after the convening of the next Extraordinary General Assembly that will take place this Thursday in Nymburk.
In fact, no agreement has yet been reached on the voting rules to be followed.
Without them, you cannot even vote to choose between the three candidates.
Those interested in presiding over Czech football are Jind?ich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomá? Paclík.
He resigned his post in June before calling on his colleagues to find a strong person who could handle football in the future.
However, after the conclusion of the Hasek era, a controversy broke out between the two federations of the association unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This was evident on September 16 when the new president had to be elected.
Delegates to the General Assembly met in vain at the National House (Národní dom), located in the Prague neighborhood of Smíchov, because the talks had been blocked and not only in terms of the method of election.
No consensus was reached as to who in the General Assembly had the right to vote - only legal representatives or also delegates with full powers.
From that moment and because of this single point, there was a partial agreement, also supported by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which representation by full powers is not possible.
However, disputes over the electoral code remain open.
Further light on the situation could no longer be shed by the Executive Committee which, in its meetings, ordinary or extraordinary, basically resolved nothing.
Opinion on the possibility of voting has changed a couple of times already, but the nerve point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the third round to avoid the stalemate?
"The dispute revolves around whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or find another model," says Duan Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FAR, who, from the association's leadership, represents professional football.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round the candidate with the highest percentage of support in the federation to which he will present his candidacy will win.
The Moravian Region is ready to reach a compromise so that the candidate with the highest total percentage of votes in both federations can win.
The bohemian party, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, must have a majority of at least two-thirds.
“This would, however, take away the meaning of the previous two rounds and completely negate the concept of the bicameral system,” is how Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, according to which it would be best not to touch the order and vote according to the applicable statutes.
With what has been said, surprisingly, Toma? Paclík also agrees, although it is assumed that the electoral rules established by the statutes of all the candidates are better suited to Pelta.
“I would like to see it voted on as much as possible in accordance with the statutes.”
“So that no nonsense is invented about the representatives as in the last General Assembly,” says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is running for the first time as a candidate and who directs his remarks mainly against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him, Nymburk will decide on the new president and he believes that the candidates in the future will cooperate constructively.
“All passions will be appeased by today’s match of our national team in the European Championship.
"Football will once again be the protagonist, and so we will cooperate more at ease," says the Jablonice representative, who of the three candidates has more experience in football management, both professionally and regionally.
Rajchl is the most reticent.
"I hope an agreement will be reached, but unfortunately the situation is much more complicated."
“It’s not about the conflict between Bohemians and Moravians, but there are attempts to adjust the rules at your own convenience.”
“This may result in a new blockade of the General Assembly.”
"Anyway, I hope common sense will prevail," Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for all parties to reach an agreement.
Some negotiations had to be held in Montenegro, but who can know until the match starts if the football team will be complete?
The special plane, in which they had to travel to Podgorica, among others vice presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not leave this morning due to technical problems in Prague, having to find an alternative to transport part of the executive committee to the place where the qualifying match will take place.
Perhaps the decisive meeting, finally, could be the one that will take place at ministerial level, which, according to them, will be held this Wednesday.
Josef Dobe, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would very much like to bring the divided parties into the country’s most powerful sports organisation so that an agreement can be reached.
There is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the upcoming General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Sport Federation (STV) which will try to provide a new direction to Czech sport after the financial problems of the lottery house Sazka.
Paclík will fight for the presidency, because he does not find a more suitable candidate.
If the head of the Pilsen players, Tomas Paclik, before the extraordinary General Assembly knew the name of a suitable candidate who would satisfy all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Federation (FA-R), he would not stand as a candidate for such a relevant position.
“If there was a right person, I would be fighting for them and not run for office.”
"But to this day, no such person has been found," Paclík told the Czech News Agency.
What motivates Paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking Pelta, the supposed winner of the elections, which paves the way for the presidency of the Czech Football Federation (FA-R).
Paclík also points out that, should he win, he would remain in the position of president only until 2013, when it would be the turn of the ordinary general assembly.
In that position he would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too much related to football events.
“I’ve already talked to some people that I might consider.”
“It was crazy for me to hear some people say that at the moment they don’t even want to identify with Czech football.”
“I would like to change that view,” he adds.
What supposedly bothers Paclík the most at the moment is Pelta’s relationship with Pilsen Regional Football Association President Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial past, known outside the world as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of delegates at the general assembly.
For Paclík it is so unacceptable to see Pelta sitting in the presidential chair.
"In case he wins, the current status would be maintained and nothing in football will change."
“With the support of Berbra, an ambitious businessman, football will get even less profit,” Paclík said.
He also mentions the fact that a few years ago Pelta’s name was associated with a wiretap during the investigation of a corruption case, from which Pelta got away with it.
"I don't know what prestige football could bring Pelta's victory."
"And with what eyes UEFA and FIFA will look at us," said Paclík, who also takes with some caution his previous statement that he would "sell Club Pilsen if Pelta becomes president."
In the event of winning the elections on Thursday, Paclík could consider cooperation with Pelta in the future.
The other candidate, Rajchl, is also of the same opinion and has been supported by Paclík before the September General Assembly, which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would follow."
"He's very capable."
“I could imagine him, for example, as head of the representation.”
"but not as a manager of an association."
“I also don’t stick my nose where I don’t feel capable,” added Paclík, who in September drew much attention for supporting the suspension of the Referees Committee chaired by Ludek Macel, later replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclík admits that he would dare to manage the association.
He relies on his management abilities of private companies, since last summer he is also the Director of Pilsen, which with his support celebrated in May the victory in the first division.
"I have the strength to change some things in the football field and contribute to their safe practice."
"In order to reduce the influence of some pressure groups, which probably tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appeal committee, producing unpleasant situations, Paclík said without hiding his antipathies towards the president of the Sparta Daniel Koetinsky.
One of the priorities would also be to consolidate the relationship between the FAIR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which it exerted pressure on political leaders to allocate more money to the sport of lottery taxes.
“It’s one of the key issues that the new president should be dedicated to.”
“If they raised taxes on gambling, as the political parties announce, I would support their arguments, but frankly, they have to tell us where all this money is going,” he says.
In addition, Paclík now does not even take into account his association with the Club Pilsner, although he himself states that the President of the FAR must be "non-partisan".
Pelta is in turn associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
"Ask for a room with a balcony."
“But I don’t see any sense in hypocritically giving up my actions at the Pilsen Club to someone else and then coming back there after a year and a half,” Paclík said.
Pelta promised the FAIR new statutes that would end the deadlock in the elections.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association one of the candidates for the presidency, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, if elected, he would guarantee that the FAR had new statutes that would definitively serve to solve, in the future, the controversies regarding the electoral rules.
Jablonec’s representative is optimistic about Thursday’s meeting in Nymburk, and believes that the pre-election conflict could move towards a solution today with the football team’s possible victory.
Even before the elections not held in September, Pelta promised to focus, if elected, precisely on representation and fundraising.
He decided to participate at the last minute in the last general assembly, so this two-month postponement could do well to defend and present, in a broader context, his ideas on the management of football.
"People at all levels have been taking care of football for a long time and expect to meet the new president this Thursday."
“They feel that the time has come for someone to manage the association,” thinks the man who is primarily associated with the Jablonice Club, but who worked at Sparta and on the Association’s executive committee.
For this reason, he believes he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that reigned in the time of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately, in the General Assembly in June, the statutes were approved that were not as perfect as everyone thought."
“If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president since September,” Pelta said.
Exactly the readjustment of the most important document of the Civic Association was used as a decoy to win over the delegates.
"If I'm elected president, I'll take it as a personal challenge and I'm willing to respond in case this fails."
“It’s a matter of principles, without which we cannot exist,” Pelta says.
Also, in theory, try not to mess with your opponents.
He had already warned in the past that he saw himself collaborating with Henry Rajchl, whom he respects for his training in Law, being aware that his opponent would also be his first vice president.
It had been a long time without attacking Thomas Paclík who, unlike Pelta, did not leave a puppet with a head.
"He's been in the football world for over a year, and he's already achieved some successes."
“Their attacks were shameful and many people were shocked by the election campaign.”
“That’s why many of them doubt his true character,” he told his opponent Pelta, who remains faithful to the statements announced as early as September.
His most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from the lowest to the highest competitions.
The latter should be a showcase for the promotion of football.
"I would also try to solve all the scandals that arose because of the Bohemians as a result of last year's corruption scandal."
"I would immediately get involved in negotiations with the public and private sector, to ensure there is enough money for the whole of football," the 46-year-old told TPK two months ago.
He also promised that his appointment as president of football would not entail any personal modification of the squad.
“I would have to know the tasks of each employee first,” he said, referring to Strahov, where, after a long period of anarchy, there is understandable nervousness.
Despite the current cataclysmic scenarios predicted ahead of the next general assembly, he believes delegates will not travel in vain Thursday to Nymburk.
“If the only point of disagreement is how to vote in the third round, we will certainly get through it.
"Football needs credibility, which will only recover if it finally has a leader", still two days before the most decisive day in his representative career, Pelta remains optimistic.
Rajchl promises, that under his leadership, the FA-R would begin to work with eagerness.
If the current vice-president Jindrich Rajchl is elected as the new president of the Czech Football Association at the fourth General Assembly, many people would surely be resentful.
Rajchl promises that, should he be elected, he would work hard.
He wants to implement systematic change and hold executive committee members accountable for each area of football individually.
He is also committed to resolving the Bohemians’ case, improving relations with UEFA and FIFA, raising more money for football and continuing the work begun by former president Ivan Hasek.
“As president, I would like to dedicate myself entirely to football.”
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to the national team, to professional football and the training of high-performing young footballers."
“By this I don’t mean that I would do it all alone,” Rajchl said in an interview for the TK.
“I’m a team player and I want to divide the executive committee’s competencies so that each member can dedicate themselves to a specific area.”
“And I will assign difficult tasks so that football can, in each of those segments, move forward with a lot of momentum.”
“A lot of people probably won’t like this, because it will mean starting to work very hard and not just criticizing the work of others.”
Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the football movement, it is said that he has considered the possibility of not running again as a candidate.
"Everybody knows, I work 20 hours a day."
“But I need to know that this will make sense and that there won’t be people behind me who will stop me and hinder me at every step.”
“A lot of people have told me that I shouldn’t give up, because then others would give up too.”
“It’s about having faith not to give up like that, just like that,” he said.
According to them, it also motivates him to continue the work that he has already begun with Hasek.
“During those two years, a lot of the work was done that I don’t want lost now.”
"There are processes that had been started and will have their effect in a couple of years and I would not like someone to stop them," he announced worried that, if they chose the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could return to the way it was before the time of Hasek.
“I believe in order, and it is something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to maintain.
"Behind him is above all those people who would take care of football so that it was only a privilege for a select few."
"I can be reproached with a lot of things, but not the fact that I'm in favor of someone."
"I try to be objective."
“I want to make football for everyone, because only then will everyone feel good and not just the chosen ones,” Rajchl said.
He also rejects the idea that only the president would be bohemian.
“Although some people try to claim otherwise, I have in mind to do my best for Moravia.”
“For example, it’s time to think about dividing the second division into a Czech and a Moravian side, whose winners would go to the first division.”
"It would not be the current situation where we have only three teams from Moravia, which represents a problem for young Moravian players," Rajchl said.
In addition to the presidential election contest, Toma? Paclík, president of the Pilsner Club, believes in his chances of being elected.
“I still feel strong support from the Czech Federation, who elected me as their vice president and who knows that behind me there are clear successes,” said Rajchl, whose successes include saving tens of millions of crowns from disadvantageous contracts, television contract negotiations and negotiations on lottery law.
On the other hand, he acknowledges his share of the blame that the federation is not united.
And while proclaiming that Pelta is “disqualified to regain confidence in Czech football”, he considers the other rival, Paclík, as a strong candidate who does have something to offer football.
“No one can deny that he did a great job for the Pilsen that year.”
"In the event that he is elected, he will probably follow what Ivan Hasek has already started and would not significantly change the staffing of the committees."
“I don’t want to use that to my advantage,” he evaluates his rivals Rajchl.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Jump to Blue
by Julia Stanek
Pools from an incredible point of view, sumptuous baths in Budapest: Those who visit Europe can experience its blue wonder, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest their tired legs in bubbling baths.
A book shows where the best well-being is in the water.
When Iris Meder went on a research trip over the past year and a half, there was something she couldn’t miss in her luggage, a swimsuit.
Lying on her back on the water, she looked up at the artistic dome, swam towards the marble angels waiting for her at the edge of the pool, and marveled at the meticulously restored modernist indoor pool.
He liked the bathroom, took note in his notebook at the time of all the interesting details about the style and history of the building.
Architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 pools in this way and presents them in her recent book "Badefreuden": the indoor pools in Munich, the historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, the "concrete constructions" in Taunus.
He made his "journey through the most extraordinary baths of Central Europe" for 13 countries: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city respectively in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
This 46-year-old German is a true bath culture enthusiast.
He doesn’t want anything to do with the sport, Meder says, only the water is different.
It only bothers him that bathroom aficionados have to settle for blue tiles and chlorinated stench, while running aficionados can breathe in the fascinating smell of the fir forests or hear the cheerful chirping of birds in the park.
“One day I wondered why swimming pools always have to be so ugly,” says the Vienna resident.
"Ask for a room with a view."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture.
The splash in the pool and the ethereal oils of the sauna. The wellness factor in the pools is so great because all the senses are attended to, according to Meder.
And if the builder strives, indoor pools can be a real treat for the eye: "Instead of flooring, in bathrooms you have a surface of water."
"On the one hand it is transparent, on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything bends optically: the high vaults, the colorful tiles, the trampolines.
The book with photographs in small format "Badefreuden" provides in 190 pages very interesting facts about the architecture and the history of art in the historical oases of well-being, but, mainly, it makes you want to jump to the blue.
Meder, the pool collector discovers the outstanding specimens in her research in Hungary.
Next to the magnificent medicinal baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Bath in Budapest, there are nitrated waters in a unique karst cavity (baths in cavities in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as thermal baths, whose pools are alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálf?rd? in Jászberény).
Many outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While the whole city sets its eyes on the roofed pool in Zurich, you can look at Arlberb, covered in snow, from the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton, and: In the Turkish bath there is a window from which you can observe the practice on the ski slopes.
The design, perhaps, most extraordinary awaits customers in L?ngenfeld: The water cathedral of ?tztal looks like a UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
From three open fountains steam rises in winter, while in the background the mountains of Otztal rise in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Meder, the pool collector, didn’t get the smell of chlorine in every pool.
Many thermal baths smell of sulfur, in the baths of Árpád in Békescsaba, Hungary, the diesel plague is so strong that people believe they have reached a sanitary bath.
The smell comes from the medicinal waters that contain bicarbonate and alkali and whose silt sticks to the skin when entering the pool, an enjoyment of well-being in a special way.
Iris Meder was also disappointed in one place in her search for nice bathing spots, when she wanted to visit uncovered swimming pools and sunbathing in the Czech bath of Luhatschowitz, she came across blocked ground.
The 1902 bathroom of architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
As Meder looked through the crumbling windows of the red, white and yellow modernist building, he saw the undergrowth growing among the tiles.
The decadence was counteracted by a lovely pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These bathrooms have three phases of construction behind them; not only can you discover neo-Romanesque elements of times of its construction in 1844, but also a Alhambra-style Arab hall, added in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite bath of the pool collector, Iris Meder, and not only because it is natural from the Black Forest.
“It has a lot of merit to merge different architectural styles into such a fantastic unit,” says Meder.
In such a palace the immersion in the thermal pool apparently does not have much importance.
Agricultural Speculation
Deutsche Bank looks at the commodities business
by Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank give up its agricultural commodities business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to check the consequences of speculation for the world’s poor.
In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For citizens, the matter is clear, according to a study, 84 percent of Germans do not find it acceptable for banks to speculate on agricultural commodities such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of respondents say Deutsche Bank and other lending institutions should pull out of the business because it intensifies the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a survey commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented to Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann shows that bets on global commodity exchanges drive up prices, and banks bear responsibility for the world hunger problem.
The campaign of the consumer advocate specifically targets Josef Ackermann, director of Deutsche Bank, although large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in a similar way.
Originally, bets on commodities were thought to protect traders from price swings.
Leading experts agree that players have decoupled from offers and demands, and profit from the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted to the criticism differently than U.S. competitors: He promised to review the claims and said no business “deserves to compromise Deutsche Bank’s good reputation.”
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the claims of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis should be finalized by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank board, along with the recommendation on how to handle the matter.
At the end of January, the bank’s management will report the consequences.
In the end there could be a reduction in the business of raw materials, or even their total abandonment.
Ackermann tries to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, welcomed the news, but reaffirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "The bets on rising food prices show especially dramatically how ruthless banks currently harm the public welfare."
Ackermann is the biggest bank lobbyist, especially in bonds.
“Deutsche Bank must cancel all investments in its portfolio that put the money at stake for food price bets,” Bode said.
"It doesn't matter if Ackermann deals with the issue of starving people or the fame of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann’s inspection is surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the head of the consortium wants to offer a perfect image a few months before leaving his post.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank published that the chairman of the board of directors will change something different than the unplanned one on the board.
With the abandonment of controversial agrarian speculation, he can perfect his image.
And you need to barely care about potential losses, that’s what your successor will take care of.
Two-thirds would cancel investment in commodities
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure high on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 netizens have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on November 7 and 8.
Only 10 percent considered it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments that bet on food prices.
Many of the bank’s clients showed personal consequences when they discovered that their bank was involved in such businesses: according to the survey, two-thirds would cancel all investments from which money comes out of agricultural speculation.
Forty-three percent would discourage such a bank from their acquaintances, 49 percent would request, after reflection, to cancel their account and switch to another institute.
The 21st house in Vienna
The transferred flag
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with ups and downs and a happy ending, the pavilion of the 1958 Austrian Universal Exhibition in Brussels won awards, was in Vienna for a museum, was left empty and fell apart.
It is now reopened as an exhibition house.
Modern postgerra architecture, clear shapes, glass halls, bold curves and new building materials, typical of thinking about technical progress, for which, the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer for the universal exhibition of Brussels of 1958 is a suitable and well-known example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion was awarded the Grand Prix of Architecture for its lightweight, floating steel and glass construction.
The construction is considered to this day a contemporary landmark of architecture.
He made the architect so well known that he also built the pavilion of Austria in the following universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW plus the adjacent flattened building in Munich, it became internationally known.
Its pavilion, designed as a temporary construction for exhibitions was erected after the universal exhibition at the Schweizer Garten next to Vienna's southern station, it was renovated in 1962 and inside a 20th century museum was inaugurated, it was called the "20th house".
The building was adequate but lacked the spaces and technology suitable for a museum; without any wall to hang art, nor a good atmosphere.
Nevertheless it was used until contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been empty since 2001 and is decaying more and more.
Currently, the architect Adolf Krischanitz renovated the pavilion, now he calls it "house 21" and it will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
On Tuesday afternoon the belvedere museum was inaugurated, to which the house belongs, with the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in a way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian belvedere gallery since 2007, made a fresh start.
Husslein-Arco, a doctor of art history with a considerable career, among other things, was an ice skater in her youth, later in Sotheby’s, the Guggenheim museum and founding director of Salzburg’s modern art museum, carried out the reforms at the insistence of politicians and monument protectors, provided public funds and private sponsors and established their use.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba of the homonymous foundation are exhibited, there should be a cafeteria and a bookstore and an office building should also be built.
Strict control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to do so.
Not only because he sensitively reformed the secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna, expanded it and was awarded the competition, but because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him an "important and immense place", in which he contemplated "almost every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with his transfer to Vienna in his change of use with generosity and ease.
In the current reforms there are big problems, the building was “an energy devourer,” Krischanitz said.
The profile of the glass facade windows was changed, an insulating glass reinforced with fiberglass was installed and the glass ceiling was replaced by a special safety glass.
Thermal bridges and steel beams were reinforced or replaced and asbestos roofs were rehabilitated.
Two basements were used for the new use, a panel of light descended between the house and the street provides the lighting, a bridge serves to enter the almost new building, but still Schwanzer's pavilion.
The original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in antique mahogany tones and protected from rust.
And the movie theater is exactly as it was before.
And all this with strict control by the monuments office and a low budget.
“I often had to find material that was good, cheap and also liked by the monument protection office,” Krischanitz says and warns of a rough floor in the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and renovations, the building remains flexible and lightweight.
The “Brussels-born” pavilion has been difficult, Krischanitz recently said, a typical “casual appearance in the history of the city.”
Such an architecture is “always in the wrong place” and so I wanted to “awaken the right consciousness.”
In this case the 21st house is not in the wrong place, an urban stroke of luck has happened. The totally new and planned "central station neighborhood", with homes and offices, is next to the Schweizer Garten.
And perhaps another stroke of luck: The 21st house could receive a reinforcement from another Krischanitz construction, as the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporary art room and, as you can hear, negotiates with the city about a neighboring place in the Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn plans a winter crisis package amounting to millions
The company has devised a crisis plan, which would prevent train breakdowns in winter.
The number of staff must be doubled.
Which costs millions.
In the fight against train breakdowns and delays caused by winter, Deutsche Bahn has spent more than 70 million euros this year, according to a newspaper report.
The newspaper "Bild" reported, invoking an internal crisis plan of the group, the planned investments until 2005 of a total of about 300 million euros.
For this, better availability of vehicles and the rail network must be achieved even in extreme weather.
Among other things, it is planned to double internal and external employees to 16,000 positions to remove snow from the tracks and platforms.
The goal is to clean the snow and ice platforms for operation and 90 percent of the needles needed for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Deutsche Bahn’s president, Ruediger Grube, warned of train breakdowns and delays this winter after a summit with the government and industry.
Last winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in the transport of passengers, as, among other things, it lacked reservations in the face of adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for years for an authorization from the federal railway office.
There is also a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to check the axles of high-speed trains frequently in the workshop, after a high-speed train suffered an axle breakage at Cologne’s central station.
Deutsche Bank Pays Million Dollar Fines in the U.S.
After the tumult over President Josef Ackerman, a new problem of the US appears, Deutsche Bank must pay there a million dollar fine.
As if the problems were not enough for the Deutche Bank, its past in the US acquires the giant of the sector, the Frankfurt Institute pays 145 million dollars (106 million euros) in a deal, to end the strife due to the bankruptcy of five large credit cooperatives during the financial crisis.
It is the sale of mortgage securities.
Financial markets regulator NCUA reproaches many large banks for inducing credit unions with false promises to buy financial products; they have minimized risks.
Such securities lost their value during the financial crisis and drag banks into the depths.
"We are pleased to be able to clarify the issue without the parties having to go to court," a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York said.
The bank admits no fault of its own with the settlement.
This also applies to Citigroup, which forced a payment of $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the deference of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit unions and provides bankruptcy support to protect clients’ investments.
The NCUA is trying to reinstate the millions of losses incurred.
The currently closed agreements are their first type.
The regulator had also held accounts with other big banks and in the summer filed lawsuits against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the matter of doubtful mortgage securities, these are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on housing credits.
When the U.S. housing bubble burst in 2007, it led to the downfall of many financial institutions.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the American investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results happened a few years ago, a complicated wind is currently blowing for US banks.
Investors and the inspection have initiated countless processes to receive compensation or sanction faults.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has produced the most lawsuits.
He reproaches the 18 big international banks that the two US state mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of the mortgage business in a volume of approximately 200 billion dollars.
Deutsche Bank also has a demand from the FHFA, dealing in businesses worth $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires the Frankfurt Institute to account for “substantial losses,” without naming an exact figure.
Deutsche Bank rejected the debts as unfounded and explained that it wants to defend itself.
Warren Buffett contributes $10 billion to IBM
Finance guru Buffett invests heavily in information technology firm IBM.
Since March, it has acquired shares worth more than $10 billion.
So far the great American investor Warren Buffett has always declared not to invest in computer companies or Information Technology since the forecasts of the long-term development of the companies are negative.
But he has read IBM’s business report and changed his mind about investing in the sector.
He must have understood long before IBM primarily offers services and procures computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, a Warren Buffett investment is regarded as an honor.
Therefore, the Information Technology primitive should be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett is currently at CNBC, which has acquired $10.7 billion worth of IBM shares since March.
Its Berkshire Hathaway investment has soared to one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said IBM knew nothing about the compromise so far.
He praised the leadership that dealt with ordinary profits in the economic crisis.
“They’ve done a great job,” Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has long established lucrative information technology services such as operating computing centers.
The 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and advice as well as powerful business equipment.
Buffett avoided tech companies to date.
He said he only invested in companies whose businesses he understood.
Instead, Buffett took the opportunity on a freight train, at a lubricant manufacturer or a mechanical engineer.
Its Berkshire Hathaway has about 80 subsidiaries of its own, as well as part of a whole series of large consortia such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly M?nchener R?ck.
Buffett, 81, took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and, with wise investments, expanded it into one of the world’s most valuable companies.
However, his lifestyle is humble.
That’s why it’s an idol for countless investors around the world.
His quick and unerring sense of money-making has given him the nickname "Omaha oracle."
After discovering Buffett’s investment, IBM shares went up one percent.
“The Blue Giant,” as IBM is known, has a stock market value of more than $220 billion and ranks, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the world’s most valuable technology companies.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, he doesn’t want to collaborate.
Bill Gates, its founder, is a close friend.
The threat is concrete
After the discovery of "the Zwickau cell", the Turkish media doubted the German rule of law.
A newspaper speaks of a "bloody ideology" that is rekindling.
The murders of eight small-business gimmicks and Greeks between 2001 and 2006 have a far-right background.
Turkey and the German population of Turkish origin have reacted with fear and concern to this news.
For many Germans of Turkish origin, a ghost long thought to be dead returns, since the attacks in the form of arson in Molln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there have been no more episodes of violence against Turks with a far-right background.
However, it has never been questioned that xenophobia exists in Germany.
The ultra-rightist network discovered reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were by no means predictable.
"Does bloody ideology revive again?" headlines the online edition of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The newspaper "Sabah" emphasizes instead that one of the perpetrators of the crime was an informant of the Federal Office for the Defense of the Constitution and is concerned that the German authorities may be involved in the ultra-rightist pantanal.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted sensibly, recalling the victims of racist violence with a vigil outside the Brandenburg Gate over the weekend.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin together with German and Turkish politicians reflected on a solemn event marking the fiftieth anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement.
The coexistence was staged with cheerful colors, like a story with a happy ending.
The information reached some Turkish media as a slap in the face: “The German gift for the fiftieth anniversary”, says the title of an article on the Turkish internet platform “Haber X”, referring to the background of the chain of murders.
Nor does the German broadcast "Hurriyet" insist on tracing this mental connection.
“It starts to smell bad,” says the title of the column by Ahmet Kolahci.
He highlights that those killed were people who paid their taxes and made an important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of Germany.
In German internet forums of Turkish origin, the behavior of the police and their subsequent success in searches are discussed very critically.
The authors are astonished that the German authorities have not looked for suspects much earlier in the far-right circle.
Some are less rhetorical in terms of the drastic means: "From now on here it is lost, the immigrants have nothing left but self-defense and weaponry."
"This will be the best self-protection."
“Germany’s internal peace depends strongly on the quality of the clarification and the adequacy of the sanction to the entire network,” Selen writes.
Which means that, if Germany’s internal peace is in jeopardy, the bombings in Molln and Solingen will be cleared up in ninety years.
The image of the ruins of the Solingen fire has been etched into German and Turkish memories.
No other event showed more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a concrete threat and, to the Germans, that mistrust and distance can lead to violence.
The attacks sharpen group sentiment on the Turkish side.
Not repeating the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press at the time mainly criticized the deficiency of German policy after the attacks, Helmut Kohl refuses to visit the survivors of M?lln.
After the attack in the form of a fire in Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish president and Klaus Kinkel, his foreign minister, replaced him at the funeral in Cologne.
It is clear how the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of their taxes.
The current information of the Turkish media shows again how deep is, since then, the distrust of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country.
In addition to the effort of a broad explanation and a reassessment of far-right terrorism in Germany, this time we need frank words.
The Lake Zurich Scandal Bank
The riskiest bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
Now it is run by a German.
I'm sure Axel Weber hadn't thought of it.
After his spectacular departure from the Federal Bank summit, in July it became known that in 2013 he would start in a new and almost equally spectacular job: Chairman of the administrative board of the big Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber publicly rejoices, praises Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidity and drops kind remarks about his future peers.
"USB has achieved a revitalisation."
"I'm glad to be collaborating with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Groebel".
In September it became clear that everything would be totally different.
A financial operator of the USB in London avoided all the bank’s security systems and defrauded 1.7 billion euros.
Oswald Gruebel, CEO of USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to come.
The chairman of the USB board has since considered himself equally touched, and everyone asked: When does Axel Weber arrive?
Weber has been expected to advise the bank since February 2012.
And he will take over the chairmanship of the board in May, not early 2013, as the bank said Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, but rather a professor of economics and a counselor, and has had a period of adaptation that is probably necessary.
Suddenly he is responsible for the strategy of a bank, which has just proven that it deserves the title "the biggest scandal bank in Europe" for a long time.
On the one hand, the USB is huge, until recently it was the world’s largest asset manager, and on the other hand, for years, it slips from one scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, is spared the once-proud Swiss bank.
The financial crisis began.
The USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the discreet and solid Swiss asset manager, but also crafty, was combined with ambitious goals, also wanted to be a large number in investment banks.
At $1.6 trillion, USB manages more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it advanced as an investment bank in the league of the great banks of the world.
This is impressive.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and later professor of banking at Zurich for many years explains: "Before my students, I have always qualified USB as a model of a good bank."
“From today’s point of view, one wonders: How could I be wrong?”
I was in a big mistake.
In 2007 it came to light that something went very wrong on the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, CEO, who until then was considered a great and very intelligent banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, the reason was suspected.
The bank’s investment fund embarked on losses on subprime securities and had to amortize billions.
To cope with this, USB announced a capital injection of no less than 13 billion francs.
For this he found investors, naturally some who looked with contempt until shortly before: an Asian and opaque state fund of Singapore and an Arab state fund, so discreet, that its name had never been heard.
This was just the first blow.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, chairman of the board of directors, in 2006 in Switzerland’s second highest-paid board of directors, resigned.
In October 2008, the catastrophe continued, in view of its misguided investments, UBS found itself in the financial crisis of bankruptcy and had to be bailed out by the state.
The national bank bought problematic securities from UBS for many billions, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a mandatory convertible bond, through which it became co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was affected, it was stated how dramatic this was for a small country, if it houses such large banks.
Finally, the sum of the UBS balance sheet in 2007 was more than five times greater than the economic results of Switzerland (see graph).
“We can’t bail out UBS again,” said Geiger, a banking expert.
The first disaster was joined by the second.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with America and was willing to hand over the data of wealthy clients, who had possibly defrauded taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, it approves a figure of 780 billion dollars, reimbursement of unjustified benefits of these businesses with compensation for payment.
With this, UBS more or less confessed to having helped in the tax fraud.
Simultaneously he lost something that had always been his capital in the competition for rich customers: the aura of discretion.
After the scandal, the Swiss bank’s secret is no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the chairman of the board of directors and the chairman of the administrative board.
And the exodus of customer funds.
In this way, in a few months the bank lost its credibility in its two central sectors: in investment banking through erroneous speculations and in the administration of goods through the aid of tax fraud.
And just as it was getting a little quieter again, just as it was thought that UBS was getting it back, this unfortunate history of the operator happens, an individual operator defrauded 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized that something was wrong.
And it was revealed, apparently, that this still does not work well with risk management in investment banking.
“The Adoboli case shows that risk controls have changed too little,” says Martin Janssen, a professor of economics and finance at the University of Zurich’s Banking Institute.
The chief financial officer of a large German bank is also certain: "The problem with UBS is that it does not dominate risk controls."
So the idea of caution arose, with which the Swiss bankers presented themselves for a long time, to be the guardians of the greatest goods in the world: no risk too great, on the other hand, the security of money wants to fail on the other side of the Alpine republic.
The security deposits of Swiss banks were the symbol of unwavering reliability, such as Lindt and Sprongli of authentic chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich doesn’t fit the cliché of the solid Swiss private bank, it’s just a little bit bigger.
The situation is classic.
The bank has its main headquarters on Zurich’s Bahnhofstrasse, which runs from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are ostentatious, the rentals are some of the highest in Europe.
Here you will find jewellers such as Tiffany’s among traditional Swiss businesses such as the Sprungli confectionery.
Swiss banks have resided here for years: from the national bank, through the Palace of Credit Suisse, to the elite private banks such as Julius Boer.
You enter the reception room of the UBS by means of a heavy revolving door.
Inside the walls are covered with marble, in front are large leather armchairs, next to the logo of the bank there is a large sign to indicate "security".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: Security.
The two big Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have at some point displaced the idea of the big Swiss bank, or betrayed it, according to the president of a small Swiss private bank.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all he does, as all Swiss bankers do, also with the businesses of both big banks.
UBS has become too big, he says, mainly in investment banking, where Anglo-Saxons have gained ground.
The Swiss had nothing else to say.
"And they have long been accustomed to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, UBS changed Anglo-Saxon investment banking, delivered its first big profit and then came disaster, no European financial institution had lost as much money in the high-risk jungle as the big Swiss bank.
On October 15, 2008, the catastrophe was evident.
"That Wednesday the government coalition of the small country of seven million decided on the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," writes author Lukas Hoessig in his book "Der UBS-Crash".
Politicians granted up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How do you come up with it?
You talk to the Swiss bankers, so they see the problem in the dimension of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three big Swiss banks merged into a powerful consortium.
A bank emerges that, due to the merger, was too large for small Switzerland, and continues to grow.
So it served to complement the two different precursor banks of the UBS: a rich but sleeping bank with the center of property management in Zurich and a poorer but stronger internationalization.
Suddenly, internationalized investment banks arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, with which they could roll a large financial bicycle.
There are two names related to this rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the consortium of the UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then president of the administrative board.
“I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team,” says banking expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive who managed to break through from learning in the bank to the top."
Finally, Ospel trusted Wuffli.
And in the end Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: “He thought his models were a reality,” Geiger says.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
It is clear: the folly came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the board meetings, in which Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeated the same motto: Get off the throne to Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
They headed the League Tables, the rankings that then documented the success of the banks.
UBS wanted to be at the top.
Some steps went well.
In forex trading and stock trading I was at the top.
However, the advisors of companies in charge highlighted a weak point: In the business of international interest, in the language of fixed income banking, there is a huge compensation for the big banks.
UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, UBS began an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Avid for growth, they invested both the same bank and one of their hedge funds created in high-risk American investments.
It became a powerful machine to securitize American mortgage loans and then sell them, keeping certain risks on its own.
And also, as other banks sought the downturn for a long time.
“In the summer of 2007, as the American real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there,” said Geiger, a banking expert.
So great the euphoria, so deep the fall.
A manager had to leave, as the attempt to order proved more complicated than they expected.
Positions at UBS became projectable seats and are insecure to this day.
Currently, who runs a large bank, has a job almost impossible.
You must find a strategy for a bank, to which all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, an expert in banks, has an idea, to put an end to investment banking, to concentrate on property management, to return to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn’t want to go that far (yet).
But investment banking needs to go down a lot, it’s clear now.
Next Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new president of the bank, will present his future strategy to the world.
In reality, only the 51-year-old Italian-Swiss was thought of as a transitory solution, as the bank surprisingly parted ways with its predecessor Groebel.
Meanwhile, he prevailed: He must permanently run UBS’s business, the Zurich bank said Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to its state in the mid-nineties.
It eliminates 3,500 posts.
But this is not enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is he?
What do you want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is sure to ask himself today.
So far he only says that he will first look for a home with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on the US stock market
The looming recession in Europe has scared U.S. investors at the start of the week.
The changes of government in Athens and Rome remain ineffectual.
Slowed industrial production on the continent stifles hopes of stabilizing a debt crisis at its source.
General relief might not be imposed on the changes of government in Rome and Athens.
The euro fell against the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek glass looked half-full, not half-empty, but now the problems are coming to the fore again, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
First and foremost, financial assets are on the sales list.
The Dow Jones Standard Index closed down 0.6 percent at 12,078 points.

The industry of the 17 euro countries has clearly reduced its production and is at the end of its boom.
Companies produced two percent less in September than the previous month, according to Eurostat’s statistics office.
Which created skepticism among U.S. investors: “We’re not an island, but dependent,” Goldman Management’s Steve Goldman said.
Europe cannot break free so quickly from a recession, and there are more signs of weakness in the banks.
Warren Buffett, the investment legend, only confirmed this caution, yet it’s unclear if Europe is strong enough to do whatever it takes to end the crisis, he said in an interview with CNBC.
That is why, from their point of view, it is too early to invest in state loans or European banks.
Instead, it throws away a decade of old principles and enters the American tech sector.
Its more than $10 billion investment in IBM supports the traditional consortium’s stock price and makes it price against the trend in the market at first just a higher percentage.

Smart Guys Spread in Cities
In many places, rooks are considered “problematic birds”: these intelligent animals are not expelled from cities for a long time, experts say.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly, the rojos have been part of the image of the city for years, but in many municipalities the complaints of the neighbors for the dirt and the noise of the animals accumulate.
Although no media has appeared against the "problem birds" so far.
Rooks no longer leave cities, say experts at the first-ever rook symposium in Leer, East Friesland.
There, specialists from all over the country discuss possible solutions.
Looking for alternatives in cities
Environmentalists attribute the problems of cities to the migration of certain protected grasslands; chemical applications in agriculture visibly end traditional living spaces.
Hunting, growing buildings and falling trees make it difficult for birds to live.
The rooks are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs in Soest, Westphalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There in 2005 a controversial project to kill the district’s rooks en masse made negative headlines.
Critics have called the hunting of animals using bird traps and the killing with sticks especially brutal.
“Ejecting and driving them away in a normal way doesn’t get you anything,” said Werner Kluver, an urban planner and landscaper from Leer.
Shooting into nests or throwing away trees are often unintended consequences, says Manfred Kaiser, an environmental expert in Lahr, Baden-Wurttemberg.
"Animals deviate, large colonies divide and distribute elsewhere."
To drive them away is only imaginable as an exception in hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
“We must live with them, we don’t catch them anymore.”
Without the surroundings, the problem in the cities is not solved, says Wolfgang Kellner, mayor of Leer.
A combination of scaring away animals from sensitive residential areas and baiting them to re-settle elsewhere is possible.
"Informative panels instead of chain saws" Uta Maria Jurgens, psychologist and ethnologist advertises against in order to treat animals in a totally different way: "The best thing is that we can withstand a peak on the face with aplomb."
In Schleswig-Holstein, he co-founded the Ascheberger rooks teaching circuit, where signs tell about the life of intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by tourists.
Jurgens also has his own take on criticism of bird noise: “It’s all forms of communication, they have a lot to say.”
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, the rooks not only take advantage of the resources to access schist bites, but they manufacture tools to use them as resources.
Recently, ethologists from the University of Cambridge checked in four rooks how far the intelligence of birds goes.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to drop a stone on a platform to reach a moth larva.
Without much training, they recognized with determination the size and shape that the stone had to have to fall on the platform.
In a second trial, the cunning rooks had to solve a complicated problem.
The researchers placed a small cube with a moth larva in a vertical cylinder.
The birds could not reach their prey with their beaks.
But investigators left them a piece of wire.
With which the four animals formed a hook, with which they fished the bucket on the puller of the tube.
Three of the four rooks got it on the first try.
Portugal at Euro 2012 thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo
The Bosnians and Turks have no hope in the championship.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will also be at Euro 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have sealed in the play-offs the last tickets for Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine.
Guided by the triumphant hero Cristiano Ronaldo (8., 53.), Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6-2 (2-1) and, after the 0-0 of the first leg, made the five European Championship appearances in a row.
The Czechs got 1-0 (0-0) in the second leg of the play-offs with outsider Montenegro, after the first leg (2-0) made things clear.
Croatia did not let him be scored in the 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland got a weak 1-1 (1-0) against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) scored Portugal’s other goals.
Former Bundesliga pro Zvjezdan Misimovic with a penalty (41.) and captain Emir Spahic (65.) cut distances twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic got a red card (54.).
Bosnia failed because of Portugal in the 2010 World Cup play-offs.
At Lisbon’s Estadio da Luz, Portugal started off perfectly.
Ronaldo ran a direct free practice from more than 30 meters to take the lead in the points.
A quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his skills to score from afar and got the 2-0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who did not show off in the first half hour, had their first clear chance thanks to scorer Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburg team player, Manchester City leader, headered the club, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33).
Jiracek is right for the Czech Republic
Next, Ergolding’s Wolfgang Stark was in the eye of the hurricane.
After the attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penati area, he decided to show the Portuguese the yellow card for throwing himself to the ground (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark whistled a controversial penalty following an action by Fabio Coentrao, which transformed Misimovic.
After the break, the 2004 European vice-champion clarified everything with 4 goals.
The Czechs finished with the last doubt in the 81st minute with a goal from Petr Jiracek.
The 1976 European champion qualifies for the fifth time in a row for the European Championship.
Coach Michal Bilek’s team with Bundesliga legionnaire Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1.FC N rnberg) was also lucky and had to overcome a second of reaction in the initial phase.
At the last moment, goalkeeper Petr Cech avoided with a reflex a possible goal in Tomas Sivok's own door (9.).
Montenegro had more chances with the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of the front lap, right in Cech's goal.
After the break the Czechs had to protect the goalkeeper's spar of world fame, the forward of FC Seoul again escaped (50.).
Finally, the goal before the end sentenced the game.
Meanwhile, Turkey squandered the wonder of Zagreb football.
Four days after the 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not go past a 0-0 in Zagreb.
While it was almost certain that national coach Guus Hiddink would have to leave his seat on the third bench of the 2002 World Cup, the Croatians celebrated their fourth appearance in the Euro final.
In front of 31,000 spectators at Maksimir Stadium, the Turks were almost getting a dream start.
In the seventh minute, Selcuk Inan only managed to touch the post with a long-distance shot, and the attacker Kazim Kazim was also unable to send the ball into the goal.
After the second reaction, Croatia increasingly assumed control.
After the break, Croatia didn’t let him score any goals.
Together with Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who in the 62nd minute made room for Ivan Perisic of Dortmund, Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) are the legionaries of the Bundesliga in practice.
Trapattoni goes to the Euro
In Dublin, the Irish celebrate their first participation in the European Championship since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led coach Giovanni Trapattoni’s team, which triumphed 4-0 in the first leg prepared for a previous decision, to the lead in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) drew with the guest team.
Ireland pushed from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, when Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy got his first big break.
From the first moment, the defense avoided possible goals of advantage.
But in the 32nd minute, he pushed it forward.
Following a defense by goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward appeared and shot the ball across the line, getting 1-0.

Massacre on a personal level
Peter Englund’s intense and generous new book, The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate Story About World War I, “begins with a long dramatis personae of the kind that can make one’s soul fall to the ground.
Here are some action tips: Gently start this page and make it your brand pages.
He will get to know these people very well in Mr. Englund’s novelistic narrative, and this dramatis personae will function as his GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, as one of his men and women, he is confused and helpless in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
What he has written here is an unusual book, which he aptly describes as "a work of anti-history."
It contains some notable names, important treatises or famous battles; there are virtually no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions about tactics or material.
It’s not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as “a book about how it happened.” It’s about “feelings, impressions, experiences, and moods.”
"The beauty and pain of battle" combines the wartime experiences of roughly 20 ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrators.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or lose their limbs, go mad, or die.
Their lives are flickering here like votive candles lit in a church; new ones are added to the mix while others are extinguished.
Mr. Englund’s book is a departure from the standard history books.
It is also a corrective to the notion that World War I was only the fateful trench warfare on the Western Front.
"The Beauty and Pain of Battle" expertly moves through other theaters of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book have their hives on them; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tsetse flies are an intractable problem.
This is a moving book, almost from the beginning.
War floods these people’s lives like a natural catastrophe, a Katrina that stinks like cordita.
When artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you are a woman who is at home with your children, do you stay or run away?
Anyway, who's coming?
Hardly anyone understands what is going on, or even why this war has to be fought.
“Factlessness,” Mr. Englund observes, “has been filled with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors.”
“The Beauty and Pain of Battle” follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor from the high seas fleet.
His stories have been obtained mostly from memoirs, letters, and other material already published previously.
Explanations of their lives can be frightening or poignant, but they are more alive in Mr. Englund’s accumulation of small moments, lost details.
Many of these are about deprivation and getting by with what’s out there.
About telling the story a German schoolgirl says, "Substitutes, everywhere substitutes."
"Substitute coffee, fake aluminum, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues to talk about substitute food in Germany.
It describes "meat made from cooked rice and pressed into ram fat (and topped with a fake bone made of wood); tobacco made from roots and peelings of dried potatoes; shoes with wooden soles."
There are, he observes, "837 permitted meat substitutes in sausage production, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and courage.
An American acknowledges his own drive toward savagery and manifests about war: "You feel that, after all, this is what men are designed for and not to sit in armchairs with a cigar and a whiskey, the evening newspaper or a best seller, and pretend that varnish means civilization and that there is no barbarian behind that starched and studded chest."
Instead a British soldier realizes that he will probably die, and that no one will know or care.
“Once you resign yourself to the thought of sacrifice, you’d like to think it could happen in front of the public,” he writes.
Instead, it is horribly similar “to a condemned man being strangled in secret.”
Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new kinds of terror.
“Conflict has increasingly become an economic competition,” Mr. Englund writes, “a war between factories.”
It reflects the arrival of what he calls “a new species in the bestiary of the young century: the eloquent and ideologically convinced mass murderer in good-dress clothing who executes his butchery while sitting behind a desk.”
People behave in unforeseen ways; there is both ignoble and heroic behavior.
Mr. Englund talks about soldiers actively trying to catch a venereal disease from prostitutes as a way to evade service at the front.
“The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade in gonococcal pus, which soldiers buy and smear with their genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital,” he writes.
“Those who are truly desperate rub it over their eyes, which often results in lifelong blindness.”
In this translation of the Swedish by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund’s agile but not extravagant prose is perfectly suited to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes he reflects the way in which the war unleashed exceptionally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.
People start asking why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about World War I have often been indirect, such as The Great War and Paul Fussell’s modern memoir, or novels such as Novelty on the Front by Erich Maria Remarque, rather than comprehensive stories.
Mr. Englund’s volume joins an unconventional pantheon.
His book has one of the most devastating endings I can remember in a work of nonfiction.
I won't reveal it.
But it’s as if I’ve come from his book, ripped that page of dramatis personae from your fingers, and burned it with a match.
After a previous false step, a planned assault at the minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing riot helmets.
The night was chosen from Monday to Tuesday because Zuccotti Park would be more empty.
The operation was kept secret except for a few high-ranking officers, initially telling the others that they were joining an exercise.
Police Inspector Raymond W. Kelly was at the center, his presence underscoring how the operation was fraught with challenges for the police department.
Episodes of recent weeks, such as spraying pepper spray on protesters, breaking department rules and creating a storm of public sympathy for the “squatters,” could not be repeated.
And so the police operation to clear Zuccotti park of protesters was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
The agents had prepared themselves by seeing how occupations had developed in other cities.
A major catastrophe drill was taking place on Randalls Island, with one eye looking towards Zuccotti.
Officers stepped up so-called disorder training -- counterterrorism measures that involved quickly mobilizing large numbers of police officers -- to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to enter the park came at the “last minute,” said someone familiar with the orders, who referred to the mission only as “an exercise.”
"The few cops I know who were called in for this, they weren't told it was to enter Zuccotti Park," said the person, who spoke anonymously.
“The only people who knew they were going to enter Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels of the department.”
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
On October 14, agents wanted to clear the park, but gave up when hundreds of protesters emerged ahead of time after hearing about the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved officers from several police units, including special forces from across the city district -- dozens of mobile officers who routinely flooded high-crime neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said many people, like those who commute to work, had been coming and going from the park during the day, making 1 a.m. a good time to get in.
“It was appropriate to do it when there were the fewest people in the park,” he said.
Emergency Services Unit trucks with spotlights and loudspeakers congregated at the Pike Slip junction with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge before leaving.
The lights and pre-recorded messages rumbling from the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
Community affairs officers went to the park with their light blue windbreakers, many protesters simply picked up their things and left.
No stores were touched until 1:45 a.m., police said, giving protesters time to pick up their belongings.
Other teams of officers were seen gathering at the perimeter to enter if arrests were needed at the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to abandon him.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the Police Department, said it was for his safety.
But many journalists said attempts were made to prevent them from seeing police taking action in the park, and that they had been treated roughly by officers.
Mr Browne said mobile television units on Church Street, along the western edge of the park, were able to capture footage.
As police moved westward through the demonstrators’ dense web of personal effects, including paper and plastic garbage bags and luggage crammed with clothes, teams from the Cleaning Department followed, picking up what was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged out, images popping up on the internet shortly thereafter.
A central group of protesters took up positions near the camp’s cooking area, near the center of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police came in to arrest them methodically.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp fell between them by the arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency responders were called in to cut the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The clearing operation was complete about 75 minutes later, police said.
Mr. Browne said about 142 people were arrested at the park.
Most of the arrests were for “disturbing public order and resistance to authority,” he said.
The highest-ranking officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the senior uniformed officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the department’s chief of detectives, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, while present, “was not directing the operations,” Mr. Browne said.
A second group of officers waited along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Streets, in case they had to enter.
Barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and Pine Street, a block south.
From those positions, police were seen extending the perimeter even beyond Zuccotti Park.
At one point, a number of agents, many of them wearing shields, were seen pushing people out.
There were about 28 people on the northern perimeter.
Some of the loudest action of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, one protester jumped on the hood of a police car, and others were seen removing air from the wheels of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out from the crowd.
In the end, an agent and a protester were hospitalized.
Support workers union to sue city over layoffs
The union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming the layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory because of their disproportionate impact on schools serving poor students.
The lawsuit is possibly the latest weapon at the disposal of the union, City District 37, in its effort to overturn the layoffs.
Six hundred and seventy-two school aides, parent coordinators and other employees who were among the city’s lowest paid lost their jobs Oct. 7, in a move union leaders have described as political revenge for their refusal to allow the city last spring to access a health care fund run by task forces to close its budget gap.
City officials have categorically denied that allegation.
At a town hall hearing last month, education counselor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were a part of the budget approved in June.
One Council member countered by telling him that nothing in the budget specified that school support staff members would be fired.
District 37 officials said they filed the complaint in writing, warning the Department of Education that it would be sued. A press conference will be held Wednesday to announce the official filing of the lawsuit, in the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will include Mr. Walcott and the city’s Department of Education as defendants, and has eight workers laid off as plaintiffs, all black or Latino women, as do most assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s Legal Department, said the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its specific allegations.
According to a draft of the lawsuit obtained by The New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs at schools in poor areas of the city to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying poor schools lost more attendees as they had been chronically undersubsidized.
While there were no layoffs on Staten Island and a few layoffs at schools on the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants lost their jobs in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were laid off in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Considering the loss of five of the eight attendees employed by Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit says, “This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit.”
P.S. The 36th district’s budget shrank by 3.26 percent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates extra funding for each enrollment per poor student in schools.
The union also claims that high school principals may have been misled by language in a memorandum authorizing the firing of parent coordinators.
The memo used the word “surplus” to describe the action, even though “surplus” most often describes the act of moving a teacher from a school payroll to a job board, whose salaries are paid by the head office.
“Sixty-six parent coordinators were fired,” the draft complaint says, “and not just in surplus.”
Mission Ended, Congress Prepared to Reach Agreement on Libya
It seems that eventually Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are willing to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
All that was needed was for the rebellion to succeed, for veteran dictator Muammar Gaddafi to be captured and killed, and for American involvement to come to an end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee will consider a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry (D-Mass.), along with Senators John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (R-Conn.), applauding Libyans for their successful rebellion and U.S. troops for their “courage.”
“This resolution is to honor Libya’s brave as they begin to rebuild their country,” Kerry said.
“It’s an affirmation of bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations.”
The language may seem harmless, but nothing about the Libya debate has been easy so far.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties quarreled with each other and with the White House over drafting a series of resolutions to approve or reject the U.S. military’s role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a wide bipartisan margin, and it never came to a vote in the Senate.
But on the same day the bill was rejected in the House, the chamber also rejected a measure that would have cut funding for U.S. operations in Libya.
That left the U.S. mission in a kind of legislative purgatory – with Congress annoyed enough to criticize Obama’s handling of the mission, but not so angry as to actually mow the grass under his feet.
Congress’ indecision was then overcome by events.
Tripoli fell to Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate could be ready to act.
The Foreign Affairs Committee resolution “congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resilience in liberating themselves” and “commends the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary bravery and professionalism.”
The resolution also “declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya.”
Will the new measure win the full support of the Foreign Affairs Committee, or will it divide lawmakers as the June bill did?
The latest version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indiana), the committee's top Republican.
Lugar’s spokesman said Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House will vote this week on a constitutional amendment demanding a balanced budget, a legislative priority for nearly all Republican and some Democratic congressmen.
The measure, sponsored by Republican Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other issue that actually achieves a vote of the entire assembly in the House or Senate in this Congress.
Other legislators have so far been unsuccessful in getting their amendments to the assembly, but not for lack of attempts.
Goodlatte’s is just one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, covering a wide range of topics.
Some are duplicates – the same bill is proposed in both the House and Senate – and others with slight variations from each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the budget balance amendment in the House alone, and another handful that will “control federal spending.”
Some of those bills are also identical to each other, but they give their backers -- especially rookie Republicans looking to refine their resumes -- a chance to brag that they were the "authors" of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, which passed in August, required both the House and Senate to vote on a budget balance amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a non-binding resolution endorsing the idea of that amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms members of Congress can serve, while Rep. Jose E. Serrano (D-N.Y.) wants to remove the two-term limit for presidents.
Rep. Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (D-Ill.) has proposed a number of amendments that guarantee the right to quality education and health care, among other issues.
One amendment banning same-sex marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as one banning flag burning.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if they are rejected by two-thirds of the states.
So enthusiastic that they have been members in proposing amendments, they are not moving at a faster pace than in previous years.
At the 111th Congress, lawmakers proposed 77 amendments, and submitted 66 at the 110th.
The pace is unacceptable compared to that of the 1990s, when members regularly tabled more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they didn’t have much more success then than they do now.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but in fact was proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Blowed but not defeated," Giffords speaks in her first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot him point-blank at a constituent act in Tucson, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) appeared on national television Monday night, sang along with the Broadway tune “The Sun Will Rise Tomorrow,” and said she wanted to recover more than she wanted to return to Congress.
In her appearance on ABC News "20/20" with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form prayers and needed help walking.
The program documented his difficult way back from the damage caused by a bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of his brain, and which passed from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he returned to the House by surprise to cast his triumphant vote on the debt ceiling deal.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six and injured 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang -- and described his recovery as "difficult."
When asked by Sawyer how he feels, Giffords, 41, replied, “Pretty good.”
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long “20/20” special, which aired on the eve of the publication of the couple’s new book, “Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope.”
The special looked at Giffords' recovery since the Jan. 8 shooting.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, with her head shaved and a long scar across her forehead.
She can only keep one or two fingers upright, while her husband encourages her.
Months later, Giffords is seen sitting in a wheelchair while therapists teach her how to perform simple actions.
A nod.
A puckering of the lips.
And then, his first word: "What."
Within days, Giffords uttered another word – “toast,” a change request on his breakfast menu.
Videos released by ABC show that music played a central role in Giffords' recovery: The congresswoman is seen singing along with therapists Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Falling."
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who does two hours of therapy every day, said he doesn’t remember the day of the shooting.
Her husband said she was reading Giffords a newspaper article about the March 12 murder when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who had died in the incident.
The suspect gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is being held in a Missouri prison and is being forcibly medicated while awaiting trial.
"A lot of people died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
Kelly told Sawyer that at one point in his wife's recovery, she said, "I've been defeated."
"So, I said, 'Gabby, you haven't been defeated,'" Kelly said.
"You've just been beaten.
And you’re going to come out of this, and you’re going to recover and you’re going to come back stronger than ever.”
Troops feel more pity than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
At that time, several hundred soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines stormed their posts around him.
The etiquette crowd stood up and applauded.
“Men and women were considered heroes,” said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
A senior military officer at the gala, also known as the then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the troops’ role differently.
“They were shown as some sort of orphaned child,” the officer wrote in an email.
I’m sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know they had them.
But it wasn't respect, really, it was pity.
The starkly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has gripped the military and an often distant, at times, adoring American public.
The troops are lavished with praise for their sacrifices.
But praise comes at a price, service members say.
The public increasingly acts as if they are sorry for those in uniform.
“We are not victims at all,” said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and will soon depart for Afghanistan.
“But it seems that the only way for some to show their support is to put us in the role of helpless souls.”
The issue is a very sensitive one for military leaders, who don’t want to appear ungrateful or at odds with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by the troops who returned in the final years of the Vietnam War was much worse.
As a result, most conversations about pity take place quietly and privately among war veterans.
After his two sons returned from combat with the Marines, retired Col. Mark Cancian warned them that people other than the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of fear because they confronted the insurgents and traveled to exotic locations.
Others would wonder if there would be an “angry and violent veteran below the surface,” said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to a high-level government job in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some interviewers had subtly asked him if he would be able to endure under the pressure of a demanding job from Washington immediately following his combat tour.
“When you talk about your service, you need to deal with negative impressions,” Cancian recalled telling her children.
Military unrest arises, in part, from American indifference to wars.
Achievements on the battlefield are rarely chosen for praise by a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism in ways that were entirely common in World War II,” said retired Lt. Gen. David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, praise from politicians and the public largely focuses on the depth of a service member’s suffering.
Troops are recognized by the number of tours they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or the extent of their injuries.
Military Faces Growing Pressure to End Rape
This week, a historic hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the military for its alleged passivity in the face of rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs are organizing for the next one.
First responder Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years and 11 weeks pregnant the night she says she was raped by a partner.
It was October 2008, and he was on his way back to his headquarters at Miramar Air Force Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met a colleague who was carrying a 12-pack of beer cans.
He asked if he could join her in her room for a drink.
“It sounded an alarm bell,” Lyman says.
However, the Texas native put her concern aside.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"It's from Texas," he says.
"I wish I had listened to my instincts."
Within minutes of entering Lyman’s room, the man approached her from behind, pulling her down and raping her, she alleges.
This week, on Nov. 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel are eagerly awaiting a court decision in a landmark trial in Arlington, Virginia, that will decide whether the lawsuit they have brought against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce the widespread violation among the military, in violation of soldiers’ constitutional rights.
Filed in February by Susan Burke, a Washington, D.C., attorney, the lawsuit initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all claiming they were raped or sexually assaulted by their peers, and that the military failed to investigate, prosecute, or provide adequate justice after the alleged assaults.
Burke says he's going after the top brass, because the problem starts with them.
“The military is a top-down structure,” he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to eradicate the culture of reprisals? The high command."
Burke also says that since February, about 400 more survivors have contacted her, many of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
His strategy: Instead of accumulating all the plaintiffs in this case, putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak, will present several cases, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, led by U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy – in essence, that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for injuries sustained in the armed forces.
By a 1950 Supreme Court ruling called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not liable for damages suffered by active duty personnel.
“The alleged damages are part of the plaintiffs’ military service,” the documents say.
The Department of Defense declined to comment for this article.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women are still officially forbidden to serve in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars rarely have clear front lines.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially in reaching local women in war zones.
The result: between those two wars, 150 female soldiers have been killed and two-thirds of them in combat situations.
It’s time for the military to modernize, too, Burke says.
She is not alone in her struggle, and three other demands are underway besides her own.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic environment.
Moreover, the non-profit Vietnam Veterans of America is composing a lawsuit against the military that focuses on diagnoses of “personality disorder” assigned to rape victims in order to discharge them from service – a common occurrence, according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women in Service Action Network, a human rights group.
Her group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing it of discriminatory practices in the way it handles claims of benefits for people who claim to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate bills have been introduced in Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010, there were 3,158 reported sexual assaults, according to the Defense Department’s Office for the Prevention of Sexual Assault and Response.
However, the attacks are notably underreported, and by the Pentagon’s own estimates, they amount to about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report, released in March, also examines prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 percent of reported cases in the military went to trial – half that in the civilian justice system.
The plaintiffs in Burke’s case describe their attacks as just the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman’s case, he reported the alleged rape to military police less than an hour after it occurred.
That night, he says, he was asked to tell the details of his rape 11 different times to a crowd of policemen, doctors, and commanders.
She underwent a rape kit, and the blood of her assailant – from a cut on her arm – was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which she was asked about having sex with her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six persons testified as personality witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
“I remember the day the verdict was read,” Lyman says.
"I thought I was going to go to work," I found myself screaming from the living room.
"They put me in the psych unit, and when I got out, I remember I told my commanding officer, "That wasn't your trial. That was my trial."
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was released from service on less-than-honorable terms, preventing her from receiving any benefits.
As for whether the case brought by Lyman and his fellow plaintiffs continues, it’s a very remote possibility, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington Law School.
However, he notes, “In my opinion, they should be able to move forward.”
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I have been a constant critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The military is decades behind because it doesn’t have the same incentive and deterrence that accountability poses.
“The odds are strongly against them ... but it’s important for them to try.”
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing doesn’t go his way, Burke, the plaintiffs’ attorney, will put his other hundreds of plaintiffs in line for future cases.
“We will continue to fight the military on this issue until reform takes place,” he says.
“Or until we die, whichever comes first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Are Studying You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was simply another guy who aired his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to a killing spree in Norway in July that left 77 dead, faced his first public court hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from alone in cyberspace: He had spent most of the time that preceded his attack in front of his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social media.
After this summer’s tragedy, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy - you just have to log in to Facebook.
“We realized it wasn’t that hard to reach them,” says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report on European digital populism by the British think tank DEMOS.
Facebook’s stash of personal information is so encyclopedic, Bartlett says, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographics with scientific accuracy – the way marketers have been using it for years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then directed ads at them, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, the ads invited users to complete a survey that asked about their educational level, attitudes toward violence, and optimism about their own future.
Arriving via Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries – all without leaving the office.
“It’s a whole new way to do research,” Bartlett says.
Some of the results are not entirely surprising: Online supporters of right-wing groups tend to be young, male and angry about immigration.
However, in a sort of twist, “those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind the computer screen.”
DEMOS’ work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming an important new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything from health issues to social trends as expressed in “likes,” wall posts and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content a day, Facebook’s “data supernova” is generating a research boom, driving the number of academic papers with the site’s name in the title up nearly 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you couldn’t reach with a folder on the street.
“Before, when you were trying to survey people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.”
“You’d have to go through the game, and they’d never allow you access,” Bartlett says.
"Facebook removes all that - you go to them directly."
Others say the site could provide a way to identify and address social-health issues.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and colleagues found that college students who talked about their drunken feats on Facebook had a significantly higher risk of drinking problems than students who remained silent on the subject.
Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as residential counselors, might control the site and step in to help a student post too many status updates with their binge drinking.
"You can't treat a problem if you can't diagnose it," said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno's co-author and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Seattle Children's Research Institute, the Washington Post said.
"We've found a way to identify at-risk children who would otherwise not be diagnosed."
Facebook is also constantly “punching” its own population for data.
The site’s Data Team has compiled statistics on the status of the relationship and Valentine’s Day, the expectation of voter turnout midway through the 2010 legislative period, and a National Happiness Index (primarily using information that can be accessed – longtime digital freedom advocates who argue that the site should make its wealth of data available to others for research).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not – the sacrifice of being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is to allow the site to mine your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey they don’t even know about?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, online is an open bar for everyone.
“I don’t think many of the users have even thought about the fact that a researcher might be examining their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, about a 2006 study he conducted with Facebook’s public walls of students.
"As far as they were concerned, it was only between them and their friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research topic is being completely honest.
On Facebook, it’s impossible to know that some of a user’s profile information and wall posts are true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do off Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn says.
That’s why, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes a paper clip and pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
“There’s no substitute for going into the real world and talking to real people,” he says.
“Social research is supposed to be about the social – and a lot of the social still happens offline.”
Cold and inhumane: Anders Behring Breivik makes his first public appearance in court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to being the mastermind behind the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a “resistance” fighter during his first public appearance in Oslo court.
“I’m a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and in the Knights Templar of Norway,” he told a packed room of 500 people.
“I am opposed to the court because it received the mandate from organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism.”
"I recognize the facts but I don't plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue, because he “did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for him to express his views.”
For the same reason he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a pre-written speech, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in custody for 12 more weeks, barred him from media access for four weeks, and said authorities would have to have strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eye, others to confirm that he is locked up.
All attended with the aim of moving towards the conclusion.
"I thought it looked cold and inhumane," a survivor from Utoya told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the audience and looked journalists and survivors in the eye as he entered and exited the building.
Despite Breivik’s bizarre notion of being part of a larger “resistance” movement, the judge determined that he is not mentally ill, and said there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
Some may find it comforting that the July 22 attacks appear to be the work of an extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But that doesn’t automatically soften the pain and confusion that an entire nation still feels.
“I wish it looked like a monster, but it doesn’t look like it,” said a relative of a victim.
"It would be a lot easier if it looked like it."
7 Lessons From Steve Jobs' Missing Interview, Shown at a Theater This Week
After Steve Jobs’ death on October 5, there were some who compared him to Henry Ford – distinguishing the tech genius as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what Apple fans might find most telling, in a recently rediscovered interview with Jobs that has been dusted off in anticipation of a series of special screenings in major markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood about business processes and product workflows.
He was certainly a self-recognised designer, dreamer and hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and a flow chart junkie – a man who believed that many executives suffered “a disease that consists of thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there’s an enormous amount of work between a great idea and a great product.”
In 1995, Bob Cringley was developing the television series The Triumph of the Nerds over the dawn of the personal computer, and sat down for more than an hour with Jobs for an extensive and rare conversation.
At the time, it had been barely 10 years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he was already hard at work at his new computer company NeXT, waiting for popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of Cringely's interview was used on Nerds, he said the interview originals disappeared during his transport.
It was only after Jobs' death that a full VHS copy was discovered in the director's garage.
This slightly re-released footage is the basis for Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which hits Landmark theaters Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known for hating in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to lay out his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And very thoughtful.
At four different points throughout the interview, there are great silences between questions and answers – 10 to 15 seconds of reflections, where Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts, looking for accuracy.
There are also times when Jobs' perfectionism surfaces, where he seems impatient due to Cringley's questions, pushing him to go faster toward the issues or arguments of greater importance.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, the iPod or the iPhone, there is something strangely prophetic about The Lost Interview, when Jobs evaluates what he sees other companies doing right and wrong, and offers his own vision of the future of computing.
It’s one thing to read posthumous assessments of Jobs’ career, but there’s something raw and inspiring about the Jobs we see here, the eager dreamer on the brink of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
Not long after explaining everything in detail here, he went and did.
A quick summary of seven notable sequences from The Lost Interview:
On how you learned to run a business:
“Over the years in the business, I would always ask, ‘Why do you do things?’ and the answers they invariably give you are, ‘Oh, that’s just the way it’s done.’
No one knows why he does what he does, in business no one thinks about things very deeply.
That's what I found.
Jobs takes his efforts to simplify Apple’s accounting to great lengths.
Bewildered by the way costs were recorded – often starting with a “standard cost” that was made to look good, and then adjusted with a “variable” – he developed an automated factory that ensured that they could determine the commercial costs in detail.
On the joke to the Pope:
Jobs narrates the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively hack into the phone company and make free long distance calls.
It’s been widely written about the device, but Jobs’ euphoria here when describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box by using a pay phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another, while creating a loop with as many satellites as possible.
“We were wrapping things around the world a half-dozen times and you’d yell through the pay phone and come back a minute later to the pay phone next door,” Jobs says with a chuckle.
“We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world.”
The two of us didn’t know much, but we could build a small thing that could control a giant thing – it was an amazing lesson, and I don’t think Apple would have ever existed without it.
Jobs goes on to describe a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost abandoned, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and requesting to speak to the Pope, while making his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the U.S. diplomat, the two burst out in laughter just before the pope himself was awakened to go answer the phone.
On falling in love with technology (and selling over the phone with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, hunting for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and made a call.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone conversation, Jobs landed a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
“That was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company I had seen at that age and shaped my vision of what a company was and how well they treated their employees.”
Jobs later became one of HP’s employees who visited the company’s research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw “the first desktop computer ever made.”
It was as big as a suitcase, it had a small cathode-tube screen, and I fell in love with it.
I would get a trip to HP as a teenager and waste time with that machine and write programs for it.
On improvising innovation:
At various points in the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the fly.
Soon in his career, as he set about selling a handful of motherboards, a customer asked him if he could assemble all the equipment.
Working with only 30 days of credit, I had to figure out the assembly and delivery of the finished devices.
Later, while at Apple, he remembers the struggles he faced in developing a computer mouse:
“I remember having dramatic arguments ... they yelled at me that it would take five years [to create a mouse that would cost $300], and I got fed up and went outside and found a designer.
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15 and that was totally reliable.
On large companies losing strength:
Long before he led Apple’s renaissance, Jobs prophetically foresaw how many industry leaders would stumble over his vision, and lose control of their market share.
“Say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make photocopiers and printers better, so what?”
You have a monopoly of market share, so the company is no more successful.
Sales and marketing departments increase success, so it is this class of people who end up running the companies and the people in charge of the products are expelled from the forum for decision-making.
The genius of the products that led to that monopoly position is rotted by people who do not have the notion of good products vs. bad products - the necessary knowledge of the trade.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have taken over the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, it could have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They took the defeat of victory.
On innovation as an artistic expression:
“There’s an enormous amount of work between a great idea and a great product ... as the great idea evolves, it changes and grows.”
You learn a lot about the subtleties of it.
There are sacrifices you have to make – some things you can’t get electrons to do, glass to do them, robots to do them, factories to do them.
You have to keep 5000 things in your brain - these concepts - fit them all at once...
In the end it all comes down to taste - it comes down to trying to expose yourself to the best that a team of humans has done, and then trying to adapt those things to what you're doing.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We've never been ashamed about stealing great ideas.
What partly made the Macintosh great was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who happened to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn’t for computer science, you might be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas have dinner with health care law rivals as court accepts case
On the day the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to examine the politically controversial question of whether they would accept President Obama’s defiance of the health care law, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were treated to a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will present the case to the high court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met in a preliminary hearing to carefully study the requests for review.
One of the cases in question was a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging the comprehensive health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying cry for conservative activists across the country.
The justices agreed to admit the lawsuit and, in fact, a historic 5-1/2-hour plea is expected by March, and the result is likely to further cloud the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing by the time the court’s decision is known.
The lawyer who will appear in court and argue that the law should be scrapped will likely be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. attorney general during the George W. Bush administration.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a longtime group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that defied the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial stake in the outcome of the litigation.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel hours after the court’s preliminary hearing on the case.
Attendees included Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the Senate and an outspoken opponent of the health care law.
Special guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
It’s nothing new: The two judges have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
And it’s not something that conflicts with ethical norms.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct that governs the actions of lower federal magistrates.
If they were not, they would arguably fall under Canon Code 4C, which says, “A judge may attend fund-raising events of law-related and other organizations, although the judge may not be a speaker, a guest of honor, or be on the program of such an event.”
However, Scalia and Thomas’ absolute proximity to two of the law firms in the case, as well as to a company with enormous financial interest, was enough to alarm ethics activists in the government.
“This stunning gap in ethics and indifference to the code runs counter to the demands of several justices who abide by the same rules that apply to all federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, the president of Common Cause.
"The judges were feted in a gala fundraiser with lawyers who have cases pending in court."
Their appearance and assistance in fundraising for this event undermines any demand for fairness, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in criticism that they say too easily blends court activity with the agenda pushed by groups like the Federalist Society.
And Thomas’ wife, Ginni, is a prominent conservative activist.
On the other hand, conservatives argue that it is Judge Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as attorney general for the Obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law were presented in trial court.
Critics have pushed for Kagan to refrain from seeing the case, saying she was too involved in upholding the law to now be impartial.
Kagan hasn't given any indication that he's going to do it.
Boeing Receives Record $18 Billion Order
Emirates has ordered 50 Boeing 777 twin-aisle aircraft, with an option for 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Oman Air, an operation valued at more than $1 billion.
It rarely makes news when a company gets an order for 50 units of its product.
But it’s a big transaction when the company is aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the sale price for the 50 planes amounts to a record $18 billion.
It’s as big as the place where Boeing took the order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a study released Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that over the next 20 years airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion.
Boeing over the weekend announced its largest ever order for commercial jets worth $50 - 50 Boing 777 twin-aisle jets.
The successful order came from Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more aircraft, bringing the total sales price to $26 billion, Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Airshow.
Then, on Monday, Boeing said Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, boasting spectacular fuel savings and passenger services.
The selling price for six of them is more than a billion dollars.
“This clearly has a huge positive effect for Boeing,” Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora said.
"The quality of these particular customers is very strong."
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by their oil-producing nations.
Therefore, not only do they have the money to pay for the planes, but an increase in fuel prices - usually harmful to airlines, because it is one of the biggest costs - is not so harmful, because the country is making money from the rise in the price of oil.
That’s important because they’re less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay flight orders when fuel prices rise, Dihora said.
“They have natural protection,” he said.
The Emirates order solidifies Boeing’s leadership in the widebody aircraft market and helps keep at bay competitor Airbus SAS’s attempt to invade its domain with the A350 airliner.
Boeing's victory at the air show comes four months after Airbus said it would delay the debut of the larger A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
It delayed the debut to add more momentum after customers demanded increased payload and range.
Shares of Boeing Co rose 1.5 percent to $67.94.
The sister of the president of Mexico, apparently defeated in the Michoacán vote
Luisa María Calderón claims that drug traffickers helped her PRI opponent, Fausto Vallejo, in the governor’s race.
President Felipe Calderon’s sister appears to have lost her run for governor of Michoacán during the violent state’s elections, and she claimed Monday that drug traffickers helped tip the race in favor of one of her opponents.
Preliminary results gave the lead in the race for governor of the western state to Fausto Vallejo, of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
“The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and, especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but for the entire country,” Luisa María Calderón said in a radio interview a day after Sunday’s vote.
“They threatened our candidates, our electoral workers... They seized the polls, set up barricades... and ordered people to vote” in favor of the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
However, it is the staging of a comeback, and the victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI is hoping to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo appears to have narrowly overtaken Calderon, who had led the polls before the election.
Calderon, a candidate for his brother’s conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left-wing candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently holds the governorship, came in third place, a major defeat for the divided and unlucky left ahead of the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also declined to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, a former mayor of the state capital of Morelia, denied ties to drug trafficking and urged other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is the home state of President Calderón, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive directed against traffickers in December 2006.
However, the violence has persisted.
A PAN mayor was assassinated a week before the election while campaigning for Luisa María Calderón, and numerous candidates left local candidates out of fear.
Although for the PRI, unpleasant as the Michoacán elections may seem, a victory will help boost the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential elections, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said: "I think this victory should be very encouraging, looking ahead to next year."
The ADB urges Asia to help rescue the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has called on India and China to prepare to help rescue the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term recession that would impede the growth of Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the Manila-based Asian Development Bank, said the world’s two largest, fastest-growing economies had to “do everything possible” to accelerate the bloc’s recovery either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against the BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries looking at Europe’s difficulties in an “impartial” way and said that Asia’s financial assistance along with European leadership and resources would help avoid a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
“So anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful,” he told the Financial Times in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it may not be immune."
“So if China and India can help, let it be by all means.”
The European monetary union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s borrowing costs have skyrocketed dangerously and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has raised fears that it could push the world economy into recession and prompted calls for major emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but said bilateral assistance – such as buying bonds from the EU bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Fund – offered greater bargaining power for Europe’s Asian partners.
Indian Trade Minister Anand Sharma said "India is going to do everything possible" to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering from falling exports and exhaustion of foreign capital inflows.
“Nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent,” he said.
“We have monumental challenges and we have to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not an option, it’s an imperative, because where do we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women?”
Others argue that developing economies like India have no responsibility to help wealthy Europeans when faced with their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the US, said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to Europe for India’s 1.2 billion people, of whom up to 800 million live on about $2 a day or less.
“At some point they will realize that Greeks retire at the age of 50 and go on vacation to the beaches and that won’t go well,” he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India’s reserves should be used to keep Greece’s many well-paid public sector workers in jobs at poorly managed, loss-making companies like the railways.
Mr Nag said the eurozone crisis threatened "significant knock-on effects" across Asia.
The Asian Development Bank’s forecast of 7.5 percent economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 now faces “downside risks” due to the threat from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets needed to make “contingency plans” to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Serious Pentagon Warnings About Possible Defense Cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta heated Congress on Monday, warning that the coming automatic budget cuts could undermine national security and trigger a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon aisles, to Afghanistan’s battlefields, to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon is already digesting the $450 billion of reductions over the next decade, but now fears an additional $600 billion or more in cuts that may be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
“The impact of these cuts would be devastating to the department,” Panetta said in a letter to Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.
He said Congress’ failure to agree on the budget and its aftermath, the so-called “kidnapping,” would result in 23 percent overall reductions and a halt to many new projects.
“Such a large cut, applied in this indiscriminate manner, would make most of our naval and construction projects unexecutable – you can’t buy three-quarters of a ship or a building – and seriously damage other modernization efforts,” Panetta wrote to senators.
“We would also be forced to remove many of our civilian officials involuntarily and, because the drawdown would be imposed so quickly, we would almost certainly have to license civilians in order to meet the target.”
“These changes would break faith with those who maintain our military and seriously damage goodwill.”
The cuts would eventually reach combat troops, Panetta said.
“While wartime funding in Overseas Contingency Operations accounts is not directly affected by the hijacking, war efforts would be negatively impacted by severe disruptions to grassroots budgets,” Panetta warned.
“The recruitment of personnel would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and oversight of the contract supporting the war.”
Staff on payroll would be reduced, leading to delays in payments to suppliers in time of war, and legal and political support would be disrupted.
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information about the possible impact of the automatic cuts on the Defense Department.
“The consequence of a hijacking at the Department of Defense would cause a rapid decline of the United States as the world’s leading military power.”
“We are firmly against this draconian action,” the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they released Panetta’s letter.
“This is not a result that we can live with, and it’s certainly not one that we should impose on ourselves.”
Kidnapping is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and should not be allowed to happen.”
Whether Panetta’s letter and recent warnings from senators will increase pressure for a budget compromise or intensify calls to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly outspoken about potential cuts, even though he came to a job at the top of the Pentagon with years of budget experience in Congress and the White House and knowing he faced tough decisions.
At a press conference last week, the defense secretary painted a bleak picture of what might be ahead – an army with a shell, but not a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without bullets."
"It's an air wing without enough trained pilots."
“It’s a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to fulfill the mission,” Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
“It is a force that suffers from low morale, poor preparation and is unable to keep up with potential adversaries.”
"Indeed, it invites aggression..."
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta spells out new details of how the reductions “generate significant operational risks: delayed response time to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limits our ability to be previously deployed and engaged around the world; and poses an unacceptable risk in future combat operations.”
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could tackle the axe, including those already being tested and some only in the early stages of planning.
That list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter fighter jet, a planned new bomber, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new littoral combat ship and the new ground combat vehicle the Army and Navy need to replace, the humvee.
Halting further development and testing of the F35 could generate about $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is the vital next step in improving and dealing with potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to detect a lie
A look at the most recent headlines tells us how serious and pervasive deception and lying are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging sexual harassment allegations with several women; each party accuses the other of lying.
Pennsylvania State University administrators have been charged with perjury for allegedly concealing reports that a retired soccer coach was sexually assaulting children.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was “stuck” with an open microphone claiming US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lying has destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
New York Congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself with his quickly refuted denials of the irrefutable proof.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with campaign finance violations related to the cover-up of an extramarital affair.
And again, no one who lived it will ever forget the media circus unleashed by President Bill Clinton when he lied during his second term about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Legends about cheating in school and college exams are widespread.
There have been instances where teachers have given test responses to students in order to be better seen in their performance evaluations.
Mentors who should be teaching the opposite are sending the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How much deception do we find?
On any given day, studies show that you can be lied to anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
Sure, a lot of those lies are godly lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting.
Detecting lies, or “finding lies,” is an essential skill that we all must acquire, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a board game similar to, for example, Charada, where the goal is to exclaim, “I have you,” the detection of deception is a branch of serious knowledge based on scientific data obtained during the last six decades at prestigious universities that carried out in-depth research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the old myths about lying have been refuted.
The liars look into the eyes.
They don’t always stutter, babble, blush, or fuss.
Nor can it be concluded that liars are difficult to detect or unmask.
A trained lie detector can come to the truth by learning about statement structure, microfacial expressions, question formation, and timings.
I spent several years probing scientific discoveries about deception in the vast and ever-emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that detecting deception is a modern technique that is easy to learn and helps navigate our complex world – especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, or managing negotiations.
Good liars have the ability to read others well, making them feel at ease, managing their own emotions, and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men tell more "self-oriented lies," while women tell more "other-oriented" lies -- usually to protect someone's feelings -- that married people lie less frequently to their partners than people who are not married (but the lies they usually tell tend to be "huge").
We also know that if you are perceived as a wrongdoer, others will feel less guilty about lying to you.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, observe the subject's usual behavior.
This is called "creating a baseline."
It helps provide benchmarks for later measuring changes.
Observe the subject’s posture, laughter, and vocal characteristic.
You’d better know if someone normally taps your foot all the time so you don’t make unfair accusations when you see your feet tapping in the middle of the meeting.
Next, look for deceptive, verbal, and nonverbal behavioral groups.
Consider these behavioral groups as warning signs, not proof of deception.
People who cheat can freeze their upper body by trying to remember their story, can point their feet toward the door, lean toward an exit, change their posture significantly, or exhibit a "post-interview release" -- that exaggerated sigh of relief and change of posture once all the tough questions are over.
Questioners often falsely pretend that the interview is over only to seek that post-interview relief.
Also pay attention to the subject’s vocabulary.
Scott Peterson screwed up to the bottom and used the time passed while claiming his murdered wife was alive, launching a nationwide search for her.
People who cheat can also use distancing language: "I didn't have sex with that woman...Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "restrictive language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... even as far as I know... as I understand."
This makes the response a perception rather than a fact and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for detecting lies, but developing skills to uncover deception is possible.
These skills will improve anyone’s chances to avoid being victimized by scam artists in their professional and personal lives.
Controversial pipeline plan diverted after threat of U.S. delay in approval
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- infuriating labor unions while appeasing environmentalists -- the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is willing to redirect the project to get it back on track.
TransCanada said late Monday it will move the planned pipeline out of the environmentally sensitive Sandhills area in Nebraska, and is confident the project will win approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada CEO Alex Pourbax says the company remains confident that over time the pipeline will be approved, albeit with a different route.
This follows the announcement last week by the State Department that they would delay the decision for a federal permit for the project until potential new routes bypassing the Sandhills areas of Nebraska and the Ogallala Aquifer, a vast groundwater supply, are studied.
“This is a real path of progress,” Rep. Lee Terry, R-Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department is likely to set aside any decisions until 2013, after next year’s election, though officials denied the policy was involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department’s request, and expressed his full support for them.
The 1,700-kilometer pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would carry 700,000 barrels per day from Alberta province to refineries in Texas.
To do this, it would need to cross six states.
He is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, who have bet on the estimate of 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are weighing legislation to force a move away from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala Aquifer, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department’s current environmental impact study found that the project posed only limited adverse environmental impacts, but the energy industry source said the department’s inspector general has ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliot, who was Hillary Clinton’s campaign adviser in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a firm that was hired to run the original studio was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a child to vomit in fear
A New York family claims disco diva Patti LaBelle behaved like a madwoman in the lobby of her Manhattan building, terrifying her young daughter to the point that she vomited in fear.
The "Lady Marmalade" singer's tirade frightened 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased her fear of strangers," her family says in Manhattan Supreme Court.
It was Nov. 10 last year when stagehand Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were getting ready to go on a family trip.
As Kevin Monk picked up the car, Roseanna Monk descended into the lobby of the Riverside Boulevard building, carrying her luggage, carrying Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stood near the door and put her daughter on the floor for a moment.
“Somebody came up from behind and said, ‘Do you know what your daughter is doing?’ I said ‘yes’ and I went to get her,” she said.
LaBelle angrily admonished the pregnant woman.
“He said in an aggressive tone, ‘You shouldn’t have left your daughter near the door,’” Roseanna Monk said.
“I said, ‘I have no interest in what you say or think.’
He got angry and started using bad words - the C word and the J word out loud...
I had a bottle of water and he started throwing the water from the bottle on me.”
He said Genevieve got hysterical.
"I said to this woman, 'Look what you've done to my daughter,'" the girl's mother said.
LaBelle pounced on the mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and had to be restrained by her surroundings and removed to a waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
The little girl was crying so hard she vomited, he added.
Later, the family sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but got no response.
LaBelle’s lawyer and representatives did not return calls to comment on what happened.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but the family's attorney, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate all the money it gets to a partnership supporting children with cancer.
“The purpose is to hold Patti LaBelle accountable for her conduct,” Davis said.
“That kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially when it’s directed at a kindergarten teacher carrying an 18-month-old child.”
Climate Adversity Cures the Economy
During the first year of Mario López Valdez’s administration, in Sinaloa, unemployment and informality have increased, foreign investment has fallen and the economy has contracted.
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, self-styled of the change, which generated great expectations regarding the advances in the economy, but given the climatic adversity of the beginning of the year, no growth is observed, instead there is a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February, in addition to causing millions of losses for the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the state economy to grow, caused a contraction in overall economic activity of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, justified mainly by the historic fall of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the report of frost damage, issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, 582,835 hectares were damaged, of which 78.03 percent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 percent had partial damage, the main crops damaged were vegetables, corn and chickpeas.
The fall in economic activity has generated, until November, a constant increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the state unemployment rate during the first three quarters of the year was observed an accelerated growth, since while from January to March 55,053 Sinaloenses were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent of the economically active population, for the second quarter the rate continued to be 5.69 percent.
Less liquidity
The unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for the economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions that have been carried out from public policy.
“What you are seeing is a growth in unemployment that has to do with several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to a resource constraint by legislation that was passed in Congress to combat money laundering, and for people who illegally take dollars it is not easy to work them, invest them and use them in something,” he said.
Detained migration
López Cervantes pointed out that there is also a demographic factor in the increase in unemployment.
"The number of people who leave the state looking for work abroad in the United States has been restricted, first because of the difficulties to enter, and second because they already have a lot of difficulties to find work, these people are staying and are demanding sources of work here in the state, which makes unemployment rise," he said.
Informality
The analysis of the Sinaloa labor market is aggravated when considering the high level of informality that predominates among the working conditions, according to the INEGI, 60.38 percent of the employed population in the state works without being quoted as a worker before any social security institution.
In addition to unemployment and informality, another of the state’s labor lags are low wages, the entity has the lowest salaries in the country, according to records from the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Ministry of Labor and Social Security.
The average monthly income of Sinaloan workers was, until September, 5,352 pesos, well below the national average, located at 7,375 pesos.
Contraction of FDI
Coupled with the fall in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, during 2011 there was the largest decrease in Foreign Direct Investment in the last 10 years, according to the Ministry of Economy from January to June of the state FDI totaled 630 thousand 697 dollars, which represents a fall of 87.74 percent compared to the 5 million 143 thousand 312 dollars registered during the same period of the previous year.
For its part, the Ministry of Economic Development of the State Government accounts for a total investment of 17.28 billion pesos in the year, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
The debt
Faced with the scenario of economic contraction, the State Government requested in July to the state congress the approval of a loan for 3 billion pesos, which would be allocated for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, in order to revive the economy, the approval of the local congress was for an amount of 2.6 billion pesos, and until November they have not observed the benefits of indebtedness in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For representatives of the business sector, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdés shows a lack of management capacity of the Government.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that during 2011 he lacked the harmonization of the wills of the different sectors, including the State Government itself.
"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, we have to work intensely to recover the ground we lost this year, in 2012 we have to redouble efforts, we lacked to align the effort of everyone and above all the good progress already synchronized of this new government team, we hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López said that events such as the frosts at the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is the product of several events, including frost, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn around fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we are closing well below the expectations we had," he said.
Redefining vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Employers’ Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, said that it is necessary to direct the state towards productive activities of greater dynamism.
“In general terms we have observed that work has been done, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program in which the vocation and economic course of the state is redefined, because it is important that the full potential of the material and human resource that Sinaloa has is detonated,” he said.
Work to do
The president of the Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision of the future that better guides the efforts of the Government.
"Generally speaking, I would say that the government has been striving to give good results in different areas, in terms of economic development there is some progress but it is important that a long-term program is developed," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in how it conducts public policy.
“There are elements that allow us to say that the government is being more inclusive, what I can say is that there is work done and I think the government is aware that there is work to be done,” he said.
Sentenced for 8 kg of marijuana
A neighbor of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days of fine for the possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Attorney General’s Office reported that the convicted narco trafficker is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the crime of against health, in his variant of possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by elements of the Mexican Army, on June 7, 2010, in a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite post 80, in the town of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug addict was driving in a white pickup truck, where he carried a black bag in the vehicle’s box and in the passenger’s seat a small backpack, where the military found eight kilograms 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the insurance remained at the disposal of the Second District Judge and the sentenced person remains in the Center for the Execution of the Legal Consequences of Crime.
Must contribute to works
Works of a social nature contemplated in programs such as Habitat, Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed or of having serious delays due to the lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The director of municipal social development indicated that although so far the work programs have advanced, they are at risk because the State Government has not complied with the contributions that correspond to it, which add up to a resource of more than 11 million pesos in the three programs.
He pointed out that in total the investment in these three programs is almost 50 million pesos, of which the State corresponds to 25 percent and that so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, so the possible delay in the conclusion of these is effective.
"There are almost 12 million what they have to contribute and despite the fact that the year is about to end they have not given us even a fifth, when since July they should have given us a part," he said, "we have started the works and are very advanced, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State did not comply with the contributions that corresponded to them, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to request a loan to cover the more than 7 million that the state administration did not provide on that occasion.
“It happened to us in the previous six years because the State did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs continued walking, and this year we had to get the resources to access these programs to cover what the State left pending,” he explained.
Despite the commitment of the state authorities to comply with the delivery of these resources, he commented that the request has been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to expedite the efforts so that the percentages that correspond to them arrive as soon as possible.
"There are almost 12 million people who have to contribute and despite the fact that the year is about to end, they have not given us even a fifth."
Cut validates "analog blackout" in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analog with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional controversies that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed against the presidential decree that advances the so-called “analog blackout” from 2021 to 2015, by not meeting the eight votes necessary to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers by issuing the decree that details the actions to follow to realize the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was dismissed for not reaching the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to pronounce on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and it remains in force.
The draft judgment, prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed declaring the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television matters is a faculty reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reservation of law.
In favor of the project only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero herself voted.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree, and upon admitting the demands, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions in it arranged for the digital transition.
The plenary of ministers also decided to dismiss the lawsuit filed by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the discussion of the project, also in charge of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the minister president said he does not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure through general rules the measures for the public administration to prepare.
"I also do not believe that doing so would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector correspond to the Federal Executive, which has the constitutional mandate, the rectory of the State.
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years, and results in better utilization of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Postponing the change, he said, would be postponing the benefits of digitization, which involves a decision in the public interest, which does not have only a technical dimension, “because it covers economic, social, political and national security issues.”
These issues, he stressed, "demand the operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of economic rectory of the State, encompasses a group of attributions that the Constitution leads to the power of the State Executive."
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition, and have done so through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the impugned decree, invades in some way the sphere of competence of the Congress, since it is providing in the administrative sphere the observance of the laws issued by the Legislative, he said.
They analyze the possibility of a "vote by vote" count in Michoacán
According to the data provided by the PREP, the difference between first and second place of the governor’s election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
The possibility of "vote by vote" counting is a reality in terms of this year's electoral process in Michoacán, where according to the data released by the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP) the difference between first and second place of the governor's election is barely 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
In this regard, the president of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, just on November 9, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines in order to harmonize local norms with the federal reform in electoral matters.
As will be recalled, Michoacán did not approve its Political Constitution or its State Electoral Code or its Electoral Justice Law, since the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the end of the legal period for them to enter into force in the present electoral process and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted their publication within the deadlines provided for in the Law on the Official State Newspaper, on the grounds that he had some objections.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Legislative Power and described as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the state president to constitutional reforms, since he has no right to "sanction or veto them."
Interviewed about the possibility of "voting by vote", María de los Ángeles Llanderal explained that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of the IEM it will be possible to carry out partial and total recounts of the vote by the local electoral body.
In this way, the partial count of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may occur in the assumptions that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no act of scrutiny and computation in the file of the box or does not work in the possession of the president of the same; or, when there are errors or obvious alterations of the minutes.
In addition, the total count of the vote received at all polling stations in the election may be made when there is an indication that the difference between the candidate presumed to have won the election in question and the one who obtained the second place in the vote is equal to or less than one percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is the express request of the representative of the party and/or coalition that nominated the second of the indicated candidates.
The total count of the vote may also be carried out if at the end of the ordinary count it is established that the difference between the candidate allegedly winning and the one placed in second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is the express request of the representative of the political party whose candidate was placed in second place, in which case the electoral packages that have been the subject of a partial count will be excluded.
It is worth mentioning that in this situation is the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP the difference between the first and second place is just 0.16 percent, although without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered in the Sierra de Zapalinamé, the family confirms.
The remains of pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés arrived in Saltillo, his hometown, on Sunday night, during a reconnaissance and a requiem mass.
According to his relatives, the lieutenant colonel’s last wish was for his ashes to be scattered in the Sierra de Zapalinamé.
After receiving a tribute from the other people killed in the accident, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila aboard a Mexican Air Force aircraft, the people closest to him attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At noon, the lieutenant colonel’s ashes arrived at the chapel located on Nazario Ortiz Garza Boulevard, where family and friends were arriving.
At 5:30 in the afternoon he was given a recognition at the Technological Institute of Saltillo organized by his former companions of the technological baccalaureate and the American football team, of which Felipe Bacio was part during his preparation of baccalaureate.
"His will was that he return to Saltillo and that his ashes were scattered in the mountains of Zapalinamé, he always expressed it this way to his family and his friends," this revealed Sandra Bacio Cortés sister of the pilot.
For her, the lieutenant colonel had fulfilled all his dreams, he considers that he was in the fullness of his life, "he was a successful man, extraordinary as a father, as a son, a loving brother and pending of his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young to enter the Air School in Zapopan, Jalisco.
Some did not believe it because they said he even got dizzy in the truck; however, he always sought to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a very good person, "just was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, like the occasion he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man remembers that even when he was seven years old he traveled to Zapopan for the graduation of his family, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he liked most in life: piloting an aircraft.
They give him his last goodbye
Felipe Bacio Cortés, Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, was fired with honors, in tribute headed by Governor Jorge Torres López, and that he was paid by the people and Government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, executives and students of the Technological of Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and stood out both in the study and in sport.
Bacio Cortés, died in recent days when the helicopter that he was piloting collapsed, along with the Secretary of the Interior, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six other people, all officials of that agency.
At 6:05 p.m., the remains of Saltillense Bacio Cortés arrived (cremados), to be delivered by the funeral home to members of the Mexican Air Force, headed by Major Jaime Martinez, in the esplanade of the campus, where he was already expected by his relatives, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, brothers and other relatives, students and teachers.
Three bodies found abandoned in Cadereyta NL estate
Hours before the discovery, the military authority presented to the media eleven people who were arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot to death in different parts of the body and with the shot of grace, in an abandoned farm in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery happened at kilometer 1.5 of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the height of the community known as El Castillo.
Several people who passed through the place observed that in the fifth, whose wall is beige with coffee, was the open gate wide.
Looking inside, about three meters, they located the bodies of three people, so they immediately gave notice to the corresponding authorities.
One of the individuals was wearing a yellow shirt with dark denim pants, without shoes; next to him was another with a white tank top.
A few feet away was the body of another man in a red shirt and blue denim pants.
All three were face down.
According to the data obtained at the site, the three people would have been killed elsewhere, since no shell casings were found at the site.
In the wall of the fifth you can see legends that are directed from one group of organized crime to another, in addition to several bullet holes in it and the gate.
11 captured in Cadereyta
The Ministry of National Defense made the presentation of 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Cadereyta and who are related to kidnappings, homicides, "hawking" and clandestine burials.
According to the information released, in a first event on November 11 in the Los Alveros colony, eight people were arrested and one who was still deprived of her freedom was rescued.
They were secured three properties and a cell phone; they claimed to be members of the criminal group called "Los Zetas".
In another event that occurred on November 12 at 06:00 hours, military personnel carried out a surveillance tour in the Rancho Viejo town, in Cadereyta, detecting a car without plates and with two subjects on board.
By marking their stop and conducting the inspection, the military found a long gun, a magazine and 18 cartridges.
Later and after these statements, on November 13 at 14:00 hours one of his accomplices was arrested in the ejido La Frauda, who on seeing the military tried to flee.
They are attributed clandestine burials in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday.
Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti will meet with Italy’s president tomorrow to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put that country on the brink of economic disaster.
Italian Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti will meet with Italy’s president on Wednesday to unveil a new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and put the entire eurozone in danger.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet on Wednesday with President Giorgio Napolitano to confirm he can form a government.
He is expected to present a cabinet made up mostly of technocrats, though it is unclear when the new executive will take office.
Monti said he will present the president with the outcome of his talks with political parties in his bid to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say he could form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that obstacles have been overcome.
The "framework is now well delineated," he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than normal, as Italy battles a political and financial crisis that has pushed its debt costs to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must pass a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to regain battered confidence in Italy.
Underscoring pressure on Monti to hurry, market instability put the yield on Italian 10-year BTP bonds above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be bailed out.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of Italian employers' association Confindustria, told reporters after meeting Monti: "We said we would be very supportive of this government."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti’s chances of success were boosted considerably by the backing of Silvio Berlusconi’s PDL party, whom the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined to have a good result," Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party, told reporters.
The support of the PDL, Italy’s largest party, is significant because so far many of its members have opposed the technocrat-majority government that Monti is forming.
Parliamentary support
Monti’s new government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what are likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in their efforts could trigger a devastating new attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by warning that a Monti failure would be a disaster.
Monti began consultations Monday with political parties, trade unions and business groups, as well as youth and women’s organizations.
He will end his round of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was named on Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would step down, Italian debt costs have now returned to critical levels amid uncertainty over whether the new prime minister will succeed.
To bail out Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros, would be too much for the eurozone’s current financial defenses.
Monti has said his government should last until the next election, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement reforms before early elections.
Monti has said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but major parties insist it should be made up of only technicians, an indication of their qualms about a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources pointed out that mutual distrust and disagreements between parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures.
The brush of the Spaniards is superior to that of the Ticos
Of the 22 players called from Spain, ten exceed the 50 international games.
On the side of Costa Rica only one of the 22 called came to 50 meetings.
A major contrast to Costa Rica, compared to the 22 called up by both countries for today’s friendly at 3:05 p.m. at the San Jose National Stadium.
While the world and European champions, number one in the FIFA monthly ranking, account for an extensive record of class A inter-selection games, the Tricolor only owns defender Michael Umaña as the only one to have all 50 international matches.
That figure was reached the previous Friday in the match against Panama (0-2), at Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players who play in the League of Stars and in powerful clubs of the Premier League of England, maintain an intense activity in league championships and domestic cup, and high level clashes in European cups like Champions League.
To the above is added the experience with the Spanish Fury in complicated qualifiers of the Euro and the World Cup.
Ticos, on the other hand, have a limited international touch in an area, such as Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the maximum record of the Spanish National Team is of goalkeeper Oker Casillas, who on the previous Saturday against England (fall 0-1 in London) matched the record of the exporter Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play today against Tricolor and they will set a new record for Spain of 127 internationals.
Xavi Hernández, Barcelona's cerebral flyer, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi, even, were recognized the previous week by UEFA along with the other centenarians of the Iberian team, the aforementioned Zubizarreta with 126 and Schalke’s batter, Raúl González, with 102.
Almost close to the centenary figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
They are followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fabregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the Tico side, and near Michael Umaña, are left-back Júnior Díaz, with 48 presences, and gunner Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five surpassed the 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31) are featured.
On the national side, with fewer than 30 appearances, appear Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest don't come close to 8:00.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba has two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolivar has only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson still do not debut.
Spain’s historic scorer is David Villa, with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one with the most points with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quintet included the country in its two-decade-long celebration tour
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to perform one of their best shows next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They have been waiting more than 20 years, but the band assures that for them it will also become a reality the dream of playing in the country.
This was assured by bassist and founding member Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The group is in the South American wing of its two-decade-long celebration tour and on Sunday 20th it will make its only stop in Central America.
That day they will perform at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., with the Angelina band The X and the Las Robertas nationals.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript of which is on The Nation on the Internet.
For his Costa Rican fans, it is a dream come true that Pearl Jam is going to play in Costa Rica, are you aware of what your fans are experiencing?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is just our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been great.
I have been to Costa Rica only once and on vacation; it is such a beautiful country and I think we will be able to stay a few days there.
So we’re excited to bring our music there.
I ask because there is a kind of devotion to the band, the fans live with intensity the days before.
What do you say to your most ardent followers?
Thank you for staying by our side through all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thank you for having waited so long and we regret that it has taken us so long to get there.
Some people even refer to their concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a bit of pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve played over the last 21 years happened over the last couple of weeks.
We played a couple of gigantic shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We’re really looking forward to playing there.
We love that country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did they discover Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
We have a lot of friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are amazing.
My friends always went surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great places to surf; that’s how we found out, through people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, they have been delivering huge shows with many songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played there before, then we have no restriction on what we can do.
We will try to give the best show possible with a good variety of songs; we will try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
Why is this?
I think it’s partially because we have nine records and we can play over 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it’s hard to choose which songs to play each night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven’t played for a while, that keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because it reminds us of the reasons why we liked those songs and that we might have forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it also makes it more interesting for people.
With this tour, they are celebrating 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you’ve accomplished?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I don’t think any of us imagined we’d be in a great rock band and having done it for over 20 years makes it seem like a dream.
We continue to count our blessings and are so excited that we can continue to make music together.
We all love and love to make music.
We’re lucky to go to places in the world we’ve always wanted to go.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What did it mean to you to have been a fundamental part of the rise of grunge?
It’s always been an honor to be a part of that group of great bands.
We are very friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is something unusual.
From time to time, a city band emerges, but it is much stranger when five or ten bands leave the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour, so we’re lucky to be friends with all of them still and we’re honored to be part of that Seattle sound that came out.
It’s also very strange that a band like yours stays together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which, by itself, is much longer than many bands last.
First, I think we’re all lucky to still be alive, and second, we all care about each other.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to that, musical avenues have also been opened that give each one freedom to experiment.
We trust each other with each other’s music and it couldn’t be better.
Your relationship with the word fame has not been simple; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do whatever you want.
How do they find a balance?
As we have grown, it has been easier to find a balance.
We make sure you’re not too much on tour because it’s easy to fall for that game of the big crowds and the people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are there for the music, that reminds you to respect the music and what brought it, without getting infatuated by being famous and being a rock star, something that none of us really cares about.
How do you remember your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and at the beginning it was a great thing.
We were a band for almost three years and never released an album until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There were a lot of frustrations because it lasted so long and the most important thing is that we are still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a photo I think about the incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and much more.
He was an amazing human being and we missed him.
The national band Las Robertas will be in charge of opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that’s why you chose her for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with several proposals and that was the band we liked the most, so we are eager to see what Las Robertas can offer live and must be very entertaining.
Why do they always change the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter live?
That’s a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don’t know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first thing he can think of.
As a bass player, what are your influences?
That's so many.
Among the first ones that come to mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bass players that I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep grunge relevant despite not already being a fashion?
I think all of us always feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I mentioned before, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all of those that came out at the same time, and, if there’s relevance now, I think it’s a wonderful thing because it’s music that’s worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are making better music now than ever before.
At first, his music had a darker content and now it has become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
It’s interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that may seem lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe that qualify as very dark songs even though they may sound a bit positive.
With both, when Ed played them to me, I cried when I heard them and they are deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow up and there’s some trauma in your life and you lose a family member or a friend, those things start to influence your art and your music and those two songs certainly represent that to me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted Tuesday to a public hospital to be evaluated for loss of muscle strength in his legs, his family doctor said.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his rule (1990-2000), suffers from several ailments, including a tongue cancer for which he has been operated on four times and which is kept under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told Channel N television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength of his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to obtain the benefit of the pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, he said that he does not want it because he knows he is innocent.
He was operated four times of cancer to the tongue, has a weight loss of 18 kilos to which other pathologies have been added such as severe erosive gastritis, cyst of the pancreas, kidney stones, hypertension and circulatory problems in the legs, listed the doctor.
Fujimori has been serving time in the National Special Operations Directorate of the police since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the deaths of 25 people at the hands of an army annihilation squad that operated clandestinely in the early years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official delegation, headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica and composed of several ministers and businessmen, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday in order to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of an extensive agenda of meetings with political and commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayans living in Mexico, according to the agenda disseminated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be "propitious for the exchange of information on all that are the political issues between the two nations," according to the Presidency of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that emerged when the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, included the South American country in a list of tax havens, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havens, a statement that provoked the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultation to its ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has chaired the G20 since November, a group composed of the most powerful emerging and developed countries in the world, and has in force with the South American country, since January of this year, an agreement to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to speed up the implementation of tax exchange agreements in order to leave the “grey list” of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), formed by countries that did not implement all the international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
In terms of trade, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in force since 2004 that has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The mustachioed plumber passes the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly over 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but never before has he fought in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the girl's love in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month in stores around the world, has been designed from the beginning to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS portable system, which allows you to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy should work without glasses," said Omar Alvarez, Nintendo's head of specialized press in Spain, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Alvarez noted that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game originally intended for that support", since until now hits such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
The Nintendo spokesman has maintained that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and fluid game.
Alvarez has claimed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hook less skilled users.
Once passed, the most expert will be able to give a "second round" to the levels of play, which this time present greater difficulty.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an “aggressive D” or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions to be able to overcome the different challenges and “not succumb to optical illusions”.
This incursion of Super Mario in the three dimensions also supposes the return of the character to a portable console, a fact that did not occur since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo winks at the followers of the saga and repeats the formula of the success of the previous installments, consisting of the mustache plumber will have to travel through platforms mined from dangers in order to free Princess Peach.
Although the player will find novelties in the movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also a Luigi "playable".
Colom supports Portillo’s extradition to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced Tuesday that he has processed the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to answer in the United States for the conspiracy to launder $70 million.
Thus ends the process for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that claimed Portillo to judge him there.
At a press conference, Colom said that his decision is due to the independence of the judicial and executive powers, taking into account that a sentencing court had already ordered the extradition.
He said that during his term he “did not get his hands on” judicial decisions and processed all extraditions he has known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
What Colom did is an executive procedure after all judicial and constitutional instances were exhausted to prosecute the former president between 2000 and 2004.
According to decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo must be extradited once his legal status in Guatemala has been resolved and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted of embezzlement of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defense when he was president, which was the process that preceded extradition, but the Public Ministry appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to prevent the fall in the marginality of children without training
The balance of the first 25 years of life of the social support entity Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received help to overcome a difficult situation throughout this quarter of a century.
To this is added the hundred long jobs currently obtained for this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to take stock in an event held in the old factory complex of Fabra i Coats attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the neighborhood of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little training, without work, with problems of dogradicion or in a situation of falling into marginality.
The celebration yesterday in Sant Andreu concentrated a large number of heads of entities and institutions that in these 25 years have collaborated with the association.
The varied political representation, in the middle of the electoral season, showed the unitary character of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Together with the president of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the event was attended by the former Minister of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall, and the former deputy mayor and current ecosocialist councilor Ricard Gomà.
The current Minister of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the general director of the social work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also attended the great hall of the Fabra i Coats.
Mas said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current one is too, but added that the work done so far "is a good base."
The president set Trinijove as an example for knowing how to fight against bad circumstances and for giving hope to people in difficulties.
“The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does,” he said.
Evicted an squatted farm where macro-festivals were held
The invaders had taken over 11 of the 13 floors of the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the farm at noon yesterday without offering resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare lived by the residents of 51 Balmes Street has come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left the property they occupied illegally, and where they organized macrofestas that despaired the neighborhood, by court order and without the need for a police intervention.
When the operation ended, the door lock was changed to prevent a repeat of the situation.
"From now on, there will be access control," the administrator said.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building - the rest are inhabited - took all the electrical installation and part of the water, in addition to painting the walls and leaving residues of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the scene of mass parties, which lasted up to two days and despaired the tenants.
Next to the building there is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat told Europa Press that since the building was occupied the business has fallen by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque points out that the invaders of the farm made it unfair competition, since they sold the glasses for three euros, while in the discotheque they are worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment venue had had to respond to neighborhood noise complaints, while, as she pointed out, the discomfort was not caused by the customers of the nightclub, but by the inhabitants of the squatted house and, above all, the attendees of the parties that were organized there, which had increased their frequency and intensity in recent weeks, according to angry neighbors in the area.
The head of the nightclub explained that the inconvenience was so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property and nine months ago she "forgives" him the rent.
The Urban Guard also confirmed that in recent weeks it had received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP in the city council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had demanded last week "immediately dislodge the property to end the problems of coexistence and civility that produce the neighbors, as well as the degradation of the area."
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one floor of the building occupied, but over the last few months the squatters had been entering all the floors of the building and almost all the floors, and that in some there have even been robberies.
In this sense, he added that, "it is necessary to end impunity and be forceful against the incivism that has been generated on the farm."
Also yesterday, the Mossos evicted a building in Nou Barris.
At 1530 hours the police went to 35 Mont-ral Street, after receiving a call from a neighbour who had observed four people entering the building.
All four were arrested at the time.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree on the opportunity of the call beyond controversies about fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, in the heyday of the now-defunct Barcelona Metropolitan Corporation (CMB), this administration printed some promotional passes for Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with New York’s Central Park.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park was again placed, in the imagination of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few that are not oriented in the north-south axis but above (mountain) - below (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park results in this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with wild boars in the role of the Yogi bear.
These were until, in September, the city council convened a megacompetition composed of 16 contests for as many doors of access to Collserola.
A door refers to the idea of park, no doubt.
Either that or someone is trying to put doors in the field.
The question is: Collserola, park or mountain?
The competition, both for its purely organizational aspect and for what it supposes of reflection on the city is the topic of conversation among all the architects of Barcelona.
It is almost already a recurring theme to be grasped when two members of this ancient caste of elect are recognized in an elevator.
And this fact gives rise, precisely, to one of the few coincidences between what three Barcelona architects think, and university professors, who have presented themselves.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Mòdol and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Roldán, after addressing the coastal front "it becomes necessary" to debate about "the mountain front", since the speech of Ildefons Cerdà, that of the green apples, has not been carried out.
"It should be noted that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things because of its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex”, says the architect, for whom the title “doors of Collserola” contains a “lexical trap”: we must not think of them “as the accesses to a park, but the delimitation of some areas where we have to act”.
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, calls the proposal an "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
Dangers derived from the "uncertainty that it is nowadays to project the public space" after the experience lived in the 80s and that had in the area of the Forum "his song of the swan".
The first fear is the very delimitation of borders on where it can be built.
"Limiting something is already fixing the next step," that is, its overstep.
“You have to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current ones [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM)] can give rise to real disasters.”
Closer to the question, Modol believes that, simplifying, the valley slope of Collserola "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, not", by a merely topographical issue.
Mòdol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronat de Collserola that "should not fall on deaf ears", although he appreciates the opportunity that the city council offers to his guild to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
And even more, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe conduct that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubt" about whether it is this technical profile that must lead the multidisciplinary teams ("a success," he points out) that have had to be created: "Architects should be just a tool."
Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question that gives title to this piece is complex, because in the bases of the contest a global vision of Collserola is missing: "16 transversal competitions have been convened -he says- in the mountain-sea sense, but there is no longitudinal reading, which sees and understands the area as a whole".
This causes, at least where appropriate, that you have chosen to participate in the 16 contests.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors may clash in program and definition with that of the next door architect.
In his opinion, yes, the city council should ensure that the strip immediately above the Ronda de Dalt should provide, in all its extension, an area of equipment that would make a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino pardons Jonah Larrazábal and goes free
After 72 days of rooting, the legal representative of Casino Red granted the brother of the mayor of Monterrey forgiveness of the process that followed him for alleged blackmail
After being imprisoned for 72 days, Manuel Jonas Larrazábal will be released after the legal representative of Casino Red granted the pardon before the Second Criminal District Court, which follows a process of blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack on Casino Royale, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, made public a series of photographs and videos in which Manuel Jonas allegedly demanded the payment of an economic fee for the city council to allow the clandestine operation of the betting house.
After the public complaint, the State Attorney opened criminal proceedings against the brother of the PAN mayor and on September 2 he was arrested and detained for 30 days.
After four hours before Public Prosecutor 3 in Patrimonial Crimes, he was transferred to Casa de Arraigo 1, located in the Old Quarter of the state capital.
He remained there for the 49 days following the issuance of a second injunction after the Public Prosecutor’s Office dismissed the crimes of bribery and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Cadereyta prison allegedly for blackmailing the owners of the Casino Red with one and a half million pesos; however, he only remained a few hours in the medium security prison since there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to follow the trial held in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, an arrest warrant was issued by the secretary of the Second Criminal District Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigations, enough evidence was found to determine Jonah’s guilt, such as the payment of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the bookmaker in exchange for allowing the operation of the bookmaker.
On Monday, the legal representative of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, went before the judge José Luis Pecina to request forgiveness for the brother of the royal mayor; so in the next few hours he could recover his freedom.
During the legal proceedings, the agent of the Public Ministry attached to the Court, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez if the damage had been repaired and who of the partners of the bookmaker was the one who granted the forgiveness, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
On the basis of file 197/2011, a legal pardon is granted to Jonas Larrazábal and henceforth no claim may be filed in relation to the process that followed him; in addition, he will not be required to compensate for damage or punishment.
After the hearing with the legal representative of the bookmaker, at about 15:50, Larrazabal Bretón was ordered to be released immediately.
The secretary of the Court, Jorge Yánez, went to the jail of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to notify Jonas that he has been legally forgiven and his file will be archived.
You will also be notified of the immediate release order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the plane crash where the Secretary of the Interior, Francisco Blake, and seven other people lost their lives
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results of the accident where the Secretary of the Interior, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven others lost their lives, indicate that the helicopter impacted directly on the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before taking off the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were suitable for flying.
"Elements that appear to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the blades had contact with trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
It also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it had the necessary requirements to transport the staff.
In addition, he said that the investigations carried out in the impact area do not report the appearance of pieces on the ground.
"In a search it is reported that there are no parts or components of the ship elsewhere, the impact was presented structurally.
“The helicopter’s design was for 19 passengers, it had adequate requirements to transport passengers.
The terrain has a slope of seven degrees at 30 degrees of inclination.
For the moment, the secretary said that it is a priority to have the results before possible; however, the investigation can last several months, even could reach a year.
For his part, Gilberto López Meyer, general director of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said that at the time of the impact, the helicopter of the Presidential General Staff operated at cruising speed and that this happened in a soft ascending terrain.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of normal cruise operation at impact," he said.
At the press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with aeronautical regulations, the flight was carried out under the rules of visual flight, this implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and the terrain.
Weather conditions:
The reports in the AICM located conditions suitable to take off, as the aircraft advances towards the border area between the DF and the State of Mexico there were layers of cloudiness at low altitude.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to the cloud conditions the crew has sought an area of lower elevation and greater visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of impact.
The impact coordinates and the last radar record of the aircraft coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration in the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft debris in a reduced area:
The information available so far allows us to assume that the impact occurred in a straight and sideways path.
The aircraft’s debris dispersal pattern allows us to assume that the helicopter hit the ground under conditions of structural integrity.
No evidence of fire or explosion has been detected:
At the site of the accident, no evidence of any kind of explosion or fire is revealed in the wreckage of the ship.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that he may have had multiple contacts with the ground.
Parts of the aircraft have been found during field work at an elevation of 9,200 feet above mean sea level, the terrain has a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which it was predictably disjointed along this route.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After a thorough search in a wider area than the cordoned-off site, no scattered pieces of the aircraft have been found, strengthening the presumption that the impact occurred under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS Announces Protocol to Find Obesity Gene
Social Security leads research to discover the obesity gene in children and young people; is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) announced that it is conducting research to discover the obesity gene in children and young people, called the "Genetics of Childhood and Adolescence Obesity" protocol, which will allow markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Hospital de Especialidades of the Siglo XXI National Medical Center, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was integrated.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
In the research, the population is invited to participate, whether or not it is entitled, go to the sports units participating in the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where the tests are carried out on minors, every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (State of Mexico West) and that since October 8, the activity is carried out in the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Unit (State of Mexico East).
Once the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 children is met, the study will continue in the Independencia Sports Unit (south of the Federal District) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and importance of genetics with respect to the development of obesity and identify risk factors in Mexican children and young people to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases.
On World Diabetes Day, November 14, he said that the goal is to bring together 3,000 children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the application of specific questionnaires on food.
They will also be asked about physical activity and a family history of diseases, in order to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
Saturdays are applied to all participants anthropometric measurements (weight, size, waist circumference), blood pressure measurement, determination of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin levels and genetics (it seeks to identify genes that are associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López pointed out that this research is due to the concern of health professionals about the alarming weight gain in minors.
"The health surveys of 1999 and 2006 indicated that in just six years there was an increase, in the case of boys, of 77 percent in obesity, and of girls of 47 percent; in terms of overweight there was also a dramatic rise," said the IMSS specialist.
He indicated that the justification for the search for the markers is based on the fact that the population of the country differs from others by its genetic history.
He reported that on average, the Mexican has 65 percent American Indian heritage, 30 percent European and five percent African and this condition is reflected in the genes that are associated with diabetes and excess weight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn the excess energy that we consume (calories) and that is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is the comprehensive evaluation of the children, which allows to detect if they have any degree of overweight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark-colored folds (acanthosis) in the neck and forearm, which indicate the likelihood of metabolic alterations and even prediabetes.
The information is handled confidentially, and doctors hand it over in writing to parents, who are told each of the measurements and lifestyle changes they must make to prevent illness.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentary lifestyle, which is the lack of daily physical activity, sitting most of the day in front of the TV and using means of transport instead of walking short distances.
It is also due to the high caloric intake, that is, the greater consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburger, etc.) with high content of fats and proteins and the genetics analyzed in this protocol.
Asphalt from UNAM would avoid potholes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry of the UNAM, develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signs sent by the pavement were attended to, it would not be necessary to repair about 200 thousand potholes each rainy season in the Metropolitan Zone of the Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of the UNAM, who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of an asphalt pavement is adequate, the potholes could be reduced in quantity or even eliminated completely.
In his lecture A technological opinion of potholes, given in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory in charge develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve their performance and, therefore, the formation of potholes.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of petroleum, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, some of high molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and others of low molecular weight, called maltenes, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of asphalt is that at high temperatures, near 180 degrees, it behaves as a liquid, at 120 degrees Celsius its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees Celsius it presents an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform, but is modified during the day according to environmental and temperature conditions, the chemical engineering specialist warned.
The CF researcher observed that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible pavement, which is composed of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Among the most superficial layers is the asphalt folder, formed by small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the pebbles that make up the folder, he said, is bathed in asphalt.
By transiting the vehicles and generating efforts, this allows the forces to spread very well on the pavement.
If they were modified asphalt, they would spread even better, the chemical engineer said.
On the asphalt folder, he added, a last layer called rolling folder is placed, which is made of a fine stone material, that is, a sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
As this is the layer that will be in contact with the tires of the vehicles, it should have more mechanical strength than the asphalt binder and provide friction on the road.
Being the part of the pavement that will receive and spread the efforts, the rolling folder also requires to have the appropriate thickness and must take care of the material from which it is made.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he said, because it greatly affects asphalt binder performance.
When the soil becomes wet, the water diffuses into the interior of the folder and is difficult to get out, this causes a softening of all the layers of the pavement and, therefore, the formation of potholes.
In the process of forming a pothole, he said, the first to wear is the rolling film and only afterwards the asphalt binder is affected, but the damage does not happen instantly, but it is a process that should be attended to at the first signs with adequate maintenance programs.
The also member of the National System of Researchers explained that the vehicular load is another important factor in the formation of potholes and, therefore, the thickness of each of the layers of the pavement must always go in relation to the vehicular load and ensure that it is met, to avoid that potholes are formed frequently.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already on the market and allow potholes to be repaired easily and without the need to use high temperatures.
What did the Valley candidate lack to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that influenced Melina Ramírez Serna not to reach the crown of Señorita Colombia.
The Valley receives its 14th princess title.
Again the Valle del Cauca is left with the desire of the crown of Señorita Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to settle for being on the podium of winners, wearing the silver crown and the band that credit her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantico won the crown and the scepter (2008), the department already adds 14 titles of Princess and Melina joined the legion of Vallecauccan women who have been close to the crown but who were proclaimed princesses among them Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Al Álvarez (1981), Roses (1983).
Today the big question that many ask themselves is what was missing?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite who in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain was elected Queen of the Police and Best Face Jolie of Vogue, titles that obtained queens like Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered key in the decision made by the jury to appoint her First Princess is that she did not convince with her answer to the question “What is that book that has marked you and why?” made by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Literary Carreta Leamos.
To the questioner the Vallecaucana replied:
“I read a lot, I believe a lot in literature, I think it’s a way of culturalizing, I definitely think that the book that marked me as a child is ‘The Little Prince’, it’s a pretty profound book.
I am currently reading Crime and Punishment, a book of universal literature that we must all read; and today I am reading Irene Nemirovski’s book, a Russian one, a very beautiful book called “The Burning of the Blood”.
An answer that did not like first for the term "culturalize" and second for not explaining in concrete way how each of the books he cited have marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe is wise no matter what has to happen.
And for all the people, please read a little bit, "The Little Prince" is a great book."
Among the hypotheses released is that Valle was burned by favoritism.
A journalist from Bogota suggested that being the favorite, the ovation and the candidate who took all the preliminary prizes (Oster gastronomy challenge, public vote for the best artisanal dress, and Reina Madre), "that aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and so did not shine on the stage."
And that was noted in his first swimsuit performance at the Hilton Beach and his two parades at the coronation evening.
Although in both it looked safe, it was noticed that it lacked the strength and impetus that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico did demonstrate.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist on the RCN Channel's "Como en casa" program, said that the fact that Melina was designated princess "proves that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the contest does not remain queen."
In addition, Valle showed himself to the latter very elusive with the press, and there he was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about his interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
For a reason, two days before the election the international jury Lucy Doughty said that they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of her country.
“Beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on their social sensitivity, that before entering the Contest they are already involved in projects,” she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned for her defects in the derriere and fibrosis that was noticed in her abdomen, but it is contradictory because precisely the jury chose her as the candidate 'natural beauty' with the healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
Queens coach Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better, "but her problem of fibrosis in the abdomen, that the truth for me was not very noticeable, lowered points on the last day."
Meanwhile the journalist Guido Hoyos, of the magazine Cromos considers that the error of the vallecaucana were the surgical interventions that were practiced.
“The surgeries are fine, but Valle didn’t know how to do them.
His body was never his forte and here he was charged.”
For this prize, which for the first time delivers the National Beauty Contest, after the parade in swimsuit came a cruel prediction that was fulfilled last night, because it was said that this was the contention that Raymundo granted to Melina to not give the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina from today begins a year of reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the possibility of representing Colombia in one of the international contests by designation of the National Competition itself.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who despite her overwhelming passage through Cartagena, was dodged the crown.
This was the work of the caleño who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano
A lophoscopist from Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4th, a lophoscopist from Cali’s CTI went down in history as the man who confirmed the identity of the FARC’s top leader: “Alfonso Cano,” through the collation of his fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists who work in the section of the CTI, that week it was the turn of “availability” to Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the area of judicial investigation for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in municipalities of Chocó, where he often had to go into the jungle for more than five days to reach the site where the bodies that had to be identified were.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of the Valley and, after taking the corresponding courses, specialized in lofoscopy, which is the study of friction skin, that is, the palms of the hands and feet.
The week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano Eliazar was warned to wear minimum clothing for three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he left for El Cauca by helicopter from Palmyra.
He knew that he had to identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected to be the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world, so they asked him to carry the decadactyl card of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigation team at the site where the body was, he did not recognize it because of its physical appearance, since it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He was beardless, dressed like a local farmer, without glasses and much thinner.
But the footprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a Galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a transplanter and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse to those of the card.
His eye did not fail him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was in charge of confirming to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was the head of the FARC.
In Search of the Footprint
For a dactiloscopista of the Sijin of Cali, the recognition made by President Juan Manuel Santos to Eliazar González, in the press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
A lot of people don’t know our job.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, with no margin for error, that can become key in solving crimes.
Apart from the identification of corpses, lophoscopists support investigations for crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of the people captured.
When caught, many criminals present fake IDs or do not have papers.
We take their fingerprints and look them up in the database.
The investigator said that, in a case of theft, he had to remove a piece of wall from a house, because in that place the thief had supported his hand to take out a safe full of jewelry and money.
“Walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to get a fingerprint, but in that case we were able to get the fingerprint of the whole hand and identify the offender, who had participated in different thefts,” he recalled.
Fingerprints can also rule out or reaffirm suspects in homicide cases.
They recently found a dead man, with bottles of liquor around him.
The investigation determined that a family member could be a suspect in the crime and, indeed, a print on the bottle matched.
Although this does not guarantee that he was the murderer, it does place him at the scene of the crime.
A CTI fingerprintist explained that in objects "the fingerprints are taken with chemical or physical reagents."
When they appear, a transplanter or tape is used to lift them.
After this, the impressions are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Registry.
“The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians,” said the CTI expert.
He clarified that not everything is as shown on the CSI TV show.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, not everything that is touched becomes an imprint.
However, if it can be used, if the respective matching is performed.
"Indignados" defy authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters gathered outside Zuccotti Square to camp.
A large part heeded the eviction order and moved to a nearby paruqe.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities on Tuesday by trying to re-enter, under a court order, the Manhattan square from where they were evicted at dawn and trying to occupy another park in the Big Apple.
Hundreds of protesters thronged Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access thanks to a court order allowing the “indignant” to return to camp in the place, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction by occupying a park further north of the city, where there have been new arrests.
“Our idea is that if the court doesn’t allow us to re-camp in the plaza, we’re going to settle somewhere else and continue the legal battle to get back to Zuccotti, as well as through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations,” said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray said the “indignant” response to the eviction from his camp personally dictated by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg reached the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced evacuation of the site and allowing protesters to stay camped.
In addition, the "outraged" proceeded to occupy a new park located at the confluence of downtown Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which links New York and New Jersey, and owned by the parish of Trinity Church.
For at least an hour they managed to occupy the place, but then the police came and proceeded to arrest some of the demonstrators, although Bray could not confirm the specific figure, while he assured Efe that he saw several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization says that several hundred people had settled in that point, where a delegation of religious leaders has already moved in support of the members of the movement and has tried to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square - which is a privately owned venue - remains closed pending the holding of a court hearing scheduled for this Tuesday in which the legality of this morning's evacuation must be analyzed.
Some of the displaced protesters carried and handed out copies of that court order at this time and even handed them over to the agents who guarded the square, which caused “some small clashes,” said Bray, who reported that some officers beat the protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from evicting Occupy Wall Street members or enforcing “laws that were issued after the occupation began or barring protesters from re-entering the park with shops or other properties they previously used.”
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that because of the court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and protesters, warning them, however, that local laws do not allow them to re-install with tents and sleeping bags.
The councilman personally defended the eviction carried out early in the morning of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which about 200 arrests were made and that was decided because the demonstrators were “violating the law.”
Bloomberg explained that he gave the order to evacuate the square because it was becoming “a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and, in some cases, to harm other people,” since “some businesses had received threats” and neighbors feared “for their quality of life.”
“This morning’s eviction was disgusting and shows that deep down Bloomberg is more interested in preserving the financial interests than those of American workers,” added the spokesman for the movement, who accused the mayor of “lack of respect for freedom of expression.”
Occupy Wall Street officials also said they plan to organize “big actions” by Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and labor unions to mark the two-month-long protests, which began Sept. 17.
Pamela Anderson will play the Virgin Mary in a Christmas TV special
Along with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, he will appear on the television show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1.
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen’s assistant on “Home Improvement,” lifeguard on “Baywatch,” Playboy’s bunny, the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Canadian TV Christmas special.
Private CTV announced today that Anderson, along with "crooner" Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the television show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 giving life to a very particular Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed footage of the TV show in which Anderson, also known for the wide distribution on the Internet of a pornographic home video in which she appears along with her then-husband, the drummer of "M ley Cr e", Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary holding in a manger a doll representing Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently acted as host in part of Charlie Sheen’s “My Violent Torpedo of Truth” tour, appears as Jose.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the CTV Christmas special features Canadian singer Bublé, who in late March married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, and who is no stranger to controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian a "slut" during one of her concerts in New York.
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of declines that began in March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still convalescing due to the devastating earthquake that became a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe that the Japanese country suffered since World War II.
Early estimates by the Tokyo government put the material losses at $300 billion, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, appears to have eased.
After three consecutive quarters of declines, the data of Gross Domestic Product between July and September served to turn the page, definitely: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% in annualized rate.
The second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year starts in March 2012 - is also the fastest pace of growth from January to March 2010.
The recovery is explained, in part, by the rebound in the purchase of machinery to restore the areas ravaged by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the 0.9% decrease in capital expenditures that was observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted increases.
However, the real upsurge of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Keynesian impulse to take advantage of crises to strengthen – or rebuild – infrastructures, using the gaps to grow from scratch.
Japan has awakened, above all, thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable rose by 1%, driven by increased spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The Yen Stigma
Tokyo has been entrusted to the internal market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "safe haven securities" chosen by investors fleeing the debt crisis in the euro zone and the murky forecasts of the US, a privilege that weighs like a slab in the accounts of export companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic waterline is determined by the health of large technology groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, attributed their weak results between July and September to the price of the yen.
As markets continue their siege of the EU’s peripheral countries, Yoshihiko Noda’s government does not let its guard down.
“We need to be aware of the risks that remain, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of Thailand’s floods and the rapid appreciation of the yen,” said Secretary of State for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa.
And indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said most member countries showed clearer signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates turning points in the world economy highlighted that the major powers are slowing down.
It dropped four tenths to 100.4 points, down from 100.8 in August.
The euro zone was even below the average, which is at level 100, when it precipitated eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens is once again fueling doubts.
Papadimos says adjustments will be approved, but conservatives won’t sign any written pledges
With peripheral risk premiums skyrocketing and uncertainty reinstalled on the parquets, Greece continues to tangle in the maze leading to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the “consensus” of the new Greek transitional government is more imposed by the demands of Brussels than by a genuine conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed with facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the period of one hundred days agreed in his appointment may be short to implement them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he will not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections by the scheduled date, February 19.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decisions of the summit of October 26," Papadi said, opening a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the new executive.
A package of 24 programmes to boost employment, reform of the disciplinary code for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras’ message does not clear the doubts about his position: “We have committed to helping the transitional government, but we have not committed to anything else.”
The conservative leader was a step further in his push to the EU and IMF, the bodies that must unlock the 8 billion that Athens urgently needs, and made clear that he will not give his go-ahead to any letter of commitment to comply with the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still haunted by the impact of the Papandreou referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unblock the aid if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible".
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said inspectors from the troika will return to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "what is needed to pay for the sixth tranche" of $8 billion, although there is no definitive date.
The Greek skein still has thread for a while.
Doña Sofía: "They are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights the "preponderant" place of Spain in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a preponderant place worldwide in the role of Microfinance".
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become in these last two decades the second donor of the plan in relation to this instrument of cooperation, whose "essence" said that it lies in being an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being."
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the V World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that these types of operations are "absolutely essential" to achieve the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations with a 2015 horizon, and, "most especially, in that whose goal is the reduction to half of the volume of people living with income less than one dollar a day, with which the "threshold of poverty" is set.
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Doña Sofía, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions that originate in the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
There are "many achievements" and "many challenges we face".
The Microcredit Summit is proposed not only as a forum for debate, but also as a platform from which to promote "two basic goals".
Thus, Her Majesty explained that it is hoped that by the end of 2015 there will be 175 million poor families who have accessed these financial services and that one hundred million of those households will leave the poverty line in which they are mired.
The impulse in the conception of microcredit in Spain and in the rest of the world "has followed the path begun years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, highlighted Doña Sofía as an "act of justice and due recognition".
He described the father of this tool as an “admirable idealist in the universal cause of fighting poverty,” whose work he has known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about its lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Ivory Coast in 1999, Canada 2006, and "in all I have been able to observe the continuous evolution", explained His Majesty, whose link with this project yesterday earned him the name of the "head of the family" gathered in Valladolid by the "baquero de los pobres".
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to advance in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Imperative"
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jimenez, warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for every democratic state.
In this regard, he said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic prosperity, since it is a “permanent obligation”.
Jiménez considered that microcredits represent “a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty”, and now “more than ever” the governments of developed countries must work under criteria of solidarity and not let it be a victim of cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
For her part, the Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded "the success" of giving "confidence" to people "excluded to whom everyone closes the doors"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present to a city that "opens its doors infected with the spirit of solidarity."
CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the congress of the Christian-Democratic Union (CDU), on Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, has passed without great difficulties for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian-Democratic party.
Initially the future of Europe had not been included on the agenda, but the issue was imposed in the autumn, in particular to satisfy the militants who consider that the policy of the Government is currently too lax with the Greeks and could be in the future with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine votes against and ten abstentions were recorded.
The standing ovation of several minutes that were won, with their interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Sch?uble, the Europhile Minister of Finance, clear any possible doubt.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and of the motion, is summed up in a slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because “nine million jobs depend directly on the euro”.
For the Chancellor, "the time has come to open the way in Europe".
This could be manifested in amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen the European Union’s control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, although it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to “give a face to Europe”.
In any case, that is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the Congress, a clear idea of Wolfgang Schaeuble.
It is doubtless unlikely that the 27 will quickly come to an agreement on this radical change: Britain is hostile to it and CDU leaders seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy is too.
But the ball is on the ground.
On the other hand, the delegates rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to weight the weight of each country of the European Central Bank directive according to the weight of each economy, which would obviously strengthen the weight of Germany.
Eager to calm tempers within her party, the Chancellor has increased references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But it is not that she has tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" European countries or countries in difficulty willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not lied to France.
Except in passing.
Remembering that, two centuries ago, there was a bloody battle in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for Napoleon’s army.
The incidence of fraud in sick leave
Following the subsidies, the UMP and the Government launched an offensive against sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15, to visit a box responsible for family subsidies and deliver a speech on the theme, already recurrent since 2007, of the fight against social fraud and assistantship.
In addition, to accompany such an offensive, part of the will to save rigorously, but still reminiscent of an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, most want to focus on sick leave.
First, to implement budget cuts: the government plans to impose a fourth day of lack on private sector workers before they can take the cut.
In short, unless there is a specific company agreement, a worker who falls ill would lose four days of salary, that is, a minimum of 15% of their monthly income.
This is a measure that could raise a wave of anger, but that would save 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
In addition, it would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: to impose on staff members a day of unpaid leave in case of leave from work (so far, they have no shortage, compared to the three days applied in the private sector).
While these issues are being debated, most are also bringing the issue of fraud back to the table, this time focusing on the abuses of work leave.
“The checks are going to be considerably increased and, in addition, if someone is discovered committing fraud, they will have to reimburse the amounts,” Xavier Bertrand warned speaking on RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in the other cases, the effects of the ad appear slightly disproportionate to the reality of work leave fraud.
In fact, since 2002 this issue has been constantly monitored and various political offensives have been launched, which have usually borne fruit.
The French don’t get any sicker than in the rest of Europe.
First of all, let us look at the national figures.
According to the French Social Security Institute (CNAM), more than 237 million euros were paid out in 2006 in leave benefits.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, subsidies for casualties accounted for 5% of health expenditure in 2008, amounting to 11.3 billion euros.
Of this sum, 46% corresponds to maternity leave and work-related accidents, while 54% is related to sick leave, a figure that amounts to 6.2 billion euros.
As a result, 2.5% of health spending.
In 2010, the French took an average of 14.5 days off work, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that undoubtedly hides deviations: another survey, published in 2007 by the Syrian professional management Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said that they had not taken a single day of sick leave.
Another study, in this case of Assurance maladie, indicates that in 2010 37% of sick leave lasted less than 8 days, 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% were longer.
Compared to our European neighbours, French workers are no more likely than in other areas to take sick leave.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers indicated that between 1994 and 2001, the overall rate of absence from work (both for health and other reasons) ranged from 10 to 11 per cent in France, compared to 20 to 28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom or 16 to 18 per cent in the Netherlands.
Fraud in sick leave is not particularly significant compared to undeclared work.
Fraud has a fairly limited scope.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has made checks on sick leave of more than 45 days systematic.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million inspections, the CNAM found, in 13% of the 285,000 carried out, that short-term casualties were “unjustified or too long”, that is, 37,050 cases.
In the case of casualties of more than 45 days, subject to systematic inspections, 11 per cent of the cases were considered to be “duely adapted or unjustified; a figure which, taking the total of 1.2 million as a starting point, amounts to 132,000.
Consequently, a total of 169,000 “unjustified” cases are reached among several million workers who took sick leave.
Undoubtedly, a negligible figure compared, for example, to the work in black.
According to the UMP deputy Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, such a practice would represent a loss of tax revenues of between 9 and 15 billion euros per year, that is, more than the total cost of subsidies for low and, undoubtedly, considerably more than fraud in the latter area.
Papademos: Greece must implement a new adjustment plan
Greece is going to need a new adjustment plan to straighten out its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos declared to Parliament on Monday, 14 November; he also added that the 100 days that have been granted to his government of union would not be enough to achieve such an objective.
"To make efforts that lead to the recovery of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new programme of budget adjustment," said the head of the government, who delivered his first public speech during the opening of the debate on the confidence vote to Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken during the euro zone summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new government, since "the permanence of the country in the euro area is at stake", he added.
Consequently, Papadémos has predicted that the country’s public deficit will be reduced “to about 9%” of GDP before the end of the year, after reaching 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The Right Rejects New Austerity Measures
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right-wing group, on Monday showed support for measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis, but has warned that his party will not commit to additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote in favor of new measures," he said during a meeting with deputies of his "New Democracy" party.
He said he agreed with the objectives of deficit and debt reduction, as well as the fight against waste, but against any policy that impedes economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the 8 billion euro loan needed without a written guarantee of the support of all parties to the planned measures, Antonio Samaras has replied that his word would be enough and that he would not sign anything because of external pressure.
A committee of experts says euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalized
Canadians living in denial of death, Royal Society of Canada report says
On palliative care, the committee calls for governments, healthcare institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not just in cases of cancer.
Canadian society denies death.
In fact, only 9% of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they wish to die and make arrangements to that effect.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which was attended by six experts from various fields, including ethical, legal and medical.
This committee recommends that the Government amend the Penal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when the patient considers such an option and has been deemed competent to make the decision.
To begin with, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada ranks tenth, the study notes that “medicalization of death in Canada has spawned a culture in which people are afraid to address the issue of death.”
With medication or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.
And, despite the fact that most Canadians want to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in hospital.
Collectively, the highest rate in this regard is recorded by Québec, where 86% of deaths occur in the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report reached conclusions that do not coincide with the position of the Federal Government, which has already stated that it does not wish to amend the Penal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offence has not led to an abuse of their application, i.e. the use of euthanasia or assisted suicide with non-competent or non-consenting persons.
Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, said yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, there were more excesses in those countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalized.
“In Canada, euthanasia is practiced, although it is clearly illegal.”
“Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal,” explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in favor of euthanasia
Eighty-five percent of Canadians have already spoken out in favor of euthanasia, saying it would allow people whose death is near to alleviate their suffering, according to a 2010 survey by Angus Reid.
In addition, 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not imply that the lives of elderly or disabled people have less value.
As for people who have practiced assisted suicide, 41% of respondents believe that a process against them should not be initiated.
With regard to maintaining or interrupting a patient’s care, the situation is not as clear, the report’s authors say.
In addition, its recommendations suggest that the Criminal Code indicate that withdrawal from health care, if legally rejected, is not a criminal offence.
The expert committee also calls for health professionals to be trained in the duty to respect the fact that a patient refuses end-of-life care without fear of facing a complaint.
On palliative care, the committee calls for governments, healthcare institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not just in cases of cancer.
Finally, in relation to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the committee requests that, unless it serves to reduce physical pain, it be considered as euthanasia and undergo the same procedures.
Other experts have reservations.
Other experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations about the findings of the Royal Society of Canada’s expert report.
Pierre Deschamps, specialist in health law, has described as "extreme" the position of the experts who sign the report, among other things because the practice of euthanasia is not limited to terminally ill patients.
“This leaves the door open to a situation where someone who is tired of living and is over the age of 18 can ask for help to commit suicide,” Deschamps said.
Mr Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to give priority to personal autonomy over any other value in society.
However, he adds that "in society, there are labels and limitations".
Health law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong opposition" to the report's findings, calling it a "pro-euthanasia manifesto."
Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Royal Society of Canada, especially calls into question the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
Jordan's King Urges President Assad to Quit Power
Damascus denounces a "plot"
Syria is becoming increasingly isolated.
The partisans of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday in front of the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure intensified on Bashar al-Assad’s Syria, which, with the support of Russia, resists and denounces that there is a “plot” against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union has tightened sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbors of Syria, have spoken out in favor of the abandonment of power by President Assad.
Jordan’s King Abdullah II was the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to “abandon power” in Syria, where more than 40 civilians and members of the regime’s forces have already died.
“If Bashar really cares about his country, he should step down, as well as create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life,” the king of neighboring Jordan told the BBC.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said Turkey’s mediation efforts since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have ended in failure.
“Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them, they will depart,” he said, referring to Syria, a neighboring country where Turkey is taking an increasingly tough stance.
For its part, following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union, the United States has welcomed the "strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime".
“The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries, such as Turkey, are taking an increasingly harsh tone” with regard to the repression in Syria, Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department, said.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of regime forces have already lost their lives in the Deraa region of southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) has announced.
Two other civilians have been killed “during bombings and shootings with heavy machine guns in Jobar” in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
During a press conference, the Syrian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Walid Al Mualem, considers that the country "is moving towards the end of the crisis."
In addition, he has reacted strongly to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from its functions, which in his opinion constitutes "a dangerous step".
Syria “will not falter,” he added, ensuring that “the plots plotted against Syria will fail.”
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a “civilian protection mechanism” and wants to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
The French Minister of Foreign Affairs, Alain Juppé, has also expressed his support for sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime that, in his opinion, is locked in "paranoia".
A further extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled to be held tomorrow in Rabat to finalize the implementation of the exit plan adopted on 2 November, which provides, in particular, for the withdrawal of the armed forces from the opposition-held cities and the release of the detained demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov yesterday judged the Arab League decision to be "incorrect", while China urged Syria to implement the exit plan, although it did not express support for the implementation of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti calls for time for markets and sacrifices for Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked for some time to the markets to form his team and launch a program that will include "sacrifices" aimed at recovering the credibility lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner discussed yesterday with political parties and today met with trade unions and employers.
It should form a relatively restricted cabinet, composed of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti has talked about a broad program with many sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups that participated in the meetings, after meeting with the President of the Council appointed.
For his part, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, has said that he hopes that Mario Monti will request before Friday a vote of confidence in Parliament to ensure that the new Government has enough support.
The consultations will end with the presentation, by Mr Monti, of a limited list, no doubt of a dozen Ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti has commented on the nervousness of stock markets and bondholders yesterday, asking them for time.
In "democracy, there are precise deadlines" for forming a government and preparing its program, he said, adding that he is "confident that the markets will have patience and understand it."
His appointment by the President initially won the approval of the markets, but then the unease was imposed, particularly after an unforeseen fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The appointed Prime Minister should create a team mainly made up of technocrats, even if he has stressed that he would like to include "politicians".
The new government will have to function until 2013, the date of the next legislative ones, he considers.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new Government will obtain the vote of confidence of the Parliament before Friday.
Monti has committed that, when he takes office, he will work taking into account the urgency and with the aim of Italy "regaining its prominence" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn said: “Even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not change.
The EU, convinced that Rome will not reach its goal of achieving a budget balance in 2013 despite austerity plans adopted over the past few months, has called for further stringent measures.
Italian chief Emma Marcegaglia, who will watch the match, also insisted on the need to boost the economy, "since a country that does not grow can not respect the requirements in terms of deficit."
Monti, famous for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), is a "period shift" for Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "teacher" symbolizes "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", according to the editorialists.
The big question will be the longevity of your team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid an early election, since Italy has to place some 200 billion euros in state obligations by April 2012.
A Russian scientist has collaborated with the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran on the development of a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, an American NGO specializing in atomic risk said on Monday.
For the identification of the researcher, the Institute of Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by that UN agency.
The IAEA last week expressed "grave concern" about a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to ISIS, drawing extensively on IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades, since the 1960s, at a Soviet military nuclear center in Tcheliabinsk (Oural) and would have been involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the center to form a company focused on the production of "nanodiamonds" in Kiev.
The economic problems of his company would have led him to contact, in 1995, the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine.
Later, he is believed to have cooperated with the Iranian program between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA mentions that there are “clear indications that Iran is developing” a nuclear detonation system “with the help of a foreign expert, who not only knew the technique well, but also, as a member state has reported to the Agency, worked for most of his career on such technology in the military nuclear program of his home country.”
Crimes against Muslims have increased by 50%
Crimes against Muslims have increased by about 50 percent between 2009 and 2010, while in the same period, the remaining types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased only slightly, according to statistics released by the FBI on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence committed against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, that is, it has increased by 49%, compared to a 13% increase in the case of acts of violence against Catholics, a 4% reduction in crimes against Jews and an overall increase of 14% in the number of anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of “hate crimes” has grown slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% is due to racial differences and 20% to religious differences, according to the FBI.
“After a decline in 2009, it is worrying that these types of crimes and crimes have increased again,” Human Rights First said in a statement, adding that “the increase in violence against Muslims is especially significant.”
“Human Rights First has long pointed out that violence against Muslims, as well as all types of hate crimes, should be considered a serious human rights violation,” said Paul Legendre, Amnesty International’s executive director.
“The U.S. government can and should strive to end such abuses,” he added, noting that such efforts could include improved police reporting of “hate crimes.”
The “hate crime” in U.S. federal law was inherited from the civil rights era.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence linked to race, skin color, religion, origin and, now, sexual orientation.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The microblogging site Twitter on Monday modified its platform’s presentation to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the people they follow, which causes its service to look a little more like Facebook’s.
A new tab "activity" and another called "name" allow you to follow more legibly and live the activity of other "Twittos", that is, those Internet users whose messages ("tweets") follow on the Internet or that follow you.
This lets you know if they follow up on messages, if they are subscribed to new accounts, if they rate a message as a favorite, etc.
Twitter's new formula was tested "with a small percentage of users in August" before being rolled out to the rest of the network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its uninstinctive operation, with slightly esoteric terms (RT for forwarding a message from someone else, followfriday pour recommender de suivre un other utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable to celui des Googleseaux public grand.
On the net, users have debated with different opinions "tweets" the interest of this innovation.
“It’s pointless, invasive, and looks too much like Facebook,” he writes.
“The Activity feature is going to help me better track some elements of my Twitter flow,” writes Dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introducing a budget “golden rule” in the Constitution
Austria’s ruling Social Democratic/Christian Democratic Grand Coalition government decided on Tuesday to include in the constitution a budget “golden rule” to reduce the government deficit and thus avoid a possible downgrade of Austria’s sovereign rating rating by credit rating agencies (triple A).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor, Werner Faymann, who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian public debt reaches 74.6%, a figure much higher than the maximum limit of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly lower than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s solvency were reduced by a single level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay 3 billion euros more in interest each year,” said Christian Democratic Deputy Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus responds to a request of the Brussels Summit to the member countries of the euro area on 26 October: in it, the Heads of State and Government called for the inclusion, before the end of 2012, of the reduction of the public deficit and the recovery of the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in a Law with equivalent value.
The device adopted by the Austrian government approximates the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
Before 2017, the structural public deficit should decrease each year by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and, as of 2017, the structural public deficit of the federal state should not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the regional states, as well as the communes, should present balanced budgets.
The objective is that, by 2020/2021, public debt will be reduced under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
A strong yen
Noda Threatens New Exchange Market Intervention
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authorities would intervene again to mark the change if the yen continued to rise.
"We will intervene, as we did last time, if we find that there is excessive volatility" in the yen exchange rate, Noda told the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose to near record highs that led to the intervention of Japanese authorities on Oct. 31.
That day, Tokyo sold massive yen-for-dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just hit a new record since 1945 compared to the U.S. currency.
But the yen has been steadily rising ever since, driven by purchases by investors who consider it a "safe haven value" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and Europe's debt crisis.
The dollar traded again on Tuesday at less than 77 yen and the euro has fallen below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, reaching levels close to those that provoked the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was trading at around 120 yen and the euro at over 160 yen.
This explosion of the Japanese currency harms the exports of the archipelago, since it makes Made in Japan products more expensive and reduces the value of the income obtained abroad by Japanese companies when they convert them to the national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild" after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, which devastated the Tohoku region, Noda said, fearing the yen's rising cost would cut off the weak recovery.
The third world economic power has regained growth in the third quarter (1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, thanks to an increase in exports and consumption of households affected by the catastrophe.
But the prime minister said the yen’s high level did not reflect Japan’s “economic foundations.”
Finance Minister Jun Azumi has asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, the institution’s deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BOJ had already taken “adequate measures,” implying that further monetary flexibility should not be expected on Wednesday.
During its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institute increased by five trillion yen (47 billion euros) its purchases of Treasury bills, bringing to 55 trillion yen (519 billion euros) the threshold of the funds it dedicates to the acquisition of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Euro area:
Guys grow up, bags falter
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis continues to hurt European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth figures in France and Germany, rates in the most weakened countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area’s stability, European shares plunge a little further into the negative zone on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, at 10 o’clock, the CAC 40 loses 1.4% and stands at 3,064 points.
The Dax lost 0.4% in Frankfurt and 0.1% in London.
“Given the new strains in relation to the loan yields of the worst-hit euro area states, stock markets around the world continue to yield some of their recent gains.”
“Investors, nervous, are perfectly aware of the risk of contagion,” Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, told Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed down 0.7 percent, renewing concerns from market participants about Europe’s ability to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has its sights set on Europe and exchanges will continue to take place within a narrow margin of variation, so investors will have no evidence that the situation has stabilized,” said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
Concerns about the future of the euro area are returning to grips with the single currency, which continues to fall on Tuesday.
The euro remains at its lowest level for a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1.3570, a drop of 0.4 percent.
According to the corridors, it has lost value after Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party, the CDU, which met on Monday in Congress, adopted a motion that foresees, in particular, the option of a country in difficulty leaving the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far exceed 6%
Credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the yield on Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, while Spanish 10-year bonds offered 6.2%.
These tensions in relation to the interest rates of the countries of the south, but also of France, continue to feed the fears of the auditors.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for time to improve the situation in Italy, which risks suffocating with the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, has stated that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October would be the "main job" of his Government.
Spain is in the crosshairs of the markets, while legislative elections will be held there on Sunday.
The spread between 10-year bonds in Germany and Spain has reached a new all-time high.
Looking forward to the euro area’s growth figures
From a statistical point of view, France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, that is, a more favourable figure than the 0.3% forecast, driven by domestic consumption.
The Insee, however, has revised down the figure for the second quarter, with a 0.1% reduction in gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
In addition, the fourth quarter is the one that really worries economists.
Germany, for its part, has recorded growth of 0.5% in the same period.
The first forecasts for the euro area as a whole are expected at 11 a.m., after the European Commission warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts are worth more than dogmas.
If there is one issue that cannot be dealt with considering short-term considerations or just thinking about emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and competitiveness of businesses.
It is fitting that an election meeting is the time to reflect on such issues and the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will be useful only if it considers the full economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, on rational data.
Now that we are 7 billion people on the planet, demographic evolution will mean the doubling of electricity demand before 2050, unless a huge part of the world’s population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, the growing scarcity of fossil resources will have to be alleviated to continue producing electricity continuously, without forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to fight climate change, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to give up nuclear energy.
This is not the case either in Belgium, which submits its own to the need to find a source capable of replacing it, or in Switzerland, which only aims to build state-of-the-art power plants.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to cite a few examples, are moving forward with determination with their projects.
The United States, on the other hand, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its park, resuming the construction of a power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, based on renewable energy, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality goes against such a discourse.
The choice of Berlin will mean an increase in the price of electricity, a greater dependence on energy due to the increased need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions from the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, the harmful effects will be noticed.
Consideration should be given to the case of Denmark.
European champion in the wind sector, from which it obtains 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to the intermittency of the wind; for this reason, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are, respectively, 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the constancy of our energy policy, our neighbors pay an electricity bill 40% higher than that of French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor of competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of industrial utility in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For that reason, any significant reduction in nuclear energy would mean a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would detract from the wonderful declarations about the reindustrialisation of our country and the defense of our purchasing power.
This is a price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay and, in fact, do not express opposition in principle to this type of energy, according to surveys.
Recall that the energy policy of our country has lost to build an industrial sector with 125,000 director jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Widely export-oriented, it encompasses a galaxy of SMEs specialized in international markets and that can create non-relocatable jobs.
Should France decide to abandon nuclear energy, it would mean the sacrifice of a large part of these SMEs and the loss of the 6 billion euros per year in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electrician would order an EPR designed to run for sixty years, when its manufacturer is scheduled to collapse?
To solve the nuclear energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no miraculous source of electricity production, just as there is no diabolical source.
Areva’s development of solutions with low CO2 emissions, nuclear and renewables, demonstrates the complementary nature of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have a Safety Authority that exercises strict and transparent control over both existing plants and the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, of renowned professionalism, are also obsessed with safety.
In half a century, the nuclear sector has suffered three major accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions; it had no consequences for people or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the accident was due to the design of the reactor and unforgivable human failures.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two natural disasters of unprecedented scope, which caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, just as it did from the previous two.
Thanks to this progress and to a cooperation between the safety authorities, French and German operators and manufacturers, the EPR presents a design capable of withstanding such phenomena.
While it is being studied by all the electric players who want to build a power plant, the interruption of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for the competitors of Areva and EDF, since it would leave them free to assume the leadership in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is indispensable and legitimate to look for the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotion, dogmas and partisan maneuvers dominate such an important debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration: a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy applied by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various points of view: the saturation of the police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of figures, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "human rights country" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has made headlines, with the Minister of the Interior (see Libération of 23 May) proclaiming in the past that France “needs no foreign talents, workers or waiters.”
However, it is rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
The point is that, on this issue, there is quite a consensus between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set the tone by stating in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country that has about two million immigrant workers", while on the left, the tone was set by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot take care of all the misery in the world" in 1990.
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005, both the left and the right shared the fear of the invasion of the national territory by a multitude of Polish plumbers.
On both sides, immigrants are seen as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity with which they act towards immigrants.
In his program, Francois Hollande merely includes banalities, indicating that co-development will solve the "problem of migration".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be electorally profitable, but economically it is very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent paper summarizing the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is broad consensus among scholars on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Limiting immigration weakens growth and hurts employment.
Fears about the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace domestic workers, particularly the low-skilled, by pushing for lower wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are more complementary than substitutes for domestic workers and exercise mainly professions in sectors with a lack of employment.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract domestic workers and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not meet the demand for staff.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country that lacks anaesthetists, the complementarity between nationals and immigrants causes the arrival of the latter to positively influence the wages and employment of nationals.
Taking this into account, Giovanni Peri calculated that a 1% increase in migration flows means a rise in long-term real wages of between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And, without taking into account the fact that the diversity that immigrants bring contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of naturalized American Nobel laureates and companies such as Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, contributing on average 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (income minus expenses) of 150,000 euros to public budgets on average over his or her lifetime.
At the beginning of his term, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go and look for the growth points he was missing "with his teeth".
Those teeth, which deterred immigrants, had exactly the reverse effect.
Europe invented democracy, it only needs to think about a European democracy
Democracy is a precious good, but it is also fragile.
The European continent should be able to remember this since, although it was invented in Athens more than two thousand years ago, throughout the 20th century it has suffered the tragedies of World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have believed that for democracy to triumph over its enemies, it would be enough to vote as directly as possible.
We know, from Napoleon the Little, that it was a matter of thought.
Universal suffrage, although it is a necessary condition for democracy, is not sufficient on its own and can even become an "instrument of oppression", as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, Lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we are experiencing in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
The palinody of the true-false Greek referendum had, in this respect, a double revealing effect: it showed the need for a powerful return of the political sphere, but also the worrying feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
We must reflect on this ambivalence in order to overcome it.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic battle have now shifted and that, in many cases, Republican soldiers are no longer advancing in a good way.
We will not win if we demand a succession of national referendums, organized according to needs and in a disorderly way.
A blank signature to the absolute European monarch or an empty stop to the nationalist hole: what options for the citizen!
No, we do not want to make blows, but a common exercise, in full right, quiet and continuous, of options and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we would not know where to finish the list), because there is only one crisis, the crisis of Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that bends to the orders of the markets and the rating agencies, that suffers from its impotence and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that suffers humiliation in the international sphere.
We care about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is all of Europe that slowly loses sovereignty and, with it, each of its nations.
The most urgent thing is that popular sovereignty regains the helm of the European project.
Because only together can Europeans reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from markets and prepare their futures through investment.
The exit from the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead us to disaster.
Having fought for a long time against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now calling for European economic governance.
So be it.
But to think of it without greater political and democratic integration, and without it being lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and would lead us to a new deadlock.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to “make” republicans.
An interest-driven revolution would not be enough.
This lesson still applies.
We must build a more economically integrated Europe.
It can only be achieved by building a more democratic Europe on a political level, a real European popular sovereignty.
To build Europe, let us make Europeans.
"Contactless" chip cards become widespread
The global chip card show kicks off Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an upbeat atmosphere.
In fact, 2011 should end with an 11% increase in global sales of cards with microprocessors (bank cards, phones with SIM cards, etc.), with a total of 6 billion units, according to calculations by the Eurosmart cabinet.
The most powerful segment is contactless technology, which allows you to pay for transportation in common or purchases simply by bringing the card to a reader.
460 million contactless chip cards will be sold worldwide this year, up 320 million from the previous year!
Its share is expected to increase further in 2012 (580 million units) and account for about 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which has long lagged behind the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the contactless payment sector.
Around 26 million Visa bank cards already have this feature, which is accepted in 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, its beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards are being used.
But large areas work for four.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCard Pass cards this year.
To get the upper gear, however, it is necessary for banks to make them available to their customers.
“There are two large French establishments that have committed to systematically distributing contactless bank cards to their customers in the future,” said Gérard Nébouy, Managing Director of Visa Europe France.
Banks test mobile phone payment
But it is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
At present, there are few devices equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, essential to carry out transactions.
"They're falling behind."
“But it should finally experience a real boom next year.”
“We expect between 80 million and 120 million units to be sold in 2012 worldwide,” said Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the lead.
The bank Crédit agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and next June in Caen.
The iPhones of around 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a case that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société générale has also said yesterday that it is preparing the marketing of an offer that allows its customers to pay without contact through their mobile.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is on the rise
Paris is concerned about links between al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Links between the long-suspected al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) terrorist group and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even claimed that Algiers already “has the certainty.”
“The way both organizations operate and the intelligence services’ reports show that they are cooperating,” he said, without elaborating.
Paris seems to come to a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have resumed the catwalks.
Kidnapped at a Niamey restaurant by people related to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were killed the next day along with several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators discovered several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The study of the calls made indicates to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers especially captured the interest of researchers: one leads to a Nigerian who stayed for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the birthplace of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is allegedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
“This is progress, but we should certainly wait for more formal evidence before discussing operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram.”
"But it's possible."
“We have known for years that the sect enjoys outside financial and intellectual support and is increasingly active,” said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, such "supports" had become increasingly evident in the evolution and discourses of Boko Haram or its operational modes, which now involve the use of increasingly complex kamikazes or explosive devices in the same style as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has been pressing Abuja ever since to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
Nigerian authorities, in fact, have long regarded the group as a community of enlightened people unworthy of interest.
A quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (meaning, in Hausa, “Western education is a sin”) incites the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing rapid success.
It is politicized and demands strict respect for Sharia law, while its militants throw themselves into the fight against the unholy central government.
The latter are primarily oriented to churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were particularly active and attacks on police stations multiplied.
Abuja’s reaction was, as usual, widespread.
The army attacked the city and 800 people were killed.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested in his lifetime, is killed in prison.
Since then, the sect becomes radicalized and abandons its northern fiefdoms.
Last Christmas, he claimed responsibility for an attack that killed 80 people in Jos and, later, another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram again attacked Abuja, in particular the protected police headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of its kind.
In August, the United Nations’ local headquarters becomes its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist hub in Africa, ranging from Mauritania to Somalia to Nigeria, is of concern to all security specialists.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and Al-Chebab Somalis operate in Kenya, Boko Haram emerges as a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned him against Boko Haram and said he was willing to “share all the information.”
The World According to Republican Presidential Candidates
In relation to China, Iran and aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
Can a crisis-weakened America manage a complex world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to Republican presidential candidates, voters might think so.
For the past few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates have increasingly made thunderous statements and shortcuts on foreign policy, traditionally a strong point for Republicans.
They spread slogans, often unfounded, about China, Iran, aid to Israel.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate in the race for the “Grand Old Party” nomination, has threatened to take the Chinese to the WTO and denounce them “for manipulation of their currency,” a key issue in an America exasperated by the migration of entire fragments of its sector to Asia.
It doesn’t matter if that means an explosion of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China and the only candidate with a sophisticated view of foreign policy, almost chokes on an attitude that “overwhelms” emotions.
He has called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama’s current position).
But Huntsman, stuck in the depths of the polls, remains inaudible.
In the style of Reagan
Romney has also promised military intervention in Iran if sanctions fail to disrupt his nuclear program.
“If I get elected, I will stop Iran,” he boasted.
"If Obama gets re-elected, they'll have the bomb."
He also pledged to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to meet his obligations to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second highest-ranked candidate, shows a shameful ignorance of such issues.
Recently, he urged countering the Chinese military threat because Beijing “attempts to develop nuclear capability,” apparently ignoring the fact that China already has the military atom since 1964.
Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says he is willing to deploy the U.S. military to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with 2008 Republican nominee John McCain, a foreign policy heavyweight.
Opponents of the current president counter that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They remember that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to loosen the piston in the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their naive dialogue with Iran, on the hasty departure of the “boys” from Iraq and on their misrepresentations in Libya, and label it weak.
But the attacks are not easy for them.
The population judges in a rather positive way the national security balance of Obama, which ended with Bin Laden.
From Iraq, he is wary of military interventions that lead to a sinking.
And, arguing that it takes rebuilding America economically to resurrect its leadership, Obama gives the impression of being fairer.
Nord Stream, the new gateway for Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream pipeline, which connects Western Europe directly to Russia via the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has already been put into service.
It must supply gas to meet the needs of thirty million homes.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with great pomp.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, participated on the Baltic coast, between the music of the orchestra and a delicate buffet, in the inauguration of the Nord Stream, the new pipeline that directly connects, under the sea, Russia with Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and their Netherlands counterpart Mark Rutte have together turned the steering wheel of the valve that controls the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
With this new pipeline, an additional 27.5 million cubic meters of Russian gas will reach Western Europe each year through a first 1,224 km pipeline connecting the St. Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second pipeline should be completed by the end of 2012, providing a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, enough to cover all French consumption.
In addition, there is already talk of the possibility of building a third tube along the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge work presents airs of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries had strongly opposed the project.
In fact, the Nord Stream will allow to supply gas directly to Germany, avoiding the terrestrial passage by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
All at once, these two countries lose some of their power: for them, it will be more difficult to influence Russia by threatening to close off its access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream as a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of the energy Europe, given that the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia has succeeded, in just five years, in its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, large gas consumers and with increasingly limited reserves.
“This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that unites us in an organic way,” Francois Fillon confirmed during the inauguration of the pipeline, demonstrating the extent to which large contracts in the gas sector are as political as they are economic.
All this explains the wide smiles on the faces of Gazprom executives, numerous in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The submarine tube is made of steel coated with cement to protect it against the anchors of ships.
It rests at the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 m.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to World War II.
“It was necessary to remove or destroy a hundred of them as a precaution,” said Jens Muller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to take extreme measures to protect fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake that weighs like 242 Eiffel towers and is not interrupted throughout its length: neither by valves, nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned in Swedish waters, but those responsible for the project gave it up, seeing that the Swedes were not very willing to allow a Russian state-owned company to permanently settle in the sea off its coast.
“In the event of a fault, we will interrupt the gas flow in less than a minute,” says Jens Muller.
In the event of a leak, the gas in the pipeline will therefore be released into the atmosphere.
But builders are unlikely to see a leak, as they have forecast leaks every 100,000 years.
Control of the condition of the pipeline is ensured by an underwater robot, dragged by a ship, which performs external inspections, as well as by a device that circulates inside the pipeline.
With the shape of a cigar, it is introduced into the interior of the tube, which has a diameter of one meter, and moves with the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three meters per second, it provides accurate data on possible deformations of the metal.
The pipeline has been designed to run for fifty years without any repair.
The circulation of the gas is guaranteed simply by the pressure.
At first it is 200 bars and, at the exit of 100 bars.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which owns 51% of the stakes.
It was joined by Germany’s E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Netherlands’ Gasunie and French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have set up a joint venture, called Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It is based in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased the entire gas transmission capacity to Gazprom for a renewable period of 25 years.
“Gazprom will be paid for the full capacity, regardless of the amount of gas that is actually transported,” says Jens Muller.
The financing of the construction of the pipeline has been carried out 30% with the contribution of shareholders and 70% through bank loans.
The total cost of the work should reach 7.4 billion euros for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment has reached 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure that they will not outstrip their investment, as Gazprom bears the expense risk on its own.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic at Lubmin, on a sandy coast planted with pine trees.
Valves, 4.5 meters high, form the exit door of the gas.
There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas on arrival, before it is transferred to German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At full capacity, it will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a branded notebook.
Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give people back their love of writing.
It has an air of adventure, from hours of writing to the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognized, with its black rectangular pastes, its rubber, its broken white leaves, as aged by time.
However, Moleskine notebooks with the current appearance were born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo, based in Milan, decided at that time to launch a notebook of design notes, but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, was in charge of launching the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an old production technique, the mole skin, which refers to a varnished cotton that was used, among other things, to cover the sidewalks.
This type of notebook was highly valued by writers and travelers.
“Moleskine has adapted to the current taste an old and forgotten object, an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century,” says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become responsible for the brand in Mode.
And he achieved success.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26%, reaching a volume of 12.7 million units sold.
Away is the confidential production of the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond the Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the profile of the buyer, since the notebook attracts both businessmen and students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open-spirited and cultured.
The small Italian company, which had twelve employees in its beginnings, now has about 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
He distributes his notebooks in bookstores, from the Fnac to small shops in the city center, and has managed to impose his identity.
“We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the rise of emails,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature goes hand in hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, he also launched a notebook with leopard covers, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has managed to diversify its products: bags, agendas, pens, computer cases ... The brand covers a wide range of supports.
A success that provokes envy: in the autumn of 2006, Mode was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, thus writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate for disabled workers still so high?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
The 15th Week for Employment of the Disabled begins today.
Despite a resolute public policy, implemented since 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people doubles the average rate: 19%, compared to 9% for the entire population.
Discouraging?
“No,” says Éric Blanchet, CEO of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.
“The progress made over the last 15 years is significant.
“Back then, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher than the average.
“However, there is still a lot to do.”
It is worth mentioning that disabled unemployed persons continue to face numerous obstacles to access to employment.
They tend to be older: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% have not finished high school and, of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread among them: 53% for the disabled, compared to 38% on average.
That is, there are numerous issues that make it especially difficult to return to the world of work and that “constitute the crux of the problem,” says Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Those are the objective obstacles.
In addition, there are those who are not mentioned; the mentality of the people advances, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the association IMS-Entreprendre for the Cité pointed out that the directors surveyed have “a low level of knowledge about disabilities”, with an “excessive representation of people in wheelchairs, physically or intellectually deficient”.
The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are far from the goal of hiring 6% of disabled workers, a goal that was set in a 1987 law.
According to the latest available figures, dating from 2008, they reach a ratio of 2.6%.
“We now reach around 3%,” says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the body in charge of collecting contributions from companies that do not respect this law.
The proof: the number of establishments "subject to this contribution", as well as the amounts disbursed, have decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
“The 2005 law, which increased contributions, has generated a lot of pressure for companies,” explains Pierre Blanc.
“But this improvement also reflects real awareness, particularly among large groups.”
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59 per cent of companies with between 20 and 49 employees have disabled employees, compared to 82 per cent of companies with between 100 and 199 employees.
Hazard: "A joy"
About to face the Bleus on Tuesday night (20:45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure generated by this friendly match.
We dare not say that there was connivance between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the Stade de France auditorium stand, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have really made peace.
Five months after his striker’s grudge against Turkey, the Belgian coach has nothing but praise for him.
"I was very happy for Eden, for his progress and for being Belgian."
"I want to move forward," the Lille forward responds.
As for the contrast between his presentations in his team and in the selection, "it is a set", it has been justified.
“In Lille, I’m all year, which doesn’t apply to Belgium.
"I have to stand up."
Called to play against Romania on Friday night, taking into account this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "glow up".
Not to mention "pleasure."
He has been cheering for the Bleus since he was seven years old, as well as during the winning campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been a fan,” he says.
This will certainly reinforce the "particular" character of the meeting.
Especially since he will face “Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami),” he recalls.
“We just faced each other recently.
"Playing against them is always a joy."
With simplicity, Leekens has made reference to "pride".
"Pride" for playing "a gala match".
"Pride" also for checking, as "neighbor", that France "returns to a team of very high level", about a year after the trauma of Knysna.
“Laurent Blanc has done a formidable job,” he said enthusiastically.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the coach would be delighted to be able to share a plane with the Bleus towards... Brazil, in 2014.
“Our little Belgians are growing up,” he said.
“We’re building something; the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.
"They'll be able to see him in the next matches." Including the match against France.
Portugal shows a lot of confidence
Paulo Bento's Portugal are facing with great optimism the return match against Bosnia (22h00), which will be held on Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the first leg, both teams lacked realism.
“When these 90 minutes pass, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country.”
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
There’s no doubt about it; Selecca, which he has been running since September 2010, is going to qualify for Euro 2012.
In fact, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there is a match to be played and a rival, Bosnia, to be defeated.
Considering the first leg (0-0), Friday in Zenica’s inferno, it seems clear that the matter is not decided.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, yes, but could not score the valuable goal that would have given him peace of mind.
“It’s a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven’t scored away from home.”
But at home, in Lisbon’s luminous Estadio de la Luz, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, before an audience that should be just as excited, even if it is evident that the match “is very even”, said an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We expect the match to be very even, but we are completely convinced that we can take the lead," the 42-year-old Portuguese coach said.
"We still have a 50% chance of participating in Euro 2012," said Carlos Queiroz's successor.
Friday’s draw in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
The Bosnians could get a draw, though they also need to score.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we have not scored away from home," regrets Bento.
"We're going to play against a team that has a great technical quality and that has players with a great individual quality," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of exerting, from the beginning, maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "leave them no time to think".
A good idea, as long as, this time, it's realistic.
