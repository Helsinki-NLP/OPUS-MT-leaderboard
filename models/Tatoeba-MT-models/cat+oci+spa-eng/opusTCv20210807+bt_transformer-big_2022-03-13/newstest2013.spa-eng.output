A Republican strategy to hinder Obama’s re-election
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight voter fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth and states that voter fraud is less prevalent in the United States than the number of people who die from lightning strikes.
In fact, Republican lawyers have found no more than 300 cases of voter fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: those new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In that sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Contrary to what happens in Canada, the American states are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.
And in the same vein, a majority of American governments enacted, starting in 2009, new laws that made the registration or voting process difficult.
This phenomenon has spread after the November 2010 elections, which saw the rise of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011 restricting the exercise of voting rights in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present an identity card with a photograph, in addition to a proof of American citizenship.
On the other hand, these laws reduce early voting periods, invalidate the right to register as a voter on the day of the ballot and withdraw the right to vote from citizens with criminal records.
Prior to the 2006 election, no American state required voters to present a photo ID.
The State of Indiana was the first to demand it.
The Supreme Court of the United States upheld the constitutionality of Indiana law in 2008.
As a result, the Republican authorities were quick to extend this practice to other states.
In recent years these authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID.
It is important to keep in mind that, contrary to what happens in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity document, such as the Social Security card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have a photo ID issued by a government agency in their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack such an identity document.
But, often, obtaining the required identity document costs more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
Twenty-five per cent of African Americans, 15 per cent of people earning less than $35,000 a year, 18 per cent of citizens over 65 and 20 per cent of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have a photo ID.
And there's more.
In many states, students, the voters who vote the most for Democratic candidates, cannot use their institution’s photo ID.
On the other hand, those same states authorize members of fishing or hunting clubs who usually vote for Republican parties to use the documents issued by those clubs.
Prior to 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to make such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Hispanic vote.
It appears that two out of three Hispanic voters support the Democratic Party.
On the other hand, Republican lawmakers supported in 2011 certain laws that abolished voter registration on the same day of the ballot in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to create a service to help voters who would like to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of about 10 million citizens.
Measures taken since 2009 brought the registration rate for new voters down in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers adopted laws in five other states that favored reducing the early voting period.
For example, in the 2008 Florida election, 33% of voters who voted ahead were African-American, while the latter accounted for no more than 13% of the state’s voters.
In the case of Hispanics, the same thing happened.
These represent only 11% of voters, which is equivalent to 24% of citizens who vote in advance.
However, whites, who make up 76% of the electorate, make up no more than 46% of citizens who vote in advance.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters have fervently opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
In this regard, Democratic governors have blocked several bills.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
It was possible, in part, to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states adopted the law requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted on, as it is clear that they are intended to influence the results of 2012 in key states.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Center shows that states that have adopted such laws account for 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty whether these electoral-system-scale legislative changes will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential election.
One thing is certain: those new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, the measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate Cancer Screening: Getting Tested or Not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes presents erroneous results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it is decided to carry out useless medical interventions.
It is more than enough reason to make men, already reticent, doubt whether or not screening should be done.
Take the test or not?
We asked two specialists for advice.
Studies in the United States found a high rate of contagion among sample groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and make strong recommendations.
For its part, the European study showed some difference in mortality between patients who had been screened and those who had not.
The study, with a follow-up at 12 years, also showed that there is between 30 and 40% chance of developing metastases if the detection test has not been performed.
I therefore recommend the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if your father has suffered prostate cancer.
African-American men have a higher risk index.
The key is to make a good decision once the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
It is truly necessary to make the patient understand the degree of risk of their cancer. They should be offered all possible options and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that do not threaten life in the long term, in which case they should opt for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated because the cancer is not aggressive or life-threatening.
Instead, we suggest active surveillance of the disease and, if it progresses, we offer treatment.
We are increasingly determining precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I recommend that you take the test anyway.
But it’s important to talk to your doctor to determine whether or not you should be tested.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, adopting healthy lifestyle habits is still the best way to reduce the risks of suffering from the disease.
We estimate that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
“If no one smoked, that rate would rise to at least 50 percent,” said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
Instead, we assess that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain totally unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the declining number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for other types of cancers.
It greatly harms people’s health.
"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," spokesman André Beaulieu said.
A hopeful fact: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is halved.
The weight
Fat and obesity also favor the onset of the disease, according to the SCC.
They increase the risks of breast, colon and rectal cancer, oesophagus, pancreas and uterus.
“Research shows that regular practice of physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer.”
The food
The body also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large amounts, they increase the risk of colorectal cancer.
Charcuterie products should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat for smoking, drying or salting can cause the formation of carcinogenic substances.
“They can damage the body’s cells and lead to the development of cancer,” they explain.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
However, at the moment his investigations are inconclusive.
According to the SCC, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While in one of them there was a decrease in the risks of prostate cancer, in another what was observed was, rather, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly determined.
On the other hand, M. Beaulieu insists on the importance of talking about each other’s concerns and family history with their doctor.
"Taking the screening test does not cause cancer."
The Higgs boson in detail
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson generated quite a stir last summer, and rightly so.
It is believed, in fact, that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
And what’s more, it’s about the particle whose existence the standard model predicted: our best or “least bad” explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has yet to be empirically observed.
But it’s not entirely clear to physicists that these are Higgs.
We know without a doubt that a new particle exists and that it closely resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, new data revealed this week at a major physics congress held in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, although more data is still missing to be completely sure.
Anyway, we assume that it is Higgs, since the chances of being wrong seem few. We will see what it is about.
There is, in this great world, a generalized and inescapable law which implies that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
There’s no way to break that rule and don’t try too hard, because you’ll end up hurting yourself.
Although the physics of particles is a very complex world, it has been shown that there is also a law of these characteristics: the Pauli exclusion principle, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state"; a "state" that consists, roughly, of some of its characteristics.
Physicists classify particles into two categories.
On the one hand we meet the good citizens called fermions, who obey wisely the principle of Pauli.
And then there are the bosons, a dirty bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means they can be found in the same place and at the same time.
According to Berkeley Laboratories’ The Particle Adventure website, which, by the way, is extraordinary, bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons, which we won’t talk about here, and the “force particles,” by which the great forces of nature propagate and with which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
These bosons, one might underline here, are not the exotic bugs we might believe.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson: the photon or the “light particle” that acts as a “messenger” of the electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disorders" the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; a bit like when we throw a stone into a pond.
In this "disorder" an electromagnetic wave (of light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.) is born, and this wave is nothing more than a photon; that is, one of the "force-bearing" bosons.
More stable field
The same thing happens with the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, that needs to be "disordered" for this boson to appear.
Now, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it you need to reach extremely high energies, a little like an icy pond in which only a thick rock could slide on the surface.
That’s why it takes a huge particle accelerator like CERN (the big hadron collider is a 27 km ring!) to reach such energy levels.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and mass.
In fact, not all particles or all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others don’t: a piece of paper, for example, will never by itself stick to a fridge door.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the rest (like the photon, by the way), do not.
Now, what “can” all these investigations bring?, asks Mrs. Plamondon.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows physicists to scrutinize the differences between MS observations and predictions.
For their part, many fervently desire that they meet, because the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" that covers certain holes of the model.
This, it must be said, still has enormous shortcomings, as it does not propose any explanation regarding gravity (ups!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter of the Universe (another ups!).
But we have not found such differences at CERN so far.
Implications
The repercussions of such investigations in our day to day are difficult to predict, but we do not think that we are wrong to say that it will not have any.
For you to see: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of lasers in laboratories did not suspect at all the revolution that their work would provoke.
They glimpsed scientific applications, but nothing more.
In fact, as the physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who produced the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962, already said, at first the laser was rather considered a "laboratory apparatus".
Imagine...
And in addition, applications can also come from all the instrumentation surrounding the research.
For example, Willard Boyle himself developed a light collector in 1969 in the course of his research into optics.
Although it was not at all his original intention, this sensor now serves as an "eye" for all digital devices in the world, which earned him the Nobel Prize in physics in 2009.
That does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC necessarily want to transform our lives, but that we never know...
Palliative care. The best way to die...
In its Dying in Dignity Commission, Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate should resume soon while a bill is being prepared.
Now, within that essential domain, there is still much to be done.
Le Devoir has tried to see him up close.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him a two-year respite.
“I had been given five years to live, but I’ve been like this for seven years,” he recounts, passing by, lying in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
“But it’s always a shock, we can’t be prepared for this,” he continues.
The disease has wreaked havoc on him: a huge weakness that prevents him from going to the bathroom alone and even eating on his own.
Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, he accepts resignedly to help him eat.
Brave, he even comes to smile, to talk to strangers who give him attention, bring him medicines and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
“My biggest wish is to be cured of diarrhea, it’s humiliating,” she confesses.
A few hours later, the team found a remedy for that evil.
“In the course of our lives we learn that a man pees standing up,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois center.
Going back to your childhood, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
“That depends on the person’s ability to accept that regression,” he says.
Because, in the opinion of most people who work in palliative care, great moments take place at the very heart of that regression.
All patients who enter Victor-Gadbois palliative care center have cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer offer “healing” care.
The 89-year-old Ms. A.’s greatest fear is to die “aware and drowned.”
But the disease has made him discover his children.
“I have good kids,” he adds.
“I don’t have any more desires left in this life,” she says, before agreeing to have a mask put on to help her breathe.
And he expects, in the coming days, a last visit from his son who lives in Italy.
With a group of volunteers, Victor-Gadbois offers body care and nutrition support.
They are palliative care when nothing else can be done.
To help make his death more comfortable.
In Quebec we have a palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It is very little, since we know that we will all end up dying one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at the center.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person is offered mouth rinses with brandy or Pepsi, depending on the demand.
Diabetics are no longer under control of their sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served a beer to Mr. X, who died over the course of the night.
This morning, his son finished the beer at the feet of the deceased.
“We help both patients and their loved ones,” says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
At the Victor-Gadbois Centre, the days pass without ever being the same.
Next to a 94-year-old man who savors his last family reunion in the courtyard, well placed between his pillows while everyone drinks to his health, a 36-year-old tragically dies, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two children, after having tried everything to survive.
"For the past six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by people under the age of 45 with cancer," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadboisarrivent center come from home and 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
Seventy-seven per cent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e., care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient reaches the terminal stage of life, whether at home, in the hospital or in a care facility.
And several agencies, such as the Victor-Gadbois center and the Grand Montréal home palliative care society, specialize almost exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this great relative lack of health care in Quebec that makes many doctors specialized in palliative care fear the adoption of a law that regulates euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by eminences of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec’s health system is not competent enough to ensure that anyone is entitled to quality palliative care before euthanasia is accepted.
"Recently," she says, "I've seen a patient spend 14 days in the ER in great pain without being able to relieve it.
I fear patients will want to die just because they don’t get the proper care.”
And at the same time, many oncologists persist with their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
Hélène Richard’s hopes of survival were already low when she left a grueling chemotherapy treatment.
“When I told my oncologist that I wanted to stop the treatment, she told me that she was very sorry that I wanted to stop fighting,” she says.
"However, she had told me there was nothing else to do!"
There is no almighty care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask to die thank their caregivers who have not taken care of them in their demands once their pain has been relieved thanks to a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful when it comes to pain management.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of home palliative care at Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors usually resort to palliative sedation, which serves to sleep the patient until the time of his death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can’t pretend we don’t understand that part of suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelieved disease is going to have the possibility of having that palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved all say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want euthanasia,” but “I want to be relieved.”
This report has been made possible thanks to a journalism grant from the health research institutes of Canada.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road network officials, BTP businessmen, political party fundraisers and Italian mafia specialists tell, day after day, what they know about a formidable “system”, of which the construction industry is part, officials, politicians, trade unionists and gangsters.
An "industry" that became too expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
“It’s funny how the system is pulverized once we’ve hunted down the big media,” said Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec lawmaker and former Montreal police chief.
He led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011, which was made possible by a thorough investigation into embezzlement linked to road contracts in Quebec, which the Liberal prime minister at the time, Jean Charest, had only consented to delay.
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between industry, clandestine party financing and corruption among officials.
“Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, only the transport ministry would have saved a billion dollars in contracts,” containing some of its instincts to keep a proportional share.
The Charbonneau Commission “has already brought down two mayors,” he adds, while hoping to be able to “demonstrate the stratagems behind the individuals.”
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, is also implemented with its team of government auditors, researchers and analysts.
This unit works in addition to the police of the "Marteau squad", which, since 2009, have caused the "sewer cartel" of Montreal to moderate when it comes to inflating contracts.
In recent weeks, the unit has proceeded to serially record allegations of fraud and corruption against municipal officials such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of an outlying city.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec’s third city.
Repeated bribes are suspected of being pocketed in exchange for public contracts.
Engineers from Montreal’s road network and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, have been indicted.
The latter has caused shock by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for three years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to a mafia-linked middleman who transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
M. Zambito distributed money right and left during the 2000s, awarding more than C$88,000 to provincial parties, especially the ruling liberals.
He also admitted to organizing an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal vice prime minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Cost inflation of sewer contracts
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, a former public works engineer, explained it perfectly before the commission: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and bribes from companies in the construction sector for a total of 736,000 dollars, all in exchange for sewer contracts whose costs inflated.
Other officials in the road network have admitted that they received money for inflating invoices between 30% and 40% in the form of false extras.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor’s party, Martin Dumont, accused M. Tremblay of deliberately turning a blind eye to a parallel budget and filled his coffers with dirty money.
In the wake of these revelations, M. Tremblay resigned in early November and led Montreal into a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal’s first elected politicians to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district, in the east of the island, she opposed since 2010 the sale of a municipal land acquired for 5 million dollars and resold for 1.6 million to developers in the midst of a real estate boom.
70% of election campaign money was dirty money
From the investigation that will finally be carried out, she assures that she pulls “a thread to be able to understand the operation of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and catch the culprits.”
He adds that the process is “painful, but positive.”
We are cleaning up the wounds but it would take a clean investigation unit in Montreal and being very vigilant so that dubious practices are not repeated.
How to do the cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, states that "the officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but is concerned above all about the role of the '"politicians elected to the contrivance".
Estimating at 70% the proportion of dirty money that went to the financing of electoral campaigns in Quebec, ironically: “I have been told that this is nothing more than a pale reflection of reality.”
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, but that will not change the donation, he said, "as long as election spending is not strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics."
He recommends a complete review of the system of granting public contracts and financing the parties: "we can not fall lower; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house with more solid foundations, with more controls and laws."
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, M. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in the mirror.
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season he has acquired a new entity with PSG.
How would you explain that advance?
It could be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have arrived.
I advance from day to day at his side.
The technical staff has also given me a lot.
And those elements push me every day to raise the level of my game.
In a game, that’s easier.
Everything is going very fast in football.
But I don't get hot.
From my beginnings at the INF Clairefontaine training centre to my time in Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced by leaps and bounds.
You will benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
This summer’s recruits are used to playing very high-level matches.
They know that every workout is crucial.
That makes a player like me eager to fight and give it their all.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my positioning.
It’s backed by deputies like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man the team needed?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, there is no one like him in League 1 and he is among the best European coaches.
He has great experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs.
He has worked with great players.
I think he will take other titles in Paris.
In January I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I had just come out of a series of injuries.
The confidence he has in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think about PSG in the first part of the season?
In League 1, Lyon has removed us from the position of leader.
But we're still in the ambush.
One of our biggest goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for the round of 16 in style.
What is the club’s aim in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say in front of many very good European teams.
To begin with, we want to finish the first of our league against Porto to be able to receive the round of 16.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
You already have the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and be there in the long run.
Today, that is not the case.
At the economic level, PSG is dedicated to its means to make that project come to fruition.
Not winning the cup in League 1, as in the last season, would it constitute a big failure?
Of course, it would be a big disappointment.
This year we will invest all our efforts in taking that title of champions.
Last season we didn’t go far.
In May we got a disappointment, since we had the optimal conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions...
But another team, Montpellier, had a much better season.
This year I think it will be good.
Even if big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux fight for the title, I think we have the weapons to take it with us.
Do you think the media expects more from PSG?
It is normal to expect a lot from us if we think about what has been invested in the players we have.
We have fully accepted it.
After we won 4-0 at home to Troyes, still finding things to reproach us with is a bit frustrating.
We wonder what else people expect.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to start a game project.
A team is built with time.
In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City who, after two seasons, has failed to qualify for the round of 16, and they have also invested a lot!
In view of the sums invested, we would imagine you with 15 points of advantage to the day.
That would be neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well the previous season, have been "boosted" by this new PSG.
That shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have ended up taking the trophy.
PSG seems totally dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s successes.
We better say we have a "Zlatandependency."
That means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and that he scores a lot of goals.
He has come to prove that he is the star of League 1.
And he has shown in every team he has gone through that he is a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
That pushes others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows us all to make progress.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with Team France?
It was a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this Eurocup.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating playing time.
I saw things there and came out reinforced.
Today I am able to play well in the national team.
That's what I've been waiting for since my baptism with the bleus.
We learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine, and that is why we have exemplary behavior today.
What is your view of the first month of Didier Deschamps at the head of the bleus?
He's getting results.
They are well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The coach is rigorous, close to the players and inspires to win.
As was the case with Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved his goal of qualifying for the European Championship.
I hope Didier Deschamps will take the national team to Brazil.
Did the draw (1-1) on 16 October in Spain serve to lay the foundations?
That game gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I had not experienced a similar game in my entire career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
The opposite of current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing burdens between the parties.
Moreover, as often happens in technologies, the political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a secure exchange protocol in the manner of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files from peer to peer.
Nearly 200,000 transactions have been recorded thanks to 15,000 computers on the network.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment.
Bitcoin’s price, having peaked at $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later, before hovering around $10 again today (quotes are listed on bitcoincharts.com).
It’s nothing impressive when compared to global changes in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in him in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
In it, bitcoin was described as “the most successful virtual currency,” “competing with the dollar or euro,” and “similar to conventional currencies.”
Bitcoin differs from other systems with types of virtual currencies such as “credits”, used to advance in a video game and that can be earned by playing or can be purchased (and even sometimes redeemed).
The social network Facebook also developed this type of system.
But in every exchange a central authority controls and deals with changes.
With bitcoin, all network nodes are both depositories of ledgers, verifiers, issuers of currency, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users is actually made between two e-mail addresses in the form of e-mail.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information linked to this transaction is electronically signed through a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that bitcoin changes are recorded in the public ledger, which is disseminated throughout the network.
The key milestone is to write that new transaction in that book.
This goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers and the winner, a kind of provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding that complementary line.
It is a phase of file cutting, that is, of transforming a large file into a shorter and more unique numerical footprint.
Computers "pick up" the new transaction and add a number before "slicing" the whole.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular footprint (plus zeros at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the good one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of sets of the other transactions; any modification would change the footprint.
If, to commit a fraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept one of the two transactions as valid; the other would be orphaned, since both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solves the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, that reward is divided into two regularly, with probability before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is thus limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to the hundred millionth, which leaves a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in each increase in computing power.
The life of the network already has its ups and downs.
Websites offering services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins on deposit have been stolen.
“The fault used does not affect the same protocol,” says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of money laundering thanks to this anonymous service.
But cash has the same defect.
Heavyweight actors like Wikipedia reject payments of this kind.
Others, like the Wordpress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the ledger and showed that about 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November the “giant sales” were launched.
“They changed $30,000,” rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogical book on this currency, believes a lot in the potential of this technology in addition to the transaction network.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which thus come out cheaper.
The bearer also manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to launch in stores, which do not have to install new terminals or software.
It’s enough for them to provide an address that a phone can “photograph and recognize,” says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement of reviewing hierarchical systems by more horizontal systems.
“It will take a while for Bitcoin to impose itself, but in 2013 there could be a change,” he predicts.
Moreover, in its report the ECB expects to reassess the various risks, now considered high, if this currency is successful.
We're out of Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans are due to leave by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for Afghans to choose their future, expecting nothing from us.
We have mainly punished the Afghan peasants, whom we have considered terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, plus the wounded and maimed.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former refugee chiefs in Pakistan, but often also peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in the times of the Soviets.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks or Tajiks join their causes.
Tolerated, sometimes even aided by local insurgents, they will no longer be when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the top of the almond-planted hills thanks to French credits, was done by order.
The convoys of trucks and tanks returned to Kabul without any attack, monitored by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban influx into Kabul from the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since its irresistible breakthrough between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country engulfed in fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
His takeover of the country had been perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghans have paid the price for the obscurantism of their campesinos overrun by the al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is no better today.
The old mujahideen, the current government and the current Taliban all share a desire to keep women in an inferior position.
The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, seizing government land to resell as land for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting on par with huge U.S. outsourcing contracts.
They are discredited; most of them have not fought.
People, as I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to take advantage of American generosity: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They have lived in the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated its advantages.
With around 65% of its population under 25, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, state schools are full of both girls and boys.
We will have to give work to those young people who will not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, is avid for mobile phones. Television and its Turkish folletins presenting a modern world have huge admirers all over the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who want to run the country be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already worried about reconstituting the provincial militias, which will flee from the central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization in the image of Western nations. However, the United States has wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with a strong presidential power, abolishing the position of prime minister that existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly on the occasion of elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country had depended on foreign aid since the 1950s and even earlier.
No industry has re-established its services, no reservoir has been fixed, and no major irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
Priority is left to private initiative.
In a country ruined after 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
Rumors spread that Afghanistan possessed immense mining wealth.
And that only heightened the feeling that Westerners were there to take them.
Without energy to extract iron ore or copper from the ground and without means of transport to export them through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost abandoned the Mes Aynak copper mines, letting international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) excavate the immense buddhic site and remain there as the province’s most important employers.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports depend heavily, will also need to re-establish normal relations.
French troops departed on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' schools, boys' schools, a French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural fields and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in order to try to "win hearts and spirits" and to carry out the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions coincide, a service of "civil and military actions" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), suppressed in 2012, brought and had brought through a small French NGO numerous works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain towns.
These jobs, greedy to obtain local labor, have been able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and increase of crop areas.
What will we leave as a reminder after two million euros of military spending?
A rather modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, very harsh in those valleys often located more than 2,000 meters high.
The Embassy received dozens of written demands with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in the province of Kapisa.
To free themselves from the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, something that the farmers have told me they want, it would be necessary to maintain a small civil aid, well controlled and that reaches them directly.
A Constitution with Forceps in Egypt
It's a new double or nothing from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever regarding the constitutional declaration, which provisionally grants it full powers, he decided to play the whole for the whole.
It caught everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when it announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had given two more months to the Assembly to finish its work.
And Egypt has been using a provisional text for almost two years, several times modified, which weakens institutional stability and leads to judicial imbroglios.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
To his opponents, the president perseveres in his “autocratic delirium” and continues to “betray his word” and “step on the right.”
Supporters say it is a move to end the institutional and political crisis faster and speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held in the next 15 days.
A very short span of time that forces the Brethren to give up their project of explaining the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way to recover popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversy wreaks havoc throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that Egyptians will vote in his favor, as he claimed in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Considering that this appeal has been voted on very quickly, it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: "either vote my text or I maintain full powers", powers that supposedly will come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in that strange environment that 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, Islamist in its great majority, voted on the text yesterday.
Most liberals did not attend the call.
In mid-November, a little before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they felt that they could not assert their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society followed suit.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 substitute members were added in a hurry yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
As might be expected, the articles voted on were unanimous.
Commentators are amused, on the other hand, by the fact that one of the few discrepancies of the day was expressed practically at the hour of prayer, so much so that several members of the committee came to think that the clock of the Constituent Assembly was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted on yesterday, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, the object of all eyes, remains finally identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, which stipulated that “the principles of Sharia constitute the principal source of law”.
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental claim, hoped that “principles” could be replaced by “rules,” which would have allowed for stricter enforcement.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a guarantee of their good will and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
Liberals call it hypocrisy and consider it nothing more than a publicity stunt.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer in particular to article 220, which confers on Al-Azhar University a consultative role, in particular for anyone who has to confirm its conformity with Sharia laws.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because “people called to speak out are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we glimpse the premises of a theocracy."
Liberals’ fears are further heightened by the fact that the university’s next chancellor would be considerably less moderate than the current one.
“For now, there is no concrete religious implication.
With this Constitution we are in the framework of civil status.
Most of the jurists who have worked on this text are not ulemas but university students, some of them trained in the French system,” explains Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity around Article 220, as the terms used mimic the religious vocabulary.
"We refer specifically to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question that could be asked in the future would be to what extent are the civil judges competent to pronounce themselves above all this.”
Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms that refer to the extended powers it confers on the president of the Republic.
The Muslim Brethren will claim that they are few compared to what they were during the previous regime.
Another point of contention: the powers conferred on the army.
According to the desire of the military, the revision of the defense budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defense council.
Nor will prosecutions of civilians in military courts be prohibited, as human rights associations called for.
They also expressed their concerns about the text, which they consider to be liberticidal.
The crime of blasphemy continues and henceforth insults are prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially that of the press.
Moreover, no article emphasizes the protection of women, says Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive thing has been the prohibition of torture under article 36.
The word did not appear in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president was due to go on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this noon.
Supporters of the head of state demonstrated on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for the holy land, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the majesty of biblical truths with modern comfort and pristine nature.
“AIF” identified the five most important reasons why Israel should be visited.
Reverence in the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enters this "baptismal font" will receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of Jesus’ miracles: the conversion of water into wine at the wedding, walking on the waters, the appeasement of the storm and the crowded nets.
In this same place, Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
But the greatest number of holy places is found in Jerusalem.
Believers travel here the Via Crucis or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin "Via Dolorosa").
It begins at Antony’s Fortress, the Praetorium, where the trial took place, and continues through the streets of the Old City, going to the Holy Sepulchre on Golgotha Mount, the site of the crucifixion, to the Anointing Stone, and to the burial place of Jesus.
In this same place is also the symbolic Christian navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built on the spot where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
Jerusalem is also home to the most sacred site for Jews, the Western Wall, the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
As is tradition, people of different religions leave notes here with their wishes, which will then come true.
Take a vertical trip
The ruins of the Masada Fortress were what remained of a secret shelter against enemies, which Herod the Great had built in 25 BC for his family.
They are located on mountain cliffs at a height of 450 m above sea level.
And get there by your own means, only those who are dedicated to climbing can.
Others can reach this historic summit on the funicular.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous ski resort Hermon, where in the winter months there is a large influx of tourists.
Bus services are offered from the foot of the hill.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, on top of the mountain supposedly inhabited pagan gods.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
In a single trip you will not be able to visit them all.
But it is worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
It preserves the ancient Dead Sea Scrolls or Qumran Scrolls, discovered in the caves of the Judean desert, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological pieces.
It is worth visiting the Museum of Art in Tel Aviv.
In his exhibition of paintings he has canvases by Impressionists and Expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the Al Basha museum-bathroom, which are some rooms of ancient Turkish baths with model figures of visitors and bathers of that time.
In Caesarea it is worth stopping by the exclusive private Ralli museum, where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin and Dalí.
There are no tour guides or souvenir shops there.
Admission is free, and donations are categorically not accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section is the Children’s Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars are shining.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they lost their lives ring out.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health
The three main tourist areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that in the Red Sea they bathe even in the winter months, since the temperature of the water does not fall below 21 degrees and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there they bathe throughout the year.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is located at the lowest point on the planet: at 417 m below sea level.
The blue waters there are a brine that easily hold even those who do not know how to swim.
The surrounding landscapes are truly beautiful.
People come here to pass courses of treatment with salt water, brine and healing muds and to fortify their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to put their broken nerves in order.
Touching the Mysteries of Antiquity
They are preserved in the old part of Tel Aviv, the citadel of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
It passed through the famous sea route linking Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this same place, he led a long and happy life.
Tourists love to stroll through the narrow streets bearing the names of the Zodiac signs.
They say that if you touch the walls on the street of your "same" symbol, fortune will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa you can find newlywed couples who come from all over Israel, and even from other countries to get photographed.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can walk through the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the principal city of Judea and the residence of Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists remember
If you travel to Israel, don’t worry if your English leaves much to be desired: in this country around 30% of the population speaks Russian.
The money for this trip is not recommended to take it in euros, but in dollars, which can easily be changed to shekels (currently 1-3$,8 shekels).
Urban transport is mainly made up of buses, but in Jerusalem there is fast tram and in Haifa is the only metro line in the country, which consists of six stations and connects the Lower City with the Upper City.
Actually, it's from an underground funicular.
Traveling on any type of public transport costs 6 shekels and for this price you can travel by transferring for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturdays.
From Friday night to Saturday sunset, markets and shops close and public transport disrupts their work.
But on Sunday morning a new work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes in which milk and meat are combined.
There is a wide selection of dishes based on beef and lamb, soups and desserts prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a variety of sauces, phalafel, which are balls of ground chickpea, fruits and vegetables.
Street dogs are not seen on the streets of Israeli cities.
Instead, there are many well-fed cats that “walk as they please” in imposing ways.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
Snorers love crowded places and don’t reject treats.
Renting a car, depending on the brand, will cost $37 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) a day.
In addition to insurance, it comes out for $15 a day.
And the rent of a bicycle will go for 15 shekels a day.
Museum tickets cost an average of 30 shekels.
Israel in figures
In 2012 more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of those who came to tour the country and rest were citizens of the US, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, a number that exceeds by 51% the same rate of 2010, before the cancellation of the visa regime on February 9, 2011.
'The Great and Powerful' Will Take You to Moscow: Immigrants Save for Language
While deputies and human rights defenders discuss the consequences of the law on compulsory examination, scammers who trade with “false” certificates have already appeared in the country.
Every year, 13 million migrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
They are mostly citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to help their families who have stayed home.
Since December 1, a law comes into force, according to which each immigrant worker must take an exam to check his knowledge of the Russian language.
For now, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service delivery sector, community service institutions, domestic services and retail trade.
However, over time, as promised in the Federal Immigration Service, the exams will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will not be enough to take the language exam, but also the one of Russian history and the one of fundamentals of the legislation.
Knowledge of the language must be confirmed even to receive and renew the work permit.
Exceptions are citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
Persons who succeeded in obtaining their education certificates and diplomas prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 shall not be subject to this law.
Utility, fatality and defense of rights
The network of examination centres will operate under the auspices of the Pushkin Russian Language Institute, Peoples’ Friendship University, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to take part in the tests in all cities, now more than 160 such centers are open in Russia.
The initiative on the introduction of the examination was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and by the Federal Immigration Service.
But rights advocates, long before the law went into effect, often managed to ask this question to the press: And what will this actually bring?
What changes will the obligatory knowledge of the language bring, both for Russians and for immigrants themselves?
First, respond the representatives of the Immigration Service, this will reduce the number of people suffering "labour slavery".
Many people today talk about defending the rights of labor immigrants, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Russian Federal Immigration Service in Tajikistan.
The defense of your rights must begin before your departure.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problem of immigrant workers in 90% of cases.
The problems are faced by immigrants without profession, education, those who do not know the language or pass medical control.
Without understanding the language, Sebelev says, the future immigrant will be doomed to find unscrupulous people who, under the pretext of helping, put a “paid trip” into a creepy, narrow covacha, where he and dozens of others like him are consumed for months without food or documents, working 12 to 14 hours a day.
We received countless complaints from our immigrants.
“In their homeland they promise them one thing, but when they arrive they are cheated, they are deprived of their passports, they are not paid the promised salaries,” confirms the Head of the Labour Immigration Directorate of the Tajikistan Immigration Service, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't be mad, bossy!
However, in the meantime many citizens of Central Asian republics who wish to work in Russia recognize that they not only do not know the language of the country they intend to go to, but also write in their own language with difficulty.
Of course, this is not so much their fault but their own misfortune: there are few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks who can afford to receive normal primary education.
This is because their families even have nothing to feed the children, not to mention dressing them, shoeing them and buying them what they need for school.
When they reach adolescence, these guys venture to work at the first opportunity.
It is difficult, if you do not know the language, to recognize them.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
However, when it comes to language law, rights advocates make an important point.
The exams will be conducted only for those immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be no examination and, consequently, no official work.
Meanwhile, most immigrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or forbidden passage to strangers"
Many visitors claim that receiving official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause is bureaucratic obstacles and the difficulties of the language itself.
In addition, legalization costs money: from twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a false inscription can be made quickly and for only fifteen hundred rubles.
The employees of the Russian police know that we usually carry false documents, we are not registered and extortion cases appear.
"They ask us for a hundred or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea," Tajik citizen Umed Hushkadamov told reporters.
"Come on, don't be stingy, buy a painting"
On the first day of the entry into force of the language law, it became clear that not only immigrant registration documents may be false.
Several “false” certificates of knowledge of the language have already been seized by officials of the Federal Immigration Service.
The forged documents had been printed on standard color printers.
Of course, they came into the hands of the new owners not as a gift: each immigrant, wanting to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official examination procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system against corruption so that “diplomas” cannot be bought, government officials and rights advocates converge.
So far, the authorities can promise immigrant workers that they would not have been able to successfully pass the exam the first time more time to study the basic course of the language.
In addition, immigrants who do not speak Russian will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against the illegal arms trade
The percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is quite low
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law more rigidly in relation to owners of weapons for civilian use.
This is the government’s reaction to the recent incidents: Squeezing shots during wedding celebrations in which fortunately there were no victims, and the massacre initiated by Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinogradov, in which Squeezing seven people lost their lives.
Police want to ban the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for obtaining a gun license from 18 to 21.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma committee on security and anti-corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that reforms in the law on gun possession will be taken to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying the “heavy-handed policy”.
An open letter has appeared on the Internet, the authors of which, representatives of various social organizations of shooters, demand that such measures of "nonsense rigidity" be abandoned.
The percentage of vandalism involving registered weapons is minimal, Russian criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lésnikov told the BBC news service.
According to statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, during six months of 2012 142 crimes were committed with the use of firearms registered in internal organs, compared to the total of 1168 crimes registered for this same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that stricter legislation in the civil weapons sector will not be an inconvenience for the offender to target the black market.
Now, according to his words, in Moscow you can find any weapon at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior states that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The black market for weapons is supplied through various channels.
The main channels are years, says retired colonel Victor Baranets, who for ten years worked in the Ministry of Education and the High Staff.
Screenshot of website accepting gun orders
The first, "army or military vestige", that is, the weapons that were stolen during military actions in the Caucasus.
“The weapons were stolen by the Russian officers and by the Caucasians themselves,” Baranets says.
The next type of "black gun" is stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that this includes weapons stolen from police warehouses and those stolen directly by law enforcement officials.
Illegal weapons go on sale from military arsenals.
In many military arsenals there were often explosions.
“There are proven accounts that some fires were deliberately set to cover the fault,” says one former soldier.
According to Baranets, gun manufacturers also do their bit.
“Now private arms factories have proliferated that are not competitive in the international market and distribute weapons under rope to the black market, including Moscow’s,” he says.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
A lot of guns and machine guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
“There they have their own production, sometimes artisanal, and a mafia has been formed that has organized the flow of weapons,” explains the ex-military.
Where do the guns come from?
Experts have calculated the approximate share of each of these sources of illegal arms supply to the black market.
A report on this topic was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Governance Planning.
The specialists analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminological bibliography and publicly accessible data from portals whose theme revolves around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to investigators, come from the armed forces and security forces.
Half of the black market weapons have arrived there “because of officials whose work is weapons-related,” the report said.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places where there is armed conflict, 14% of the cases are stolen during the production of weapons and 5% correspond to “illegal archaeology”.
The clerk of one of the gun shops, who asked that his last name not be mentioned, says that the guns found by illegal diggers have not been bought by anyone for a long time because they are too old.
More often, he says, suppliers head to military warehouses when they need a departure.
Through some ensign, the supplier buys a unit, for example a TT pistol.
They remove it from the log and run it over the fence.
"This one takes the gun to the city and sells it for 900 euros per unit with two chargers," he says.
“But, of course, the police are aware of all the issues, so periodically, when the crime discovery plan has to be complied with, they make test purchases from illegal gun dealers,” the clerk adds.
"Like in a luxury boutique"
The seller and the buyer usually meet through acquaintances.
"I visited websites and blogs until a guy proposed that I go to the platform "Begovaya", where I would be a man who would take me to a "little squire" where we could negotiate.
Of the price of the gun, I found out only there.”
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
"To get a gun I need a friend who has contacts," the store clerk says. "I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him very much."
There are vendors in the markets, but there, too, you have to get, let’s say, “from Mr. Ivanovih, who asked me to tell him that his daughter’s tooth had fallen out.”
I can even get a pair of steel mittens through a trusted person.
He also supplies them only to me because he knows that I will not betray him.
Newbies look for weapons in different ways.
Former military officer Viktor Baranets was put to the test in the role of a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was preparing to publish an article on this subject.
The patterns, in his words, have not changed.
He was given a photo album where there was "nothing at all".
“I felt like I was in a luxury boutique,” the soldier recalls.
To the buyer, in Baranets’ words, they do not offer a cat for a hare: everything there is can be tried.
I, as a potential customer, not only buy; we go with the seller to the forest, where we put a target.
“They give me a chance to shoot and when I make sure the gun fires well, we start negotiating,” he said.
Sofa shop
Web search engines lead to "Vkontakte" sites and groups, where you are offered to buy weapons "for different purposes".
No documents or personal meetings are required for this.
“It is enough to have a certain amount of money,” they write in the title of the advertisement “Buy a gun or a machine gun.”
There users place their orders and ask questions.
Do they sell to minors?
"Without permission, of course," asks the user "Ivan" ( preserved spelling).
"I buy pistol TT. Moscow", laconically asks your question "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and captures in two hands those who wish to buy firearms.
And people go, like hungry fish to bait, and then, to extract coal in Siberia
military and ex-military commentator Viktor Baranets
I have heard of these systems: usually, the website is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People make the orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an ATM.
“In response, they send him a photo and instructions so he knows where the gun is hidden,” said Dmitry Kislov, press secretary for the Right to Arms NGO.
Viktor Baranets claims that if you place an order online, you run out of a gun and are thrown in jail.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and captures in two hands those who wish to buy firearms.
“And people go, like hungry fish to bait, and then, to extract coal in Siberia,” he says.
Makarov for $100
When buying illegal firearms, experts say, you can spend anywhere from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the NGO "The Right to Arms", a Makarov pistol can be purchased for $100-300.
It will have to wait a month and a half.
It is sent from the military warehouses by the mid-ranking chiefs.
According to official ministry statistics, compared to the period January-October 2011, the total number of these crimes in Russia decreased by 7%, constituting 22,900, and the number of identified cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
Employees of fast food restaurants and supermarkets in the U.S. go on strike
Up to a quarter of U.S. teens find their first jobs as cashiers at McDonald’s
In recent days, a wave of protests has been launched in the United States against the low wages paid in Walmart supermarkets and restaurants of popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
For now, no one dares to say whether or not this wave will reach nine points, or if it is destined to lose strength and calm down in its early stages.
The protest actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to raising the modest wages earned by Walmart workers and those in the fast food system, the goal of the protest organizers is to create labor unions in these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy has hardly been occupied by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The actions began last week, after Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday". That day, in the United States was beginning the orgy of rebates that captured millions of inhabitants, and that was sometimes accompanied by clashes.
On that day, some workers at the Walmart corporation, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, walked off their jobs and formed protest pickets alongside unions and left-wing activists in the corporation’s stores, whose products target people of modest and moderate income.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in their stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than those in larger supermarkets.
That’s why many low-paid Walmart workers shop only on the job.
The availability and assortment of products have made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to two critics, Walmart can afford to sell products at very low prices, in part because it pays its workers little.
The latter also complain of poor working conditions, such as a lack of forklifts or hand-held scanners.
That "Black Friday" rally participants demanded higher wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation went from $30 to $100 a month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who gets $9.5 an hour, this expense is excessive, they said.
Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley argue that if Walmart raises the median wage to $12 an hour, it will cost the corporation $3.2 trillion.
This is about 1.1% more than you spend on wages now.
If Walmart puts the wage increase on the shoulders of consumers, every visit to the store will be only 46 cents more expensive.
In a year they will spend the ridiculous amount of $12.39 more than they spend now.
Supporters of Walmart are pleased that the protest took place in only nine states and caused no loss to the corporation.
“Black Friday” lasted in their stores from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the next day and, during that time, Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, its cash registers made nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
The company’s representative, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview with the left-wing Huffington Post website that “fewer than five” Walmart employees left their jobs and that the protest had been nothing more than “another PR stunt” organized by the workers’ union.
"Free box!"
Protests continued this week in New York, in which the targets were not precisely the Walmart department stores (which in this progressive city do not appreciate them, and for that reason for now there are none), but the "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says it sells billions of portions, and then they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council Member
Currently, according to federal and New York law, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are increasing it over time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers receive in New York $8.90 per hour.
No one earns less than them in this city.
How is it possible to survive in New York with that money, for me it is something incomprehensible.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of American teens walked past McDonald’s and worked there, behind counters, part-time after school, though they still lived with their parents.
Few saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for long.
Now, I constantly stumble into some interviews with McDonald’s workers who complain that they have to live off this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a forum of the Wall Street Journal there is a comment whose author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald’s on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast-food cooks be paid at least $15 an hour, or double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that in the fast food sector workers unions be created.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from impeding this right and punishing union movement activists with trickery and firing.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes their lives easier.
But, for objective reasons, it is easy for unions to embrace the fast food sector.
One of the main ones is excessive staff turnover.
Discordant
Noisy protests took place that same day in other cheap Manhattan restaurants.
The culmination of the action took place midway through the rally at McDonald’s near Times Square, which involved several local Democratic politicians, particularly City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said, “McDonald’s says it’s selling billions of portions, and then it doesn’t even give you a hospital or pay you for your honest work.”
The demonstrators were supported by other prominent New York Democrats, including City mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio, who said "we must support fast-food workers to get fair wages and the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves."
As the New York Times described it, this has been the largest demonstration of its kind in the American history of fast food.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, even not all of them were employees of the fast food service, in which tens of thousands of people from New York work.
It is not yet clear whether this will serve as a spark for mass movement.
"For now, tricking the brain isn't that easy"
The theme of augmented reality, so popular among fans of modern technologies, lately is perceived normally mainly through the prism of special glasses.
Earlier this summer, at its annual Google conference, Google demonstrated a model in motion and later, in November, it was learned that Microsoft had also filed an application to claim the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the interactive 3D technology group in the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Izadi Sharamom, it was elucidated that for the scientists of that company, the glasses already belonged to a past stage.
They are drawn to the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands and creating open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the object of study of your research group?
- We are dedicated to human-computer interaction, but we also try to expand the limits of this interaction.
For now humanity in its great mass has been trapped in the stage of working with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes touching it with the finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, since everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else does the future hold?
Even though Kinect has taken the interaction to the physical level, much of it still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is still not very good.
We’re trying to change this, working on truly three-dimensional visualization systems, based on different technologies, including design ones.
The world of computing must be liberated to ours, to the physicist, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space that surrounds him.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, to hell with those silly virtual reality headsets!
What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don’t you think they overestimate it?
Of course, it can not be considered a panacea, it remains pending to resolve the issue of privacy, since you do not always want others to know about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but each in its own field.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not in loose movements, but shorter.
In addition, the gestures were captured not by the device’s camera, but by a wristband that recorded the movement of bones and muscles.
For now it is very large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass you this can of soda?
You will talk and show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, that's going to be very hard to recognize.
- I mean, do you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or cannot do right now?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I think that in the near future we will have to work mainly on the design of new types of sensors that can accurately determine the reactions of the person.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, as they provide good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints do you have about modern cameras?
Are they lacking resolution, depth, or something else?
In principle, the current generation is what may be the beginning of our work with three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be nice to get 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000fps.
But the question is not in the megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and in the depth.
From this last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives more work to algorithm designers.
That is, we have to remember not only the resolution in the X and Y axes, but also in Z.
Also important is the speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30 fps are truly scarce, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our laboratory in Redmond, made a contact sensor with adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms and it is worth mentioning that the modern sensors produced in series are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands to what extent this affects human-machine interaction.
It would be very useful to me for my work an equivalent of such a device, but that does not require contact so that the frames per second are more.
- And there's no need to increase the number of cameras?
The Kinect now has three “cameras,” one of which is in fact the infrared emitter and the second the receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is actually a simple visible fingerboard sensor.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
Or on the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible Kinect analog, play with the camera’s location curvature, and see how this would help determine the three-dimensional position.
As far as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented its glasses to the public.
Don’t you think that, from the point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spending all the time holding up a smartphone in your hands, is not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be a "transmutable" augmented reality when, based on a cloud platform, you could go from the glasses to the smartphone,
Glasses are very personal devices, that’s their strength (private things only you can see them), but also their weakness: an augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark from the film "Iron Man", but also to any mere mortal.
There’s a problem with this idea that critics often point out: there’s no tactile response!
The hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh irruption in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could well be the addition of tactile sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand in image support quality.
Record the touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are truly aimed at bringing tangibility to these "pictures in the air." For example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed to a specific point where the finger is located gives a sensation similar to that one feels if someone was blowing it on the fingertips, but that sensation is still very weak.
There are also wrist bracelets that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, this also a promising direction.
- Did you try to trick the brain?
Make him think he feels what he looks like he should feel the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
Here is another challenge that we will have to struggle with for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space believe that he is going to an open space, almost endless. We are also working on the idea of treadmills (not like those of gyms), mobile platforms, as well as that of giant balloons.
For now, tricking the brain is not so easy, you still have to work for many years.
That’s what makes working with virtual reality attractive to researchers, that many things are in a state of total conception.
Personal subjective taste rather than culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Vanguardism of St. Petersburg", dedicated to the citizens who are in front, at the forefront of art and culture.
In this list of the best are brilliant figures of the art and scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements reach beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without even being known by Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the flamboyant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from top to bottom, who can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or at fashion meetings and openings.
Kirill Miller’s paintings always attract crowds, wherever they are displayed.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely sociophilosophical storytellers from St. Petersburg, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s - early 90s.
In addition, he is an urban man, whose appearance on the streets of the city awakens in the inhabitants smiles and lifts everyone’s mood.
Recently, he took an organillo in his hands and became the organillero of St. Petersburg, since he has matured to make such a difficult role, due to his Bohemian existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you going around town dressed in red and not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the color red because I am a fashion designer and I dedicate myself to the appearance and the image.
In this world, the color red is a compromise between the artist, the image makers, and society.
Although in society, everything that is not a little gray arouses aggression and agitation of not good properties.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
When did you realize you had to be an artist?
- In an exhibition of the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where my works were exhibited.
I realized that was my path.
Then the wave of old unofficial artists was over, and new ones, free like me, were still misunderstood.
I became friends with artists of the new wave, with those after those who were exposed in Gaza and Nevskiy, who led to "Pushkinskaya-10", and the new wave is over.
I got into the theater because of the clothes, the music of all genres, but not because of the lyrics.
- And all this came together in your art clinic... - For me it was important to be in the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds had to meet.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there existed a musical arts club, a bohemian club, the home of the St. Petersburg bohemian.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I remember the way Schnur brought "Van Gogh's Ear" to the project.
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under phonogram, wore tight pants, among them was the current fashion composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group started playing live, they became "Leningrado".
Trachtenberg was an animator of many programs before the times of Hali-galivskih.
We gave them to Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of his great career; the basic education and training he received from us.
Gallery "D 137", the "Griboyedov Club", are the remains of the Art Clinic.
There went our regular employees and customers.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In the year 2000, the survey was done in the press, the award was "The people of our city".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was chosen, so ended my culmination.
In these new times it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who likes the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In our times it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity go apart. One can be popular but very little cultured.
- There's something recognizable about your work.
- Many of my paintings are hits, in them the actuality and the occurrence is clearly expressed.
I'm going to do a scheduled exhibition, "The Russian Museum on Clowns."
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, but now to be so is painful and terrifying.
But in clowns everything is smeared and tragedy is eliminated.
I love the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through a totalitarian and obligatory change of clothes.
Now one is followed by clothes, orienting oneself to the outside, but not to the inside of the person.
And, perhaps that person should not be given a hand, but spit in his face.
And the deception will be eliminated when you change your clothes.
- We recently saw you in the role of urban organillero. - A cultured city must have such a hero.
Who better than me to be!
- Well, maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, tactful.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
Before, people were grouped into herds, the bohemians wanted one thing, the simpletons another.
Now everyone has been divided into micro-communities, it’s hard to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill for everyone to like.
Now you have to think about who you want to like.
Now, every cult hero has their 100 fans.
- And to listen to Stas Mikhailov they come by the thousands!
- The abandoned ones are going to see it, there the sex-social sphere works.
And at a cultural event there are 300 people, 10,000 will never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything withers.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to cheat them, not to spoil what you have achieved.
When he was young he made such paintings that a collector had them hanging on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, which people usually end up with.
Now they often confuse concepts.
They say spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no culture in consumption, that’s another story.
I am a man of yesterday’s culture, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, they refused money just to paint pictures.
I am in favor of this culture.
- Kirill, what is St. Petersburg missing?
- Good culture experts.
There is a concept: official of culture.
But not all of them can devote themselves to culture.
When the kings were correct everything was otherwise, the kings perhaps did not understand the culture very well, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the experts correct.
In Moscow there are now very good consultants.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could well be experts, but they are closed, because they need experts at a higher level who correctly evaluate these and pave the way for them.
Now subjective personal taste is thriving.
The same Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What's St. Petersburg for you?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital. In Moscow there is much more culture, there is land.
But on our stones it is difficult for art to grow.
We need cultural terrain and we now have more writers than readers, this is wrong.
In Europe there are a lot of curious people who go to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is tiny.
We have to make art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a grant from St. Petersburg.
Giving birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with humans on board set out in search of a spare planet.
To conserve humanity, the main question is asked: How to continue the species in weightless conditions or on the same spare planet?
I think there's little to choose from.
In fact, only two are true planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
"These are Venus and Mars," says Sternberg P.K. (IAES) chief investigator Vladimir Surdin.
But if conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
The problems of reproduction in space with flora began to be addressed.
Experiments with plants have been carried out for half a century.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit differed in nothing from terrestrial varieties.
Then came the brood of insects in orbit, small fruit flies, the drosophiles.
In 1979 quail eggs were sent into space to check how the embryo develops under conditions of weightlessness.
We get a normal chick as a result.
But then the problems begin.
“The problem is that this chick has to find support, it has to stand on its own feet and start moving,” explains Vladimir Sychev, the laboratory director of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Finding no support, the chicks flipped at random.
And after 10 hours in the newborns there was a total atrophy of the instincts.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
And the misfortune was that after four days they were just dying.
“And twice we got the chicks born, but then we left them because it was impossible to work with them there,” Vladimir Sychev comments on the failure of the experiment with the chicks in space.
The last time a biological "miniarch" flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
Experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, in the biosatellite "Bion" only species of the same sex will travel.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent into space already with fetuses.
In principle, nothing supernatural was found.
“This was precisely in biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this need to be carried out,” says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats had offspring.
However, the problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been addressed.
It's a tough challenge.
Animals, by losing their usual habitat, simply cannot perform their sexual instinct.
Man, however, unlike small animals, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract reasoning and is able to create an adequate emotional background.
Similar experiments are not conducted for ethical reasons.
Women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing that humanity has is the female organism.
Our gull is flying, and no one on Earth could say: if it’s after a flight into space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
“After all, no one has answered this question,” says aerospace veteran Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, just one year after the flight into space, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The girl's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice orbited and even worked in open space, had a son.
However, the risk persists.
We are few, there are only a few astronauts who after long flights have done well, and a healthy generation has been growing.
“And if you can say more, it’s dangerous even on orbital flights,” sums up cosmonaut pilot, Soviet hero, Russian hero Valery Polyakov.
However, humanity must look for some new avenues in biotechnology, in radiation protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The cosmonaut preparation center hydrolaboratory is a mandatory stage in flight preparation.
In conditions of zero buoyancy, cosmonauts practice their working skills in space.
Water simulates weightlessness.
If for an adult water is a comfortable environment, although still hostile, for a newborn child it is his native element.
The little amphibious men seem to confirm that life on earth arose from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months inside his mother in the amniotic fluid, because it will be easier for him to get used to the water later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the time of birth to the time of the first bath only 2 weeks pass.
“This is too little to forget,” says Marina Aksenova, a newborn swimming monitor.
In short, if weightlessness is a more natural state for a newborn, for women gravitation, the force of gravity, is necessary.
In weightlessness the abdominal and pelvis muscles decrepit very quickly, the ability to expel the fetus is reduced.
Well, we skipped that, relying on the action of birth stimulants.
You can, of course, give birth in a special camera, it will push you.
"And then what?", Valery Polyakov asks himself this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the sensation of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton or the muscular system.
A newborn in orbit is impossible to dress in a special training suit, like adults.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
“And this experiment that we are going to do together, by allowing the birth of a child in a strange environment, will result in us bringing to Earth a disabled, a totally misfit person,” predicts the head of the bioethics committee of the Institute of biomedical problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical question.
However, in time this will become a reality, as humans on their ships head to a distant planet that will be home to their space-born children.
Head of NK: The inspection of the system "Avarc" has not found the guilty politician
In the area of public awards, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although its implementation is limp.
Miloslav Kala, vice president of the Office of Supreme Control (NK) said this in an interview with Aktuáln.cz.
"The law will never be perfect", but its application must be correct. "This is, in my opinion, what we lack", thus describes the current situation.
The joint controls of the Czech and German inspectors also reach similar conclusions.
As an example of an incorrect practice, he mentions Petr Neas' attitude towards the system of being autonomous only on paper, which is known as the "varc" system.
The prime minister recently said that the SDG (Civic Democratic Party) would not bother businessmen with inspectors. So, is it forbidden or allowed?
"The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits something, in that case, neither the president of the government can prevent the action of the office that has the obligation to carry out such controls or demand obligations," Kala says.
At the meeting of the control committee in the Congress of Deputies, you talked about the common project between the Czech and German teams, in the framework of which the legislation regarding public awards in both countries was compared.
What exactly is it?
This is a parallel check that we started doing about two years ago.
Put simply: European legislation regulates how public awards should be organized, this is followed by the legislation in force in each country and, later, the praxis itself.
We have put everything together and, although the control has not yet finished, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, the legislation of our country is "stricter and more complete", however, the concrete praxis in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is thus confirmed that it is not enough to incorporate ever stricter rules, but that it is necessary to concentrate on the application of the law itself.
What can this project actually bring? What do you think are the conclusions?
Precisely a common control of this type could help us to stop investing efforts in the concreteness of the laws, the reduction and the improvement of the limits, even if this does not have such a positive impact.
Savings economics means getting the right thing at a reasonable price (which doesn’t always mean the price is the lowest) to avoid enrichment and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But not by reducing the limit of awards does it mean that we are going to achieve it.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much “paperwork,” those who want to look for flaws in the system will be able to do so more easily than if the limits were kept as high as they are now.
You talk about the problems of our country with the transfer of the legislation that regulates the practice of public awards.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it an office similar to our NK? Or is it organized differently?
As for the offices, like the NK, there acts the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Accounts), with an organization similar to ours, with a school too, the only thing is that in his case it is structured in a somewhat different way, but in principle both offices evolve in parallel.
The competences are also somewhat analogous, however, while Germany has a federal organisation, the courts of accounts are even at this level.
The Federal Court of Accounts (BRH) can only control federal money, what we here call state funds.
Public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities, there, in Germany, are controlled in the Federal Court of Auditors.
As for local legislation, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would not like to make a comparison without specific data; however, Germany is still a model in some respects, but it is not possible to specify exactly which is better.
Could it be better, for example, in terms of the quality of the inspectors?
Of course not, but again, I don’t like to make this kind of comparison.
It is necessary to say that even those countries that we take as a model must face a large number of problems.
If they didn't, they wouldn't benefit from collaborating with our office, would they?
With regard to the legislation of our country, what did the amendment of the law on public awards mean to your Office?
Since the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been manifested in the control proceedings.
Since we carry out ex-post checks, a certain delay is required.
For now, it is observed in the process of preparing future controls: we have initiated a new tool of "non-economic risk detection", through which we have passed almost 14,000 public awards, which have been analyzed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, since the limits are modified, the conditions of some types of the selection process are rectified and the like.
Do you consider that the adoption of this law is beneficial or that, rather, it is a mess for the bureaucratic system?
I believe that this law is surely a step in the right direction and I hope so.
The problem that can arise is that the regulation “hardens” and it is impossible to comply with it.
Under the previous regulations, the controlled persons were linked to the contractor (for example, in the case of the regional operational programmes of the regional council), and each law not respected in terms of public awards meant the violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense to harden the law in this way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack it or take advantage of it and not punish those who commit a formal failure, which has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only create more bureaucratic pressure.
And how do you get out of this?
We will see where this path takes us.
The prime minister has recently stated that the SDG would not bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called varc system, with reference to being autonomous only on paper. What does this mean?
Is the "varc" system prohibited or allowed?
The law must be regulated in some way and, if it prohibits something, then not even the prime minister of the government can prevent the action of the Office that has the obligation to carry out such checks and demand obligations.
He can say, “We changed the law and allowed it,” but he can’t say we’ll just do it.
In the law on public adjudications, the rules are quite strict as to how to act formally. And that is how they should be to protect public competition.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic that the candidate with the best offer is excluded for not fulfilling the formal demands.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct. This is, in my opinion, what we lack.
The roads have ice sheets, although they are mostly passable.
In several places in the Czech Republic the roads have ice sheets and snow.
Although most roads are passable, caution should be exercised in some.
Karlovy Vary Region
Today in the morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were passable, but presented plates of ice and snow.
The temperature drops and will range from five to ten degrees below zero. During the day the thermometers will rise slightly.
It has stopped snowing in the region and in low areas the snow cover is thin.
On the other hand, in the crests of the Metallic Mountains the snow reaches almost 30 centimeters.
In some places, visibility was still poor because of fog, according to information from the region’s road operations control center.
The R6 fast track and first-class road in the region are now passable without restrictions.
However, extreme caution is recommended, especially on some bridges whose surface may be icy and slippery.
All second and third category roads, including mountain roads, are also passable.
However, in some of them there are still stretches with remnants of ice and rammed snow.
There is a need to increase attention on the road, especially in higher areas.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové Region
On some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a danger of frost and in higher areas and in the mountains a layer of snow may have formed on the roads, reports in its pages the Direction of roads and highways.
Road operators warn drivers of the danger of ice sheets forming, especially in higher areas of the Pardubice region.
Freezing may occur in the vicinity of Lankrouna, Orlici, Poliky, Svitav or Vysokeho Mita, and especially on second and third category roads.
I/43 and I/34 roads in Svitav have been chemically treated.
There is snow especially on the roads of the mountains from Krkono?e to Orlické hory.
There is a layer of snow rammed into the higher areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Knou and Trutnov.
In the area of eastern Bohemia, the sky today will be between clear and partly cloudy, without precipitation.
Temperatures will usually range from three below zero to a positive degree, blowing a weak wind.
Pilsen Region
Roads in the Pilsen region are passable today morning, although caution will need to be exercised and it will be necessary to adapt to the weather.
In the early hours of the morning there will be frosts, temperatures will range between three and nine degrees below zero.
After the snowfall and subsequent drop in temperatures, some tracks could also be covered in ice.
In some places drivers will encounter fog, but visibility will progressively improve.
This is what emerges from the information of the control center of road operations in the region.
The D5 motorway is almost unrestricted, although extreme caution is recommended, especially on the road between kilometre 80 and 131.
The surface of most top-notch roads is dry and ice-free.
In the Pilsen and Tachov road area bordering Germany there may be stretches with ice sheets.
The second and third category tracks are wet, so, in this case, there are also sections with ice sheets.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially on the least traveled roads in the area.
Olomouc Region
Drivers heading to the higher areas of the Olomouc region will encounter partly discarded snow.
After the chemical treatment, there was still snow in the port of ?ervenohorské and on the road in the direction of Videlsk? k?í?.
Road operators cleared the snow overnight; about three centimetres of snow piled up on the umper road, according to road managers.
In the rest of the region, most roads are passable without restrictions.
"On the highest areas of the umper road, there are remnants of snow.
Drivers in the port of ?ervenohorské will find themselves with half-wasted snow heading towards Jeseník," confirmed today an operator of the road administration from ?umper to the ?TK.
On the ground and at night his colleagues also went to the Jesenická and, after the chemical treatment, the tracks of the highest areas are now clear and wet.
On the Olomouc road the roads are passable without restrictions, on the ?ternberská road drivers should drive with caution in the forest sections, where the roads are still wet.
Ostí nad Labem Region and Liberec Region
Road operators in northern Bohemia have reported complications in different sections early in the morning.
Apart from some places where it has snowed or frozen, according to the police database the mountain road between Telnice and Kninice in the region of Istí nad Labem is closed.
Temperatures remain below zero, even in the lowest areas, so ice and snow obviously remain on the roadway. On the other hand, in the lowest areas, especially in the southeast of the Czech Central Massif, there are no problems and the roads are usually dry.
For the moment there have been no complications of service.
Road operators have warned of the presence of ice in the vicinity of ?t?ti.
According to meteorologists, the conditions have been ideal during the night. During the day rain and snow are expected to melt and at night the sky will be clear and there will be ice.
Unfavourable conditions have been announced from the general roads on the I/13 road, on the border between the Usti nad Labem region and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Kninice had to be cut by the branches of the trees that had arched over the road with the weight of snow.
Ornest: In our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
It is said that in a little less than a month the end of the world will come, what do you think about it?
It's just one of many other alarmist news stories we like to hold on to.
The Tap Tap likes to make jokes about this and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that manages to gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it.
Also, in December you organize a really original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain this to our readers?
This is a state benefit that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential that the end of the Mayan calendar enunciated for December 21 at 11:10 in the morning.
The day before, on December 20 at 9 pm, we will organize 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end at approximately the same time as the Mayan calendar ends on Kiribati Island in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially it was my idea, then we forged the project all together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar we have also created a unique collection of items: boots, t-shirts, bags and original keychains against the end of the world that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The group The Tap Tap, along with other performers, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which is titled "End of the world, canceled".
It is currently very popular on YouTube, can you hear it at charity concerts?
Of course it is, and it will be just the last, well, as long as everything goes well and the world does not end...
It will be sung by all performers at the same time at all three concerts.
The hymns will be linked to each other simultaneously thanks to the special live broadcast on Czech Television.
Toma Hanák has written the lyrics of this song and plays the leading role of Jesus in the video clip, where he also sings Xindl X...
How did this collaboration come about?
We work together even with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, apart from organizing many charity events and concerts...
We make every effort to participate in this project.
It has been proven that most of them are interested and have fun working with us.
What will the money raised at the concerts be used for against the end of the world?
Equipment for the school without barriers Studeo, which we have completed in its sixth consecutive year with the civil association Tap in Jedli?k?v ústav.
The students of the school of Khedlykov Ustav are regularly visited by teachers with whom they carry out fun and interesting activities.
Students do not have sufficient financial means to pay teachers and we make an effort to make this possible.
Within the framework of the completion of the works in Jedli?k?v ústav, there will be an independent building to which we will move with this project.
In each concert several groups and performers perform.
What are the selection criteria?
We try to develop a program that appeals to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague they will perform Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Ji í Such.
For more detailed information, you can consult www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any other similar "spectacular action" in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Praské jaro festival, so here we will surely prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and I personally, taking advantage of the fact that we are in the United States, would like to complete it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not exactly minimalist, so far you have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group made up of people with disabilities.
How is the logistics and organization of these trips?
It’s not as difficult as it may seem at first glance.
There are five members in an electric wheelchair, the chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and we also carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
However, so far we’ve managed well. SA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which still surprises me.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned from, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to going abroad you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects.
What have you come across so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have seen that, in the east, there is a long way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there it is still not frequent for a person to travel alone through the city center in an electric wheelchair.
Something as common as it is, for example, to give preference to someone in a wheelchair in an elevator, there it is not.
Fortunately, a civil partnership had been set up to address the problems of persons with disabilities.
In what areas should we take the example of more advanced countries?
There are a lot of areas where we are behind...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the people it directly affects.
In London and Madrid it is very normal for people with a serious disability to travel on their own in public and can go to the service, to the museum, wherever they want...
But it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to actively participate in social life, in this aspect, with The Tap Tap we are a little ahead!
A respectful or barrier-free society is one thing, but when the time comes for eminent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers to emerge, it will begin to truly change everything.
So far, they are isolated cases of people who have great willpower.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, but if we look a few years back, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I went in as an educator in Jedlykov Ustav, where I had a lot of young people around me who wanted to devote themselves to something.
And since I am a musician, I play, among others, the saxophone, I founded an amateur group with a co-worker.
And over time, as our moderator Laca Angelovi? says, it got a little out of hand (laughs).
However, the popularity did not come until these last years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us a lot to connect with famous singers and also actively work to promote the group.
We come to the conclusion that work that is not seen, is as if it did not exist.
Thanks to the help of the European Union, we can also afford quality teachers, equipment, etc.
Did you intend to go that far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential that there was, that you can do something differently.
The show business is full of things that look like each other.
It is logical, in its own way, that everything new is welcomed with caution and takes a long time to be accepted.
There are few extraordinary things, but dare I say The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone seeing us for the first time is clearly compassion, it is a natural reaction...
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings who suffer and for whom we must have compassion.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, provided, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well for people with disabilities, then it’s not just a breakthrough for them, but for society as a whole.
Did it help that you are a demanding boss, as many people describe you?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be rigorous in many aspects and demand some discipline.
I think it's completely normal.
Some people arrive with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and when they learn that they have to go two days to rehearse, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and in concerts, the initial euphoria leaves them quickly.
But that’s how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and get something done.
The Tap Tap group currently has twenty members.
How many of them were already in the beginning of 1998?
Only one: Láña Angelovi?.
We’re an open group, people come in and out, you can’t help it.
Whoever has the will and the will will always find the doors open.
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21 hours
It will take place at the Incheba Arena in Prague, in Fléda in Brno and in Plynojem in Ostrava and 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic will participate
The three cities will connect at the end of the evening via videoconference to co-sing The Tap Tap’s song “End of the World, Cancelled.”
The aim of the concert is to gather the necessary resources to finance the multifunctional equipment of the STUDEO barrier-free educational centre in Jedli?k?v ústav in Prague, which costs 25 million CZK.
Admission to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years old have free entry into the early sale option on Bohemiaticket
Poland and the Cosmos.
Poland was accepted as ESA’s twelfth member at last week’s meeting of ESA country ministers, the second member of ESA’s former Eastern European bloc, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008.
Poland began an intensive collaboration with ESA in 1994 and over the following years participated in the agency’s project committee.
However, Poland’s path to the cosmos began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were already engaged in spaceflight before World War II, although their work was not always understood.
I remember, for example, the lecture by A. Sternfeld at the astronomical observatory in Warsaw in which, on December 6, 1933, he presented his ideas on the pioneering study "Introduction to cosmonautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the assistants indifferent and, years later, Oternfeld remembered that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934, Oternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize in France for his "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899-1966), mentioned above, later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, he was known all over the world and his contribution to science was rewarded when he put his name to one of the craters on the far side of the moon.
As early as 1925 a dresina was built in Poland that was to be fitted with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, it is unknown who was the author of the proposal and the details of the project are not known.
It is not clear if the rocket was to be used for the start of the drain or for its braking.
The information on this drain is limited to the information collected in the press of the time.
Beginning in 1933, Polish artillery began to devote itself to missiles.
The research was funded by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the preserved material, it becomes clear that the investigation reached the stage of practical testing.
However, with the arrival of the German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937 the prototype of a photoelectric hunting missile designed by the engineer Rohozi?ski appeared in the specialized press and the following year the study "Rakieta - torpedo powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki was published.
Both projects were intended for military use of missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all missile technology projects for military use and coordinated all work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the start of the war.
Other studies devoted to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The November 1954 issue of Problemy magazine first referenced society with four very extensive articles devoted to astronautics.
In one of them, Prof. M. Suboticze, proposed the creation of a society that would be dedicated to cosmonautics.
At that time artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was obvious that cosmic research was a discipline with future prospects.
From the beginning of 1956 the Polish Astronautics Society (PTA) aspired to be part of the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951) and in the autumn of that same year the PTA became a full member.
The following year the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the vice president of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Beginning in 1956, the PTA was significantly involved in the development of the successful RM (Rakieta Meteorologizna) sounding rocket, which became the first Polish rocket in which scientific research was carried out.
The first RM-1 type was completed in 1957 and first launched on October 10, 1958.
The rocket had an apogee of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm in length and did not reach 5 kg in weight.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed and in the summer of 1959 the air tests of the two-stage RM-2 rockets began in the Bodów desert.
The rocket measured 1.4 meters and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of rocket in development was to be the object of real scientific study. The RM-34 rocket was to have an apogee of 14.5 km and its mission would be to control the high wind.
In 1962, however, work was suspended.
The successor to the first rockets of the RM type was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during the years 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed from each other by the space available for scientific devices.
In the Meteor-1A rocket the space available for the volume was 0.4 liters, in the Meteor-1B 0.34 liters and in the Meteor-1C 0.62 liters.
The maximum apogee in all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968 the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Air Institute, whose first aerial tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg up to 60 km in height.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were later built.
It is also necessary to mention Poland’s entry into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the COSPAR national committee two years later.
Within the framework of the Interkosmos program, Poland joined the cosmic space research on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimír Remek.
The suspension of the social work law is not the solution.
Last week the Constitutional Court suspended the social work law.
The resolution sparked a heated discussion in society.
It will certainly be interesting to look at the existing problem from a broader point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulation.
Consequently, this means that different economic forms and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with each other.
The cause lies in the principle of free trade and the free and unlimited movement of private capital, along with unbridled financial speculation.
The effect of large differences in labour costs (wages) produces economic tensions.
Under this concept it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the import of cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and to do so "causes a decrease" in the price of the competitor with the aim of taking the largest part of the market and, thus, increase its profit margin.
On a large scale it means, for most entrepreneurs, moving production abroad, buying there cheaper or disappearing. The result is high unemployment in those countries where the price of labor, compared to other economies, is higher.
Because private capital has no social responsibility and, with it, is not responsible for the unemployment that this phenomenon generates, the social spending of the state necessarily grows.
All this situation encourages the total lack of interest of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and compensate for the economic and social damages they have caused in their desire to obtain benefits.
The situation is universally so well known that it is not necessary to present specific statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create situations, in certain economies, in which the governments of these countries are forced to compete with the objective of artificially reducing the social level of their own population and, in this way, attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments make private capital available to their own population without regard to social decline.
This is especially evident in the changes in the existing laws.
The aim is to force the population to accept the dictates of private capital, especially with regard to wages.
This takes place, on the one hand, through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other, through the restricted right of employees in respect of labour rights.
The result is growing poverty along with the widening gap between the poor and the rich.
For a number of years now, there have been food delivery points in Germany for poor people who cannot support themselves with their own work.
The number of people receiving this type of aid is now one million.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there is a fairly frequent case: employed people with such a low salary that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum essential to survive.
A scandal of this kind related to the situation of the auxiliary employees of the German federal parliament was made public.
The savings measures of practically all the southern states of the EU lead, without a doubt, to the same situation. People, pressured by an abysmal decline in their social level, are forced to emigrate as in the nineteenth century or to live poorly on a lousy salary at the limit of society, in the hope that one day private investment capital will arrive in the country.
Do you have to wonder where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, then poverty passes from one country to another or never arrives, since Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians or Africans continue to work for a tiny part of a European salary.
This also affects all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media adamantly assert that the state should not bring capital to the economy, that running the economy leads to its failure.
Private capital defends tooth and nail the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by meddling in control.
Next, it is necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence with its egoism the political march and, therefore, the entire state.
In this case the answer is clearly yes.
The proof is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and ubiquitous, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation that manifests itself in the area of corruption, in mutual favors, in legislation that is practically reprehensible everywhere but not punishable.
In Germany, the situation is as follows: State ministries, in the absence of financial means, entrust the drafting of bills to private legal companies, which are often linked to industry.
These types of bills are then passed in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
In this way, all power does not emanate from the people, as announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from the strong financial groups that represent their own interests.
It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation quickly find themselves in a situation like that described by Appiános in his work The Crisis of the Roman Republic in the Time of Caesar and Pompeii: "The state had long been disintegrating and the administrations were occupied by force."
In exchange for bribes, favors obtained illegitimately and help to finance stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption spread unhindered and people went to the polls with the vote spoken in advance"... "there were no people of character who aspired to a position in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state went eight months without consuls"... "Although it began to talk seriously that the only remedy for such a serious situation was the autocracy and that it was necessary to choose "
The conclusion, as in ancient times, is that today’s society is based on inconsiderate preferences of individual benefit without regard to common interests.
Private capital is not able, in its essence, to understand and claim the benefits of the whole society.
The result is the same as then, an unprecedented decline of the elite, without an effort being made to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the unbridled liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a liberal democracy, as a definite pause, waiting for the next coup.
The truly devastating fact is that today’s elite completely ignore the hundreds of thousands of lives lost, the social and humanitarian catastrophes we have witnessed, as well as the crimes against humanity as we know them in ancient and most recent history.
Suspending the law on public awards is not the solution; at least not in the long run.
Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and within the EU, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue looking for other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution lies in concrete socio-political reforms, which reinforce both the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: The Laboratory of Chaos.
"That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could", Sting in his song Fragile and whose refrain reads "Let's not forget how fragile we are".
“If my children didn’t want wars, there wouldn’t be any” Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on her deathbed in 1849.
After the latest waves of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, diverse reactions have emerged, as always.
One, on the Israeli side, argues for the right to self-defence and pigeonholes Palestinians in the role of terrorists, the other supports Palestinians and alleges racism on the part of the state of Israel, genocide perpetrated against Palestinian Arabs and branding Israel a terrorist state.
I do not want to focus on who is guilty of the massacres that are repeated periodically and who is the victim. After all, the citizens of Israel today, including the autonomous territories, were born within the current political situation and did not live the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a behind-the-scenes look, a look to discover who takes advantage of the tensions that have dragged on for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour declaration in November 1917) in a small area of Middle Eastern land.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions I have reached based on my own understanding of the matter, about who or what group of people is the main driver of events in modern history.
In the history of mankind, the history of power struggles is at the forefront.
In every era we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
But what is no longer so evident is whether it was always these characters who directed their steps autonomously or if behind their throne there was someone who oriented their actions towards a certain objective.
We must accept that we live in an age that concentrates the wealth of the world in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the power that this implies, has not been reached in a single generation.
Of these astronomically rich families, one stands out that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind, I don’t know, but I don’t rule it out): the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Naturally.
In the 19th century, they bought the first news agency to stop associating their name with very serious criminal acts. Power and wealth, or both, covered their backs, which for them always meant a strengthening.
They have significant stakes in almost every central bank in the world and in those countries where they are not represented, a war has been declared or is being prepared: before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5, after overthrowing Gaddafi there were only four, but in the meantime Russia has subordinated the central bank to the Russian government.
Everyone who has tried to oppose this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the Rothschilds' central bank Bank of America, began during the American Civil War to print money, and was assassinated in 1865 in the theater.
JFK began printing money and wanted to suspend the Federal Reserve System (FED) and was assassinated in 1963; Congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for triggering the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their eagerness for world power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to draw up a plan with three world wars, designed by the Freemason Albert Pike, decorated with the 33rd degree.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchical states throughout Europe; the second wanted to eliminate colonial supremacy, especially from Britain, and the third was aimed at reducing the population of the earth between half a million and a billion people (such a number of slaves for their welfare and luxury would be enough and would not consume so many resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than the final adoption of such a solution).
The method with which the group of the richest families operates, together with the Rothschilds, follows the dynamics of the unleashing of crisis and the subsequent offering of a solution (order ab cao - order out of chaos).
These solutions are, however, wrong, and always lead to a worsening of the situation. If not, it is enough to remember that the FED was created so that a crisis such as that of 1907 would not be repeated.
So, after the success of the assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Franz Ferdinand, in Sarajevo and after the First World War, they destroyed Tsarist Russia with the beginning of the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended suddenly and unjustified from the military and economic point of view, the capitulation of Germany (the wars to end Tsarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian empire.
To prepare the ground for World War II, they allowed the bankers and politicians to covertly create a conflictive situation in the wake of the enormous war reparations imposed on Germany, thereby creating the optimal conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds pushed for the founding of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour declaration laid the groundwork for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine and the first conflicts with the Arab population there began.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
World War II broke out: it is difficult to know whether Hitler pulled too much of the rope to which he was tied at first by international bankers or whether everything he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created the optimal conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state into world society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similar to the way war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way to World War II, with the proclamation of the state of Israel the focus for a third war was created.
If the international bankers succeeded in starting it, the Jewish nation, as in World War II, would become a victim on the front line, now together with the Arab or, generally, Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is an immense laboratory, a machine of welding and chaos, not only within the framework of its country, but also on an international scale. Let us take as an example how Israel’s sympathizers and detractors are sharply divided.
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Where does injustice breed injustice in an endless spiral of violence, if at the beginning of it all was the greed of some individuals and their eagerness for world power?
At this point it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leaders, because, as in our country, international bankers only present their candidates in elections.
The current president of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything possible to declare war on Iran and, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan ...), would threaten to become a global conflict and, if we take into account that Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz, where 20% of all world oil passes (the shipping corridor only has two miles).
In the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: “All we need is a general crisis and people will agree to a new world order.”
The New World Order in your imagination is a world of lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well-off financial aristocracy.
A world in which each new individual is implanted with a chip at birth that controls their entire being.
And it compels everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark on his right hand or forehead, to be unable to buy or sell, unless they bear the name of this monster or the figures in his name.
It is necessary to understand it: whoever has two fingers to the front, add up the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is six hundred and sixty-six.”
Argo Movie: If It Gets Raw, Call Hollywood
In November 1979 a protest group of Islamist students occupied the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
His release was to be in exchange for the dethroned Shah Mohamed Réza Páhlevi, who after the revolution fled to the United States, a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the American administration the situation offered no positive prospect: throwing the shah overboard could not be allowed, since, if it did, it endangered the confidence of its allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the constitution of the theocratic regime, was not within reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which subsequently escalated further with the failed attempt to release the hostages by force.
The imprisoned diplomats were released 444 days after the Algerian government’s negotiating intervention.
In the US, their fate caused a wave of solidarity and animosity against Iran.
The failure in Iran contributed decisively to Jimmy Carter's defeat of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film "Argo" by director and actor Ben Affleck themed an episode of this story, which garnered a small success for America.
Shortly before occupying the embassy, six employees of the building escaped.
After a difficult journey, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian embassy.
The CIA, in collaboration with Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, for it helped a cover story an extravagant point: they came out with Canadian passports, as members of the film team that examined the location in the country for the filming of a science fiction blockbuster.
Combination of genres
The plan devised by “exfiltration” expert Toni Mendez required Hollywood collaboration.
To make the lie seem truthful, it was written about the film project in specialized magazines, press conferences were organized, the fictional production society even had a real office.
Details about the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck’s film is a singular combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a so-called "caper movie", the story of an episode that went well, a hoax (an example can be the series Ocean's Eleven).
The film combines moods. We find on the one hand well-documented sequences of Tehran. In the sequence of credits are shown emblematic photographs of the time of the events, which were embodied in the same way in the film; there are not many differences in this regard.
On the other hand, typical Hollywood scenes somewhat lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
And also, scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions: men in suits who analyze the situation at the negotiating table, in the corridors of the office, by phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been mocked, has become a respectable director and his way of acting has ceased to be the target of ironic comments.
Argo is her third feature film, after "Goodbye Little, Goodbye" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of Thieves" (2010).
At the same time, it’s the first Affleck film in which the action has no place in the city of Boston, where he grew up.
Also, the sensitivity of capturing the atmosphere of the place was a feature that placed the directors of old films above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck proves it in Argo, where Tehran “rolls” in Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of true events. The introductory sequence of the seizure of the embassy is impressive for its synoptic capacity that, at the same time, conveys the emotion of bewilderment and lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, the story takes a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect in the fictional scenes (the impostor team in Tehran’s bazaar).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that an explained story doesn’t offer much in the cinematic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
Sometimes it adds something to the reality: everything doesn’t come out so elegantly here (the scene where the crisis lurks at Tehran’s airport, the diversion of a call to America, and the unbridled search behind its trail turn into madness).
Argo’s weakness is the lack of control that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very funny role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserved more space and are not, by any means, the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck’s film loses a bit of dramatic stroke, but it is a film that can be followed with a moderate interest, value its realization and the retro style of a thriller that evokes the 70s.
But if it collapses, that will be difficult.
As an evocation of a true story and as proof of how exaggerated the notions of omnipresence and omniscience of the secret services can be, it is enough.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circuses
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which every year presents a survey on the most absurd bank fees, has now decided to announce the contest on "the regulation or the most absurd ideas of the EU workshop".
“It occurred to us after the last event, the EU plans to approve a 40 percent quota of women in management positions in large European companies,” explained Právo Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the survey.
Among the absurdities nominated is, for example, the recent decision of the European court to unify insurance policies between men and women.
Until now, women have been ahead of better life insurance rates because they objectively represent a lower risk.
“Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be put forward by the people until the end of this year.”
The election will take place at the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
Among the EU’s controversial regulations is, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel which, as a result, harms the environment; another ban is the use of life-long mercury thermometers only because they contain a small amount of a hazardous substance or the guideline shade the size of the cages of the hens, which has contributed to the considerable increase in the price of eggs this year.
Criticism has been levelled at the factual prohibition on using the expression "butter spread" or the removal of the classic light bulb from shops.
A quality banana should have a length of 14 centimeters.
The Union apparatus often makes such decisions under the pressure of one or another trade or industrial lobby, whose petitions in Brussels are normally defended by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of a veto, claims the demands of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that the highest quality bananas should be at least 14 centimeters long in the EU and could not present “abnormal curves”.
The European Commission defended itself by saying that this only seeks to harmonize national standards not homogenized to date, which only complicated their commercialization.
Rules referring to fruit and vegetables in the EU, despite opposition from some states, have softened on the grounds that the existing directive entails a waste of groceries.
The candidate to win the survey could be the EU prescription from last year according to which on inflatable balloons that are marketed it is mandatory to warn that children under 8 are not allowed to inflate them without adult supervision.
The EU referred here to an American study according to which, when talking about toys, balloons are the main cause of child death by suffocation.
There is also a similar restriction on the use of mother-in-law matas by children up to the age of 14.
Curious occurrences are born even in our country
Equally absurd is the regulation concerning European officials: anyone who has any official function in the EU can not use the name of Macedonia. In order not to hurt the sensibility of Greece, we must talk about FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, nominated in the survey, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the EU prescription on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a member state.
The EU determined the maximum volumes of food supplies that can be found in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our entry into the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volume set for canned mushrooms, posing a threat of a substantial fine.
The organizers of the survey were also interested in the occurrence of paying those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy for the application for subsidies.
These kinds of ideas did not arise in Brussels but in Prague.
“We’re at a disadvantage because we don’t have a sea.
We are asking the European Union for compensation," then-agriculture minister Jaroslav Palas said in the autumn of 2004.
He argued it with the fact that in our country there was a lot of cereal and, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had the warehouses full and had to export.
According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission was willing to help the Czech Republic and organised a public competition for the purchase of the cereal from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant to receive a grant was proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry for Local Development led by Minister Pavel Nimec (US-DEU). Specifically, it is intended for the drafting of applications for grants from Brussels.
EU: Rare prescriptions are an exception
The guidelines of the member states are often the target of criticism, the efforts of the EU in terms of regulations and, likewise, a more effective functioning and development throughout the Union deserve rather, according to several experts, our recognition.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU grants for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but that the member states have achieved in the budget negotiations.
The Czechs also have the nerve, as do other countries of the Union, to fight for the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products, although our country has not always emerged victorious from these struggles.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the designation of origin of the Olomouc cottage cheese, but had to change the name to national rum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, and was renamed "tuzemák".
Only products made from sugar cane distillate can be called rum, but not those made from sugar beets.
In the official list of protected designations of origin of the EU, along with the feta and gorgonzola cheeses known throughout the world, the marzipan of the German city of Lubeck or the Parma ham, there are already, for example, the cookies of Karlovy Vary, the carp of Poho-elice and of Tuebo and, even, the variety of hops of ?atec.
As protected maras of the EU, you can be proud of the Pardubice gingerbread and the wafers of Hocice v Podkrkonocí.
People want me to save the republic, but I’m an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, how did you come to run for president?
It’s not about being a senator or president.
If it were all right in our country, then I wouldn't run.
But I can no longer stand to see how it is stolen in the last twenty years in our country, how thieves go unpunished, taxes are raised and the retirement age is raised.
He had no ambitions to be a politician.
When I see something I don’t like, I try to find a solution to change it.
And since I’m forty years old and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have to change things is to run as a senator or president.
The Senate has already arrived, but soon after it has set off on the road to the presidency.
Aren't you turning your back on those people who voted for you?
I always said that my candidacy for the presidency depended on the results in the Senate elections.
Later I specified that if I were elected senator, I would present my candidacy for the presidency.
But my goal is not function; function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas come true.
That is why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate.
The problem is not only that we are a nation that we criticize at the bar or in front of television, but that we trample on anyone who wants to initiate change.
To this is added the media, which discredits you and confuses freedom of expression with the freedom to lie.
I am said to have bribed journalists or to have been an advisor to Ji?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
Let's talk about your ideas.
It is presented to the presidential struggle with financial theses and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of property above twenty million.
To do this, the law must change.
As president he does not have this competence and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have been part of a pressure group to make the office of guide recognized as autonomous work, and we achieved it.
The problem is in politics: if someone arrives with a good proposal, whether from the right or from the left, it is rejected on purpose and this affects citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have greater potential to gain the support of all parliamentary groups.
Without party typecasting or dogma, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is best for our country and apply it.
Do you consider yourself a man of the right or of the left?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more left-wing.
It doesn't matter to me, whether it's a little left or a little right.
What matters to me is that we get ahead.
I don’t care if someone is right-wing or left-wing, I want to bring people together.
I always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from the KSM or the SDG and, in the same way, I will be against bad ideas.
He's joking when it's said of you that you're populist.
But aren't you proving it by what you say?
When you create a business plan for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
And you try to get close to them.
There will be those who call it populism, but all the proposals of which I speak already work in the world or well-known experts talk about them.
But without the support of parliament, there are only slogans left.
And it cannot survive in long-term politics.
Or do you think that if you address people and talk to them, you will get, for example, criminal and financial liability?
I have no choice.
Convince politicians, journalists and civil society and try to do my part to achieve it.
If elected president, there would be no problem organizing a live television broadcast in which he would ask parliamentary party leaders to legitimize criminal and financial accountability for state politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And, eventually, they would have to communicate why they didn’t want to.
If there is a strong character pointing out disputes, pressure can be put on the political scene.
Take for instance the direct election of the president, which has been an achievement of public pressure.
At the same time I affirm that I am only an amateur, I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I try to look for allies.
I've just started in politics and I'm trying to get as much support as possible for my program.
I'm trying to pull things off myself, but in case it doesn't work out, in six years I'll leave it and go back to the private sector.
It sounds a bit like Okamura is going to save the Czech Republic.
I am no savior.
I know that with one person I don’t do anything, that’s why I have visited a number of well-known personalities, in case maybe they were encouraged to present their candidacy to the Senate.
I went to see Radim Janura, but he refused because he had a lot of work.
For my part, I have at least supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who exposed the frauds with light heating oils.
I showed up on the basis that people are really unsatisfied, now I’m on the scale.
Sixty percent of the population did not go to the polls and, those who did, voted for the establishment representatives.
In the Senate we are two of the independent sector.
The people elected the Senate, so it will be difficult to make changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own party?
I haven’t considered it yet because I don’t have time for it, to check the faultless past of each of the potential members of the party, nor do I have money.
I have no money even for the campaign for the presidency, in my transparent account there are only 20,000 crowns.
You don't have any money?
You talk about property declarations, how is yours?
I estimate my private property at about 60 million.
In Prague I have a land worth 25 million, a floor worth ten million, another floor valued at eight million, a collection of works of art worth ten million, an Aston Martin worth about 3.5 million and a Skoda Superb valued at one million, and in the account I have a couple of million.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my dream as a youth. I always liked James Bond, who drove this car, was gallant with women and, at the same time, fought against evils and injustices.
You drive an Aston Martin, your property is valued at $60 million and you have no money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic but you don't want to put too much money on your side.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to borrow?
In the campaign I have already put 2.5 million.
The fact that I don’t have any sponsors shows that there isn’t too much interest in my program.
And I don't have to pay for the campaign with money out of my pocket.
The expenses of the campaign essentially cover what I will receive as a senator's salary.
For example, I would not be able to pay my son for the English school, which costs 30,000 kroner a month.
If I just wanted to make money, then I wouldn't run as a candidate.
So you will continue with your business activity to be able to live?
Didn't you say before that you were going to leave this activity?
This has nothing to do with a higher salary.
As I have promised, I have partly given up my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will become my replacement in the spring.
The people would want the Samaritan to save the republic.
But I also need to live on something.
How much do you usually earn monthly as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, which I still win.
If I were president, then I would quit business.

The architecture studio MVRDV shows that true adventures are not only in the head - in the example of the library of Spijkenisse and the newly completed "mountain of books" - 2 photos
“I think the building is fun, it has a futuristic look to it, and there’s finally something interesting to see,” says Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by walking down the street.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT technician at a large company located near the library, points out: “Plus, the building is nice.”
But I wonder why we need a library these days.
We all have the Internet, tablets and e-books.
Nobody goes into those old-fashioned libraries for pleasure, right?
Spijkenisse, a sleeper city at the gates of Rotterdam hardly worth a quick visit, has the dubious honour of having set a record for forgetting.
The population of 80,000 has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counteract this shameful situation, a few years ago it was decided to contribute in some way to the general culture and copy the seven fictitious bridges that are represented on the euro banknotes in the form of decorated reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And that’s how policy makers decided there was only one way to improve statistics: you had to build a library!
Winy Maas, from the Dutch architecture studio MVRDV, a master in the art of bar charts and responsible for fun as well as cynical buildings, took the subject with his usual serenity and appeared at the presentation of the contest in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And as the jury looked perplexed around him and shrugged, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size forming a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words: "Dear fellow citizens:
Here you have it, my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, the so-called 'Boekenberg'".
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain rises to its intended location.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with an underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of residential and townhouse buildings.
In early November the mountain of books was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is also nominated for the "Dutch National Wood Award 2012".
In this way, the small town devoid of history, which to date had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an incredibly ugly town hall behind whose white facade one would intuit rather a dairy plant, now has a work of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Way to the Book
The first impression is that it is a paradise of books under a cheese maker.
It is true that there is an elevator that transports us right to the center of this mountain massif, but true lovers of space and reading do not use it, but prefer to merge with its topography at every step of their climb to the top.
The fully glazed interior is bright and easy to cover with the view, the annealed brick floor and the elegant street lamps unequivocally support the public condition of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
When you look up, you can see the benches of the park, the dogs and the children playing football.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
“Normally the bookshelves are arranged along the facade and in the center opens a huge dark room that is usually somewhat uncomfortable and impersonal,” says Winy Maas.
What we have done is turn the classic spatial configuration upside down and take the reading area from the interior to the exterior.
The interior of the mountain is very well used: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental education center and the maintenance room.
Special mention deserves the black shelves that assume the functions of wall covering, parapet and railing at the same time.
The sight, touch and smell are strange.
Even the most up-to-date architects and civil engineers shake their heads when they hear about this unknown material.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials,” explains Joop Trouborst, project manager in the city of Spijkenisse.
And that’s how one day, on a Frisian farm, we came across the right by-product from agriculture.
For many years, in the greenhouses and fields of the Netherlands, a plastic fabric of a few millimeters in thickness has been used as a base to hold the roots of crops.
It is a cheap and efficient material.
This tissue lasts for two seasons and is then discarded.
For the library this fabric was pressed, for the first time in such quantities, until plates of four centimeters thick were obtained.
With the heat and pressure, so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells like a mix of new car and sneaker.
After 105 steps you reach the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous route of almost 500 meters around the mountain awaits us the reward: from the cafeteria you not only have a fantastic view of the city, but in it you can also enjoy tasty Dutch croquettes and their ficus planted in huge pots.
These create a pleasant atmosphere while maintaining the right atmospheric humidity for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a New Soul
“Although it’s hard to believe given its large glazed surfaces, this building is an exemplary project when it comes to ecology,” says Trouborst.
The necessary heating and cooling is obtained from geothermal energy.
Even though the mountain of books is located under a huge glass pyramid, even on the sunniest days the sun only shines for a few hours inside.
The huge wooden trusses located transversely to the glass facade serve to shade and absorb most of the sun’s rays.
This creates a comfortable indoor climate.
The rest is automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the skeptical IT worker, has already dared to set foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has been there, too.
Traditional Chinese medicine professor Cynthia Bogarde has also visited the library, calling the "Boekenberg" the "late soul" of Spijkenisse.
The reason is that, on the occasion of the inauguration that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to donate a book from their private collection.
In this way, it is intended to fill, for the moment, the optical holes of a library that does not yet have its complete archive; at present it has 70,000 copies.
The concept has taken a deep dive.
The shelves are full.
“There’s nothing worse than a half-empty library,” says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain link with this building.
Everyone knows that your book is part of the library.
Even if it's just there to decorate.
In this way, the MVRDV studio has achieved great success in that discipline that in specialized slang is known as "creation of an identity".
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature.
Regardless of how young and uneducated you may be.
Finally a starting point to shape your identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a more leading role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on U.S.-European relations, this puts Berlin in a rather thorny diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier in the week, Germany implied that it would vote against the proposal to grant the Palestinian territories observer status to the United Nations.
However, Berlin eventually abstained.
Why is that?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Now, because of the special relationship that unites the country with Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time, I don’t think he supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to prove its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from establishing a no-fly zone.
This has finally been declared by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear stance when important international issues are at stake?
Yes, it is.
This is because it is currently reorienting its foreign policy, moving away from a policy led, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what makes things even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
The Germans are at a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to doing so.
I think they are still groping over what their role will be, but they have already started on the path to a “normal” foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to countries like France or Great Britain.
What does a “normal” foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is willing to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy finds a strong motivation in economic policy, that is, in exports and in its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are to some extent different from those of other great powers and that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the stance taken on the conflict in the Middle East and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
For this reason it must be careful not to alienate itself from Arab public opinion or Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I would not give it so much importance since it is not a totally one-sided relationship.
However, they do play a key role in German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the U.S. by refraining from voting on important decisions such as the Palestine vote?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position enjoys an enormous degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not believe that there has been such a drastic break as in the case of Libya.
Perhaps Germany has gained some respect for it.
After all, all this has only shown that it is a country that is taken seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
In Europe there are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative.
Instead, the U.S. has been clearly in favor of a veto.
Is there a disparity of opinion between the U.S. and many European nations?
These disparities have always existed because of U.S. domestic policy.
I think the Obama administration secretly shows a great understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, it is clear that the government cannot publicly defend this position.
I believe that the true disparity of opinions does not really have the magnitude attributed to it.
If we analyze the relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not at all enthusiastic about the policy he develops.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the stance of its main partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that is precisely what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course it would be a little easier for Germans if there was a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but that is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the possibility of being part of a higher entity, but they must push things from their own position.
That is precisely what they are doing now with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take a leading role in forcing Europe to adopt a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, either simply because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a tricky subject.
But I think the Germans are clear that they must play the role of an independent figure.
Does Germany see itself in the role of an important international actor? Does Germany really want to take on a leading role?
Or maybe you still find it hard to accept that leadership?
Germany has not yet become accustomed to it, it is always somewhat uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country still finds it difficult to play a more important role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time Germany positions itself as a leading player, certain anti-German sentiments are unleashed.
This is not easy for the Germans.
This is an old problem and no one wants to be surrounded by enemy countries.
Seen this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
You must show a receptive attitude to different neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
The influence of the US in European politics is diminishing more and more, but the EU does not fill that gap at the moment, so who is left?
The Germans will have no choice but to take on a more leading role.
Even if they do not like it, if they find it unpleasant or if it makes them an even more unpopular people, c'est la vie!
Stephen Szabo is Executive Director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, an institution where scholars and policy experts from Europe and North America jointly analyze the challenges facing the transatlantic community.

"Brand protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands
Armani is a globally known brand and Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
What is Armani Polo?
Behind this name is a name officially registered in China but that has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, it enjoys protection as long as the true eponyms do not file a lawsuit.
And even then it is not clear that they will be given the reason.
“Foreigners are finding it increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing who specializes in Far Eastern rights violations.
Every week a new case comes to my table.
The imitators simply add a couple of letters to be able to register their marks.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and in place of Prada Prada-Kny is registered.
German companies are also legally copied in the same way, as has happened to the sports goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a filing cabinet in which he keeps seats of the Beijing trademark office.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company applied to register the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that also used the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights is well known.
In large cities there are large multi-storey stores dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeits.
However, Pattloch’s cases are of a different kind: on behalf of his clients, he fights against the fact that the trademark office officially grants Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a name that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pai" or accompanying brand.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan",
This refers to women who have "fished" a rich man.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
“It’s bad for the business, you have to fight it,” Pattloch says.
“The brand is watering down, the monopolistic position disappears, and the damage to the image is enormous.”
The financial losses and the procedural costs of the sectors affected are millions, especially in the case of emblematic luxury products.
According to data from market analysis firm CLSA, with a volume of 15 billion euros per year China is, in size, the third market for luxury goods and the fastest growing.
However, the cancellation of registrations of dubious legality in the registration of trademarks is complicated and also involves a lot of money.
Processes can last up to nine years and the outcome is uncertain.
Pattloch talks about cases in which the court dismissed a lawsuit because so much time had elapsed that the name subject of the lawsuit had already become a “market reality.”
“If the plaintiff is unlucky, he may even have to pay money to the plagiarist because the process has damaged his brand in China,” Pattloch said.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Some of the best known cases have to do with graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that has recently been absorbed by German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
That is why today the Chinese can still use an emblem very similar to the Mercedes star.
Volvo buyer Geely initially used a blue-and-white logo that was largely reminiscent of BMW; the matter was settled in court and Geely had to modify it.
The clothing manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a crocodile looking in the opposite direction from the original.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing recognizes that in 2010 they have had difficulties due to the shortage of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, “the work emergency situation returned to normal.”
In this way, the number of unprocessed claim processes has been reduced by 22%.
Almost 57,000 of these cases were resolved, 75% more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 claims remain outstanding.
Fighting this costs a lot of money
As usual in China, the numbers are staggering.
Last year, the CTMO registered more than 1.4 million trademark protection applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
It would be a new record and means that China leads the list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth consecutive year, according to the trademark office.
It seems that this also happens with the number of valid logos, a figure that amounts to 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan in royalties would have been pocketed.
Put another way, this means that on average each inscription costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
Fighting this costs a lot of money, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years the group has been fighting in court against a Chinese imitator.
While the Germans have managed to stop the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts,
the imitator has managed to secure the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
“We have caused this situation ourselves because in Germany the surnames are not protected,” says Hanno Wentzler, President and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trademark office CTMO also dismissed the appeal from the Munichs.
Freudenberg has been proved right in the next two instances, but the other side is still fighting today.
You have to be very careful
Now the case has reached the doors of the High Court of Justice, where it remains pending resolution.
Wentzler is confident that he can resolve the issue favorably and praises the professionalism of the courts.
However, he also states that “the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time.”
Internal costs are difficult to estimate; the corporate archive has had to review records up to 100 years old in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the opposing party a “six-figure sum in euros” with the aim of reaching an amicable settlement, but it was unsuccessful.
“It shows how much we care,” Wentzler says.
The dangers lurking in the Far East threaten even to affect Europe.
In particular, if the imitators secure the rights to unprotected trademarks there.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The group has long since abandoned this commercial area, but nevertheless managed to prevent registration.
“You have to be very careful,” Wentzler says.
Both he and lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be extremely cautious when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark law, but what needs to be done is "to register in China also everything that may be susceptible to protection", as Wentzler points out.
Otherwise, the issue can be much more expensive than a simple registration.
In fact, should Freudenberg lose the last round of his particular battle, then he would have to pay the opposing party license fees in his own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or the segment in question would drive us out of the market.
World AIDS Day: Dance, sing, help
Imbongi choir rehearses in Heidelberg and AIDS orphans rejoice in Swaziland
The story of a bond able to overcome much more than 8,733 kilometers away.
First you start with the dance: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, heeled shoes and loafers look for the compass on the parquet floor, and they find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Only then do the voices of the singers (contralto, bass, tenor and soprano) slowly begin to rise, swirling, hindering and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to get out of his way by trying to bring order with his brisk, gentle gestures.
It is Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg the Imbongi choir rehearses a new song.
Fifty singers have also arrived, between 23 and 69 years old, from the human geneticist to the housewife.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each voice of the choir has a different text and also in a barely known foreign language: Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some areas of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to an estimate by UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS programme, there are approximately 34 million people infected with HIV worldwide.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40% of the population is already HIV-positive.
Voices for Africa has found godparents in Germany for the 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend high school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can sponsor a child.
This contribution will cover the school’s tuition, uniform and guarantee you a hot meal a day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means "storyteller" or "panegirist" in Zulu.
In this room nobody knows how to speak this Bantu language fluently, but they do know how to sing.
For ten years this choir has been rehearsing songs in this soft foreign language that sometimes manages to transport them to their place of origin: southern Africa.
8,733 kilometers away in a straight line from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is a town called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this German choir.
40% are infected
Approximately 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 no longer have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the highest rate of AIDS infection and the lowest life expectancies worldwide, according to UNICEF.
The population does not welcome circumcision, a practice that has been shown to halve the risk of contagion.
More than 40 per cent of people in Swaziland are carriers of the immunodeficiency virus, and dying in their 30s has become commonplace.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005 the choir discovered this hidden population, but what they saw above all were many children on the streets who lacked not only the protection of their parents, but the main thing: food, clothing and training.
Without a school degree, the chances in a poor country are more than slim.
At first it was only the particular commitment of a few that made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal a day. All this for a few euros.
However, a year later the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" which has since dealt professionally with AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts About Sexually Transmitted Infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STDs include syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.
The most common STDs of viral origin are AIDS, human papillomavirus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
The crabs and scabies are among the STDs transmitted by parasites.
What are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur more often in men who have sex with other men.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, at least four out of five syphilis cases in Germany are caused by sexual contact between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia infections, trichomonas, human papilloma virus, candidiasis (fungus) and gonorrhea.
HIV transmission among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively low; however, approximately 20 per cent of new HIV infections occur in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In our country, the human papillomavirus is also added to the most common diseases among young people.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory reporting.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been on a downward trend since 2007.
Approximately 2,700 cases were reported in 2011.
This is one tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that it is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can lead to ulcers in the genital area, discomfort when urinating, discharge, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
They often do not cause pain or cause other symptoms and are not detected.
How can one protect?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they don’t offer 100% protection.
Some sexually transmitted disease pathogens can also be transmitted through dirt and physical contact infections.
For this reason, experts recommend regular medical examinations, especially if you change sex partners frequently.
If diagnosed early, most STDs can be cured and any late consequences can be avoided.
Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, the fees charged by the choir for their performances throughout Germany, they get to raise quite a bit of money.
“In total we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni,” proudly points out Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village itself Zodwa Dlamini a self-confident and gifted woman manages the money sent from Germany.
It ensures that orphans find good accommodation, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The "gogos", as the older women in Zulu are called, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in their care, offer them a roof over their heads and ensure that children go to school every day on time and dressed in their uniforms.
Those who have no one are left under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children, receives a salary from the association.
In addition, Voices of Africa has set up a sewing school, built two chicken coops and, in collaboration with the US health organization PSI, has managed to get many villagers tested for HIV.
This is not obvious, since, despite the fact that this disease is evident throughout the country, it is not usually talked about openly.
A King with 14 Wives
“AIDS is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
Something strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent and overcrowded lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This unofficial way of life is largely responsible for the rapid spread that the HIV virus has experienced in recent decades.
But it is also due to the countless seasonal workers who travel the country from one place to another and who take it wherever they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "You can get free condoms anywhere, but they're barely used.
It’s another culture, here they only accept skin-to-skin contact.”
To encourage cultural exchange, the Imbongi Choir travels every two to three years through southern Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, combative spirit, hope and trust in the black race, songs that many in the southernmost tip of the African continent still remember from the apartheid era.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language; so much recognition not only brings an excellent atmosphere and a lot of joy, but has also managed to tear apart a couple of tears from some rabid border soldier.
The trip always takes them to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the sponsored children.
Although this small population barely appears on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni River is well known.
“Come to Esitjeni, there the light shines,” says the locals.
And after traveling the 8,733 kilometers in a straight line back to Heidelberg to the rehearsal rooms of Bergheimer Street full of singers marking the passage, one realizes that it is also possible to see its light shine from there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence of ice on Mercury.
The ice sheet is probably up to 20 meters thick.
NASA, the US space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice on Mercury.
Despite being the closest planet to the sun, there is also ice water there, as can be seen from three studies published on Thursday in the specialized journal "Science".
The Messenger probe reportedly found evidence that a layer of ice has formed in the area of the planet that is permanently in the shadow.
It looks like this one is at least 30 centimeters and probably even up to 20 meters thick.
The water presumably comes from comets or, with great probability, from asteroids that once collided with Mercury.
No one is linking the ice finding to the possibility of life on the planet, says Messenger chief investigator Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help shed light on how water and other components of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
Inadvertently for the inhabitants of planet Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots like the Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images back to Earth: small windows into the vastness of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that make up our solar system, in addition to the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is no “planet.”
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" in which infinite generations of stars appear: the oldest stars are shown as blue dots, although the most difficult to recognize is the pink color of "newborn" stars.
This star-forming region, unromantically named by W5 scientists, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This iridescent image of a dying star was taken by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The doughnut-shaped ring is composed of the material that the star spits out in its extinction process.
In the huge Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars form from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer telescope took this photo of the galactic star formation zone.
The Pleiades, a group of stars also known by the nickname "The Seven Sisters", are an object visible to the naked eye in the night sky.
However, with the telescope you can better appreciate the colors.
The Helix Nebula appears as a huge red eye appears in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light-years from the constellation Aquarius.
Its similarity to a terrestrial continent has earned it the nickname North America.
The combination of a normal photograph and an infrared image gives rise to a spectacular color.
This budding star could be captured in all its glory for the first time by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: how they originated remains one of the great unknowns of astronomy.
It's probably the remains of one of Saturn's moons that disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest photographs taken by the Hubble telescope: the Whirlpool Galaxy.
Depending on the hues, some images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image released by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula located several thousand light-years away in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin term "trifidus" (divided into three), since dark dust lines divide the hot heart of this star formation zone into three lobes.
In the constellation of Ophiuchus, astronomers were able to photograph the signs of a cosmic star: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two galaxies in the process of merging rush towards each other to end up colliding irremediably.
This star formation was captured by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations can refer to it with the nickname of Molinillo Austral.
The Hubble Space Telescope photograph shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula located 1,400 light-years away is composed of dust particles whose size is between ten and a hundred times smaller than the dust particles that we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and X-rays made by different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes located 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, named Arp 273, served for a time as a model for NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call it the largest spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this nebula lies the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
This zone of star formation constantly produces new stars.
In this cloud of stars, associated with the Rosette Nebula, new stars also continuously arise; 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole there is still no dust, only gas.
The researchers assume that it formed shortly after the big bang, when hydrogen could mostly be found in the universe.
Our window to the universe: the most important telescopes
It appears that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not stopped growing and the images they offer us have more and more depth.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
His mirror, in the image, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, the Large Binocular Telescope is launched.
This allows us to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias located on the island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Despite this, it reaches a diameter of approximately eleven meters.
The drawback of this more economical construction is that the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed elevation angle.
Its particularity is its enormous capacity to collect light.
Despite having a comparatively smaller mirror diameter, this capacity is comparable to that of the largest mirror telescopes in the world.
With the help of the Arecibo radio telescope (Puerto Rico) researchers can explore the universe for signs of extraterrestrial life.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) anyone who owns a computer can help, providing processing capacity.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that lives up to its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
ESO will also host the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT).
Its primary mirror will cover 42 meters and will be composed of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
Until 2018 it is not expected to be able to take pictures.
Until 2007 the two Keck telescopes located on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which together with them explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
Mauna Kea is planned to build a new telescope of enormous proportions and with a mirror diameter of thirty meters.
This is a picture of what it would look like.
However, the most important information in the cosmos comes from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been sending images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets, mainly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 planet candidates had been located since the start of its mission.
This image shows the final preparations leading up to the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not be launched into space aboard an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to look for the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
The researchers believe that there is also ice at Mercury’s south pole.
However, there is no reliable evidence, since the Messenger probe revolves around the planet in an orbit much closer to the north pole.
For decades, radar measurements have pointed to the existence of ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe (2004), the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now certain that this is the case.
Drink butter daily and live 168 years

The tour of the Talysh mountain region could be described as wild and romantic.
The minibus roars along the winding road that passes wooded hills, high-flowing rivers and the simple homes of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, one might even think that it is located in the Black Forest.
However, we are in the southernmost part of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here live the "talyshi", a people that not much is known, apart from the fact that they dominate Persian and Azeri perfectly and that they are very long-lived.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small town boasts perhaps overly massive architecture designed in the Soviet era and does not seem to fit into such a picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists barely reach this place, since the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy.
To travel the 323 kilometers that separate both urban centers, it takes eight hours because the road is one way.
The astonishing wealth that the country enjoys thanks to oil from the Caspian Sea has not yet reached this remote region.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
“Baku became famous in May to celebrate the Eurovision Song Contest and next year we will celebrate the World’s Oldest People Festival,” says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, perhaps the only one in the world.
The life of eight dozen talyshis over 100 years old is documented here. Fatulayeva points to a black and white image.
This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.
His son died at the age of 136.
However, the undisputed star of the museum is the sheepherder ?irali M?sl?mov, who seems to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate that certifies it.
And if we take into account that the oldest man documented lived 122 years, it seems that the age of M?sl?mov is quite suspicious.
“He was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973,” Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, and apparently still had time to conceive one more daughter at the age of 136.
Have you made a mistake then in your age in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard about the advanced age of this Central Asian inhabitant.
“In some regions of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan there are also very elderly people,” says Scholz, “even in Sardinia there are many older men.”
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age, especially when there is no civil record.
Everyday glasses filled with melted butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly often, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik often reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people over the age of 100.
Why do so many elderly people live here in the south?
Azerbaijani tour guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that these are the special genes of the talyshis.
The director of the museum, Ms Fatulayeva, believes instead that the cause lies in food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that precisely the high-calorie diet of the talyshi, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of whom, in addition, drink a glass of melted butter daily, is so healthy.
Or perhaps it is the natural way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the town of Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At 97 years old he is relatively young for what is stylized by these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the floor, she untiringly moves a huge tub of butter.
Eight people live under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva’s sons and a daughter, both of whom became grandparents long ago.
Two small children also jump from one side to the other.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for the guests, a tea that they serve in typical glasses with a bulging shape.
Mirzayeva’s teeth are white and perfectly aligned and under the scarf she hides two long braids of dark blond hair that her son proudly reveals to us.
I have always washed my hair with milk, so it has never fallen out and has kept its color.
“I haven’t used a shampoo either,” Mirzayeva says.
The pension is enough to live on.
He has always eaten only what he produced on his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In all my life I have never gone shopping at a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the post-World War II era.
However, everything returned to its course when the "dear father", Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds weird on an older woman’s lips.
In Azerbaijan, however, the cult of the father figure of the nation, who runs his country like a dictator, knows no bounds.
He remained in power until 2003, at which time he ceded the witness to his son Ilham.
At least the elderly in Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva charges 230 manat (about the same amount in euros) as a monthly pension, an amount with which you can live well considering the situation here.
And perhaps Mirzayeva’s grizzled son is right: “In our culture the elderly are highly respected.”
They live in a large family, are loved, receive all the necessary care and are happy.
As if this wasn't reason enough to stay alive for many years...
The term “human rights” is missing from the Constitution.
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival demonstrations in Cairo highlight the tremendous divide the country is in.
The future constitution, with Sharia as its basis, is highly controversial.
The Egyptian president spared no pathos.
“We have to overcome the transition.
And for that to happen is my responsibility, before the people and before God,” he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, especially the Coptic Christians, liberals, enlightened Muslims and secularists.
All of them, hopelessly mired so far in confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Morsi explains, almost asking for forgiveness, he has had to temporarily annul the powers of the Constitutional Court and expand his own “in order to save the revolution.”
Yet neither Egyptians nor the entire world know what this 61-year-old engineer with a doctoral degree from the University of Southern California really wants to save.
Do you want to deprive the judiciary of its power?
In fact, the 234 articles, which have been forced through a constituent assembly of 100 predominantly Islamist members in a 15-hour evening meeting, are truly troubling.
As in previous constitutions, the draft is also said to be based on the “principles of Islamic law.”
But what does that mean for “principles”?
This was and still is open to interpretation and it seems that the Islamists will take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the legal leeway it entails, to impose a stricter interpretation of Sharia.
This is at least what a new article added suggests: in all matters pertaining to sharia it is mandatory to consult Al-Ashar University, the country’s most important Islamic institution with great power throughout Sunni Islam.
It doesn’t have to be, but this may mean that the clergy would control the legislation, something that – in fact – would result in the incapacitation of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation.
What is also problematic is that it seeks to maintain military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak’s dictatorship these courts served to exert a harsh repression on the opposition.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons.
As the draft states, the state must protect “the true essence of the Egyptian family” and “promote its morals and values.”
It is such a vague formulation in legal terms that with the help of this article state institutions could even control the contents of cinematography and literature.
To be clear, this is nothing but censorship.
Certainly, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
On the other hand, another forbids offending or slandering the Prophet Mohammed and his legates.
However, it is not clear what an offense is and how it should be punished.
Just as dubious is the formulation that forbids "offense to people"
Is a cartoon of the president or a joke about a lawyer enough?
A question of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been submitted to Morsi for his signature and that, according to him, "very soon" will be submitted to the Egyptians for a referendum.
"The revolution is back"
The opposition has been closing ranks for weeks in the face of Islamist superiority.
Ten thousand people gathered in unusual harmony on Friday afternoon in Tahrir del Cario Square and vowed to derail the Act before it can take effect.
“The revolution has returned and we will end up winning,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, who is third on the list for the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El-Baradei said the draft constitution should be “in the dustbin of history.”
On Twitter, he accused Morsi’s supporters of wanting to lead a “coup against democracy.”
“When the referendum is called, we will go to his palace and overthrow him,” said opposition leader Jasser Said.
“We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been expiated,” opposition politician Chaled Ali was quoted in Egyptian media.
And several judges announced that they did not wish to oversee the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
“The Koran is our constitution.”
For its part, the well-organized Muslim community called for a counter-demonstration, just in case not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, before Cairo University.
Many women covered with a veil and supporters of the Salafists took part in it to the cry of: "the people demand the application of the divine law".
They demanded that Morsi “cleanse the country,” while proclaiming, “the Koran is our constitution.”
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would have caused a civil war-like situation.
Clearly, Morsi’s supporters didn’t want to risk such a thing happening.
The Muslim brothers claimed that both opponents of the draft constitution and supporters of it would have expressed their opinions loud and clear.
Now the time would have come to let the people decide at the polls which direction the country should go.
In this sense, it seems that the Islamists’ draft is guaranteed a majority.
"The expression 'Human Rights' does not even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious with this forced constitutional process that should have actually lasted until February and included all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended Muslim brothers when they were being held in prison or facing trial during Mubarak’s dictatorship.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because for him Human Rights are indivisible.
For this reason he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
“And now the expression ‘Human Rights’ does not even appear in the new constitution,” he laments in a conversation with the newspaper “Welt am Sonntag.”
The extension of Mursi’s powers to the three branches of government made this lawyer resign himself.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
“Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is abolish it,” Saeda laments.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could turn against you.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: "You are conceiving a monster that you cannot control."
Norwegian rakfisk: the smelliest fish in the world?
Norway’s five million inhabitants enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible that the country’s success has something to do with its craving for a very smelly fish?
Take a series of over-cured cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a mountain of dirty, wet soccer clothes.
Leave it there for a week.
You can then smell the paralyzing aroma of rakfisk, one of Norway’s delicacies.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
The landscape is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
Rakfisk is salted trout that is left to ferment in water for, depending on how foul-smelling you prefer, up to a year.
As it gets darker and colder, Norwegians flock to a festival held here in Fagernes, dedicated to this most, so to speak, captivating delicacy.
“You eat raw and then you drink a glass of aquavit from a drink,” says Havard Halvarsen, a city firefighter who is also what is known as the “General of Rakfisk,” who is in charge of organizing the festival.
Everywhere we see people eating this fish that is kept in small buckets and drinking from a drink significant amounts of the drink.
“Some people like aquavit more than rakfisk,” Havard says.
Drinking can kill the smell.
I try some pieces.
If you can avoid passing it near your nose, it’s not bad; it’s not much different than a portion of sushi you’ve traveled a few miles by bus.
Rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different time, in which poverty plagued Norway and in which, before refrigeration existed, fish was stored during the autumn submerged in water and salt in airtight barrels.
Later, in the middle of winter, when it is already well fermented, it is taken out and, obviously with the senses inactive due to alcohol, it is eaten.
Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and migrated mainly to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a complete system of social services.
A stream of inhabitants of Sweden, the old rival and even makes it not too much richer than Norway, comes to this country to work.
The rakfisk is considered to be something important, an essential, though rather smelly, part of Norway’s past.
It is among the most expensive dishes you can buy.
But, in fact, everything is expensive. A beer cane or a sandwich costs you a whopping 10 euros ($14) each.
Norway does not usually appear on the international news agenda and most Norwegians like that.
Here people are still reluctant to say the name of Anders Breivik, the far-right racist who gunned down and murdered 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as “the July 22 event.”
Norwegians find it very hard to believe that in their peaceful country one of their own was capable of such cruelty and murder.
Behind much of Norway’s current wealth is the growth, since the early 1970s, of one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries.
“But oil is not the only reason why we do so well,” says Anna, our waitress, as she passes rakfisk trays and who, with her long blonde mane and striking blue eyes, represents the image of Norwegian well-being.
"We are, as you say, wise people."
His English, like most people in this country, is impeccable.
“We don’t like bragging, we don’t like ostentation.”
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution; everything, except a small percentage of the money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While everyone was wasting money they didn’t have during the years leading up to the financial crisis around the world, Norway kept the wallet tightly closed.
“As long as we can ski in winter and hike in summer, we’re happy,” says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk," she adds with a wild laugh.
I'm in the snow lining up to eat something; I've had enough rakfisk.
Now a moose burger is definitely something different and quite succulent to savor.
But at night, that stinky fish comes back.
The hotel where I stay is one of the many places where a rakfisk dinner is held in which diners vote for the best fish, or perhaps the one that tests the nostrils the most.
A television has connected live with a presenter wearing bow tie and who is surrounded by rakfisk dishes.
It looks like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What are your scores for the best fish up in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Havard."
There is laughter and applause.
A man falls from the chair, perhaps defeated by the aquavit.
Or maybe it's the vapors of all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto faces a tough start
As incoming Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto prepares to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant looks at the challenges the new president will face and the different expectations of his people.
Traffic in Mexico City is especially bad these days.
In a city that, under the best circumstances, is already congested, a steel fence has been installed since Monday that cuts several of the main roads that lead to the city and that is causing enormous chaos on the roads.
The aim, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their workplace, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico’s new president, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential sash and take over the management of the nation.
He is faced with a complicated task.
Mexico has been getting good economic results during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is immersed in a war against drug trafficking that has already claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
“My administration has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,” Mr. Peña Nieto explained earlier this week to U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office.
“I’m going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal.”
Before rubbing shoulders with the president of the U.S., Mr. Peña’s previous political experience was as governor of his home state of Mexico.
A heavily populated and rapidly growing state, it surrounds the capital; opinions about the new leader are divided in this territory in which he used to move.
A sincere man
In the bucolic city of Valle del Bravo, for example, he is fondly remembered.
Its residents credit it with the growth of on-site tourism and infrastructure construction.
To get to the city you can drive along one of Mr. Peña Nieto’s new roads, which is a huge improvement compared to the cracked and pothole-filled roads that were rehabilitated.
You can also see plaques with his name at the entrance of a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
“We are confident that he will make a real and lasting change,” says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, a deputy in Mr. Peña Nieto’s party, the PRI.
“Particularly when it comes to security and the economy, we look forward to the interesting and true change that our country so badly needs.”
After an uninterrupted 81-year period in power, the PRI was ousted by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Deputy Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, within the party there are many expectations regarding Enrique Peña Nieto.
It also rejects the opposition’s qualification of lack of substance of the new president.
"He is a very sincere man, very committed and with an excellent vision of the country.
He’s a fantastic statesman and, above all, he’s a person who knows how to listen.”
On the other side of the state, however, that’s not the impression many people get about their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Tucked under elevated stretches of highway is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also hard and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was asked to intervene to help in the fight against neighbourhood drug gangs, and violence against women is especially serious.
In a desert plot next to a garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left abandoned in just the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was governor, a rate much higher than that of Ciudad Juarez, unfortunately famous for its violence and a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
Critics of Mr. Peña Nieto say, at best, that he failed to address the problem of femicide while in office.
Critics accuse his administration of turning a blind eye.
In a concrete house, typical of the run-down neighborhood, Irinea Buendía has to make efforts to hold back tears as she shows me photographs of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes her partner murdered her.
“When I got home, it looked like his body had been cleaned,” Ms. Buendía recalls.
"There were signs that she had been beaten and rigor mortis had already appeared."
While her mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana looks down from the walls, next to a cross on which is read a single word: Justice.
However, that is exactly what the family says it has been denied.
“The state authorities have treated me like I’m an old gossip, a troublemaker, a whiner.
What they want is for you to just accept what they say and shut up.”
“But that can’t be the case when there have been so many irregularities and so much negligence,” he says.
The presidential band that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by an enormous responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has vowed to prioritize it during his tenure.
“I hope he’s the same kind of president he was when he was governor,” says PRI deputy Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, that is precisely what the families of the Neza City victims fear most.
Bradley Manning did not report ill-treatment, prosecutors say
Prosecutors Try to Address Bradley Manning Abuse Allegations While in Prison
The trial focuses on Manning’s time in the Quantico military prison in Virginia.
The defense wants the case dismissed on the grounds that Manning’s incarceration was harsh.
The army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to prove Friday that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of confidential information in U.S. history, missed multiple opportunities to report the mistreatment he now alleges he suffered while in military detention.
During the prosecution’s interrogation of Manning at a pretrial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, District Attorney Commander Ashden Fein claimed that records of weekly visits by officers from the unit that Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, show no allegations of his treatment.
The interrogation, which took place during a hearing following the defence's request for the case to be dismissed because his incarceration had been harsh and had already resulted in sufficient punishment, came a day after Manning had testified that he had thought about committing suicide while in detention.
The army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while on duty in Iraq.
WikiLeaks later posted the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of the information.
At Friday’s hearing, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms officers filled out after visits to Manning during his arrest at Quantico military prison, where he was jailed in maximum confinement from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers reportedly asked Manning questions and wrote down his answers.
When Fein asked about the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that he had called the treatment given to him by the warders "excellent" and the treatment received at the facility in general "very professional."
The forms do not show any allegations of ill-treatment, even though officers asked Manning directly about her treatment, Fein said.
Manning responded that he had expressed concern about some issues and that visiting officers had discussed those issues and indicated that they would be addressed, but that they did not record those issues in the record.
“They were writing ‘no issues’ (after I had talked about the issues) but this doesn’t necessarily mean that I hadn’t mentioned any issues,” Manning said.
The judge, Army Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why she had not reported her treatment during the January 2011 meeting with a council charged with examining suicide intentions she had expressed on a form months earlier.
Manning responded that his intention during that meeting was to obtain the reduction of the "injury prevention" regime under which he was.
The military said it had placed him under that restrictive regime, which is one degree below that of surveillance for possible suicide, to ensure his protection and the safety of others.
“I wanted the staff to know that I was OK and (wanted) to stop being under injury prevention ... so that I could enjoy what, in my view, is a better quality of life,” Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the Marine base military prison in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and once lost consciousness because of the heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what was happening to him or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
“My world came down to just Camp Arafjon, to that cage,” Manning explained Thursday.
“I thought I was going to die in that cage.”
Manning said that once he was transferred to Quantico, he spent most days in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, alone.
Manning said she was only allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, some flip-flops, some clothes and her glasses.
He explained that he was trying to move all the time, as it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down during the day.
Manning claimed she always had a light coming from outside pointing at her eyes while she slept.
He said that if the guards couldn’t see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up to turn around again.
Manning’s attorney filed a formal complaint in January 2011 about Manning’s treatment.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth Military Prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation he made in Thursday’s statement that, after being forced to sleep naked in his Quantico cell one night, he was forced during a morning recount to stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover himself with the blanket during the recount.
During the judge’s questioning on Friday, Manning said she deduced from the warrant given to her by the warden that she should drop the blanket she could have covered herself with, but acknowledged that no one had ordered her to drop it.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to prove to an officer that he posed no danger to himself.
Manning said she had told the officer she might have used the elastic in her underwear or flip-flops to self-harm but hadn't.
Manning testified that his underwear, flip-flops and glasses had been removed from his cell that night.
His lawyers are hopeful that the judge will at least take into account the experiences he went through while in prison and drastically reduce his sentence should he be convicted in the court-martial, which is scheduled to start early next year.
The defense said it plans to have Manning plead guilty to misdemeanors and defend other allegations deemed too extreme.
The hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has maintained that Manning was held under the rules for all detainees in maximum custody in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include cooperating with the enemy, illegally causing the posting of information on the Internet, leaking national defense information, and stealing property or public records.
If convicted of all charges, he could face life in prison.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He claims that many were forced to leave Mexico due to a lack of opportunities.
Mexicans tend to criticize those who left; they remind Mexicans of those difficult times.
Navarrette says Mexican-Americans are caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, he had barely gone down the esplanade and reached the immigration processing area and was already totally confused.
Posters pointed the way to two queues: one for "Mexicans" and one for "Foreigners."
I stood there for a few seconds not sure where I should go.
Growing up in Central California, I’ve been called “Mexican” all my life.
This is ethnic shorthand, just as my friends in Boston refer to themselves as “Irish” or my friends in New York refer to themselves as “Italian.”
I later decided to go Mexican-American.
But this was Mexico.
And, in my grandfather’s homeland, shorthand or scripts were not necessary.
He was simply American.
I speak Spanish well enough to handle myself during an interview in this language.
But I don’t have the vocabulary level of a native speaker and I can’t get rid of my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and put myself in line for foreigners.
I thought of that moment this week when Mexican President-elect Enrique Peña Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda of the day, as always when the leaders of these two countries meet, it was: immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was also eager to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why a Mexican is as likely to stay in Mexico as he is to venture to the United States.
It wants to partner with the United States and Canada and create a European Union-style trading bloc in North America.
In addition, Peña Nieto promised to continue fighting drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not give details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of rancor.
Most Americans probably never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to cede half of their territory at gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think in centuries, not minutes, the elements that remind them are everywhere.
So, the moment a U.S. official says anything that carries the slightest criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the sons of Moctezuma set themselves on a war footing.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really is a challenge is the one they have with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Are we talking about grudges?
There's plenty.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it does not.
The only reason there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, at some point in our family tree, there was one person, maybe the father or mother or one of the grandparents, who was closed the door of opportunities in Mexico and had to march north.
And most of the time that person fit a certain profile: dark skin, a low level of studies, coming from a poor town, etc.
We are their descendents and we are loyal to them.
Not in Mexico.
And, even though we may be living the American dream now, having gone to good schools and had good jobs, we can never lose sight of that what we are living is that, the American dream, and not the Mexican one.
Sometimes our identity may not be clear, but our loyalty is.
It's for the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many of the Mexicans belonging to the elite of the ruling class do not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look over our shoulders as if we are from an inferior category that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
In his view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn’t failed in Mexico, they wouldn’t have left.
And now we would not find ourselves trapped behind this silk curtain, living well in the United States but, still, as lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came to the United States legally as a child, reminds me that there is this friction between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the former know more solidly who they are and the latter this bothers them.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she considers herself part of both countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel they are not part of either.
We love listening to the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best of every country, but you’re not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico, they see us as Americans.
In the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
Now, to complicate matters further, from what I’ve learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as makeshift “ambassadors” to Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our fellow Americans how great it is to visit that country and we would pressure political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yeah, sure...
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much rancor.
And, with wage inequality, rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us aren’t so sure it’s a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you're going to be left alone with this idea, folks.
Fair enough.
If some Mexicans are not yet prepared to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still resentful of how their relatives were treated far less time ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
Israel-Hamas ceasefire may well be unlikely basis for peace
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
Amid the futile and habitual discussions over who started first, piles of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, Israel’s metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though Israelis and Palestinians seem to be anchored in their old conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has left everything in pieces whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been caught up in the regional uproar.
Perhaps this will make their struggle even bloodier than before.
However, there is reason to believe that their deadly stalemate could be derailed.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism now seems very difficult to justify.
Even if the ceasefire agreed to on November 21 is maintained, this week’s clashes have bolstered hawks on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to withdraw, even though Gaza has taken a good beating.
And despite killing some of its leaders and putting pressure on the 1.7 million people of Gaza in one of the most miserable and populated corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to end Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently ruled by its relentless rivals Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders might conclude that time is working in their favor.
Since Islamists have been gaining influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a resurgent regional power that had previously been Israel’s closest Muslim ally, has embraced Hamas’ cause, as has Qatar, one of the Gulf’s richest and most dynamic states.
Exultant Hamas members say the Islamist crescent is encircling Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where Hezbollah dominates, through Syria, where rebels with an increasingly Islamist bent could topple Bashar Assad, all the way to Jordan, where Hamas allies are threatening the king.
Especially on Israel’s southern flank, the growth of the Muslim Brotherhood led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and fundamental of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, didn’t have much time for Hamas.
Instead, the Muslim Brotherhood is Hamas’ first cousins and its leaders are more dependent on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, Hamas may emerge as a protagonist that cannot be excluded, not even Israel and the United States.
Meanwhile, Israel’s hard wing will draw the opposite conclusion.
As far as the military issue is concerned, they have put Hamas in its place.
Israel’s Iron Dome anti-missile system has proven its effectiveness and many of Hamas’ missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep calmer... for some time.
As for diplomacy, the United States is stronger than ever; many European countries also blamed Hamas for initiating the latest wave of violence.
First and foremost, Israel has prospered, especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets fired from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide bombers, thanks in part to the barrier that corrodes the West Bank, the main piece of territory aspiring to become a state of Palestine, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to rise even though, under international law, they are illegal.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined an even tougher-line group led by Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the Jan. 22 election, is in a good position.
Why pamper those twisted Palestinians by giving them a state of their own?
If they really ruled the West Bank, wouldn’t they fire rockets just like their compatriots in Gaza have?
It's better to have them behind that wall and give them a good blow if they raise their heads.
Perhaps the hard wing will prevail, although the Arab Spring could alter his calculations.
Even if Islamists taking power in Egypt and elsewhere don’t have much appreciation for Israel, their priority will be to address domestic difficulties.
Israel’s defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a war with the area’s superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments improve their economies.
That the pragmatic Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get the ceasefire is a good omen and could mark the start of something.
Israelis, too, should think long-term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination means creating a powder keg that will one day explode in the Israeli-occupied territories, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demographics worsen the situation as the Arab population increases.
The bloody missions to Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay a growing diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push from outsiders.
The solution continues to be that proclaimed by sensible people on both sides, most of the outside world and this newspaper: two states and the cession of territory by Israel for security reasons.
The hope, small in the short term, is that the ceasefire will give a little more impetus to outsiders who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must start curbing the flow of weapons into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented position to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land swaps and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs oblivious to the issue should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to join.
That would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to obtain a virtual status category at the UN.
Mr. Obama also has an important role in getting Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he omitted to present his own plan for peace.
Back at the White House, he seems just as reluctant to devote his attention to it.
This attitude is a deplorable vision of the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
Tobacco plain packaging law goes into effect in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and diseased body parts appear on packs of a dull green color, which are the same for all brands of tobacco
Australia’s world-leading tobacco and plain packaging law comes into force, replacing logos and brand colors with an olive-green off-the-shoulder wrapper, gruesome images of diseased body parts, and depictions of sick children and babies as children of smoking parents.
Except for the different images and health warnings, the only difference between the packs, mandatory since Saturday, are the names of the brands, all of them printed in a small type of source.
It is the strictest regime in the world applied to tobacco packaging.
Australia’s federal government says the goal is to deter young people from smoking by removing the traits that make this habit glamorous.
He relies on studies that show that if a person hasn’t started smoking before age 26, there’s a 99% chance they’ll never do so.
“You can see that children, even from a very young age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand,” said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that showed, for example, how girls related the logo of a crown to the idea of being a princess.
Even though Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and these changes won’t affect multinationals’ profits too much, other countries are considering similar measures.
The tobacco industry has exerted enormous pressure against the law.
Tobacco companies said the law would encourage the black market for tobacco, in which cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
"The legislation will have serious unintended consequences," said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco in Australia.
It will increase the amount of tobacco that counterfeiters in China and Indonesia will bring to sell on the streets of Australia.
Other people say their business has benefited from the passage of the law.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, claimed that the demand for silicone cigarette cases and covers to cover up the unpleasant images of the packs had skyrocketed almost from scratch two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain’s Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a challenge to the law in Australia’s Supreme Court.
Ms. Ha claimed that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesalers and was expecting more stock.
“For us, it’s good business.”
According to experts, the possible obstacle is the popularity of social networks among the demographic sector targeted by the plan.
Following a series of Australian laws banning TV advertising and sports sponsorship and forcing most marketers not to put cigarettes in plain sight, tobacco marketing has gone online.
Australia has banned Internet advertising to local businesses and websites, but cannot restrict it on foreign websites.
“If you market tobacco and only have this little window left to promote your products, the online space is the most compelling place to be,” said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman saw an increase in reviews of brands from “regular citizens” posted on social media websites like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
You might wonder if this is just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigars and has taken the trouble to make a video or if some marketing company is behind it all.
The British American Tobacco of Australia indicated that the industry focuses more on what the new regulations involve than on marketing.
The industry has even gone so far as to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules; these countries are claiming before the World Trade Organization that trade is being unfairly restricted, even though neither of these countries has significant trade volume with Australia.
The WTO is likely to issue a resolution in mid-2013.
Plibersek said the government had held talks with other countries considering similar tobacco packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada became the first country to make it mandatory to include images in packs.
They are currently mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India, tougher laws are being considered.
In Australia, many smokers are defiant.
“The pictures don’t affect me.
I just don’t listen to them.”
“You take the cigar and put the package away,” says Victor El Hage as he buys a package with the image of a tumor in his mouth.
"Honestly, there's only one reason I'd quit: for my daughter."
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack tobacconist in central Sydney, says the uniform packs make it harder for him to put them on shelves.
“Normally it took an hour to devalue a delivery; now it takes four,” Yu says.
“The government should have totally banned tobacco and then, that’s it, okay, it’s over and we close the store,” he says as he raises his hands upward.
In a constantly connected world, it’s not so bad to get a little bored
During this year’s Thanksgiving holidays, I unexpectedly had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane we were flying on suffered a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had plenty of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is quite boring, even if you have means to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting the duty-free stores.
But more and more academics and child development experts are praising the benefits of boredom.
According to them, it is okay for us and our children to get bored from time to time.
Getting bored forces the brain to look for interesting options and may encourage creativity.
Since most of us are currently connected to this or that screen, we don’t experience the benefits of boredom.
So, should we accept boredom in good spirits?
Yeah.
And no.
But, we'll talk about it later.
First, like many people, he assumed that, now that we have more time for leisure, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada, and author of the book "Boredom: A Lively History" published in 2011 by Yale University Press, states, this is not the case.
“In fact, the history of boredom is very extensive,” he says.
In the walls of Pompeii there are Latin graffiti on boredom dating back to the 1st century AD.
We must also ask ourselves how we define boredom.
“The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in many different ways,” says John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada.
After examining published research and pitching the idea to a 100-person discussion group, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of “wanting, but not being able to, engage in an activity that fills you.”
The difference between boredom and apathy is that a person doesn’t do something but wants to do it.
He points out that with apathy there is no desire to do anything.
The main experience of boredom, he says, is “the alteration of the attention process, associated with a low mood and a sense that time passes slowly.”
Boredom can sound terribly like depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that although they may be related, people who are bored tend to view the problem as a matter of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed consider the problem to be them.
Sometimes we think we are bored, when what really happens to us is that we have trouble concentrating.
In their study “The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention,” published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading a journal article.
Some groups listened in the next room to a loud television program that had no relation, others listened to it with the low volume, so that it was barely perceptible, while the third group did not listen to the audio at any time.
The group that listened to the program with the low volume showed more boredom than the other two groups; they struggled to concentrate, but were not sure why and attributed it to boredom.
"When you're trying to focus on a difficult or interesting task, attention disruption can lead to boredom," said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study's authors.
“On the other hand, when you’re doing something boring, like spotting faulty parts on a manufacturing line, music that distracts you can help you not get bored.”
“In fact, we currently know that moving or scribbling, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help fight it, as they make that person more physically alert.”
“Research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stand still,” says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it’s like to get bored at some point: the delay of an airplane, a monotonous speaker, an especially boring movie.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To help measure it, some researchers developed a “boredom trend scale” in the 1980s.
The scale includes questions like “a lot of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous” and “there are so many things that interest me that I don’t have time to do it all.”
Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, says that, using such scales, researchers have found that boys are more likely to get bored more often than girls, and specifically need more external and more varied stimulation.
But, in general, teenagers are a type of group that gets bored quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted 400 teenagers and their parents between seven and eight times a day through a search.
It found that 32 percent of teens said they got bored while in school or doing homework, while 23 percent said they got bored when they weren’t in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the current boredom rates, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said he did know that “adolescence is a period when boredom reaches its highest levels,” largely because both children and teens aren’t given much control over what they want to do.
So, back to my starting question: is it good to get bored?
Sometimes it is not, since, taken to the extreme, it can cause us to expose ourselves to absurd physical risks, such as making bets or falling into the consumption of substances as a method to combat it, as research shows.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between boredom and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this question for more than two decades.
“Boredom is the brain’s way of telling you that you should be doing something else,” says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn’t always know what’s most appropriate.
If you’re bored and use that energy to play guitar or cook, that will satisfy you.
But if you watch TV, it may satisfy you in the short term, but not in the long term.
“So if your child is bored and you give them an iPad, they may not be bored anymore, but they won’t have learned to entertain themselves or dose themselves,” says Professor Fenske.
And “that ability to dose applies to other situations,” he says.
Not only does your child learn to be entertained on his own, but he learns to control himself better in other areas.
I don’t think we really want to praise boredom.
But we shouldn’t be too critical of him either.
Our goal should be, rather, to feel comfortable away from the constant buzz of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
“In our view, we need to get bored more, but boredom is too distressing and unsettling a desire to relate to something worthwhile,” he says.
He points out that what people are really looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy a time-out.
“In an environment where we’re constantly overstimulated,” he says, “it’s hard to find ways to focus our attention when the noise stops.”
Colorado: No Instruction Book for New Marijuana Use Law
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old student at a community college and soccer player in southeastern Colorado, faces criminal prosecution for something soon to be legal statewide: possession of marijuana stones and a pipe he used to smoke it.
Orozco says that one day in September, he and some friends were driving through Lamar, on the plains near the Kansas border, when police stopped them.
Police found marijuana in the car and a while later Orozco received a court summons for possession of drugs and related items (minor offenses each carrying a $100 fine) informing him of the date of the trial.
“They treat us like criminals,” Orozco says.
And they are?
In the weeks of uncertainty following Colorado’s vote to legalize possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response in hundreds of minor drug possession cases depends less on law than location.
Hundreds of misdemeanors for marijuana possession are being quashed both here and in Washington state, where a similar measure was passed.
Police departments have dropped charges against those over the age of 21 for small-scale possession, which will be legally approved once the law has taken effect in the coming weeks.
But Colorado’s most conservative district attorneys have pledged to move forward with open marijuana possession cases and are still citing people.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent recently licensed marijuana stores from opening in their communities.
“All of this is changing so quickly that I don’t know what’s next,” said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, just east of Denver.
Regulators in Washington state are also mulling the matter.
And they continue to seek advice on establishing a production, manufacturing, distribution and sales licensing system – all before the deadline of 1 December 2013.
They say that, for better or worse, Colorado is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana use, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide,” said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions about what might work.
“There is no real precedent that serves as a model for us,” he says.
The Washington law, called I-502, goes into effect on December 6, which also leaves a year during which it will swim between two waters, since the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some sensitive mechanical issues that need to be resolved during that period, such as how to maintain a balance between the state’s requirement to offer “adequate access” to licensed marijuana and its prohibition from conducting cannabis business within a radius of less than 300 meters from schools, parks, children’s play areas or children’s centers.
“Nowhere will it be more difficult to locate a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the greater Seattle area,” says Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a newly created research group.
On November 21, Oates, the Aurora police chief, sent an email to his police officers informing them that the city prosecutor would stop pursuing legal action for minor misdemeanors for marijuana possession of people over the age of 21 and that police would stop bringing charges against those crimes “with immediate effect.”
Police Chief Oates said they would enforce the city’s rules governing the cultivation of marijuana for therapeutic purposes and would continue to pursue traffickers and drug dealers.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck represents a stricter view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to pursue marijuana possession cases, mainly to pressure consumers to decide to receive treatment.
Currently, 119 people are facing charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges.
“Our office has an obligation to bring legal action against those misdeeds that at the time occurred were a crime,” Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The response has been complicated even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana legalization initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the county’s largest city, no longer subpoena adults for possession of small amounts.
County District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the pending possession cases.
“I don’t think I’m wasting my time in continuing to enforce the law until it changes,” he said.
Even though 55 percent of voters supported the measure, bringing recreational marijuana use into the government and court system was never considered to be easy.
The contradictory reactions that arise throughout the state show a marked ambivalence among officials regarding the great environmental experiment in this state.
“This is a cultural barrier to district attorneys,” said Sean McAllister, a Denver attorney who represents marijuana possession defendants and is a local spokesman for the National Organization for Marijuana Law Reform.
“They’ve spent so much time taking people to court that, in reality, they still can’t accept that it’s legal,” he said.
Being the first states to consider small amounts of marijuana the same way it would be alcohol, Colorado and Washington are poised to become the national test cases for drug legalization.
While lawyers and state officials are counting on a new frontier of legal sales, they are also anxiously awaiting directions from the federal government, which still foresees the consideration of the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Proponents of legalizing marijuana are hopeful that the Justice Department will relent.
Although there have been some notable arrests of patients and sellers of marijuana for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has mostly allowed marijuana businesses to exist for these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
“While anti-drug agents are likely not going to pull down doors to confiscate a small bag of drugs, they will likely be reluctant to allow state-regulated stores to operate for the sale of marijuana for recreational use, allowed under the new law,” said Kevin A. Sabet, a former Obama administration anti-drug policy adviser.
Several Colorado cities are not waiting for federal authorities to act.
Even before Election Day, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new marijuana stores, even though it will be about a year before any of them can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and is likely to pass it next week.
“We don’t want to put ourselves in a situation where we authorize someone and then have a serious problem at the federal level,” said city council member Bob Nicholson.
“Our community voted against this amendment.
We're looking at what the community voted for versus what the state voted for."
A lot of questions come up about it.
Petronella Wyatt: ‘I was kicked out of Oxford for being a Tory’
College students aren’t attacked for their views just now
I don’t remember any time in my life when I hadn’t been dreaming of getting a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had been in what I assumed was the best place in the world to learn, a contemporary-era Greek symposium that fostered the two pillars of civilization: free thought and tolerance.
However, within two weeks of taking up my place at Worcester College in the late 1980s to pursue a career in History, I had already packed my bags, which triggered the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and burst into tears.
My friends were bewildered.
The Evening Standard claimed that I had dropped out because I couldn’t stand some college classmates having sex in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson jokingly announced that I was gone because I was forced to drink in peeled cups.
The truth was less fun.
I ran away from there.
Yes, I fled, because I had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my outlandish name, or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was harassed for only one reason, which in the cradle of the supposed illustration was somewhat intolerant and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the Conservative party.
You may wonder what that is all about now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of center-right students is suffering a similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of Conservative Party students in Oxford is such that, last week, a group of them claimed the same level of equal rights as homosexuals, the disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College say they are “often seriously set apart, personally attacked and treated as unwelcome people” for their political views.
They want to create a seat on their college’s equal opportunities committee to make sure they can express their opinions freely.
Their situation was not helped by a recent BBC2 documentary called “Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right” about student politics and featuring the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
It showed graduate student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Party Association (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, sporting a silver suit and a cane with the silver hilt.
At other universities, conservative students say they are being treated as “Turkish heads” by the introduction of higher tuition fees.
Luke Black, 20, a vice president of the University of Nottingham’s Conservative Party Association, said in a Sunday newspaper that “there is a growing left-wing trend in universities.
People assume we’re like the Bullingdon Club without even knowing each other.”
Samuel Roberts, a 21-year-old history student at Corpus Christi who filed the motion for greater protection, says this environment is “uncomfortable,” while Stephanie Cherill, 19, president-elect of the OUCA, says the attitude of JCR members toward people who are center-right has worsened.
“This poses a threat to the environment of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of members,” he says.
During my first few weeks at Oxford I was more lonely than one.
I entered college in September 1986, I was a terribly shy 18-year-old.
Hatred of the Conservative Party was at an all-time high.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, a former student, an "honoris causa" degree following cuts in higher education funding.
The atmosphere would have made any Stalinist shudder.
Already during the first days of the week of welcoming the new university students, when the new students meet and meet the professors, I received a sign of the bitterness that awaited me.
I found that professors not only turned a blind eye to the mockery of conservative college students, but willingly participated in it.
The miners’ strike policy, privatization and the government’s opposition to anti-apartheid sanctions in South Africa all made their way to the seminary’s wooden rooms.
The first one I attended had to be translated into English French texts of the eighteenth century and I was not prepared for what came next.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I didn't say one.
Pitt, a short man with a face that looked like cake dough, knew well how to expel bad bile.
“Do the Thatcherites refuse to learn French, or are they just fools?” he asked.
The other students laughed.
My eyes burned with the tears I was trying to hold back.
“I suggest you go to French classes in your spare time, as long as you’re not too busy meeting people,” growled Pitt.
I returned to my room as a soul in sorrow.
That night I sat alone at dinnertime in college; then I felt a slight pat on the back.
He was a second-year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of OUCA.
“I know who you are,” he said kindly.
"I'm afraid that's how it goes.
They mess with anyone suspected of being Tory.
For me it's very complicated, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so for you it will be even worse.
Many Tories newcomers appear to be Labour."
Later, in a local pub, I cowardly tried to hide.
I insisted that I disagreed with everything Mrs Thatcher said.
That trick proved useless.
A freshman in Philosophy, Politics and Economics who, paradoxically, had studied at Eton, said: “You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contaminated."
Other students adopted this song.
I became the dirty pervert.
"How do the Tories have sex?" one asked.
"They beat each other up, don't they?"
I felt the same way homosexuals should have felt before the liberal law of the 1960s.
Could he ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet people who thought like me only after dark?
Should I become a Labourer and repress my natural tendencies?
The three years that awaited me were presented as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory professor was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History for my college.
They hated her for being not only a Conservative, but also a foreign policy adviser to Thatcher and one of the people who wrote her speeches.
I was barely there.
He detested the place because he considered it provincial and insignificant and because of its adherence to the Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
“You’re not going to be happy here,” he told me.
I began to commute daily from Oxford to my parents’ house in London, finding refuge in my more open-minded family and friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he was studying there in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
“But it’s the best place in the world,” he said sadly.
“They would never do that, not there among my beloved dream needles.
Even my communist friends always had an impeccable attitude.”
His sore eyes began to cloud.
“Give it another chance.
I'm sure they did it just to joke.
It would break my heart if I left it.”
Exhausted from so many trips to London, my emotional resilience was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who was also a supporter of the Conservative Party, had succumbed to pressure and renounced his creed.
The following week, during a seminar where another History professor had insinuated, quite seriously, that I was an “enemy of the people,” I decided to do the same.
Red with shame on the inside, I admitted that my parents had “brainwashed” me and called them “stupid old men.”
The truce lasted a short time.
It was my father who put the last nail in the coffin of my college career at Oxford.
At that time my father wrote two weekly columns in Murdoch’s press.
My door was locked.
I was inside huddled in fear and, after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left I packed my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
Maybe you call me weak weeping.
But no 18-year-old should be subjected to such a level of bullying and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only trained 14 Prime Ministers of the Conservative Party but, today, hides behind an undeserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Sewing", which opened this week in London, ABC talks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian designer
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized him during the inauguration of "Valentino: Master of Sewing", an apotheotic retrospective that brings together more than 130 couture dresses created by his "maison" during the last 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the rarefied and distant world of nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, private letters and photos abound with the signature of the most pomegranate of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from humble couturier from the city of Voghera in northern Italy, to idol of the international jet-set.
There's nothing wrong with being in love with royalty.
“At least they don’t put out their cigarette butts on your gorgeous rug like some beautiful pop music celebrities do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and entertains with generosity and elegance.
“We all loved being invited to his chalet in Gstaad,” explains the ex-wife of “Heini” Thyssen, intimate of forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the charisma of the couturier.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the floor, the decoration, the food, the music, in everything its spirit was seen and felt.
“He made each of us feel important and loved,” recalls the “top model,” who began working with him during Haute Couture Week in Paris in 1995.
“It never goes out of style because their designs are works of art,” he says.
Alcurnia Parade
Garavani’s life is not a story of obsessions, but of well-requited loves.
He loves people with good education and better degrees, and they love him.
One of Somerset House’s galleries has been transformed into a glamorous 60-metre-long catwalk that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must walk the catwalk to contemplate a dreamy “audience” that wears masterpieces by Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for his wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the wardrobe that Monica Vitti used in “La Notrea”, or a coat that she wore.
In that audience of mannequins shine names such as Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the couturier, in 2006
Many of those clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "impossible to forget".
I remember perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a vest "gillette" and a jacket of the autumn-winter 1971-1972 collection.
“It was a gift he gave me,” says Naty Abascal, one of the designer’s muses.
“I prefer him over others because of his femininity, because of his great love for women, because he enhances our beauty,” adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I really like the colors he uses, they have great light and are "donors" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion prescriber Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg also can't forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager living in Italy, I dreamed of getting the age and the chance to be able to wear one of their evening suits...
It was finally time in the late 90s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear at a party at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red suit, with ruffled skirt, draped "corsage" and strapless neckline.
“It was a dream come true,” says Rodrigo d’Arenberg’s widow.
“Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is timeless,” explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her dressmaker's party dresses with "the utmost care ... because a dress is not only a dress, it is also the set of memories that it entails".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller’s wedding dress at her wedding to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "racazzes" (as the dressmaker calls his seamstresses) to make that ivory-colored silk suit inlaid with pearls, twelve different types of lace and a tail of four and a half meters.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a milestone of haute couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return of the clients of high society."
Obfuscated for years with the "savoir-o'tre" of the elite, Valentino is now his best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest ranking distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any of the spouses of his clients.
“I’ve always been struck by its refinement, its calmness, its neat and perfect look,” D’Arenberg acknowledges.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
"He was impeccable, the time does not pass for him."
If a princess says so...
The Hardest Craft in the World: The Human Mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the Indonesian volcano’s porters risk their lives and health carrying 70 kilos of sulfur through steep stone paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who make a living by extracting sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, it has to descend every day to the bottom of its crater, where the sulfurous gas that emanates from the bowels of the Earth solidifies when it comes in contact with the air.
After pulling large sulfur rocks, which in total weigh about 70 kilos, he carries them in two bamboo baskets that he carries on his shoulders through steep stone paths.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters in altitude, but the exhausted porters take more than 40 minutes to ascend at a turtle pace, keeping the balance and measuring their steps carefully so as not to slip and fall down the cliff.
They know that any mishap could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who fell off the cliffs of Kawah Ijen years ago.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents for every kilo of sulfur they extract
Once up, they make their way among the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus monkeys and, wearisomely carrying the heavy baskets, walk three kilometers to the scale that a mining company has placed a little lower, at 1,850 meters of height.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been exploiting the volcano since 1960 and, never better said, its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents of euro) for each kilo of sulfur.
He then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, since this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to whiten sugar.
“As is normal to carry 70 kilos, we take out about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip,” explains Anto, who usually carries out three daily shipments.
It takes three hours in each and ends up grinding, but they allow you to collect 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a pittance for such an inhuman effort, it is three times what he would earn on the field.
“The miners’ day is very high here, where coffee collection is paid at 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros),” clarifies the porter, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the cut was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a town near the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as forceful as sulfur: "I married a young woman from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have brought her to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathes hard, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases
At 27 years old, Anto has been playing hide in the Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already begun to take its toll despite covering his face with a mask and special glasses.
He has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases emitted by the volcano.
It’s the price you have to pay to achieve your dream.
"I will work two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punished for life, this friendly and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, waiter or hotel receptionist, but instead he does the work of a mule.
Sharing an filthy wooden cabin with other porters, he gets up every day at two in the morning because the sulfur does not stop flowing at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the middle of the darkness.
Challenging the shadows, Anto descends into the crater with a small lantern attached to his helmet, which he has bought himself with his money.
About 400 porters carry sulfur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its great profits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulfur to save costs or provide any equipment to the porters, who work on their own and at both weight.
In fact, they do not even see part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) surcharge per camera that, together with the entry of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
“This work is for the beasts and not for the people,” protests Madrusin, a burly 42-year-old porter who has been at Kawah Ijen for three decades, since he left school.
Able to lift up to 110 kilos, he says he will endure working “as much as he can” because he needs the money to educate his three children, between 18 and 10 years old.
I won't retire, I'll die here because the volcano has been my whole life.
Although sulfur burns the throat and stings the eyes when the wind suddenly changes and traps the miners in the thick columns that come out of the volcano, they are so hard that none complain of suffering serious diseases ... beyond, of course, of their usual respiratory problems, osteoarthritis, pains in the knees and sores on the shoulders, which have been malformed by the weight of the baskets.
Swinging the basket on his back, Unainik can only carry 50 kilos at the age of 53.
Each day, he and his companions pluck 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away by a goat path in the undergrowth.
“I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life,” proclaims Unainik opening his mouth well, where he is missing several teeth.
Of his five children, the oldest, 30, also works on sulfur.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the toughest trades in the world: the one made by the human mules of Kawah Ijen.
Singapore seeks babies to save economy
Singaporeans blame career, stress and the cost of property and education for not having children.
"Singapore's population needs to grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife, we do our civic duty and we create life!
It may seem implausible that these verses are part of a peppermint pill ad, but despite that – or perhaps because of that – the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references such as "Let's put a bao in the oven" to laugh at Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, hopes that with the announcement they will be able to draw attention to the problem in a fun way.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to do “their national duty.”
This is purely an internet thing, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we felt this was an issue we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as throwing perfumes with pheromones or organizing speed-dating evenings.
Many of those ideas may have been creative, but they didn’t necessarily work.
So we thought, why don’t we do as creatively as possible to solve this problem, which is to compose a rap?
1.2 children
The one who doesn’t take it so lightly is the Singaporean government.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriages and parents gives up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for its leaders’ conservatism and strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, according to its national population division, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2 – known as the replacement rate – was in 1976.
So why don’t Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policy for the National Population Division, says it’s because of “better education” and “a wider range of career opportunities.”
“That has allowed people to have a wider range of choices in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond getting married and raising a family,” she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to increased singleness, and delayed marriage and births, resulting in a declining birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy that aims to dramatically increase immigration to cope with the population decline has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that abound with barely disguised xenophobia against many new immigrants, particularly Chinese, whom they criticize for keeping wages low and not integrating.
Rising immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why Singapore’s ruling party last year experienced its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with higher quotas and levies for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the drop in the birth rate has known effects on a nation’s economic growth, tax revenues, healthcare costs and immigration policies, Singapore’s example is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has gone on to control the number of small apartments, known as “shoeboxes,” that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and have been very successful in sales.
However, there are concerns that they may promote a singleness lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large, family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of real estate firm EL Developers, says his “shoeboxes” sell much faster than larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that units sell out days, even weeks, faster than larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new rules give clearer guidance for developers, who were previously hampered if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a state city.
While these new rules may be a step toward increasing the national birth rate, talking to Singaporeans working in the downtown financial district seems like they won’t have much effect.
“People are very stressed, houses are expensive and so is education, so many people are putting it off,” says one young executive.
Other people may have children.
“But for me it’s important to have my own money and time,” says another young man in his 20s.
Men and women cite their careers, stress, and the cost of property and education as the reasons that keep them from having children.
So, as much as the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, Singaporeans have the last word.
Offline is private on line
Privacy.
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy it is about the quality of private or "the scope of private life that you have the right to protect from any intrusion".
What is private for a child under 16?
How do you apply this definition in your everyday life and on social media?
Do you understand the dangers you’re exposed to from venting situations on the Internet that you probably wouldn’t share offline?
elPeriódico interviewed five boys between 10 and 15 years old, frequent users of the network.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with "something very mine", on a personal level, and "in the user's password and name", when they applied it to social networks.
“My deepest secrets I wouldn’t upload to a post,” says Jorge, 10, as he tries to explain the meaning of private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
“They’re very secretive secrets, my mom may know them, but not everyone,” she says.
In FB I upload pretty images or games.
I also entertain with my acquaintances.
“I wouldn’t share a photo that’s not mine, or someone who’s making a fool of themselves,” he says.
The child acknowledges that it is wrong to post obscene photographs, of naked people, of crimes or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge claims to know the 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother is included, has the key to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
“I don’t know if they answer me, I just upload them,” he adds.
“Social media is entertaining, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly,” he says.
He does not hesitate to answer that he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
I wouldn't even listen to someone recommending you to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
The teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in the latter admits not to know 20 of the people added to his list of friends.
“It doesn’t scare me, because we have something in common, music for example,” he says.
According to the boy, no one has been insinuated or asked for his home address or phone number.
“If they pressured me or demanded it, I simply take them out of my account,” he said.
Jose became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to the experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying.
An acquaintance of a friend of mine was being extorted on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who he was," she says.
The victim, according to Jose, did not close the account.
“It just gave him privacy.”
It then explains a series of steps to set up the account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this guy would upload photos of acquaintances in awkward or embarrassing situations.
I would, if I don't like it or feel like it.
“Although I know that’s cyberbullying,” he says.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, an English teacher with a degree in Education and Learning, believes that to guide children and adolescents, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
“The Internet emerged as a means of searching for information, but with the emergence of these sites the rules of the game changed,” he says.
Porras points out that the academic Marc Prensky, master in Pedagogy from Yale University and author of the work Natives and Digital Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are they, the children and young people who were born with technology.
“We’re the digital immigrants that we have to teach them, when we’re still learning,” he says.
He comments that the issue is complex, “because we are asking them to have a definite criterion about what is convenient or not to disseminate, publish or say at an age that maturity does not give for that.”
“Also, let them be selective when what matters most to them is being popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences.”
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach privacy to children and adolescents is through questions that make them reflect.
“Telling them not to do it doesn’t help,” he adds.
Next, Porras lists a few options: There are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like them to post a photo of you like the one you posted from a friend?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
When you tag party photos, did you ask other people’s permission to tag them?
And one more, do everyone need to know what you’re doing every moment?
Another point is to make them see that they must act online as they do offline.
It's the same rules.
“One outside of the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, the same should be in social networks,” he says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary school teacher and educational consultant, says it is essential that parents read social media policies thoroughly.
By understanding each of the subsections they have solid grounds to talk with their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
“For example, age and what is allowed to share or post,” he says.
According to Guardia, it is key to remind children of the lesson of "don't talk to strangers."
Unasur Summit ends without making public the Lima Declaration
The Sixth Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (UNASUR) concluded today in Peru without making public the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven attending leaders.
Efe repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the VI Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Unasur, but sources of Foreign Ministry and Presidency initially indicated that they were going to deliver it after the closure, but later said that at some point it will be published on the website of the Peruvian Government.
When consulted by the text, they pointed out that the content had been exposed by the president of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during a brief statement to the press.
Journalists’ access to Summit information was restricted at all times.
During the day only the soundless video of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, restricted audio" was broadcast in the press room.
The little information that circulated among the reporters was delivered by the press spokespeople of some of the governments of the Unasur attending the meeting, although not the Peruvian.
The only document released during the day was the list of attending presidents, which caused the discomfort of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who requested greater data.
Subsequently, the Presidency of Peru sent an email to the media with the “final declaration” of the summit, but it is Humala’s pronouncement, and not the official document that closed the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of South America-Arab Countries (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite being insistently requested by the press, the so-called Lima Declaration that they had previously announced was also not disseminated.
On the official ASPA website it can be corroborated that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international events, Peruvian authorities made efforts to ensure that transmission systems were in place for all journalists but limited information to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a ruling by the Court of The Hague that settles a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and ratified that they will respect the decision of the (ICJ), which begins on Monday in The Hague to listen to the allegations of both parties, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago.
“We will abide by and execute the judgment that defines the differences that we are bringing to this international court today,” Humala said, along with his Chilean counterpart.
“Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country that respects international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international tribunals,” Piñera added, and greeted Humala with a handshake, alongside the two countries’ flags.
The confirmation of both presidents that they will submit to the ICJ came after Colombia denounced this week the Pact of Bogotá by which it had agreed to submit to the rulings of that international tribunal, after a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua that it considered seriously wrong.
The summit was held with the absences of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the ouster of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was in charge of opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit, shortly after noon in Lima.
The president read the final document in which he reported that 16 agreements were adopted and the lines of action were set for 31 projects between the South American countries for a total of 17 billion dollars in investments.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the countries of UNASUR will take "important steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship for which we are expanding the agreements on residence."
He reported that actions are being promoted to improve “cooperation in the fight against citizen insecurity and transnational organized crime, actions to make medicines more accessible, low-cost internet access in all corners of South America, and jointly and efficiently address the risks of natural disasters.”
With Europe in crisis, “the economic consolidation (of Latin America) must not have a triumphalist matrix but must serve to expand our productive matrix and envision a better future for our peoples,” Humala added.
"We have decided to privilege a group of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the connection of the spaces of South America, especially in rural areas and borders ... uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits," the Peruvian president said in a message read.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located in the transverse axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not give more details.
The final document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve for his reinstatement to the Union of South American Nations,” from which he is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and good relations between neighbors, was another of the issues highlighted by the summit.
In this regard, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting his participation in the regional meeting that he expected to meet with his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to treat in a respectful way the maritime dispute after a ruling of the ICJ, questioned by Bogotá.
“Tomorrow (Saturday) you may have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega,” Santos said.
“We are going to review all these roads, they are not exclusive, even the treaty with Nicaragua is going to require a conversation with Nicaragua,” he stressed.
“With President Ortega, I hope to be able to tell him that we handle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible,” Santos said.
Santos and Ortega will meet Saturday in Mexico where they plan to attend the inauguration of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit, the bloc’s defense ministers met earlier to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defense in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the last country is suspended.
Peru holds the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenry": Rafael Correa
Ecuador’s President Rafael Correa said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which “South America, in this case, must learn from Europe.”
Correa, who participated in the VI Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, told state TV Peru that Europeans “were killed in World War II” and other conflicts, “but now they are practically a homeland.”
He defended, in that sense, the project to establish South American citizenship encouraged by the member countries of Unasur.
"We must achieve the free mobility of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case with the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to return us to the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian president was also in favor of the recomposition of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San José pact on human rights.
Those who give chairs never commit to anything and, instead, we South Americans sign everything.
“It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under US funding,” he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa said he did not regret that decision because it did not betray his principles, but respected his “profound democratic and human rights values.”
He added that, at the time, “there were well-founded suspicions that Assange was extradited to a third country and that his process was not respected.”
He also criticized the Swedish justice system for requiring him to submit to interrogation on its territory for an alleged sex crime when “Sweden’s own legislation allows it to be done by videoconference, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London.”
Correa said there is a risk that Assange’s physical and mental health will deteriorate.
“I haven’t spoken to him since he’s been in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious,” the Ecuadorian president said.
What there is is the danger that your physical and mental health will deteriorate by being locked in a small space without being able to exercise outdoors.
“That complicates anyone’s health,” he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, by granting a safe conduct that allows him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European legal authorities and stressed that there have been talks with London in search of a solution to the confinement of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been permanent talks.
“The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because Assange’s lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is doing a series of procedures in different European instances,” he said.
He added: "If Britain gives the safe-conduct tomorrow, it's over."
And if Sweden, as its legislation perfectly allows and as it has done in other cases, interrogates Mr Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy in London or interrogates him via Skype tomorrow, this problem will end.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm himself as an advocate of freedom of the press and qualified that what he does not tolerate is “mediocrity, bad faith and lies, which undermine freedom of expression.”
“The biggest enemies of press freedom are not evil and perverse politicians but bad journalists on the basis of profit, blackmail and extortion,” he said.
In this regard he congratulated that these journalists are no longer "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador", and advanced that if reelected "it will deepen in the revolution to continue the path and the right direction".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto of Paraguay in the UNASUR at least until its next elections, arguing that the body "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and coup dressed with legality" because in reality "it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy."
The Ecuadorian president also considered "perfectly pertinent" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to now negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between both countries after the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which benefited Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, that failure is not being complied with.
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American one.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
You have to process them broadly to overcome them and move on.
He also trusted in a good conclusion of the litigation for maritime limits that Peru and Chile maintain in the same court and opined that "it is correct for Latin America to seek international instances if the two countries commit to accept judgment no matter how hard it is."
Referring to the eventuality that he will stand as a candidate in the next presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term, he said that he sees that possibility “with a lot of optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite hard.”
Correa said that if he loses the February 2013 elections, he will withdraw from public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unfair as Ecuador’s, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
“My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed that probable victory, because we have to accept that responsibility,” he said.
If we win it would be my last term in the presidency and from there we come out of public life.
If we lose anyway.
“It’s a decision,” he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he tells me that he traveled to a treatment that was already planned, routine, that was expected to pass the campaign to return to Cuba.
“It does not mean a relapse in the state of health of President Chávez,” he said.
The Ecuadorian head of state participated today in Lima in the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) that concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths now cause late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when the test result was confirmed: AIDS positive.
“It was like I dropped a bomb,” he says, recalling the moment of the announcement, which the doctor was trying to make “softer,” without evident success.
The boy hid it from his family.
He decided to take care only of his illness and began to learn about it; with such an effort that he already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV Unit of the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), which he arrived at in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 90s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him “because he had a cut.”
So, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive this syndrome and do it with quality of life.
However, ignorant of their illness, many people still arrive when the virus has already wreaked havoc, “exhausted” their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, at least of the first reported cases, "the great achievement means at this time that the survival of a patient who initiates treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population, is exactly the same," said the head of the HIV Unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after reporting that this information was endorsed in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectologist and expert on HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of impairment to the immune system that patients present at the beginning of the diagnosis, with better expectation for those who are not drug users: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years, when they report 500 CD4.
In simple words, this means that those who are diagnosed with HIV positive at 25 years of age, under these terms “as long as they remain in control, they will be able to live without problems until 75 years of age,” explained the interviewee.
To measure this progress, it should be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
While mortality has dropped significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS fell from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone 255 people died in 2011, and there are 187 deaths until May of this year; however, it is ensured that there is universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there still deaths?
It seems to me that the problem is not access to treatment.
That’s how I see it, that’s how it happened to us in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have not had shortage of medicine the problem is that patients arrive very advanced because they do not know their state of infection, that is, in late stages of the disease.
Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, what has to be done to have a greater impact on global mortality is to make earlier diagnoses and, therefore, have to offer screening tests in a massive way, to all people who require it.
His proposal coincides specialists and officials of the State Council for AIDS Prevention in Jalisco (Coesida), also the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who went to be tested in a particular laboratory, only motivated because a friend had done it and, despite his young age, he was already in the AIDS stage and even suffered Kaposi sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they’re going to die and don’t want to know anything.
“If I’m already going to die, I’d better break out three times a week,” they say not in my case.
The change was to get better, I eat well, I exercise, I take medications.
To date, his parents only know that he suffered from cancer.
I live a normal life, just like anyone else.
“I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but I share responsibility, I take care of myself and the other person,” said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate with his testimony those who today, in the framework of World AIDS Day, are afraid.
Get tested, if they were at risk, the sooner they know if they are HIV positive, the better and if they already have the diagnosis, they learn that they can live like anyone, being responsible.
That, his message, sums up the battle slogan for AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There are big gaps between health programs and ordinary citizens, said Ricardo Salazar, a Tapatío journalist who has taken up the cause around HIV.
The biggest one is prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task "the distribution of condoms has effectively increased, before they gave us one or two, now they give us packages of a hundred, and that is very good but it turns out that there are those today, still, do not have access to a condom," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"What do you want them for?" is a common question, with slurs and judgments of social workers, school counselors, pharmacy employees and health personnel, to which adolescents do not want to be exposed, said the communicator.
He proposed to reorient this ineffective distribution; that the condoms are not only behind the counters and that those one hundred are in public bathroom dispatchers of the places that young people frequent.
It’s not about encouraging promiscuity.
Nor is it about paying for their cellas and the motel, as Gov. Emilio González responded, when asked if there would be condom distribution in his administration.
"That's not sexuality, it's best to bring condoms closer to those who already practice sexual activity," he said.
Keys in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state ranks 4th nationally in new and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th in HIV.
92% of infections correspond to the sexual route, 6% to the blood route and 2% to the perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50 thousand people may be living with HIV since for a registered case there are 4 to 5 people who do not know it.
Ratified by a U.S. appeals court in a ruling that ignores the restructuring of Grupo Vitro’s debt achieved through a commercial tender in Mexico, the scenario sets a disastrous precedent for any national company with ramifications in the neighboring country that has solvency problems.
It would be said, therefore, that the procedures in guarantee of survival of the signatures that allow the Mexican laws are not valid in the country of the bars and the stars, contrary to international conventions.
On the practical level, the accolade of the sentence issued on June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the northern district of Texas, leaves Mexican firms defenseless against the possibility of garnishment of their properties in beyond the Bravo.
However, the ruling opens the door for Mexico’s top glassmaker to go to the U.S. Supreme Court, alleging three inconsistencies.
For starters, while the judge in the case notes that creditors must be governed by U.S. Bankruptcy Law, the New Orleans-based Fifth Circuit appeals court says the main proceeding is bankruptcy in Mexico.
The first point would involve ignoring international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Trade Law was created to that end, with the American Law Institute serving as the arbiter.
Secondly, the judgment establishes that without the intercompany vote, recognized in the critical mass of the commercial competition the debts that the subsidiaries of Vitro had with their parent company, the majority required to approve the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, the possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro’s was not the first case in which the scheme was accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts were endorsed by the Federal Institute of Commercial Competitions.
The truth, moreover, is that subtracting the votes of the subsidiaries, anyway the creditors of Vitro who fought against it in the United States Courts, that is to say the “vulture” funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent to 37.
The data is omitted by the Court of Appeals.
From another angle, this blames Vitro of the difficult situation that he faced from 2008 to beyond the serious economic crisis that the United States faced, hitting the neck of the country.
For now, the González Sada family firm will file an appeal for reconsideration before the appeals court itself so that the vote reaches the plenary of the court, that is, the five magistrates, given that only three voted.
If this does not succeed, Cerciorare’s appeal will be requested, which requires the review of the process by a higher instance, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
What is serious about the case is that the court ignored a document sent by the government of Mexico under the figure of amicus curiae (“friend of the Court”), which details the procedure followed by Vitro under the framework of the Commercial Competitions Act, noting that it was released in accordance with the agreements signed by both countries to tie it with chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Law of the United States.
Moreover, it is noted that the country subscribed to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules set for cross-border insolvency, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Two-banded carambola: they hit Vitro and they hit the country.
General balance sheet
For several months the complaints placed on the table by the unions of Mexicana de Aviación against the former owner of the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, the Trade Union Association of Aviators has already found the bottleneck.
The court headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a criminal lawsuit against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
Accordingly, the supervisory authority has consistently refused to report to the Attorney General’s Office on an operation carried out by the businessman to extract 198 million pesos from Banco IXE’s F/589 trust on behalf of Mexicana de Aviación.
The resources would have been channeled to the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Administrator.
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Close to the Dragon Mart
Gathered over the weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and members of civil society in general approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, of a colossal center of sale and distribution facing Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products of the country of the wall, with a zone of housing to fit employees of 150 companies.
Previously the Canacintra had managed to unify the governors of the southeast area to oppose the monumental thing that destroyed part of the protected areas and raises the mother of all threats against the industry.
The Act died.
The government has ignored a Senate requirement to explain under what terms and circumstances Mexico’s ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property.
As you know, the action occurred despite the fact that the Senate itself had disqualified the possibility by considering it an attack on freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex for the long term
In an effort to pay long-term debts without affecting short-term ones, the housing developer Homex is placing Stock Certificates on the market for 500 million pesos.
The issue is the first of four identical ones that offer to pay interest every 28 days.
Competival is born
Integrated by the companies NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, leaders in information technology, a consortium has just been born with the social name Competival, whose objective will be the services market of the software clusters of Central and South America.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball has been my life"
Basketball globetrotters Hector "Hetin" Reyes was more than 60 years linked to the sport of tabloncillo and, thanks to him, traveled the entire world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental recollection of local basketball history as broad as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
And is that before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, whether as a player of minor categories, player of the National Superior Basketball, proxy and leader in the BSN with the Bayamón Cowboys or president of the Basketball Federation.
“I put a lot of hats on basketball throughout my life, including several at once, such as when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and president of the federation during the 90s,” Reyes recalled during a First Hour visit to his home in Bayamon, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife of more than 50 years.
“Basketball has been my life.”
Reyes does not exaggerate in making that assertion.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilia that denote his extensive career, attest to this.
Bayamon in the heart
Of all, the ones he treasures with the most emotion are those that recall his time with the Cowboys from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he turned 15 years old serving as a co-operator or proxy of the franchise.
“Those were my best years, the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Cowboys championships since 1967, whether as an attorney, co-manager or manager.
It was many years of satisfaction, including the five championships run from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, Jerome Mincy’s debut year on the BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" Ortiz took over, who was a great administrator," Reyes said.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had run here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), telling me, "I have a very strong player, 6"7" tall.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended sniper Raymond Gausse, who was nativized and was one of our best shooters.
I remember him saying that if Mincy had given Bayamon a championship, Gausse would help bring another one.
The Cowboys championship with Gausse was enjoyed, but already at a distance, because by 1988 it was already more federal.
At that time he preferred to enjoy his executions and those of Mincy in the National Team.
I remember when we first beat the United States during the 1989 Pre-Olympic in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we came fourth and it should have been bronze if not for that Canadian referee who made us repeat the final play a second time, Reyes said.
Is that group from the 1990 World Cup the best National Team you've ever seen?
He is among the best, just like the one that beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the Pan American in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave a fight to the team of the United States, which was quite similar to the one that won us the bronze in the World Cup.
That team not only repeated Mincy, Guasse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculin" (Ortiz), but also had (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter young, the Leon brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quixote" Morales, who had not been able to be in the 90 due to a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personnel, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was that of the 1995 Pre-Olympic in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and a junior Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the players suspended for the mess of the Panamericano de Mar del Plata, we won gold against all odds.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, that has been Piculín Ortiz.
Their numbers at the international tournament level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at that level like Piculín did.
And that’s not to mention his career in the different leagues he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
That's very difficult.
We have had a very good litter that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
For young people, I really like Leo Arill’s work.
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation?
To have been part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that at the beginning of the 90s the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What was left for you to do?
There were things I would have wanted to implement, such as the regionalization of the smaller categories.
For example, Ponce’s boys will only play in their area and will only face teams from other corners of the Island in the national playoffs.
Right now children travel and play too much unnecessarily.
At least I see the fruit of the compulsory certifications and course for leaders, officers and referees.
That pleases me.
What are you doing now?
The most I do is listen to music, watch music videos of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman has died.
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became world famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R.", in the television series "Dallas", in which he played an unscrupulous, malicious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the predatory oil tycoon J.R. Ewing on the television series “Dallas” became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas," died Friday afternoon of complications from cancer, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by "Dallas" producer Warner Bros.
“Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, once again playing the iconic role he loved the most,” the family said.
Larry’s family and closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played his wife in the original series and sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, her publicist Jeffrey Lane said.
It brought joy to everyone I knew.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him dearly.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and acknowledged that he had drunk heavily for years.
In 1995 he was found to have a malignant tumor in his liver and underwent a transplant.
Years before "Dallas," Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie," broadcast on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is altered when he finds an attractive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to live with him at home.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included well-received critical roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful portrayal of the charmingly detestable J.R. that led Hagman to his ultimate stardom.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "Who shot J.R.?", intended to generate anticipation around an emotionally charged episode in which Hagman's character is nearly killed, sparked international speculation and millions of risky dollars in bookmakers.
It also helped give the series an audience record at the time.
When the response was revealed in a November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million viewers tuned in and made "Dallas" the second most-watched entertainment show in history, behind the 1983 "MASH" finale, which had 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. pregnant her and then threatened to brand her a prostitute unless she left town, but others also had reason to attack him.
Hagman portrayed Ewing as an insatiable corrupt man with a charismatic smile: a cheating businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), interned.
“I know what I want on J.R.’s gravestone,” Hagman said in 1988.
It should say, "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only deal he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, on Friday remembered Hagman as someone "huge, on and off the screen."
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of each of us, who were lucky enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success for the TNT channel.
He had already finished recording five of the episodes for the second season and a sixth was in the works, the network reported.
There was no immediate statement from Warner or TNT on how the series will handle Hagman’s loss.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in such classics as “South Pacific” and “Peter Pan.”
Martin was still a teenager when she had him in 1931 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the stage in New York in the early 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While there he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001 he titled his memoir "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
“I didn’t put anything there that I thought was going to hurt someone or affect them in any way,” he told the Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplant he became a promoter of organ donation and volunteered at a hospital to assist fearful patients.
“I advise them, I give them courage, I meet with them when they come for their surgeries, and then,” he said in 1996.
I try to offer some comfort, like “don’t be afraid, it’ll be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but they’ll be fine.”
She was also an anti-smoking activist and participated in several campaigns.
Course exploring the "End of the World"
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to teach a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible hook: The end of the “long countdown” of the Mayan Calendar, on December 21, to which many people have clung as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea what awaited her in the next couple of months: Cataclysmic Hurricane Sandy, a fiscal cliff some have called “deudarmageddon,” and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where end-time Christian theorists believe the Apocalypse will begin.
“I didn’t realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester there has ever been,” Charmé told Rutgers-Camden University students this week.
If you analyze what has been happening in the world today as if we were 30 days away and counting, this has been a really good period.
And remember that bad is good for those with an apocalyptic mindset.
And he’s not the only teacher offering courses on the “end of the world” this semester, theoretically the last in history.
At Temple, adjunct professor Barry Vacker is teaching the course “Media, Culture and the End of the World.”
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
“We looked at why these ideas proliferate over time,” he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, war could break out.
This month, students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and explored how they compare to real-life examples.
“I’ve tried to inform students about what’s possible, probable, credible and impossible,” Vacker said.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Latin American History Professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an adjunct professor of Art History and Anthropology, have teamed up to teach a course, titled “The End of the World.”
"We don't add '2012' to always have the option to teach the course again, in case the world doesn't end," Restall said.
Despite the “imminent ruin,” students must study, generate projects, and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to work “until the very night the world is supposed to end,” Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
“It was saturated in two hours,” Restall said of his course for high-average students, which was filled with 35 students.
We received emails for weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, from people asking if there was still room.
Students, on the other hand, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves,” said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old career student in Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
The apocalyptic mentality, secular or religious, is only a matter of consolation or the absence of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing major student, said he’s seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"I've never heard of a class that could teach that," he said.
I enjoy it.
But no student interviewed - let alone a teacher - said they believed in the Dec. 21 expiration date.
“Our first project was about Mayan prophecy and we kind of discredited it,” said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old senior at Temple in West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world; it’s just a key point on the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, going back several centuries, that people react to changes around them by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a rise in these speculations.
“People elsewhere don’t think about this,” he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a religion professor at La Salle University who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew about any “end of the world” courses there.
“The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world,” he wrote, hinting at an exception from a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years there has been talk of many doomsdays, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately begin to think about the next date" or to philosophize that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly.
Several said they plan to go to "end of the world" parties.
“Maybe I’ll call some friends to laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
