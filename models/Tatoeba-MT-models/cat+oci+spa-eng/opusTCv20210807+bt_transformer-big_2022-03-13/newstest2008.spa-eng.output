European Inflation Sliding into Food
Accelerated inflation in the euro area is primarily due to skyrocketing food price growth.
The increase in prices in the month of November has been higher than expected in the 13 countries of the euro area, registering - after 2.6 percent of the month of October - an annual inflation of 3.1 percent - announced the Union Statistical Office based in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts gave a likely 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the American, British and Canadian issuing banks, did not cut the basic interest, on the pretext that the decrease, together with the rising prices of raw materials and the reduction of forced unemployment, would cause a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but at least close to, two percent.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in trap 22: “we have to negotiate” on inflation so that it does not have to intervene on this issue later.
Inflation of 3.3 percent, registered in Germany, broke the 12-year record; while in Spain it rose from 3.6 percent to 4.1 percent.
Inflation soared in the euro area as a result of soaring food and energy prices.
Wheat forward quotations increased by 88 percent and soya prices also reached their highest level since 1973.
Similarly, much more had to be paid in 2007 for vegetable oil and dairy products.
The price of crude oil in the world market increased this year by 52 percent, reaching already last month black gold almost 100 dollars a barrel.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will jump from the current 2.1 percent to 2.5 percent, while in 2009 it will already decrease to 1.9 percent.
According to analysts, annual inflation will remain in the next 3 or 4 months around 3 percent, however the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to cut interest rates twice in 2008.
Gallup predicts a government crisis
After a long stalemate, by early December the support of the Alliance of Young Democrats increased significantly, reaching its highest level since 2002, while the Gallup never before experienced such a low level - 13 percent - in the case of the socialists.
The difference in the case of the confident voters of the parties - due to the greater firmness of the voters of the opposition - would mean a support of more than two-thirds (71%) against the support of one-fifth for the socialists (20%).
According to the poll, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats would not reach even the limit necessary to have any parliamentary seat: their support within the entire population is two percent.
Among the secure voters there are one percent more sympathizers on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even compared to the previous low point – the proportion of those who judged the country’s economic situation especially bad has never been higher, with 41 percent believing the situation to be quite bad.
Families, after the most hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimistic about changing their own economic situation.
As far as the next year is concerned, the majority of the population is counting on the deterioration of the situation and only a tenth expect an improvement.
In December, 71 percent of those polled, higher than any previous Gallup poll, estimated that the president of the government performs rather poorly than well in his duties.
13 percent of those consulted trust or trust Ferenc Gyurcsány a lot, while Viktor Orbán has the support of 38 percent of those consulted.
Fifty-four percent of the population does not trust the head of government at all and 27 percent do not trust the president of the Young Democrats Alliance.
One of the indicators of the configuration of the political situation is that, what proportion of society thinks that it is possible to control the discontent experienced in front of the person of the Head of Government without a change of government.
While after the riots in October last year, 35 percent thought it would be desirable to keep the government and the head of government in power, today this proportion is only 20 percent, while the relative majority (33 percent) believes that holding new elections is the only solution.
Interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 percent of respondents to the question on participation answered that they would surely participate and another 20 percent said that they are likely to participate.
By way of comparison, in "a general election to be held this Sunday" only 55 percent of the population would surely participate and another 15 percent believe their participation is likely. Based on the current intentions of the voters there is no doubt of the result of the popular consultation.
74 percent of the population would disapprove of the payment of study fees, 79 percent of the medical consultation service and 84 percent of hospital care.
If we look at these proportions only among the confident participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would reject the introduction of study rights, payment for medical consultations and hospital care.
The most expensive is the Auchan, the Tesco has quintupled its prices
They maintained the average price level increase of 16 percent in the hypermarkets of the golden trading triangle of Budaers, with the difference that this year the VAT has not been increased.
Article by Napi Gazdaság
This year also increased by an average of 16 percent in the golden commercial triangle of Budaers the usual Christmas basket of the Napi newspaper, but in all hypermarkets there was a growth well above one thousand HUF.
As prices in food supermarkets had already "fired" in December last year, so there was not a drastic percentage increase compared to the high starting point.
However, it is obviously frightening for consumers that what they were able to buy last year at a price well below nine thousand HUF, today they cannot even do it for ten thousand.
The Napi basket in the hypermarkets studied exceeded with a minimum of 91 HUF the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF.
And the highest value basket was 10,573 HUF.
(In 2003 that basket cost 6800 HUF.)
The price of Unicum liquor and fish remained almost at the previous year’s level, but there was a sharp increase in turkey breast fillet, walnut and poppy seed.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed the data of the Central Statistical Office, although in the Auchan we have also found a kilo of bread for the price of 139 HUF.
The competition did not reduce the price of the product to less than 200 HUF.
It was also surprising in this store that the price of Coca-Cola with a two-liter redeemable bottle cost less than 200 HUF, so that this product, even with the price of the bottle, cost only 257 HUF.
All in all, Napi Auchan’s basket was the most expensive, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, with respect to Christmas prices last year, Cora increased by 15 percent, while Tesco and Auchan with about 18 percent the prices listed in the Napi basket.
Comparing the values of last year’s most expensive basket with that of this year’s cheapest basket, the difference has been 12 percent, while the growth between last year’s cheapest and this year’s most expensive has been 21 percent.
The mean growth was 1480 HUF.
Last year the average price growth was 1206 HUF, so that last year’s Christmas in prices was felt the VAT increase.
Precisely this process was the one that destroyed trade, supermarkets were visibly unable to make a decision on the price margin to be applied for each product and to calculate the effect of the change in prices on consumption.
(If the merchant misplans the speed of a product’s circulation, he may lose a significant profit on the margin that fits the sales volume.)
The increase in the price of the Napi basket reached such extremes as a result of the increase in VAT, that the most expensive was superior with 1720 HUF to the value recorded in 2006, while in the cheapest the difference was only 844 HUF.
No such extremes occurred this year, since the highest price now has been 1630 HUF more than last year and the cheapest also increased with 1284 HUF.
Comparing the two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic growth in prices in less than 20 months, in hypermarkets the price of basic consumer items grew more than 30 percent.
(However this does not necessarily confirm the figures of the Central Bureau of Statistics: this office, in the case of some staple foods recorded in the 12-month interval a price increase of more than 30 percent.
So, for example, in addition to wheat, also in the case of the egg.)
According to the Napi basket, in the latter case this seems almost impossible, because in the price of this product that was quite expensive already last year compared to the base, there was only a 10 percent increase in prices in the worst case.
By all indices, flour suppliers have a stronger position than egg suppliers, being able to impose the drastic increase in prices even on multinationals.
Hypermarkets do not complain about the golden trading triangle, they constantly talk about positive results.
According to our collected experiences, the majority of consumers in the three stores visited are no longer interested in prices.
Of all the products they buy large quantities, taking preserved food by pallets.
On Wednesday morning, large queues formed in the three stores ahead of the checkouts because the number of customers suddenly increased.
However, we have information that in the interior of the country the sales volumes are lower, many multinationals complain to the survey institutes because the revenues are below their plans and not only in the case of food, but also in the case of appliances.
In many hospitals you save with disinfectants
This year several thousand infections first caused by the misuse of antibiotics have been registered in hospitals.
The prevailing hygiene circumstances in hospitals, the overcrowding of beds and the overload of staff do not favor the control of infections - says the doctor-head of the department of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many hospitals it is saved even with disinfectants.
Not long ago, an infection with MRSA was diagnosed in the traumatology department of János Hospital.
In one man hospitalized after a serious accident, the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of contagion occurred in this same hospital earlier in the year.
A person injured in a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital and the same patient soon after had to return to the hospital as a result of the infection with MRSA and since then a major surgical intervention has not been possible due to the presence of the bacteria in his body.
As of December 10 this year, 1094 cases of hospital infection caused by multidrug-resistant agents have been registered in the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System - said Karolina B?r?cz, a doctor-head of the department of the National Epidemiology Center.
This means that in hospitals this number of infections caused by multiresistant agents has certainly been recorded, of the rest there is no information.
About two-thirds of infections (683 cases) are due to MRSA, i.e. methicillin-oxacillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
One-third of humans carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria on their nose without causing any disease.
SA infections (e.g., throat inflammation, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infections) react well to antibiotics and are easy to treat.
However, once over- or over-applied to antibiotics, the bacteria that normally react well to antibiotics transform into highly antibiotic-resistant bacteria and rapidly spread into inadequate hospital conditions.
They can cause serious hospital infections, for example wound infections or septicaemia first to patients with transient or chronic immunodeficiency, to patients with the weakened organism, to the elderly or to people of low weight.
In the opinion of the doctor-director of the János Hospital there is nothing special about MRSA infection, these infections are daily in hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is only absent - said Tibor Nyulasi - where its presence is not examined.
Resistant to antibiotics
"These patients are isolated, the nursing staff treat them in rubber gloves and mask and there are the right antibiotics for their treatment" - said Tibor Nyulasi.
Inpatients are pre-screened for MRSA in their body, but infection cannot be prevented in all cases.
It is not fashionable to take samples
It would be possible to prevent hospital infections of MRSA in most cases, however the current national hospital circumstances do not favor for the prevention of formation and infection with multiresistant pathogens - says Karolina B?r?cz.
As this infection occurs primarily in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should screen hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients who have MRSA in their system.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
This is also due to the fact that the National Health Fund does not fund these medical examinations.
So most cases come to light when the visible MRSA infections in the patient already occur - said the doctor-head of the department of the epidemiological center.
The European Union makes stringent mandates for the application of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives to treat infections and pathological conditions.
Antibiotic therapy should be targeted, i.e. microbiological tests should be done to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
Microbiological sampling is even less frequent in the case of walking patients or in basic care - said Karolina B?r?cz.
You save with disinfectants
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases MRSA is spread from one patient to another through healthcare personnel.
Therefore, hand washing, the use of rubber gloves and masks play a very important role, however also in this regard considerable faults are experienced in hospitals.
MRSA is spread through droplet transmission and direct contact between people, however in national hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
Moreover, hospital wards are often crowded, beds are often close together, although to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated by at least a distance of 1.5 meters.
Unfortunately it can also be experienced - added Karolina Borcz - that in the hospitals of less favorable economic situation is saved with disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and that is why there is a greater chance for infection.
In Karolina’s opinion, where the appropriate prevention measures are met, there are fewer infections of this type or the spread of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government program against MRSA
Treating MRSA infection is a huge expense for the National Health Insurance Fund, which is why it is being fought in all countries.
In England, for example, there is a government program to prevent and reduce cases of MRSA.
The programme appears to be successful, according to data provided, with MRSA infections showing a declining trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of multi-drug resistant agents (including MRSA) and hospital infections due to these pathogens.
Negative breathalyzer control of the police commander who caused a fatal accident
The official expert report has been made on the case of the fatal accident caused by the commander of the XXII district police.
The possibility that he was driving drunk or in a dazed state can be excluded the since resigned commander of the police of the XXII district, who on Tuesday struck and caused the death of a passer-by - reported Friday Attila Morvai, spokesman for the Prosecutor General of the Capital, after having prepared the expert report on the case.
The expert report confirmed the result of the primary alcohol control that had already found that the former police commander did not drink alcohol before getting behind the wheel.
The then-head of the XXII district police station on Tuesday in his private vehicle at the turn of Kossuth Lajos street in the XXII district ran over a 55-year-old man who was trying to cross the street, but not in the designated pedestrian zone.
(This last fact, that is, that the pedestrian did not use the zebra to cross the street, according to the regulations of the Traffic Code are not extenuating circumstances, the driver must always give way when bending.)
The bystander lost his life after being hospitalized.
For what happened the district police leader resigned and requested his retirement, according to the police statement, because he was very moved by the case.
The case is being investigated by the Budapest Public Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also said that the former police commander from the beginning collaborated with the prosecutors in charge of the investigation.
400 million euros more for infrastructure
Hungarian Finance Minister János Veres and European Investment Bank (EIB) Vice-President Marta Gajecka signed three credit limit agreements in Budapest on Friday for a total value of 400 million euros to finance education, transport and environment infrastructure, as well as the energy sector.
In 2006 the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a budget of EUR 300 million to finance transport and environmental protection projects in the Hungarian budget, to be implemented from the grant of cohesion funds, of which the parties had already signed a credit agreement worth EUR 100 million, the contract they have just signed relates to the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The credit agreement of 150 million euros is also intended to finance the budget of educational projects.
The EIB approved a total of 300 million euros for this objective of Hungary, on the use of the remaining 150 million euros the decision will be taken later, by extending the credit agreement.
The parties signed a contract for 50 million euros for innovations, which the budget will mainly use for the innovation and research project of the University of Debrecen.
During the talks they also covered the issue of the construction of the 4th Metro line.
It was agreed that by the time Hungary finalizes with the EU the details of the financing of the Metro, they will return to the issue of whether or not it is necessary to modify the original contract and how to do it.
According to János Veres, this may take place earlier in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary worth EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest on the claims is adjusted to EURIBOR and the EIB offers a grace period of 8 years, without charging a fee for keeping the claim available to the debtor.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is admirable - the attention of the whole of Europe is directed towards that Balkan country just mentioned.
What, where and who buys from the EU market even cheaper, will it quickly become more expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The preferred target for real estate acquisitions in Eastern Europe is undoubtedly Bulgaria, with its cheap ski apartments and beach chalets.
The mountainous regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most preferred, while on the beaches of Albena, the "Gold Coast", the "Costa del Sol", the old Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are looking for real estate also in the surroundings of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to the analysts of Re/Max in Bulgaria, sooner or later also the central area of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will arouse the interest of real estate developers and more and more people will buy real estate in the especially cheap area of Rus.
The capital Sofia can also be attractive, with commercial and office spaces promising a quick return on investment.
Bulgaria is on the best path to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe, thus being a prominent destination also during the other two seasons, in addition to summer and winter.
Therefore, cautious investors are already doing their shopping, for example in the surroundings of Bansko.
In the opinion of analysts, those who buy real estate in Bulgaria also strive to change their lives and their way of life.
Most of the customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot promoters are also present and there are traditionally many Russian customers on the beaches of the Black Sea and in ski paradises.
Foreign customers can be classified into three groups - says Georgi Jankov, regional director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who intend to settle here buy new or renovated properties for a price between 50 and 100 thousand euros or old houses in poor condition between 5 and 15 thousand euros, to renew them later.
They require good communication and access, and for them the proximity of a large city, shops and usually a local doctor is important.
They constitute the second category of buyers of chalets (Bulgaria in the month of December was included among the top 10 holiday destinations of Germans).
The third group are real estate investors who make their purchases in the hope of benefiting in the medium or long term.
The price of capital real estate is constantly growing, since the demand is increasing.
Although in the European Union Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices, in the last five years they suffered an annual increase of 21 percent.
The increase in the price of real estate considerably outpaces the growth in wages.
Fodor and the Hungarian Six Percent
According to the Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor, the meetings at the expert level will end on Tuesday and on Wednesday after the official inauguration negotiations will continue at the ministerial level on the international climate regime after 2012.
Experts and policymakers from 192 countries around the world discuss the Bali Roadmap on post-period emission reduction efforts under the Kyoto Protocol, which runs until 2012.
There are now lively discussions on the subject between developing and industrialized countries.
The United States has already indicated that at the moment it does not want to negotiate on precise figures, although it tends to agree that compared to the situation in 1990, until 2020 the emission of the gases responsible for the greenhouse effect will decrease by 25 to 40 percent.
Another major theme of the conference is whether or not industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are willing to offer material and technological aid to countries in need.
Agreement was also reached on the aid to be offered to developing countries.
The support fund, provided for under the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by a 16-member Governing Council, likely within the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF) - writes the "Piac es Profit".
Six per cent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor supports the EU’s efforts to retain its leading role in global climate protection and promote the signing of the new international agreement until 2009.
The minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020, regardless of whether or not the “post-2012 agreement” will be signed, and is willing to commit to reducing even 30 percent if the other large developed regions of the world and developing countries are also willing to make commitments in line with their responsibility and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the signatory countries of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol committed to a decrease of 5.2 percent, within this the then 15 EU Member States committed to comply with an 8 percent decrease.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce by 6 percent the emission of gases responsible for the greenhouse effect with respect to the period between 1985 and 87, which our country will comply with - says the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
Much is at stake in Bali, since in two years time the international agreement on long-term climate policy will have to be signed, because otherwise, it is certain that its entry into force would be postponed to after 2012. In this case the reduction commitments, assumed in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international system of emissions reduction, whose need was warned in its most recent report by the IPCC, the international scientific association of the UN that obtained the Nobel Prize.
This would delay the reduction of emissions and could not prevent an increase of more than 2°C in the average temperature of the Earth, a fact that according to scientists would have immeasurable and irreversible consequences.
The British Army Recruits on YouTube
British army units at a video distributor post recordings about actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
First the British air force (RAD) was the one that took advantage of YouTube services: special units displaced in Afghanistan since March 2006 are uploading videos about their actions against the Taliban - the BBC reported.
These recordings made with helmet-mounted mini-cameras are monitored in Kandahar’s general operating body, then sent to London to be uploaded to the internet.
The political message is inevitable.
139 recordings have already been uploaded to the Internet and their “channel” has already been viewed by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered in the spring of 2007 under the name of "defense headquarters" and publishes videos of both actions carried out in Iraq and Afghanistan, while both the Ministry of the Commonwealth of Nations (Commonwealth Office) and the multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally the air force had uploaded the videos for recruitment purposes, but in the view of the Ministry of Defence they also serve to present to the public the true objective of the British army’s presence abroad.
This type of propaganda costs practically nothing compared to conventional TV recruitment spots - the defense expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC - instead, they inevitably have some political message, since in a specific way they justify the raison d'etre of the military actions decided by the government.
The Americans made a video game.
The army is also concerned by the fact that, in addition to the recalcitrantly edited and censored recordings, amateur videos also appear in the distributor, for example about the death of the soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a little hypocritical, the officers speak at most of losses, without presenting however the bloody part of the fighting.
In addition, the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan have been uploaded to the Internet and numerous videos recorded in real operations, but the British army is only lately taking advantage of this opportunity.
Americans use a slightly different form for recruitment with the free-to-download shooting video games, called America's Army, in which in the midst of a more or less real situation the player can put himself directly in place of the soldiers.
Tombola and salty cupcake at ministries Christmas party
Labor Minister Mónika Lamperth does not seem very sentimental: instead of the Christmas party, she will hold a work meeting for her colleagues who will be able to say goodbye to 2007 with salty pastry and coffee.
There is a ministry that will celebrate your party with live music, in another they will create the Christmas atmosphere in the hearts of public officials with tombola and a toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - so the power is fun.
State offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas party will be held at the Ministry of Defense, but not for Ministry workers.
At Christmas the Orphans will receive gifts for the children of the fallen soldiers and for Christmas the Missionaries invite the relatives of the soldiers who are currently serving missions abroad. A reception will also be offered for the press.
This portfolio will allocate 25 million for the festive atmosphere at the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (ANF) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) will hold a luxurious party with respect to the parties of the other portfolios
The MET party will be held at the House of the Future, with a total budget of HUF 4,320 000 and approximately 350 of the ministry’s six hundred workers are expected to attend.
In the party of the portfolio there will be a Christmas atmosphere, artists will also perform and there will be a tombola draw.
ANF Christmas cost 4.7 million HUF and was celebrated on Wednesday in the National Council of Administration of Justice (CNAJ) building with musical concerts and dinner.
The room rental cost one million HUF, the rest of the budget was spent for the more than four hundred guests.
We have information that workers in one of the ANF departments are also invited to another Christmas party to be held by a contest management company called the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development of Community Funds.
For this purpose they rented the entire building of the Comedy Theater.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA, since we are unable to communicate with the competent person.
You can attend without a suit
The CNAJ building not only hosted the ANF party, but also that of the Ministry of Justice and the Police, which instead of Christmas celebrated the Lucia Day dance on December 7.
Their CNAJ did not charge anything for the use of their facilities.
Five hundred people participated in the dance.
The party began with the minister’s words of greeting and after dinner there was live dance music.
Responding to the question of [origo] they reported: to attend the dance it was not mandatory to wear a suit or evening dress.
Health, work and local government portfolios are preparing for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organize a program and party for its workers in its own building with a budget of 400,000 HUF.
Instead, Labor Minister Monica Lamperth is not waiting for her colleagues for an official Christmas party, but for an end-of-year work meeting.
The participation of one hundred and eighty guests - as reported by the press department - will drink only coffee and salty pastry, so the party will not cost more than 350,000 HUF.
Minister for Local Governments Gordon Bajnai will instead simply toast with his colleagues in the Ministry for Local Governments and Territorial Development classroom.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will hold a Christmas party in its own auditorium with the participation of 436 workers.
The Christmas party will have a budget of 2500 HUF per guest - from this budget the reception will be paid with buffet and a toast.
Since János Veres is the minister, the workers of the MF celebrate Christmas in the same way every year.
On the other hand, there will be no festive atmosphere, the official character will be given not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the schedule of the afternoon of its celebration.
The agriculture portfolio will offer a New Year's reception on January 20, at the Ministry will not celebrate Christmas.
The reception will be held at the Castle of Vajdahunyad in the Municipal Park and according to the portfolio, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for the hundred guests.
This - according to the press department - will be a very simple reception standing, to which only specialized diplomats, accredited in Hungary, will be invited.
These receptions, which are held every year, begin with a brief greeting from the minister and conclude with a modest meal.
The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Education and Culture will not hold any Christmas parties - this is what the relevant press departments told [origo].
In the press department of the environment portfolio could not report on the budget of the Christmas celebrations of the Ministry.
What is known is that for the party to be held at the Museum of Applied Arts more than four hundred people were invited.
The forces of the giant strike are gathering
The League Trade Unions and the National Federation of Workers’ Commissions will set up a strike commission on Friday to coordinate Monday’s indefinite strike.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while on Monday - the day on which the final vote on the public health law will be held - a work stoppage will begin.
Surely this action will cause great difficulties in transport, since rail traffic will be completely stopped and until 1 p.m. the workers of the Collective Transport Company of Budapest will also be on strike.
On Friday afternoon the League Trade Unions will report on the details of their strike on Monday that they will hold jointly with the National Federation of Workers’ Commissions.
The strike committee of the LIGA and the National Union of Machinists will also be set up to coordinate the actions on Monday.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while on Monday the participating unions will strike indefinitely, if an agreement with the government is not reached.
This means that - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the public health law - they did not report on the date of the end of the strike started.
If the National Assembly disapproves of the public health law, the unions will immediately withdraw their call for a strike.
Instead, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide on the future.
On the basis of the National Assembly’s Monday agenda, it is also possible that only the public health law will be voted on in the late hours of the night, or perhaps close to midnight.
As a result of the strike that will start on Monday, there will be significant difficulties in transport: on the railways you will stop working indefinitely, in the morning you may stop a part of the collective transport of Budapest and more than half of the intercity bus transport of the Volán companies.
At the same time, in many parts of the country there will be closure of half of the roads.
Numerous unions and civil organizations have joined the strike, their names are constantly updated on the League’s website.
Some unions announced their strike indefinitely, others for a defined time.
Until Thursday afternoon, the State Railway and the Free Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) could not reach an agreement even on the minimum services, although, as the Christmas holidays approach, more and more people are traveling on trains.
According to information received so far, from the start of the day until 1 p.m. will be on strike workers of the Collective Transport Company of Budapest, Budapest Airports from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m., hold a four-hour strike the Unions of LIGA of the Electrical Industry and Thermal Energy, the Unions of Educators called for a strike of 2 and the Democratic Union of Educators from 2 to 8 hours.
The Hungarian Medical Association will take part in a national strike at alternative times and the Democratic Union of Health and Social Sector Workers (SDTSSS), which are part of the Trade Union Cooperation Forum, will hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is for the government to withdraw its proposal on public health reform and submit a new conception to a social debate.
The second demand is that they gradually introduce the new form of calculation of pensions that will come into force next year.
The third is that they ensure, even before 2010, in the case of advanced pensions, the possibility that the occupations that deserve it can enter the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Union of Railway Workers (SLTF), which is part of the League Unions, does not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on the railway side lines and expects another different proposal.
Political Capital[b1]: The Hungarian Guard increases the risk in the country
According to the Risk Analysing Division of the Political Capital, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, formed in August this year with the support of the Movement for a Better Hungary, has increased the political risk of Hungary and the region in several ways.
In the company’s “risk warning” it is written: in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard the greatest political risk is constituted by the fact that “with the aggravation of the ethnic tensions existing between the Roma and non-Roma population of Hungary, even in the short term violent ethnic clashes may occur”.
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is probably the provocation of an event of this nature - added the representative of the research institute.
They stated that all this is due to one of the main faults of the protagonists of Hungarian political life: "the protagonists of public life gave the public debate of the Gypsy problem to the representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who were able to base their political strategy on the existing discrepancies between Gypsies and Hungarians".
This aggravates the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of the outbreak of violent conflicts.
In addition to this, according to the research institute, the activity of the National Guard, as a result of the great attention of the national and international average, "significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, especially as it relates to the stability and democratic development of the country."
They remind us that since the autumn of 2006 the reorganization of radical and far-right groups in Hungary has received increasing publicity and momentum, and that since the summer of 2007 numerous organizations have formed in the country that define themselves as "national self-defence associations".
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil organizations, while openly proclaiming the training of their members for defense - even armed - (civil defense, national defense, defense of public order), alluding to the ineptitudes of the police, of the army, that is, of the State," they add.
They stated: all this takes place in accordance with the method that tries to give a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the discontent of society with politics and with political parties.
Because highlighting the civil and the form of association in the case of these associations not only serves to avoid the legal problems of legal registration, but at the same time is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a risk factor also from the point of view of neighbourly relations.
“In recent months, in numerous neighbouring states they referred to the Hungarian Guard as a potential danger, while ultra-nationalist political figures in certain neighbouring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy with the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this influences the political stability of the region" - they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so political risks have increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard operates in a similar way to, for example, the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (UNB).
The constitution of the Bulgarian guard is due to the massive riots of the gypsies that occurred in one of the neighborhoods of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, the UNB decided to set up the guard, arguing that the organization’s goal is “national self-defense.”
In his opinion, in the last 17 years there was "Gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, however the state remained powerless and indifferent to the facts - recalls Political Capital.
They added: this initiative has provoked a lively discussion in Bulgarian public opinion.
As it was written, it indicates the increased risk of ethnic clashes that certain gypsy organizations in Bulgaria have announced that in order to resist, they will constitute their own guard.
As the functioning of the Hungarian Guard has so far shown similarities to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that also the Gypsies of Hungary react to the threat in a similar way, organizing their own self-defense - it can be read in the warning about the risks of Political Capital.
Political Capital’s director of research, Attila Juhász, told the news agency: “Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, each year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that can influence the risk change, they inform the public, as happened in this case, by publishing their warning about the risks.
The holiday is not always written with red numbers
In Hungary the law defines precisely the days that are written with red numbers in the calendar and has already become a widespread practice that around the holidays - that the coming year will be less - the working days are reorganized.
Not even in the EU or North America are the holidays unified.
Hungarian laws make a difference between national holiday, state holiday and festive days.
The festive days are fundamentally related to religious festivals and historical ephemeris.
We celebrate the New Year as well: both the last day of the old year, and the first day of the new year is festive - the latter especially so that those who spent celebrating the old year can rest.
Throughout the year we have eleven holidays written in red numbers on the calendar.
It is a national holiday on March 15 in memory of the revolution of 1848 and October 23, commemorating the revolution of 1956.
On August 20 we celebrate the founding of the State, on May 1st the work party, on November 1st and 2nd we remember our deceased relatives and friends.
In addition, in our country there are two-day feasts of Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious holidays rarely coincide with a weekend, so it often becomes a bridge when there is a single working day before or after the party.
In exchange for extended weekends like this, on the previous Saturdays you cannot be absent from work or school.
It is the minister of labor that regulates in his specific decree when you have to work exactly in exchange for the day directly before or after the party.
This legal standard is mandatory for all employers and their employees, as well as for employees and civil servants.
On the other hand, it is not mandatory for companies and service institutions that, due to their function, work uninterruptedly even during the festive days.
This year the work order can be altered only around the holidays of the end of the year: from December 24 life in the country practically stops, since according to experiences, most people "bridge" during the days between Christmas and the end of the year or take their holidays during these days.
Next year several of our parties will coincide with mid or weekends, so there will be fewer changes in working hours than this year.
First the agenda around the work party will be modified so that then, for four successive days, the workers can rest.
Saturday, April 26 will be a working day, so that in exchange Friday May 2 will be a festive day.
The other change is related to the feast of October 23: on Saturday, October 18, we will have to work instead of Friday, October 24.
On the other hand, the year that comes during the end of the year party will be able to rest, since from December 24 you will not work almost anywhere, even if the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
Six little deterrents to embitter the lives of your colleagues
Emails that we forget to send, sound messages that we never receive, innocent lies that pass us without realizing it: all of them are part of our “everyday folklore” at work.
You have to decide if you adapt to the small discomforts or consciously avoid confusing situations that can irritate others.
Advice.
Sorry, I forgot to let you know that you’ve been searched by the marketing department,” says one of your colleagues.
That's why you didn't go on a date?
At best he feels it and tries to repair the matter, maybe he calls the marketing department to tell them that he forgot to deliver the message (this is the least usual solution).
In most cases the matter is resolved by apologizing.
Before proceeding to embarrassing explanations, it is worth meditating on the things with which you can embitter the lives of your colleagues and consciously strive to avoid them.
Do you borrow something that is not yours?
There is nothing more irritating than when you want to take a document, an office tool or your phone and you do not find them.
Remember you put the stapler on the table yesterday, but by this morning it disappeared?
Can you find your lost pen on one of your colleagues' desks?
Do not take anything from your colleagues without asking them, because they will rightly be angry with you for stealing their things.
Do not take envelopes or post-it from the office because it can be unpleasant when you need them immediately and they run out before time.
Do you joke about the private lives of your colleagues?
There is no good solution to stop rumors that are already running.
Who, what are you doing and with whom?
Where and why?
Don’t pass on to everyone the information (guesses) you have about the particular lives of your colleagues!
Don’t abuse your colleague’s trust when he shares his innermost secrets with you!
Bury in yourself what you have heard and do not gossip about your colleague in his absence, although others also know the things about him.
Are you going on sick leave unjustifiably?
When you call the office on the phone and say that you are sick and your head hurts unbearably, you feel bad or well, you feel that that day you prefer to rest; think that others should do your work, your urgent tasks, your work for term.
Don't screw up your buddy!
If you already know in advance that the next day you will not go to the office or something may happen to you, so you must stay at home, communicate them, so that your colleagues or your boss do not have to face your absence the next day.
Tarareos, giggles, phone calls
Are you involved in your work, but are your colleagues’ giggles suddenly taking you out of it?
Have you unwittingly heard a phone conversation that would have been better left unheard?
Do not disturb your colleagues with your hums, songs, conversations out loud (except when you make them above their head), kicks, constant blasphemy, expressing your discontents out loud.
All of these can be annoying, even if you’re not delving into a project right now (writing, planning, organizing).
Do you blame others for a mistake?
Don’t blame others if you haven’t finished something on time, you’ve forgotten to send an important letter or message!
Don’t allude to the chaos that eventually reigns in the office, or the noise your colleagues make!
You must recognize if you have made a mistake that harms others and you must repair the fault!
Ask how you can repair your fault!
Do you feel too much at home in the office?
Jogging and sneakers: very comfortable room for the house, but not suitable for the office!
Don't wear comfortable jogging even if your occupation allows it!
Do not be messy, respect your colleagues and yourself by wearing everyday clothes, elegant and beautiful when your occupation demands it!
You lose interest if you want to meet the expectations of the public
The car is slowly moving forward in the usual morning traffic jam.
It sounds a strange beat on the radio: violin with electronic effects.
I turn the volume up.
Change the rhythm of the music and to the previous tones the bass is added and then the voice of a female choir like a real jewel intervenes.
The channel mr2 plays the song Wings of Love by Zagar.
National music life didn’t spoil us much with quality electronic pop.
But now it seems totally different this jam when you’re listening to Zagar’s new album.
Yonderboi appears. Some new and interesting songs from the underground [b2]digital [b3]national are gradually changing the image and although garage-style rock is fashionable again, breaks guitars, electro pop national has shown: there are novelties under the Sun.
Balázs Zságer started his career in the city of Pécs, played in the Yonderboi ensemble until he began his independent career perhaps because both cannot be protagonists of the same ensemble.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mixture of jazz, electronic dance music and pop, he tried to succeed, when he was asked for soundtracks [b4]cinematographic (pl.
Ferenc T?r?k Szezon).
The wider public got to know the ensemble that initially performed only in small clubs when the magazine wan2 selected its first album released in 2002 among the fifty most important national albums, classifying Zagar, along with Yonderboi as almost the only national trendsetter, capable of selling also in Western markets.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his ensemble are in fashion, but no one has asked them whether or not they gladly wear this label.
The ensemble reacted as it should: it prepared a new and even better disc.
The newly released album, titled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, will be able to open new paths for them, although the title itself aims to establish continuity with the initial years in the city of Pécs.
For this title was one of the lines of the ancient ensemble of Balázs Zságer.
It’s fine to refer to the airy, the flighty, but in addition to the music’s airy, the loudest-sounding guitar, the rock-and-roll effect, now appeared – in the spirit and trend of the time.
With these songs he presented the album in the Millenáris Gy?rgy Ligeti, the singer who currently works in England with the ensemble The Puzzle.
The album includes a true success of the mr2 Petofi channel that lately transmits popular music from morning to night. This station carried to the ears of the listeners the high-flying music of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungarian singers (Divas Underground").
Everything is in order (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: After this new success the question arises: the one you are performing, to what extent is a music dedicated to a select audience?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of a select audience for me means little.
In my opinion there are two types of caste in light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Also so-called underground alternative music can be boring, meaningless and can be composed equally just for sale, which makes it commercial.
But also a good pop song can come from sincere inspiration.
The attitude of the listeners also works in this spirit, regardless of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the reception of your music by Hungarian and foreign audiences?
B. Zs: Abroad, especially to the west of us, light music has larger traditions.
There not only the generations of fifteen and twenty frequent concerts, but also the older ones.
They pay much more attention to the changes that occur around them in light music, because they consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the public have in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they’re from, and how many people are listening to your music?
B.Zs: Naturally I feel good to see more and more people attending our concerts.
But we have never composed music for the market.
We do not write music for some purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the audience is rather felt in concerts where there is a reciprocal influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet, I realized that if you want to meet the expectations of the public, you lose their interest.
hvg.hu: How far do you intend to follow Yonderboi’s example?
He works alone and made his career rather west of us.
B.Zs: We don’t follow his path, even though sometimes they try to compare our music with his.
We rather work as a team, trust in the musical presence of the other and let it unfold.
At first it was inevitable that they compare our works with the music of Yonderboi, since many of us started our career in his group and from there we started another way.
hvg.hu: On the list of hits of mr2 Pet-fi Wings of Love is in the first place.
Many people first heard the name Zagar in connection with this song.
Did you consciously open up with this style to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn’t intend to write great hits and sell our album with these hits.
This song is more than that.
We added it to the end of the record, trying to relax after the album’s sonic orgy and heavier tracks.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why exactly them - what was the main reason?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a gospel choir.
Then came the idea to create this chorus of good-voiced soloists from our own national musical stage.
Thus was created that choir of six women - namely Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik ? Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Németh - who was later baptized as Divas of Underground.
hvg.hu: Did you compose exactly that way the song or did the girls change some things?
Zs.B.: This song existed a long time ago in instrumental version and when we had all the material on the album, we thought something was still missing.
The chord attracted singing.
Even that night I recorded the song that the girls later learned.
It all came almost to the first attempt and in an incredibly spontaneous way.
I remember, I was very excited then, but naturally I needed the Divas too.
My voice wouldn't have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: Both at the concert and on the album it seems as if the girls are in the background.
There are no soloists (except for Judy Jay's brief solo), they have no role of their own, they sing all together and no more strongly than the music, so the music doesn't just accompany their chants.
Also on the stage are located in the background.
Intentionally?
B.Zs: They are at the bottom simply because of technical problems.
Instead we consciously didn’t want to distribute solo roles.
The song is also about it, about forgetting for a while our ego, that who has come from and where it goes, let those wings, the wings of love lift us up.
I would have wanted to make others feel that euphoric mood that we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: Which one did you do the most work for?
Zs.B.: In the musical composition really none, rather when mixing there were more difficult pieces.
For example the Dorian Gray's Dilemma in which I am playing on a concert piano or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time I did not want to run the groove and then, little by little everything was put to its place as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song on the new album?
Zs.B.: This is constantly changing with the concerts and because I’ve already “released” the album.
Now Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
A treacherous stockbroker risks billions for his inferiority complex
A disloyal embezzler.
This is how he points to his former employee, Jerome Kerviel, the French banking giant of Societe Generale, also owner of the Czech Bank of Commerce.
For it lost about five billion euros.
However, it seems rather that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare himself to his colleagues and, undoubtedly, with good abilities.
He long ago hinted, unlike all the big Czech banks, at the crisis in the American mortgage market.
“He has a fragile character,” she said of her superiors, who sent her to the police.
But what emerges from Kerviel’s answers according to what the French media, such as the newspaper Le Monde, show is that he was a man who at the end of last year had a profit of more than 1.6 billion euros thanks to his business.
Crisis not only in America
“All I wanted to do was make money for my bank,” he says in his answers.
Precisely, in the summer, he managed to win during the American crisis, 500 million euros.
I saw this opportunity coming at the beginning of the year.
In February, some news began to be heard about so-called sub-prime mortgages offered to low-income clients or to those who in the past had problems with payments and that those clients would begin to have problems.
However, this crisis should not influence the entire economy.
Kerviel did not believe it and bet correctly.
And then, at the end of the year, its profits exceeded 1.6 billion euros.
“When I won my first 500 million I didn’t know how to notify him,” confesses Kerviel and adds, that nothing has been left for himself, at all.
Throughout the interrogation, he stated that he had falsified the records in such a way that they would not be discovered.
He even went so far as to deceive the bosses, even as the Eurex Exchange began to take an interest in his business.
Risk turned to profit
Were you afraid it would be discovered?
Rather, no.
“I thought I’d made $1.6 billion for the bank and that from that simple fact, they’d be happy.”
Where did he get so much willpower to risk it that way?
In my position I had to work gradually.
He joined Societe Generale in 2000, exactly after finishing his studies in Lyon.
His annual salary ranged from $51,000.
Two years later he was already an assistant stockbroker and in 2005 he became a stockbroker with an annual salary of $90,000.
I knew I would never win as much as everyone else.
“In my first interview in 2005, I noticed that they were looking at me with caution.
Because of my training and also my professional and personal progress," Kerviel told the researchers.
But shortly after my entry into the company came the first great success.
Thanks to the actions of Allianz won, during the bomb attacks in London, playing down a title of 500 million euros.
And this was a starting mechanism, and he wanted more.
If you win, we leave you
"This is like a snowball," police said.
But it is said that the chiefs knew all this or rather suspected it.
"While I was making money, they closed their eyes."
Only, then, came the coup earlier this year.
In one day he lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in mid-January he wanted to erase all traces.
When he arrived at work on Monday, he no longer worked at the bank.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5 billion euros because of him.
And how did they track him down?
He became a suspect from his vacation.
“I chose only four days for the past year.
The runner who doesn’t have a vacation is a runner who doesn’t want anyone to take a look at his file.”
The Czech Republic has the possibility to get 365 billion
The ministers of the government of the Czech Republic signed with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programs from which the Czech Republic can get 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion crowns).
This is almost half of the total sum that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
Approximately Kr 125 billion will come out of seven operational programmes for the regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion kronor from the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money will go to transportation, up to $150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest of the operational programmes and represents up to 22 per cent of the resources that the Czech Republic can obtain from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the state fund for transport infrastructure that next year will have the amount of 90.8 billion crowns.
The Enterprise and Innovation program should serve entrepreneurs and companies to obtain resources in business innovation.
Companies should secure funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research, and for the implementation of more effective organizational methods.
As far as the current use of EU funds is concerned, the Czech Republic is among the least-used newly-entered countries.
Twenty-year sentence for former president of Nicaragua, court decrees
Nicaragua’s Court of Appeals on Thursday handed down the 20-year sentence for the country’s former president, Arnaldo Alemán, who was convicted in 2003 of embezzling $100 billion (nearly 1.8 billion crowns).
Despite this, some time later, he was released from prison to go to house arrest on his estate not far from the Nicaraguan metropolis.
It is not clear at this time, according to the AP agency, that the then head of the Central American state between 1197 and 2002 is back behind bars.
According to the president of the Court of Appeals, Ileana Pérez, it will depend more on prison officers if they let Alemán finish his punishment at home or if they put him back in prison.
Four years ago, the court showed how Alemán constantly transferred money from the government to the account of a company in Panama.
This partnership was fictitious and the account actually belonged to his closest relatives and supporters.
Some of this money ended up in the fund that Alemán created to finance his campaign in the 2001 elections.
This is how the budget was approved.
That's right.
The state budget was approved.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first prepared by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
This year’s budget was already approved with the support of SSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and SSD could not afford not to accept it.
Apart from different debates before the vote on the confidence vote to the government, this time, nothing dramatic happened.
The parliamentary assembly, in this traditional although the most influential view, calmly approved the new law.
It's a big paradox.
Every government begins and ends with every chapter and budget item, whether they like it or not.
The budget is an important part of politics but it hides the rivalry of power between the government and the opposition.
It is important for the media and therefore they pay special attention to it.
Political discussions are much more interesting than simple numbers.
The State Budgets of the last Social-Democratic governments suffered from three defects that for this year of 2008 it is not possible to solve so easily:
The first of them is the high participation of the mandatory laws, called as expenses of the leaders that are not only pensions but also social benefits that already last year were approved before the elections by the "silent" coalition of SSD and KSIM.
The second is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first defect.
The third limit is the deficit in public funding, such as the municipal and community budget deficit.
However, the greatest risk is not to be found in the state budget deficit.
This is public and relatively under control.
The time bomb, however, is in the deficit of the municipal and community budget.
Many mayors in order to obtain other sources of investment, apart from the money from taxes, fees and credits of the banks, often issued, without meaning, obligations with which they disproportionately indebted their municipalities.
In recent years they managed to pay these debts through the massive sale of energy shares and other development networks they received from the state and privatization.
They do not currently have this resource.
If we stick only to the official and verified facts, we discover that:
Our economy, already a few years ago, goes through phases of growth in the same way as the rest of the world, of which it boasts.
This was the ideal occasion for his government to bring order to the finances of the State.
Instead, however, the state continued to go into debt.
The rest of the countries, except for some like Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, economized much more reasonably than our republic.
It is a great shame that falls, above all, in the previous government.
We belong to the nations that within the global measures are less threatened by poverty.
That is why we do not need massive social programs that, unfortunately, in recent years have been inflated in vain with gigantic measures.
And although they managed to eliminate part of the incomprehensible populist expenses approved this year before the elections, if soon the retirement age and pension reform does not change then it will really be the end of any policy in this country and, govern who governs will only be a simple bureaucracy.
Exaggerating a little, we can say that the politicians who govern will be transformed into civil servants, mechanical deliverers of most of the tax money for retirement and social benefits.
That’s why this year’s budget can’t be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure of normal spending on presidents.
The planned deficit of more than $70 billion by 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary, had the last government not wasted what they could in the last ten years.
We would not want the politicians who govern to become only officials so we must be patient and concede to this weak coalition of government, which realizes that the state can only spend what it is able to obtain from taxes and rates, the peace of mind for the preparation of other reforms of the laws.
Only this will enable the gradual achievement of a balanced State Budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The American Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian Central Banks decided to fight together against the crisis of the Finance Market.
In the Monetary Marking will receive more than one hundred billion dollars through tenders.
In these tenders banks auction the interest rates at which they are able to lend money.
For example, the American Fed will send forty billion dollars to tender, and then another twenty-four billion will be provided by the central banks of Europe and Switzerland.
After the September 11 attacks, it is the first time that central banks from different states have agreed on this coordinated process to protect and lessen the consequences of the financial crisis.
“This step must solve the biggest economic problem, namely the continued growth of the shortage of free capital that banks could lend,” Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group wrote in his report for clients.
“This coordinated action by central banks likely reduced the recession in the United States from 65 percent to 50 percent,” Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already spent sixty billion dollars on unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Economists still expect billions in losses.
“Central banks need to be really afraid of what’s still ahead of them when they decided to take this step,” said Kieran Davies, chief economist at ABN Amro.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks fear that they will have the same problems of access to loans and that therefore they will have to lend more expensive to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy into recession with different impacts on the growth of the world economy.
The central banks thus decided, after they failed to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, London interbank rate that is used for the loan of money in the interbank market.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to lend themselves money even as the central banks of the US, Canada and Britain cut their interest rates several times over the fall.
"It will have the same effect as another fall in interest rates," Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some economists are not surprised that the step taken by the central banks contributes to ignite the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem that is the fall of the housing market in the United States.
Klaus: The debates of the environmentalists are incredible
Global climate change affects developing countries in particular.
President Václav Klaus spoke again on the issue of global warming.
The criticism now came with the closing of the UN international conference on climate change, in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, Not Green Planet, he commented that the debates of environmentalists are incredible.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference that creates a strange mix of government and NGO representatives unacceptable, but the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that is used and the reality.
“There the debates are barely structured, they are fireworks of words, substitutes for the solution to the current problems,” Klaus said.
The Czech president stressed during the presentation of his book that this topic is very important for him and that is why he is interested.
He also expressed his joy at discovering his book translated into German because as he said "many times I only find the caricature of my ideas".
Interested parties can now find out about their varied opinions.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist but that he has, in his opinion, enough assumptions to write a book like this.
He is an academic with the ability to follow and judge a specialized dissertation, has experience with statistics, and is also an economist.
At the main moment of the closure he expressed his thought that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that there is no agreement among scientists about the warming of the planet, that the consequences of the current changes are not so large and serious, nor do they represent possible disasters and that attempts to influence the development of the climate are useless, ineffective and expensively unacceptable.
Moreover, as a man experienced with totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous way to limit the freedom of others.
To the questions of those present he repeatedly explained that he is not against “reasonable environmental defenders but against environmental activists who do not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits.”
Klaus spoke about the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayes Institute.
600,000 people failed to change their driver’s license
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the date and therefore did not manage to change their old driving license whose validity ends at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can apply for the change so officials can give them time until the end of the year to issue the new card.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after the New Year hundreds of thousands of drivers will be on the roads without the valid card.
According to traffic, the card has not been changed mainly by those who no longer even want to drive.
While in the villages they announce a rapid decline of the change of cards, the offices of the metropolis are full of applications and the interest for the new card has increased.
The City Council estimates about 2,000 daily customers.
In the queues, wait half an hour.
In Prague, around 140,000 drivers have not yet taken out the new card.
The issuance of a new card lasts twenty days.
However, it is possible to request the issuance of the card in a shorter period of five days.
But in that case the driver must pay five hundred crowns.
Drivers who are required to change their license and do not reach until the end of the year, but will hit the roads without the valid card will risk a fine starting in January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
The police officer can arrange the infraction with a reprimand.
If it is an administrative offence, the fine shall be 2,500 kroner.
According to the information above, a person who does not go anywhere could be fined.
They could presumably pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry appealed to the offices to impose fines of a maximum of 1,000 kroner.
According to Karel Hanselka, a member of the transport ministry, fines of 1,000 kroner do not threaten anyone.
According to him, the driving license is a document in which people can decide if they want it or not.
It is not the identity card that each person must have valid.
People who don’t want to drive should give up their driver’s license.
Simply bring it or send it by registered mail to the municipal offices.
At the end of the year, the cards issued during the years 1964 and 1993 cease to be valid.
However, drivers will need to gradually change the other types of driver’s license.
People with the document between 1994 and 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the card that was issued between 2001 and 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million more documents.
Court reduced sentence for Berdych's accomplice detectives
Ex-cops Josef Opava and Petr Kocayik accused of complicity with the criminal David Berdych are going to spend between thirteen and ten years in prison.
The High Court in Prague decided to reduce the penalties, the first to one year, and the second to two years.
Detectives from the Prague department against organized crime were initially going to fall for 14 to 12 years.
Today's decision can no longer be appealed, only by revocation by the High Court.
Berdych is also charged in this case, but he is awaiting the verdict of the trial court in the first place.
In other cases, however, he has already been sentenced to 16 years.
He can't get any more.
In January, the District Court acknowledged the involvement in the heist of 19 people and the High Court today overturned 16 of them.
Most of the defendants’ allegations were rejected by the investigation as fabricated cases.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, members of the police in agreement with Berdych passed information from police sources to criminals, covered up the robberies, and helped members of the criminal group avoid penalties.
These criminals handed over 30 percent of their theft to Opava and Kocayik.
The indictment relates to the criminal acts committed by the group between 1999 and 2001.
As far as the theft is concerned, their victims suffered serious impacts on their health but are also accused of abuse of power as public agents and without a weapons permit.
In the home search, police found pistols, steel-core ammunition, a laser pointer and a machine gun.
The group of criminals, according to the indictment, stole tens of millions of crowns from them.
With the exception of nearly 20 men, the court has already found Berdych and other defendants guilty.
Other men connected with Berdych's case are still testifying of other trials, and in some cases they have not yet appeared.
Tomá? P?t and Maro? ?ulej, who for now have avoided trial, are in prison in Ireland where they await the final decision on their surrender to the authorities of the Czech Republic.
One account to change some children: 12 million
For changing a few children in the Maternity House the lawyer of the affected families, Igor Veleba, wants from the hospital of Tuebic 12 million crowns of compensation plus the expenses of the trial.
For each of the mothers, three million, for the fathers, two million, and for the children, one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The hospital’s legal representative, Ond?ej Dostál, is not in principle in agreement with Veleba’s proposal.
"Such demand we do not approve, it is too high," Dostál said after today's meeting.
"In order for us to get an idea of this counterproposal, we need the report of the specialist that the counterpart had investigated.
We'll find out if it has a rescissory value.
We remain in the opinion that it will be hundreds of thousands for everyone," Dostál said.
The amount should move between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each parent.
At the beginning of the cause, Jabloi’s family wanted, for every month they didn’t raise their biological daughter, a million crowns.
Velaba served as the basis for negotiating compensation for the specialist's report, only that it was drawn up at the Motol faculty hospital in Prague.
The parents of the girls according to specialists in psychology and psychiatry suffered from psychic impact and stress of different levels and depth.
The situation of stress was better endured by the men although they fought with recriminations for the change of the girls.
Women have it worse with the trauma they are currently experiencing and with respect to what happens today, Veleba said.
Veronica and Nicola were changed by nurses at the Tsebic Maternity Home last year, on December 9.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola to the Ermakovs in P?ibyslavic, and Veronica to Libor Bro? and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jablo?.
At the end of October, the governor of Vyso?ina, Milo? Vystr?il, gave each family 100,000 kronor as compensation for the mistake made in the T?ebi? hospital that the region administers.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law as liability for damages.
In case of errors they must be extracted from the reserve fund and extraordinarily they can ask for help from the administrator.
The court until today awarded them a proportionally low compensation, the sums that were calculated according to the tables that count in hundreds of thousands and extraordinarily of a million crowns.
Polívka lost the kingdom of Wallachia
Bolek Polívka lost the lawsuit over the brand Kingdom of Wallachia.
According to the judge of the Ostrava provincial court, he was the first to use the Kingdom of Wallachia trademark, but the project was created over many years by Tomá? Harabi? with whom the actor collaborated.
Polívka did not appear for oral hearing today.
According to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The lawsuit is that Mr. Harabis and his team are parasites of Bolek Polivka's popularity," Polivka's lawyer said after the trial.
For him, before the words Kingdom of Wallachia, the image of the actor and comedian comes to everyone.
The same idea also has Harabi.
“We’ve had about 10 years of work behind us.
Searching for money and inventing activities," he said.
For him, the cause of the lawsuit is in the money.
"After years I have realized that the project is successful and that is why I could also receive something.
They want to live as parasites of our work,” he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, the trademark Kingdom of Wallachia was first used by Polívka in his television show.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohat.
So it was not a matter of orienting it towards the creation of a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later Harabic came up with the idea of editing the passport of the Kingdom of Wallachia.
From that comic origin resulted a business and a lucrative business activity from which Harabi? then created the company Kingdom of Wallachia.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to the use of his name and signature on passports and even offered his holders discounts to visitors to his farm and attendees of his shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge today also ruled that Harabic only used a simple idea that Polivka made public on stage for his own business profit.
"It is clear that Bolek Polívka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Wallachia," the judge said.
He added however that in the spirit of the project is Harabi and his team who were dedicated to it completely.
The collaboration, between the now decomposed parts, continued until the year 2000 when Harabic organized for Polivka the official coronation in Vsetin.
From that moment on, conflicts began to arise between Polívka and Harabic, the culmination of which came with the overthrow of "King Boleslav I, the one who was chosen forever".
The main role in the kingdom, through Harabi's mediation, led to the singer Jarmila ?uláková, as queen mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed an indictment against Harabic and his society, which has so far been rejected by the court.
Something clear could bring in the litigation, the tournament for the throne with its princesses, which is already preparing Harabi.
From him should come the new king.
He did not want to reveal any more data or dates.
“We are not in any hurry.
It would have to be something like the king's road to Moravia.
The king would have to be elected on a specific date.
Even Mr. Polívka can introduce himself," Harabii added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: prejudices overcome
I never really liked the Peugeot 206.
Its running characteristics were never anything special, the quality of the gearbox, handling and also the product could be characterized as below average.
But now there is its successor on the market, the Peugeot 207, and this one is much better.
This Combi called SW is a little more advanced and for me, I only have to think better.
When I tried the classic Peugeot 207 five-door, I complained, for example, about the headspace in the rear seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the body of the Combi means in this sense, that I will not suffer before the two meters in length.
Flying around the world
I go through the interior quickly so I don’t repeat it too much.
It is an elegant design where the only defect is the poor central tunnel.
Here I would appreciate more the invention of design although the car already seems quite elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are times when we complained about short seats and backs.
Also unlike the 206 model, the lateral direction has improved considerably.
And the space, and here you can feel how the body measurements have grown.
In the Combi disappears the aforementioned shortage of space in the header.
Suitcases in the trunk
But the main thing in this vehicle is its trunk.
This should be valued as very accessible (thanks to the folding tailgate) and well distributed storage.
The dead spaces are equipped with rubber straps that are an ideal solution.
They do not disturb, and can be extended to the point of holding heavy objects.
But let's stay in the depot.
According to the tables, in basic regime it has a capacity of 428 liters which compared to the competition is rather an average value.
But not in comparison to the best-selling car of the same type in the Czech Republic, the Skoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mladá Boleslav model, we find that the Peugeot lags behind with its noticeable 52 liters.
On holiday abroad or when placing the stroller of the child its value is critical.
But if I had to comment on something positive then I must cite the floor that is quite flat after lowering the backs of the second line.
120 horses in four gears
Our tested car was equipped with a four-valve injection ignition over a capacity of 1.6 l. and a force of 88 kW.
And to tell the truth, that’s what a 1600 should look like if it belittled the familiar five-door.
It is quiet, consumes little and above all, has momentum.
If I compare it to the Skoda era of the time which looked as if the exhaust pipe was plugged by a rag, I can say that with this one I can be impressed.
Prices respond
The price of the car is not for every pocket.
We must, however, keep in mind that we have tested a vehicle elegantly equipped and with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with injection ignition of 1400 for 329,900 crowns, can still be.
Our aggregates put it from 410,900 crowns, which is already too much.
The tested Premium type already reaches another 80,000 crowns.
Only we would still have airbags on the headboards, automatic air conditioning, automatic windshield wipers, automated rear windows...
That is, the car with everything, costs 531,900 crowns.
It’s a lot, but have the team add-ons on the Fabia and you’ll come up with a pretty similar number.
Now it remains to decide which of the two brands.
Slovak students do not integrate into English schools
Children from Eastern European countries attend English schools and locals fear more changes in schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans for now brings only a number of problems.
Even British schools record cases where conflicts between migrants and children of the natives increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of Eastern European children into British schools is well illustrated in the northern city of Kent where conflicts between natives and Slovak emigrants are beginning to grow.
Discussions, extortion, and anger among students have already caught up with even the parents themselves.
The situation has gone so far that the Chatmam police arrested a Slovak woman who was beating a ten-year-old student with a green stick.
In her defense, she said the girl was insulting her son with racist slurs.
The police also had to act after an attack by two underage girls on a Slovak migrant.
The girls treated him with racist slurs and threw rocks at him.
“As we were going home, a boy came up to us at the bus stop and started spitting at us.
When I told him to leave, he made the gesture of throwing apples and pears at us, and then he pulled down his pants and showed us his butt," she described another unpleasant incident to The Times, the mother of the Slovak student.
The complaints are from both sides.
One of the natives even designated the conflict with migrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above show us how the atmosphere in English schools begins to be quite tense.
In Britain there are 70,000 Slovaks who came here for work.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors it is truly the island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your vacation can be accomplished, provided you choose correctly.
Sandy and golden beaches, big waves or a calm sea like a pond.
palm trees and the whole enclosed with waiters offering pizzas on the beach, ice cream or various cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the island of the Caribbean Sea you can find all this and much more.
Only on one island does it find much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the islands of the Greater Antilles.
At the time of the Spaniards, Cuba became the bastion of the conquest of America.
Columbus called it, the most beautiful place human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and cargo port for the treasures that the Spanish extracted from America and brought to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional grew in the late 1920s.
It was built by one of the bosses of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, since everything that was criminal in the US (and therefore prohibited) was welcomed and supported in Cuba as drugs, gambling and prostitution.
Among his guests were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, tall buildings emerged, along wide avenues ran the cars that were a symbol of worship in the 50s of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a hacienda in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojimar he had his yacht.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, the stars of show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita Abánense you can also leave your autograph.
In the bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional you can mix cocktails according to your wishes.
And those cult cars of the 50s, until today continue to operate in Havana, because those Lada and Fiat that arrived long ago have rusted among these humid and salty winds.
Although Havana, especially the old quarter is deteriorating significantly, there are not as many wonderful colonial monuments in the surroundings as there.
Other places are metamorphosed into beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings so much necessary money, its development is guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years new hotels have grown not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and in islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is unique in the world and that is highly valued by lovers of the railway.
Sugar cane is transported from huge plantations to sugar factories by narrow tracks in steam or electric machines.
Their garages for dozens of years were not discovered and now they are there, machines that work and whose sister models that exist in other parts of the world are only found in museums.
Where to go?
The best known place for most visitors does not change.
And therefore, it is not necessary to talk more about Havana or Varadero.
Perhaps, just remember that in the aforementioned Hemingway estate there is a museum that for those who are lovers of the writer, they should not miss visiting it.
The Viñales Valley is the most picturesque corner of Cuba to the west of the island.
Lush vegetation growing on limestone lands.
Mogotes, limestone pylons and steep rocks in the falls of the valley, and in their caves fertile lands are acclimatized thanks to which rocks are formed that hide dense vegetation.
The valley is the place where probably the highest quality tobacco is grown in Cuba.
Visiting one of the cigar factories in Havana you can find your final product.
Perhaps someone finds it interesting that the Chilean part of the series was filmed there, Major Zeman.
Trinidad
A city of old age that was founded not long after the Spanish colonized the island.
Slavery and sugar brought her fame and wealth.
Wealth became beauty with constructions in the small town.
Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by French settlers who arrived later, in four centuries has hardly changed.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Sierra de Escambray, is such a remote place that even in the 50s of the last century there was no road that linked it with the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built and therefore, neither, nothing was destroyed, because each person was happy to have where to live.
If you have more time to be in Trinidad than an afternoon, it is worth visiting interesting places in the nearby area such as Playa de Ancón or the valley of the sugar factories.
The night belongs to the House of Music, which animates with its music the silence of the mornings.
Baracoa
A small town in the extreme west of Cuba, some consider it to be the most beautiful on the island.
Surely that opinion is already confirmed by the way itself.
The two roads that reach there from Guantanamo must pass through high and broken mountains, as well as by a nature that barely knows the action of man.
This eastern place of Cuba has been inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO thanks to its intact nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the cross of Columbus (actually it is a cross that came 100 years after the landing) and from the hill, where the castle was located and that now there is a hotel with the same name, you can see the mountains and among them the best known, the Anvil.
Coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Pinos, the Tropicana Cabaret, the patron saint of Cuba, the Virgen de la Caridad del Cobre, Santeria, an African religion practiced by the descendants of those slaves, could fill many pages.
However, as they say, it’s best to see it sometime.
Allies are passive in Afghanistan, Americans say
Few soldiers and insufficient equipment are what is influencing the progress of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to US Defense Minister Robert Gates, should draw up a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going as it was thought, agreed in Edinburgh (Scotland) the representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country.
As conflicts with the Taliban grow, today, the eight participating states discuss the plans and coordination of the allies.
While the United States this week through its defense minister, Robert Gates, encouraged NATO forces to increase activity, Britain sees as a priority strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and the distribution of development aid.
“Development in Afghanistan is palpable, but armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The next step is to make it possible for people themselves to start economic and security development," Defence Minister Des Browne told BBC radio.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan rebels according to U.S. military data is higher than in the last five years.
The number of violent actions grew compared to last year by 27 percent, and in Helmand province by up to 60 percent.
NATO countries have in Afghanistan around 40,000 troops of which a quarter are in the south of the territory.
However, for the United States, the allies have reached the same limit in terms of organization and equipment of the units.
They are calling for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to seriously think about concrete goals for the future and how we will achieve them," Gates said.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop also spoke in a similar vein today.
“I’m not happy to know what we have on earth and in heaven in Afghanistan.
We have ninety percent of the troops and equipment we would need, and that’s not much,” De Hoop told Reuters at the close of the three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the countries attending in recent months, the controversy prevails over whether all allies do their best in Afghanistan.
For passive was criticized, for example, Germany.
"The Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are in an area of minimal violence and the demands for struggle there are not as high as in ours, in the southern and eastern part of the country," Gates said.
The Sun tabloid this week called the German soldiers lazy.
"Afghan rebels discover that the Germans are playing while our boys are fighting," Sun wrote in footage accompanied by photographs of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild responded to the attack and posted a photograph where the British troops were playing a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
State debt to reach $1 trillion by 2009
For every Czech the state owes 84,000 crowns.
The total debt amounted in September to 842.7 billion kronor.
This year the government planned to lend itself 159.2 billion kroner.
However, at the beginning of December the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns thanks to the improvement of the evolution of the economy of the state budget.
The state debt of the Czech Republic grew at the end of September to 842.7 billion kroner.
In nine months of this year it increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
However, since June it has decreased by 13.4 billion kroner.
Thus today, the Ministry of economy confirmed its data on the debt of the state of early October.
For every Czech, the debt corresponds to 84,000 kronor.
For the whole of last year the State was indebted with more than 111 million crowns.
“For now, it seems that thanks to next year’s low deficit, we could pass the billion-kronor border until 2009.
Next year the debt should move between 900 billion and one trillion crowns," said David Marek, an economist at Patria Finance.
Next Finance economist Vladimír Pikora similarly sees it: “We could spend the trillion in 2009.
Exactly when that will depend on the next budget we don’t yet know.
If the situation on the political scene were to change and politicians were able to save, then it could be delayed to 2010.
But I don’t see that change,” he added.
Doubt grows
State debt creates debts in the central government and arises, above all, from the accumulation of the state budget deficit.
The state debt is paid by means of treasury bonds, state bonds, direct credits or for example loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state’s domestic indebtedness grew this year from 38.5 billion kroner to 719.4 billion kroner.
The foreign debt has so far grown from 1.7 billion kroner to 123.3 billion kroner.
The so-called tradable state debt at the end of September contained 803.3 billion kroner since June was reduced by 13.7 billion kroner.
The average maturity of state debt increased by 6.5 years.
Total year-on-year debt from the first to third quarter created 13 percent, which is huge given how the economy works.
It is interesting that growth is generated mainly from obligations where there is 20 percent growth.
It is bad that the debt grows but on the other hand it shows that it is going to be negotiated until there is a pension reform," Pikora said.
Better than expected
From the strategy of payments and debt management of the state for the year 2007 it is extracted that the government planned this year to lend itself 159.2 billion kronor.
At the beginning of December, the ministry reduced the plan by 152.8 billion crowns thanks to the improvement of the evolution of the state budget.
The amount is composed, above all, of the deficit of the state budget that this year will be 76 million crowns instead of the planned 91.3 billion crowns.
The rest consists of maximum resources planned for the Czech Consolidation Agency with some 13.3 billion kroner, the reserve of 10 billion kroner for pension payments, 43 billion kroner to finance state obligations and 1.8 billion kroner in payments on loans from the European investment bank.
Today he compared Khartoum in front of a court to have given a name to a teddy bear.
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced Thursday afternoon by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and expulsion, her lawyer said.
She was accused of letting 6- to 7-year-olds give the name Mahomet to a teddy bear when all depiction of the prophet of Islam is illicit.
It was a pity to be whipped.
The 54-year-old British schoolteacher at Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested Sunday at her home and charged with assaulting Islam and sedition under Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, following several complaints by parents of pupils to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually goes back to September, when this teacher asks her students, 6/7 years old, to choose a name for the class teddy bear.
“Eight names come out of the mouths of children, like Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” says school principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, after one vote in class, 20 children out of 23 have chosen Mohamed as their preferred name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have made a book for the class with the photo of the bear with the following legend "My name is Mohamed ".
The bear itself did not bear any label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the depiction of the prophet regarded as an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons’ Muslim colleagues, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, said he knew her well and would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, “sorry I just asked the kids to vote for a name,” it was just an “innocent mistake” according to him.
Opinion divided by numerous students of the school teacher who describe her as "very attentive to her students" and "who never talks about religion in class"..
Remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Britain, it is written in English with 14 different modes.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules concerning the use of this name?
Can we, for example, give it to a toy?
It is, of course, a matter of interpretation.
They have not reached an agreement on Wednesday on the future status of the province, during the last session of negotiations in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
On Wednesday morning, the Kosovo Serbs and Albanians ended a sixth and final session of discussions in Baden, Austria, without having been able to overcome their differences over the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the statute," European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger said during a news conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was "at stake", his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of negotiations.
“We do not foresee violence at the moment but we enter a very difficult period,” he added, noting that “evident tensions exist.”
End of mediation on December 10
The mediators of the troika, which includes the European Union, the United States and Russia, will go one last time on Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province populated by 90% Albanians could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko return their relationship to the United Nations Security Council by December 10.
The Baden talks, near Vienna, were the sixth and final session of negotiations since the troika was tasked with a new UN mediation last August.
Americans and Europeans believe their mediation will end on Dec. 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked in the Security Council the granting of independence in Kosovo, insist on a pursuit of negotiations beyond this deadline.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," Botsane-Khartchenko said.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence?
After eight years of UN administration of Kosovo, Westerners see independence under European Union supervision as the only viable solution.
Pristina feels ready to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not resolve in its favour.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been found," Fatmir Sejdiu, president of Kosovo's autonomous authority, announced at the Baden hotel where these "last chance negotiations" had been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, a former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future prime minister of the province, has expressed some of his regrets.
But he added that the plan of autonomy presented by Belgrade "belonged to a past that has led to homicides and deportations."
" Domino Effect "
Serbian President Boris Tadic said a compromise was always feasible, warning Kosovo’s Albanian majority against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province’s independence.
Belgrade particularly says it fears a " domino effect " in a region still weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
“For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible.”
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that every decision belongs exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has a right of veto.
" The Parliament of Kosovo shall have the last word "
"Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
" These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must end as they began: in the Security Council. "
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had responded that " the Kosovo Parliament will have the final say on status " , adding that any unilateral declaration of independence on the part of Albanians would be made " in concert " with the Westerners.
Bush starts an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced at the opening of his international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland, on Tuesday that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a common declaration.
He said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately enter into negotiations in view of finding a definitive regulation of the 60-year-old contentious point between their two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" by the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must dismantle " terrorist infrastructure " and Israel must end its colonization activities, Bush declared, reminding both sides of their obligations regarding the peace itinerary they accepted in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would attempt “to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues, without exception, including core issues.”
This name covers the three main thorny issues of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Taking the floor after the American president, Abbas insisted that the coming negotiations be “global and in-depth” and refer to all aspects of a regulation, citing “Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things.”
Upon his return to the rostrum, Olmert pledged to make the upcoming negotiations "direct and continuous" and to make "an effort to conclude them over the course of 2008."
Bush set the end of 2008 for the implementation of his Palestinian and Israeli " two-state vision " of coexistence.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had made an effort in this regard on the part of Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose involvement in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a blueprint, endorsed by all Arab countries, that proposes to Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks “a point of confrontation in the history of the Middle East, more particularly because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its core aspects,” Prince Saoud said in his Arabic newspaper interview with Saudi capitals.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened last Sunday?
As well as every time in this type of events, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the General Inspectorate of the French National Police (IGPN), a police car was on the road on Sunday, shortly after 17:00, rue Luisa-Miguel, to Villiers-le-Bel.
"He was not in intervention but on patrol, and he was traveling at 40-50 km/h, without a rotating headlight," explains a police source.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, " not homologated, that is not authorized to circulate on public roads " (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, circulated " at full gas ".
"He hit the police car on the left side, after a breach of the yield the right way," the police said.
The breathalyzer control performed on the occupants of the vehicle was negative.
The condition of the car (defrosted front, cracked windshield, ripped bumper) testifies to the violence of the crash.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the Attorney General of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that she had entrusted an investigation into " acts of involuntary manslaughter and denial of aid " to the IGPN, which had been seized from the departmental directorate of public security in Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor said that the IGPN investigation, at this stadium, ruled out the responsibility of the police officers.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, understood on Sunday afternoon, confirmed "the version of the policemen, namely that this mini-motorcycle arrived relatively quickly to their left."
Yesterday, a type of groove, undoubtedly caused by the rubbing of the shoes on the ground, showed that both vehicles had been locked in the time for the police car to come to brake.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of both victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after?
Yesterday, a rumor circulated quickly through Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police would have left the site very quickly, thus not providing help to both young people.
The IGPN, being prudent, would also set aside " any serious misconduct " on this point.
"It's the most difficult aspect of the investigation, which needs more investigations, which you have to be very cautious about," a law enforcement source said.
Liberation found an eyewitness to these few moments that have followed the accident.
One of its windows that precisely faces the scene.
"We immediately went down, with my cousin who is a nurse to the hospital, to try to resuscitate them," says this witness.
There was nothing to do.”
Then he saw "a completely panicked, limping policeman.
Two others were trying to revive one of the young men, the fourth was talking on the phone.”
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, it seems, to the certainty that people were present of the unexpected situation of the young people, the policemen have been taken by car by colleagues who had arrived at the site.
Always according to this witness, the relief arrived "about twenty minutes after the march of the police".
They also performed cardiac massages, to no avail.
" I will not allow it to be assumed that the police services did not provide assistance to the young people.
These young people have been helped.
Firefighters arrived at once.
Everything has been done to try to save them,” the prosecutor stressed for his part.
Tensions rise in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday cracked down on the first demonstrations since the state of emergency was declared two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the eastern city of Lahore, about 2,000 lawyers protesting against the state of emergency have been injured by tear gas grenades used by law enforcement, witnesses said.
The latter replied with shots of stones, injuring policemen.
At least 350 lawyers have been questioned.
Scenes similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police charged and injured lawyers.
Many would have been questioned.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of about 500 arrests over the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets that gave access to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the grouping.
Other demonstrations reportedly took place in Multan (center) and in Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers' movement on Monday picked up support from religious parties regrouped in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose president "called on the population to send flowers to the judges who pronounced themselves against the state of emergency and the waste to which they took the oath in front of Musharraf."
" Musharraf's promise no longer fulfills "
The Pakistani Supreme Court is directly concerned with the emergency measure proclaimed on Saturday afternoon.
He had to pronounce himself in the coming days on the legality of the re-election to the presidential elections, on October 6, to the indirect suffrage of President Musharraf.
Court President Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry has been removed and replaced.
"Everything we attend is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the rulings of the Supreme Court," the judge told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's pledge to leave the army and become a civilian president " does not value it any more" after the state of emergency was introduced, he told Tariq Azeem, the assistant information minister, on Monday.
He was expected to leave his military uniform by Nov. 15, the end of his first presidential term.
The assistant information minister also confirmed that the January elections could be moved.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government denied insistent rumors in the country according to which President Musharraf would have been assigned to residence by his deputy head of armies.
More than a third of pregnancies remain unplanned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unplanned births.
Still today, more than one pregnancy in three (36%) is not planned, reveals a study led by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the Neuwirth law vote that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unplanned births.
Different methods of contraception such as the pill or the sterilet still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, Ined estimates.
The liberalization of contraception however allowed for a better "fertility dominance", according to the institute which notes that the pill use rate among women aged 20 to 44 is up from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
At last, eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
Even calculated roughly a month for a couple out of five and if possible for spring, season judged as the most enjoyable to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It will have taken more than seven hours of work in space for astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates on the International Space Station (ISS) to make the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel indispensable for the continuation of the station’s scientific activities.
A risky exit that accumulated the records because of its duration, its distance from the habitable modules, the speed with which it has been imagined, instruments "splattered" by the astronauts to make the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday then that the astronauts had released from the shuttle Discovery the module Harmony, a thick cylindrical piece in charge of hosting soon the European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see framed).
This module is a type of landing platform for laboratory modules.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move an electricity production module with solar panels weighing 17.5 tons, already present on the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After having displaced it, the crew began the reorganization of the solar panels of the module that have a wingspan of 76 meters.
And it’s where one of the panels, which unfold like accordions, has been damaged in just over a meter by a cable that jammed.
Deployment has been stopped so as not to further damage the panel.
The astronauts, who initially had to make a control exit from the Discovery shuttle, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it is Scott Parazynski who has been chosen to go snailing at the end of the 30-meter-long remote-controlled arm of the shuttle added to the station to perform the repair.
It's one of NASA's best spacewalkers.
Tall, tough, very skilled, it has a highly developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training doctor has been commissioned to "operate" the "wounded" solar panel.
After having precisely inspected the damage, he severed the fallible cable and installed types of "tablets" in the damaged area.
He had been helped by the second "spacewalker" who had stayed close to the airlock and, from the inside, by other astronauts such as Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini hockey stick wrapped with insulator to prevent electrocution in solar panels that produced several hundred volts, has been conceived and "splattered" by astronauts aboard the station.
Once the operation was over, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before taking inventory of his instruments and returning to the interior of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts took advantage of a midday break before today, seven astronauts return from the Discovery shuttle for the scheduled return to Earth on Wednesday.
The sanctioned EADS title on the Stock Exchange
The EADS stock is currently on a sharp decline on the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aeronautics and defense group has announced it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to cope with the A400M delays.
EADS loses 4% to 21.96 euros currently on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group has been forced to revise its 2007 operating outcome forecast in response to delays engendered by the slow progression of the A400M’s engine development, which conditions the aircraft’s maiden flight.
The cost to alleviate the delay taken in the delivery of the military transport aircraft, announced in October, amounts to "between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros of which more than 1 billion for Airbus", announced the mother house of the European builder EADS.
Because of these burdens, EADS will be forced to announce new operating result targets (EBIT) for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, it adds without any more encrypted precision.
The group also indicates that the estimate of the new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
It should be remembered that EADS’ operational result failed by 86% in 2006, mainly because of burdens linked to the delays of another programme, that of the very thick carrier A380.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
No surprise on Sunday, at the exit of the ballot boxes: the Russians are going to opt massively for the party of President Poutine, united Russia.
Confirming his aspiration for stability, even authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
Three days before the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today addresses to voters a televised message on public networks, already registered but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as leader of the list for united Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory proves overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president left nothing to be revealed by receiving foreign ambassadors, contenting himself with delivering a new charge against the West accused of meddling - his theme of predilection during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy and we want honest, more transparent and more open elections, elections without incident," he added.
According to the opposition, we are far from the truth.
He denounces a campaign marred by pressure.
Communist leader Gennadi Ziouganov says there are "never had elections so dirty, even in the time of Eltsin."
After the repression of the demonstrations last weekend, the former world champion checker Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, visits are prohibited according to his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the mentality of Soviet homo"
Behind these unsurprising legislative elections are two far more open questions:
Who will succeed Poutine to the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; the candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and reelected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot apply for the third consecutive term.
Then no successor emerges.
What role will Poutine play after March?
Prime Minister?
Head of the parliamentary majority and of the very powerful united Russia party that would elect the government and the president?
Whatever it is, in legislative and presidential elections, outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
“The Russians kept the mentality of the homo sovieticus, they don’t feel they own their destiny,” estimates sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent Levada center.
Historian Nikolay Kopossov of St. Petersburg State University goes back further: civil society fell behind in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of community delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Poutine restored the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population since this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic relief," estimates Maria Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians " willingly renounce personal responsibility " for those who had briefly proved themselves after the outbreak of the USSR.
"Why reflect?"
The phenomenon touches all social layers, including the world of affairs.
And the administrative elite plans to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of every 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of the united Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
Opinion prefers stability.
In the name of Russians not voting for extremists either.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, 54-year-old teacher: "Why reflect?
Those in power aren’t too bad, why change them?”
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of secrecy, the Bad Arolsen Nazi archives, which describe the fates of 17.5 million Hitler regime victims, are freely accessible.
The 47 million archival documents, stored on 27 km of shelves in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were thus far not consultable only for a "humanitarian" purpose, that is, individually and nominatively, at the request of a former victim or his successors.
The eleven States in charge of its management - such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to seekers and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive Information
Historians’ access to Bad Arolsen will make it possible to search “particularly on the movements of prisoners, the population of camps and the state of health of forced labourers,” explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives administered by the International Red Cross Commission (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, such as Germany, were opposed to the opening to the public of these nominative documents, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
As well as the supposed homosexuality or mental handicap of certain victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or of the detention orders established by the Gestapo had been gathered after the war for a practical purpose: to find the countrymen deported or subjected to compulsory labour and, eventually, to provide them with proof of their internment, in order to open the way to their compensation.
Still today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent wage earners deal with tens of thousands of individual petitions.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to be expected from these documents," Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Research Centre on Antisemitism at the Technische Universitat in Berlin, had stated in 2006.
European Union and India want to reach free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, Indo-European bilateral trade already reaches about 60 billion euros a year.
The European Union is India’s first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath.
Last April, EU foreign ministers gave their approval to the European Commission to start negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The European Union is India’s first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
LEU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the European Union’s 9th trading partner, according to figures from the European Commission.
"A free trade pact will doom both economies enormously" and "India would improve its entry into a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," Peter Mandelson said.
Europe represents the first or the second market for each of the top ten products exported by India, said the European commissioner. The Asian and European giants exchange annually for "47 billion euros of goods " and for "ten billion euros of services ", had declared this week Danièle Smadja, head of the delegation of the European Commission in New Delhi, feeling that bilateral trade "has not yet reached its potential".

The Bank of England takes note of concerns by offering 10 billion pounds in five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday was worried about easing the current turnaround of concerns over credit conditions, and announced a 10 billion pound offer to the base index of 5.75% over five weeks, an offer of unusual duration.
"To alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight by the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its planned reserve contribution during the maintenance period beginning on December 6 in the form of a five-week open market operation," it said in a statement.
The bank notes that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put on the market on December 6 at 12:15 GMT, at the base index and until January 10.
It is the first time it seems that the bank England BoE puts on the market liquidities for five weeks in an open market operation.
These are usually done in a week.
The BoE adds in its statement that it " is prepared to take further steps to keep interbank lending rates " up-to-date in line with its base rate.
The interbank index per day was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The index after three months was set at 6.6 percent, the highest since Sept. 18.
Since the start of the summer financial crisis, the sums put on the market by the Bank of England were combined to a major penalty rate that had deterred banks from resorting to it.
According to some rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the change of the pound in relation to the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums brought to the market by the European Central Bank, to the most advantageous indices and with a more assured discretion.
UMP and NC parties deny examination of PS party proposals on purchasing power
The UMP group and Nouveau Centre on Thursday refused to discuss articles of the proposed socialist law on purchasing power, which amounts to a dismissal of the text.
Registered in a socialist "niche" (meeting for the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the national office of the PS among which the 50% increase in the bonus for employment, the restoration of the TIPP (internal rate for petroleum products) floating, a check-transport or restrictions on rents.
Since UMP and NC have voted against the examination of the articles (180 voices against 115), the session has been adjourned at the end of the general discussion that resulted in exchanges, sometimes lively, between majority and opposition a few hours after Nicolas Sarkozy’s televised intervention on purchasing power.
PS Jean Marc Ayrault MP announced that his group would represent the integrity of its proposals in the form of amendments to the draft amending finance bill considered by the Assembly next week.
A new festival comes to light
Following numerous rumors regarding the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
“For our company, it’s an honor to work with a person who inspired, no more, no less, the current festival movement in America,” Charlie Jones of C3 told Billboard.com.
C3 produces Chicago’s Lollapalooza festival and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer camping destination.
The festival would take place Aug. 8-10 on a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Once known as Mean Fiddler, Republic Festival director Melvin Benn is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the helm of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts some 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio then, in 2006, the Republic Festival created the Henham Park Latitude Festival in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organisation of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177 500 people.
Calling Glastonbury “the most inspiring event” he has ever attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says his company and Melvin Benn’s work in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
“We had chosen Philadelphia as a marketplace and were working persistently with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia,” says Charlie Jones.
"We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we are stuck in low-grade policies because of the current administration, Charlie Jones pursues.
“Fortunately, we were able to argue with Melvin Benn and we prepared to create a magnificent festival at an exceptional site that, lately, will take place in Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at Chicago’s Grant Park, having broken out of the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded respective gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban environment.
“Melvin Benn’s European model is a country festival, while ours are held in urban green areas,” says Charlie Jones.
The goal is to merge, in one way or another, both formulas to give both a country festival impression to the European and urban way to the American way.”
Vineland is roughly halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the celebration of this event,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the conditions of the agreement, but states "that they are quite interesting to allow investing in such an event and to host a festival that, we hope, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the festival’s hotel offer is “very big,” compared to the 80,000-strong Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that invitations have been issued to the groups, but that nothing could yet be confirmed at the time of going under press.
“Vineland will have the taste of rock, but the music will be varied there, hoping to attract all kinds of viewers,” says Charlie Jones.
His fellow C3, who received the Top Independent Promoter award from the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal takes on Terminator
It’s not easy to lure the dishes of Hollywood movies into Montreal when nothing but the Terminator opposes that...
This mission of seduction is part of the functions of delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "runaway productions".
Is it hard to compete with the Governor?
“You have to be cautious, it’s the industry that decides where it goes.
If you find that conditions in Montreal are favorable, you will go there.
Our role is to offer the ones that will judge the best,” he says.
The Race to the Festivals
For the moment, Denis Turcotte’s priority is nonetheless the promotion of cinema here.
The race to the Oskars is started.
All festivals on the West Coast, whether it’s Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to present the Quebecese films, give them value and make sure that the filmmakers do interviews.
The Dark Ages had a good image at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is slated for Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films to the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally on the stock market? The experts, divided by the 'subprime' crisis.
With less than five weeks to go until the end of the year, investors are already rubbing their hands waiting for the traditional year-end rally to arrive.
However, this year experts are not so clear that this will occur.
Banif believes that "statistically, the month of December on the stock market usually has a positive behavior.
However, it is not advisable to make forecasts based solely on statistics, even more so because in the current context, uncertainties lurk in the markets, at least in the short term.
Although they are not in favor of the stock market taking a run in the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is sustained by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of fleeing to quality values in both the long and short tranches."
Therefore, they believe that the stock market will have a rather lateral behavior, not exempt from volatility "especially because the impact of the probable decline in the Fed rates is not known, given the high level of oil and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions."
Javier Barrio, head of sales at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is not a good time to venture to say that there will be a rally.
“It’s not the case for many joys,” says the expert.
The Ibex index has fallen nearly 4 percent since Nov. 8 highs when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
Still, not all experts have such a negative view.
Juan Solana, analyst at Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year closer to 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of the portfolios and the traditional contributions to the pension plans that occur every year at this time.
However, the expert clarifies that things will be somewhat different this year since he believes that the rally will be ahead of the second week of December, after the Constitution bridge.
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, appreciates that we are close to technical levels and “so we could see a rebound in the index that could be boosted depending on the news coming from the United States regarding the consequences of the crisis in the credit market.”
The analyst is confident that these are positive.
Analysts agree when choosing the values that will be responsible for taking the Ibex to new maximum levels.
Intermoney’s Solana says it’s “all about great values this year.”
The expert would include in the portfolio the two large banks and some construction companies "because when the date arrives, the electricity sector will be very expensive."
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha, from Inversis Banco assures that the increases will come from the hand of the banking and the industrial sector.
Construction companies will also be able to benefit from this rally, if any.
“ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we expect other construction companies such as Ferrovial and FCC to follow suit,” explains the expert.
Cyclical consumption will take center stage in the latter part of the year due to increased sales in the holiday sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology will also do very well although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, on just two occasions December has been a bearish month.
The real year-end rally took place in 2003, an exercise in which the stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the puncture of the technological bubble.
This year, in which the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December registered a rebound of 6.68%.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of gains (for the moment the Ibex rises by 8.36% since January) and if it manages to count on its year-end rally.
Popular will open 200 offices 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
Popular has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
In total 200, located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a great change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish entities, since it is the first group that decides to take the leap to bet on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 20.30 in the afternoon, and open on Saturdays from 10 am to 20.30 pm.
Another group that has also reiterated on several occasions that it wanted to extend the hours of its branches, BBVA, has not yet decided to take the step.
Meanwhile, it is about to close a deal with unions to close 75 percent of its offices on Saturdays in exchange for opening an afternoon, though not to the public.
The results of Popular’s experience will be decisive for other entities to sign up or not to this initiative that supports the schedules of the shops.
This is precisely the objective that Popular pursues with the project.
Capture private customers who move through these areas to make their purchases, SMEs, freelancers and shops on the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 offices open throughout Spain in about 18 months, since they are not new openings but remodeling of the existing ones.
To do this, the entity will modernize the branches it already has in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile presented by the customers of the different streets.
In this way, the extension of the schedules is accompanied by a different conception of the branch space and a new design, more current, with brighter colors.
The head of commercial banking, Ángel Rivera, assures that this restructuring does not involve a large investment, although a greater hiring of personnel, since it goes from having about six employees per premises to eight or nine.
The offices, which will even have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its initiative in three offices in Madrid.
And the experience has been positive, according to Ángel Rivero.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía in Madrid have been chosen, and it seems that with success, according to Rivero.
Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 that operate under the Mundocredit brand, specializing in immigrants, also with very wide schedules, which even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax locations, they will not repeat the BBVA model, where several of their offices have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
“We don’t want to compete with our customers,” Rivero says.
So far, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with personnel outside the bank.
Telecinco doubles for the first time the stock market value of its rival Antena 3
We've made it.'
With that phrase he expressed yesterday his satisfaction Paolo Vasile, CEO of Telecinco, at the close of the market, when he noticed that the chain he runs doubled the value of its rival, Antena 3.
Only one aspect tarnished his joy: 'It's what hurts me, it's not because we've grown more but because we've gone down less,' he said.
Still, he stressed that in a weak market, “we’ve fallen less.”
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with an advance of 2.54%.
That gain puts its loss so far this year at 15.66%.
The stock market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and owned by Vocento (another 13%) thus reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to Bloomberg data.
Its rival Antena 3, which yesterday gave 1.52% and accumulates a decrease of 40.5 % since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other listed media companies amounts to 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518.53 million Prisa (Cinco Días editor) and 1,779 million Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is because 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do, in the same market, at what cost and how we monetize it in terms of audience.
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become the first television network this year to exceed 1 billion gross advertising revenues, according to Giuseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages the group’s advertising.
If this announced data becomes real, the television network would register an increase of 3.6% in its advertising turnover compared to 965.4 million in 2006.
Meanwhile, Antena 3’s net turnover increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (to reach 734.4 million) while net television revenues grew by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point out for the best relative evolution on the Telecinco Stock Exchange is the high pay out that it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile says that, although it is early to make the decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol in association with its Mediaset parent.
“We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to make our shareholders happy, which we have already given value to with 33% of Endemol’.
According to analysts, the market is showing signs of some fatigue at the moment.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates on Telecinco in 2008 by 4% and in 2009, by 7%.
This is due, they explain, to the fact that it has cut its expected revenue growth from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
This same firm has lowered Antena 3’s profit forecast by 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
Ibersecurities: recommends buying both securities based mainly on their high dividend yield and sustainable long-term potential.
2.
Caja Madrid: see Telecinco (accumulate) better than Antena 3 (hold) for the 'attractive multiples' and business boost.
3.
JPMorgan: recommends underweighting in both cases by having 'similar threats' (saturated market and worse economic climate).
The Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which entered into force 1 November
In parallel with its parliamentary process, which ended today with the vote by Congress on the amendments incorporated into the bill in the Senate, the Government has submitted to a public hearing the regulations that will develop the new law, with the objective that both enter into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the different groups agreed to highlight the effort made by deputies and senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulations in order to guarantee the protection of investors and regulate in detail the activity of the entities so that the markets work efficiently.
The Mifid, which modifies the Securities Market Law, involves the modernization of financial markets, while strengthening investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the different supervisors of the European Union.
The new rules will allow financial advisory services to be provided to specialised firms as well as to natural or legal persons and creates a new type of financial services firms (ESIS), financial advisory companies (AFI), which join securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it expands the number of systems for the execution of transactions in financial instruments, so that regulated secondary markets are added multilateral trading systems and systems of internalization of orders, which will compete with the current stock exchange managers.
The Act also requires investment firms to disclose information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and forms of risk management to the market and requires them to keep a record of all transactions they undertake, in order to facilitate supervision by the CNMV.
In its passage through the Committee on Economics of the Congress, several modifications were incorporated, among which it stands out that the securitised debts are considered as a "complex" financial instrument given their high danger to the investor, which has been demonstrated with what happened with the debt of subprime mortgages.
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to legally delimit the functions that graduates can perform in Economics and Business 30 years after the Royal Decree was approved in 1977 that delimits the professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as the mediator, who will work for others, will not require the authorization of the CNMV and will be able to provide its product marketing and customer acquisition services to different investment companies at the same time.
Harmonized CPI rises five-tenths in November to 4.1%
This indicator, which later serves Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation index in the European Union, provides an advance of how prices evolved in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to offer data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advance indicator is calculated using the same procedure as that used for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, so it does not necessarily have to coincide with the final data, which will be released on December 14.
"The CPI will continue at relatively high levels"
The second vice president and Minister of Economy, Pedro Solbes, has affirmed that the rise in the CPI by 4.1% in November is a "temporary figure", but at the same time he has predicted that the price index will continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case Solbes has pointed out in the halls of Congress that "although the figure is not good" the differential of inflation of Spain with respect to the monetary union remains "more or less" the same of recent years.
He also explained that in November "there has been less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government did not have such a high rise.
"We expected a figure around 4%," said the minister of Economy regarding the data advanced today.
Virgin plans to raise 42 billion euros with Northern Rock in three years
Northern Rock’s deposits have fallen more than 50 percent to 12 billion pounds since it went into crisis in mid-September and had to draw on an emergency loan from the Bank of England.
At that time it amassed a record deposits above 25 billion pounds, a figure that has fallen progressively in two and a half months due to the distrust of its customers and despite the guarantee of one hundred percent of that money offered by the Government and that it will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rename the entity with its financial brand Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the income in British banks that are deposited in the next three years to achieve the remaining 18 billion pounds until reaching the target of 30 billion.
The group of billionaire Richard Branson, known for its eye-catching advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) annually on advertising and marketing to achieve its purpose.
Northern Rock this week named Virgin’s three-company consortium offer as its preferred way to bail it out of bankruptcy.
The mayor of Totana arrested for alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested today early in the morning the current mayor of the Murcia municipality of Totana (of the Popular Party) for his alleged relationship with the plot of urban corruption uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the consistory and the chief of police of the municipality have also been arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced last May Juan Morales, current popular deputy, and until then councilor of the municipality, and that according to sources of the investigation consulted by Cadena SER, could be the 'leader' of this plot.
The agents continue to search the municipal offices and the council of Urbanism and no more arrests are ruled out in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the urban corruption plot uncovered earlier this week, has been charged.
As the Cadena SER reported yesterday, the lawyer of the 'popular' deputy Juan Morales, therefore abolished, was arrested leaving Morales' home with important documentation related to the plot.
Moreover, the object of the investigation, according to sources of the investigation, is the alleged collection of commissions from Morales in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to requalify 200 hectares of land.
So far, eight people have been detained.
Bono agrees to lead the PSOE candidacy for Toledo and preside over the Congress if they win the elections.
Former Minister of Defense José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to head the list of the PSOE for Toledo for the next general elections and be president of the Congress in the event that the Socialists win the general elections.
This was announced at a press conference by the Secretary of Organization of the PSOE, José Blanco, and Bono himself, after the meeting he has held this noon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The head of the Executive has justified the offer to the former minister because "it is important to have the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, he has pointed out that "it seems" that the politician from La Mancha will be the candidate of the socialist group to preside over the Congress if the socialists win in the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as president of the Congress, who made public on November 15 his decision not to run in the next general election and to abandon his career in active politics to dedicate himself to fight against climate change in the university environment.
The former minister has acknowledged that the president of the Government has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he abandoned it two years ago.
In addition, he pointed out that, just as citizens know who will be the economic vice president if the PSOE wins the elections, his party has wanted to announce who will preside over the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he reaches office, Bono hopes to turn the House into "the house of respect and not of insult or shouting" and make it "more and more like the citizens."
"Sometimes unfortunately it seems that the only place in Madrid where you can not talk quietly and calmly is the Congress, the president of the Government was interrupted in the Senate 26 times."
Likewise, he has had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his good work" and has not wanted to see himself already occupying his position so as not to fall into what, as he has pointed out, his adversaries could see as "prepotence".
Climate Propaganda
As the climate movement mercilessly pursues both those skeptical of its predictions and those who prioritize other political and social battles, it is bound to show iron consistency.
And more a leader of the movement who is president of the Government as Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and even proposes to sign a "new contract with the planet".
That approach forces him to explain why his government’s action, or inaction, has contributed decisively to Spain leading the EU in breach of Kyoto.
Who is responsible for the non-compliance, in which sectors it has occurred and why his government, that of the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it requires you to explain with the utmost clarity to the Spanish what measures you will take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what citizen habits will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be obliged to make, what economic consequences it will have.
That is, who will sacrifice and who will pay to save the planet.
But there has not been and will not be such explanations.
Precisely because it is about sacrificing and paying.
The measures against climate change, the real measures, are unpopular.
Costly, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and individuals.
Even the gasoline penny suggested by the PSOE has seemed so electorally dangerous to Zapatero that he has been quick to deny it.
That is, it is about saving the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With shocking phrases, commissions, committees, protocols, new positions.
With contracts with the planet, that gentleman so useful for electoral campaigns that he neither speaks nor denounces nor demands, but adorns the rallies and inspires tenderness.
Provided that it is limited to being a merely virtual contracting party and does not intend that we move by bicycle or cool ourselves with the fan.
The mayor and the head of the local police of Totana are arrested for an alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested the mayor of the Murcia town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local Police, the secretary of the City Council and a hotel entrepreneur for possible urban crimes, sources of the investigation have reported today.
The mayor was arrested in his home and has been transferred to the Consistory, in whose dependencies he is at the moment together with numerous agents, who have also gone to the Department of Urbanism and the municipal company of management of Industrial Land and Housing.
These three arrests are in addition to the six made last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of rustic land in developable for the Galician company Nuaria to build 4,000 homes, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other people were not arrested but are charged in the case, which is being investigated by the Court No. 1 of Totana.
The first six detainees were brought to justice today.
According to sources, the former councilor of Totana and today an autonomous member of the PP, Juan Morales, is being investigated.
In addition, the former woman, owner of a real estate agency registered today in Totana, has been charged, as has the current girlfriend of the former councilor, who resides in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and businessman Manuel N.A. from Vigo, was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as was Pablo José M.G., director of Soil of Inmonuar, an agency integrated in the aforementioned Group, and through which the bribes would have been carried out.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the Civil Guard, whose agents, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven searches, most of them in companies related to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
A single person was then arrested in Totana, specifically, the owner of a poultry company well known in the region, which could have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was in charge of developing what would be the largest residential complex in the Murcia municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 homes, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana that were reclassified and its project would double the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group integrates companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, dedicated to real estate development; Conycase, which manages the Vigo car parks in Coruña, Venezuela and Plaza de Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, dedicated to the direct marketing sector; Preconiza, focused on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with this comment yesterday in the most important newspaper in Finland (by the way at the head of the PISA report on educational level in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day that there appeared, curiously, the criticism of Blackburn’s book:
"The content of the signature of Philosophy has leapt into public opinion in the wake of the tragedy of the Jokela school.
The culprit of the deaths, a high school student, cited in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Minister of Education in charge of the subject of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded from the pages of the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato and affirmed that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in institutes.

A colleague passes information on the introduction of Internet download offences in the Penal Code:
A. Downloading a song would be a crime punishable by six months to a year.
On the other hand, if you steal discs worth less than 400 euros in the store, it is considered simply missing (article 623.1).
B. If you steal in the store up to 1,000 euros, theft is already a crime, but the penalty remains lower than that imposed on the download (article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is still lower than the discharge (article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the exchange of compacts.
Participating in a tumultuous fight is punishable by three months to one year (article 154 of the Penal Code) and the exchange would be punishable by six months to two years.
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a movie on DVD, according to article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of films protected by copyright and without the authorization of the authors is more punished than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (article 186).
Anyway, if my colleague's right, someone's getting out of hand, a very long hand.

My family doctor gave me one of his articles on rare research entitled: ‘Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less’.
That is, the feelings generated by the monthly salary of the workers depend on what the colleagues earn.
The study has been performed using tomographic magnetic resonance imaging at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Neurocognition Imaging group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: “The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and their partner failed.”
The researchers observed that if when both received the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one received twice as much, the activation was greater.
I don’t know if this conclusion required so much science.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has spent eight years relentlessly pursuing Balkan war criminals from the prosecutor’s office of the Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, located in The Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla will leave with a bittersweet taste, because the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died -, former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are on that list from which the documentary by Swiss filmmaker Marcel Schpbach, 'Carla's List' (2006, not released in Spain) takes its title, which, with the rhythm of a police thriller, follows the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to persecute the fleeing criminals and pressure the governments involved to tighten the siege.
What insurance is right for me?
Car insurance, which covers the driver for possible accidents, is a significant expense that will depend on several factors, such as age, sex, age of the card, marital status, the type of vehicle to insure or the use of it, among others.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
First, we need to be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured.
This commitment is materialized in an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the agreed premium in exchange for being responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a loss.
The premium is the price of insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, age of the card, marital status, the type of vehicle to insure or the use that is given to it, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so that the more likely you are to suffer an accident, the higher the fee to be paid.
It is for that reason that both those over 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, since the statistics reflect that they have a lower accident rate due to their prudence.
Also, drawing on the tallies, companies have concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use that is given to the vehicle will influence the frequency, and therefore the probability of having some kind of mishap.
Increasing the frequency increases the odds.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the price of the premium.
That is why the driver has to study the situation well to choose the car insurance that best fits his profile.
We will expose here the most significant variables when choosing one or another type of insurance, so that this, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insured, offers a reasonable price.
Young people under 25 face various disadvantages when it comes to buying insurance at an affordable price, such as the reduced driving experience and the age of the card.
Although the ideal to be well insured is comprehensive insurance, there are other cheaper options.
The most cautious drivers can opt for an all-risk franchise, so that they get the coverages of an all-risk insurance but at a more feasible price.
This type of agreement would mean that the customer pays a part of the amount of the claim.
"The part of the amount of the claim contributed by the client will be preset according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount," specifies Luis Noguera, head of Spain of First Europa, online insurance mediator.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer is assured of protection against damage caused to third parties, although not those caused in their own car.
In addition, you would be covered for theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
A tip.
If you are under 25 try to be careful and avoid claims as much as possible, as this will affect the bonus, and may reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the base rate that the company owns.
On the contrary, a penalty is a surcharge on that base rate.
"Bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and the company's profit.
If the company has had a good year, it will be able to afford to increase bonuses,” Noguera said.
After 25 years drivers have it easier when taking out insurance, since the accident rate is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
For this reason, it is best to hire an all-risk franchise.
“Normally young people can not make use of the experience previously acquired when relying on an accident, and even when driving,” says the director in Spain of the European company, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, once the ‘fear of the novice’ has passed.
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children, it is preferable that he negotiates comprehensive insurance, as long as his economic situation allows it, of course.
On the other hand, marriages with children are considered by insurers as the public with the lowest accident rate, so the surcharges will be lower.
In this case the best insurance would be one at all risk with excess (this may be 300 euros), or, when a high level of bonus is available, one to third parties extended from the third year of life of the vehicle.
“They carry out a more relaxed driving and have a greater purchasing power to afford to assume a greater amount of franchise,” says Luis Noguera.
For retirees, it is recommended a full risk insurance with excess (this being 150 euros), or an extended third party when you have a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver before possible accidents, but also because it represents an important expense, which is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that best suits us according to our personal situation.
Celtic look to Milan for a point worth the eighths
Milan and Celtic are measured this Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point that they lack to achieve their respective objectives in the closing of the league of the 'Champions', since the Italians serve to be first and the Scots to sentence their classification.
The Italians have ten points and already certified in the fifth day his pass with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic have nine points, but still need another to ensure that Shakhtar, with six, and receiving Benfica, who has four, does not overtake him.
These two matches of Group D will be played a week before the end of the sixth day, as Milan have to play the Club World Cup in Japan, where it debuts on the 13th in the semifinals in search of a place for the final of the 16.
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and the tie at Giuseppe Meazza seems the most expected result, although the two teams will try to go out for a victory, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic knows that winning would be first and would ensure a better crossing in the round of 16.
Gordon Strachan’s side could even get a loss to qualify if Shakhtar don’t win, but they can’t be trusted because on nine points the pass is for the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanistas will try to make the night bitter for the Scots, who are hoping to get into the round of 16 for the second time in the restructured Champions League and consecutively, after they were precisely defeated in that round last season with a goal from Kaka in extra time (1-0) after the 0-0 of the first leg.
Waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' will be Shakhtar who is only worth the win, in the event that Celtic lose, both to get into the round of 16 and to continue in UEFA.
And is that Benfica, despite being last and without options to continue in the maximum European competition, could reach third place with a victory, which would play UEFA.
20,000 Attend First Spice Girls Tour Concert in Vancouver
The Spice Girls have kicked off in Vancouver, Canada, in front of some 20,000 spectators, their first tour since they disbanded in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) stated shortly before their gig at Vancouver's GM Place that the group reunion is "brilliant".
About 20,000 people sold out to watch the concert, which included a video telling the story of the group that was raging in the late 1990s.
The reunion and the world tour coincide with the release of a new album that includes his main hits as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which in Spain publishes EMI.
The five members of Spice Girls came on stage wearing bracelets given to them by Posh Spice’s husband, British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the crowd that crowded the GM Place, even though Victoria’s nerves had forbidden him days before.
Victoria Beckham said: “He hasn’t seen our costumes at all, so I’m nervous about what he’s going to think about the show.
'Sporty Spice' whose departure from the group in 1998 "because of the differences between us" caused the dissolution of the quintet two years later, also expressed his nervousness during a meeting with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that the feeling of the world has changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm glad I made the decision," Chisholm said of the group meeting she disbanded nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, “things have been fixed and we love each other very much.”
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
For starters, according to CTV television, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
Upon arrival at the airport, an army of nannies was waiting for them.
Among the five, there are seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will perform in California (USA), in San Jose (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
They will perform in Madrid on December 23.
New fears over gas between Russia and Ukraine
The growing dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk that it will affect Russia’s export of the fuel to Western Europe.
Most of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so every brush between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises the price of gas, Russia will have to pay higher transit fees.
An earlier dispute last year cut supplies to EU states.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and Russian state monopoly gas owner Gazprom trying to agree on how much money Ukraine was to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom said it will charge more to Ukraine, which has pledged to pay an extra 50 percent in 2008 for gas coming from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say it could be that Ukraine will pay 40% more for Gazprom imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important transits for gas during the talks," Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh told Reuters news agency.
“Changes in gas prices should not be related to our arguments about transit rate levels [towards Western Europe] via Ukraine.”
In the last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut off supplies to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a drop in exports to Western Europe, which quickly raised prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the EU’s supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supply from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet nations in Central Asia.
NHS 'must test foreign workers'
The Scottish NHS needs to monitor the criminal records of employees from outside Europe, a watchdog said.
Auditor General Robert Black’s recommendation came after a foreign doctor was found to be linked to the Glasgow airport attack in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish NHS has no idea exactly how many foreign staff it has.
However, his report pointed to other checks that are carried out correctly through a sample of five health authorities.
The auditor-general checked the number of foreign staff hired outside the European economic area in the wake of the Glasgow airport attacks.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at Paisley’s Royal Alexandra Hospital, was arrested at the airport after crashing a jeep at the gates of the airport terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who performed at the Old Bailey by video conference in October, charged in connection with the alleged car bombings in Britain.
NHS expects to conduct pre-employment checks on candidates, to ensure they meet the qualifications, experience and authorisation to work in the UK.
Although Scotland’s health board uses “Disclosure Scotland” to conduct criminal background checks, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside of Britain.
The auditor general’s report recommends, among other measures, that boards should be guided by the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with criminal controls in many countries outside Britain.
"Although we found some of the personal records with evidence of these controls, this is not a routine review," the report said.
Black states that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but notes that: "our report highlights areas that can be improved to ensure that the necessary information is available in the number of NHS foreign staff."
BMA Scotland President Dr Peter Terry said it was “very unlikely” that pre-employment checks could identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
“The report suggests that pre-employment checks work at NHS Scotland but it is unclear what the added value of the recommendations made is,” he explained.
Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreign nationals, most of them doctors and nurses.
But the auditor general cautioned that the number may be higher, in part because boards have trouble identifying which employees have indefinite residence authorizations.
The investigation also found that the verification procedures established by NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were being widely complied with.
This includes passport checks, work permit and qualification checks.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing the pre-employment policy and guidance for foreigners in the NHS.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: “It was of great interest that this work be carried out in the wake of the Glasgow Airport terrorist attack.
He added that the Scottish government, in conjunction with the health boards, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this will be reflected in the update of the pre-employment control guidelines for all working groups – including foreigners – which they planned to publish next month.
Joy Division dominates at film awards
Control, the biopic about late Joy Division vocalist Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including best picture.
The trophies were also given to Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until he was cast in the role of Curtis, for director Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebbell.
Actress Judi Dench was named best actress for the thriller "Notes of a Scandal."
And Bond star Daniel Craig won the variety award for putting a British film on the international stage.
The awards were presented at a ceremony at the Roundhouse in London.
Control follows Curtis' rise to fame with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, at the age of 23.
The film - in black and white - which features soundtracks by The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - was produced at just ?3,000.
But Dutch photographer Corbijn, already known for the iconic cover of U2’s two-award winning album Joshua Tree, also won – for best director and best debutant director.
Rock music was the center of another award-winner at the ceremony – like Julien Temple’s film about The Clash vocalist Joe Strummer, it won the award for best documentary.
The best actor award went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as a chauffeur for a London-based Russian mob boss in David Cronenberg’s Eastern Promises.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing hardball, received the Richard Jarris Award for his contribution to British cinema.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel “Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.”
Winstone said he was proud to receive that award, named in honor of Harris, star of Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
"It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors for people like me," he said.
“I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, it’s really an honor.”
The independent film awards, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa festival supporters and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia Arrests 208 Terrorists
Saudi Arabia says it has arrested 208 terrorist cell militants planning an imminent attack on oil facilities, as well as attacks on religious and security forces.
The state television of the world’s largest oil supplier said one of the cells was planning to smuggle missiles.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have mounted a campaign against the local monarchy, in alliance with the United States, since 2003 following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants made up of foreign residents was planning an attack on an oil facility in the eastern province, the TV report said.
Saudi Arabia created a 35,000-strong force to protect the Abqaiq facility, the world’s largest oil plant, after a failed al-Qaeda attack in 2006.
The report, citing a statement by the Saudi Interior Minister, said 18 of those arrested belong to a cell led by a “missile-launching expert” who has entered the country.
The minister said the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the country.
Another 22 of those arrested were planning assassinations of religious leaders and security forces.
The government warned religious leaders that they must be more active in stopping Saudis traveling to Iraq from joining as Al-Qaeda militants to fight allied forces and to back the Shiite Muslim government, which is considered heretical by the more extreme Saudi Sunnis.
Al-Qaeda militants are targeting many religious in Saudi Arabia who have been designated by authorities to support the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militants - recruited by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born al Qaeda leader, to harass the country's pro-Western government - targeted residences of foreigners associated with the government, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This was a great effort by the security forces, since five months of work," the spokesman for the interior minister told state television.
Those arrested also include a 16-person “media cell” in Medina whose goal was to promote “takfiri thinking” – the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims who support violence against Muslims deemed infidels and apostates.
The arrest includes 32 others accused of providing support and financial support to the militants.
Venus' climate may give insight into Earth's future
Venus may have once been a fitting place for life, scientists declared yesterday.
Data from an orbiting European spacecraft showed the planet more like an Earth twin than had previously been observed.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
The two planets are similar in size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus may have had conditions similar to those that made Earth a habitable planet, scientists now believe.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation and slower solar rotation sent Venus into a very different kind of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature is enough to melt lead and is eroded by hurricane-force winds and lightning storms.
The results from the European Space Agency's Venus Express, which has studied the planet for a year, offer an overview of how the Earth could develop catastrophic climate changes.
Professor Fred Taylor, from the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "It is becoming clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, when they are two such similar planets.
“Our new data make it possible to build a scenario in which Venus began as Earth, possibly with a habitable environment millions of years ago.”
Police seize 'enriched uranium'
One kilo of radioactive material, which they claim is enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The cash could not confirm whether it was enriched uranium but said it could have been sold for $1 million.
It still remains open
Mitt Romney says it’s unworthy for presidential candidates to answer the questions of a snow monkey.
However, Republican presidential candidates eventually agree to hold a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters record questions on video and send them for dissemination among the candidates.
None of the questions posed on Wednesday afternoon were more ridiculous than the snow monkey that asked Democrats about climate warming in the YouTube Republican Party debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected much of the state of the Republican party ahead of next year’s election.
It’s not known exactly how CNN producers, who co-sponsor the debate, chose YouTube videos to show aspiring candidates.
But the first half-hour of debate, the longest devoted to a single topic, focused on immigration.
The issue is one of the most potent topics for Republicans.
CNN called on a group of undecided voters to step up the dial when they heard ideas they liked: Issuers noticed spikes in approval when candidates spoke with extremist arguments.
The toughest exchanges of words of the night were between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, who has been leading the way in crucial polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin Romney’s reputation because he was soft on illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former Massachusetts governor of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
Both responded aggressively when asked if any candidate could support an “amnesty” (allowing illegals to regularize their situation and giving them the possibility of obtaining citizenship).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, settled on the issue.
Neither has the word to be nominated candidate, but both remain in the race perhaps because they both raised the issue of immigration before the others.
At least in immigration, and broadly speaking, candidates share views: increased surveillance at the borders, intolerance of illegal immigrants.
This topic, along with China’s fear of toxic toys and other foreign concerns, helps Republicans forget, or minimize, divisions between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate turned uncomfortable when other issues surfaced.
Giuliani was asked why he had supported gun control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney debated whether immersion in water should be considered torture.
One person asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to stumble into the position that while the Bible was his favorite book, he did not literally believe in the story of the Jonah and the whale.
Another person asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee – now, against all expectations, first in Iowa’s most recent poll, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism – said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When pressed to answer whether Jesus would be in favor, he laughed saying that Jesus was too smart to be a candidate in the election.
The race remains unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee is on the rise in Iowa, coinciding with liberal Ron Paul’s fundraising campaigns and his heated remarks from Wednesday’s debate.
The two have come out of the background, because the two wings of the party did not agree on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party early and convincingly with a winning message about the greatness of America, satisfying both wings of the party.
This time the match is divided and the result is far from clear.
Labour pains
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole to sink into; but still he emerges.
As political scandals continue in England, this one is not particularly interesting.
No influences seem to have been sold, no exorbitant hotel accounts in Paris, no sucking extramarital fingers.
But it has been revealed that a wealthy businessman has disguised contributions to the British Labour party of more than 650,000 pounds ($1.3 million) for about four years using fake names, and that the party did not denounce him.
Two months ago, when the prime minister shied away from calling for an election, stupidly insulting British intelligence by declaring that opinion polls did not influence his decision, the hope was that it would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead, like Vince Calbe, the liberal Democrat leads with increasing ingenuity, because the dreaded Mr. Brown has gone from being Stalin to being Mr. Bean.
The bailout of Northern Rock, a troubled bank, demonstrated regulatory weakness and poor judgment in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code have put business groups, together, against the government.
The tax authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an unimaginable administrative botch.
A trio of retired generals started a mutiny in the House of Lords, protesting against cuts in military spending: being ministers of the armed forces is, they claimed, a part-time job.
Now it’s David Abrahams’ multiple donations; Peter Watt, the Labour general secretary (and former accomplice) has already resigned.
None of this means Mr. Brown irrevocably walks out.
Governments may reach a tipping point after they find themselves unable to govern.
People don’t believe them as politicians, but they usually suspend their disbelief when a new batch takes over.
Once it is clear that the prime minister cannot improve things, that he does not have much time left, that suspension is over: public officials begin to fail; cabinet ministers are exposed; the press seeks bad news; and the government is put on the defensive and does not focus.
In one part, Brown’s position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders he cannot defend himself by arguing that he is new.
Although he wanted to disown Tony Blair, he was his senior lieutenant.
The problems of Northern Rock and the authority registration tax are related to the decisions Brown made as chancellor of the treasury.
And even when it’s not directly involved in Blairish mishaps – or “partner cash,” the investigation of political party funding – voters can assume it is.
However, Mr. Brown’s situation is not as bad as it seems.
The plates are not as bad as the Tories want to show.
As in Mr. Bean, no one has died, nor been directly scammed.
And the remedy, though painful, is to give what Mr. Brown’s naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political donation scandal is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations to charitable gifts, says he does not want public recognition for his benevolence.
This may be so, but the decision is not made by him.
The laws against anonymity for big political contributors are clear and exist for one clear reason: the public has a right to know who is buying access to those in power.
Mr. Watt, who said he heard about Mr. Abraham’s deal, and that it wasn’t illegal, will obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, head of fundraising who was asked about the donations in October.
But Mr. Brown is not involved so far: there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these performances, though the bulk of the payments were made after he took control of the office in June.
So far, the prime minister has done half the job.
He has been quick to condemn his party for breaking the law, but he is diluted in decision-making by a family matter, a commission of inquiry into the matter – led, to a large extent, by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, the morals are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it is a matter for the police.
In addition, there are other things that Mr. Brown must do, such as find a permanent and independent head for the Standards Commission in Public Life, as he has not had one for six months, and he must also push for genuine party funding reform.
This will require hard co-operative labour with the Tories, and perhaps a renunciation of the special financial situation with the unions – bitter measures for a partisan like Mr Brown.
But he must face some partisan facts.
Conservatives now have a good level of support in the polls; he has two years to win voters; and the only way he can move to victory is to act with impeccable probity and solid competition.
Sharks Cards
Is the subprime mortgage crisis infecting the American credit card market?
When there’s blood in the water, it’s only natural for a pair of dorsal fins to swim around excitedly.
Now that the American housing market is in crisis, predators have their sights set on the country’s credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate credit card losses could reach $99 million if the subprime mortgage crisis spreads other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of contagion are already visible.
There is an increase in both card charges and crime rates, which measures the proportion of balances that have not been written off or that are more than 30 days late respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken a $1.4 million charge on its U.S. consumer finance business, in part due to card borrowers’ weakness.
However, it is too early for panic.
Delinquency and delinquency are at low levels.
According to Moody’s, a rating agency, the third quarter crime rate of 3.89% was almost one percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the American bankruptcy law (2005) resulted in a sharp drop in bankruptcy applications, which in turn represent a large loss on credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore, delinquency) would be growing again, or it may happen that the conditions for borrowers were worsening.
The industry also reports strong payout rates, which show how much of its debts consumers pay each month.
And confidence in credit cards and asset-backed securities is pretty firm, despite paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that emission volumes for 2007 will be about 25% higher than last year.
The direct infection channels of the crisis between subprime mortgages and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers like to charge credit card debts now that lenders are expiring.
But credit card issuers look more at the flow of liquidity than active securities, so falling prices don’t necessarily trigger a change in borrowers’ creditworthiness.
They can even work to get ahead of the emitters.
Incentives for consumers to continue amortizing the mortgage decrease if the properties are worth less than the value of the loan; and as a result, the payment of the card debt goes up in the priority list.
Card issuers can also respond quickly and flexibly to the difficult conditions that mortgage lenders face by changing interest rates or altering credit balances.
That should in theory reduce the risk of a rapid asset price cut.
“We’re not going to wake up one day and reassess all the loans,” says Gary Perlin, chief financial officer at Capital One.
If a sudden subprime infection in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If home prices are lower and a credit crunch pushes America into recession, the industry undoubtedly faces a more severe future.
Those dorsal fins need to be monitored further.
British bankers found guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who went on trial for their responsibility in the frauds with the former head of Enron’s financial office, Andrew Fastow, were found guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocent of seven counts of fraud for colluding with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of employees.
They were sent to trial in January.
But during the hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each was convicted of collusion in fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich Natwest, a unit of the Scottish PLC group at the Royal Bank, became notorious in Britain for extradition proceedings that lasted two years.
In the United States, his case marks the loose end of an investigation launched after the 2001 Enron collapse.
Initially, the charges against the bankers were to have alerted Fastow in 2002 that he was the target of a government investigation into the fall of Enron.
The indictment against the bankers - dubbed the "NatWest Three" - alleges that they came to Houston in 2000 to concoct a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his former top aide, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron company controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of a myriad of frauds at Enron, which helped its spiraling bankruptcy.
In 2002, the bank valued the subsidiary’s interest at zero, but the three Britons knew it would appreciate upwards.
A company under Kopper’s control bought the subsidiary’s bank interest for $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for interest on the company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely represented Enron, as the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its portions of the subsidiary.
But the 20 million remained in the hands of the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers charged $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received about $12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow was convicted on two counts of conspiracy in the collapse of Enron.
The trio of Britons were arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a 6-year sentence in a Louisiana federal prison.
Kopper is serving a three-year, one-month sentence in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay the $1 million they required to live in the United States while the trial was taking place.
Enron, one of the nation’s seven largest companies, declared bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, could not hide the debt of millions or make its failing businesses seem successful.
The collapse lost thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in market values and more than two million in pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were charged last year for their roles in the company’s collapse.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay’s conviction for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when he died of a heart attack last year.
Neither down nor out in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough fuel capacity to fly direct from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is a small expense for some of the rich Russians.
“It can accommodate up to 18 passengers,” says Dan Firer, Gulfstream’s representative.
“But no one asks for that seat model because it’s for private family flights or for company presidents.”
Mr. Firer was in charge of the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaire’s Fair, a four-day consumer orgy held at an event center near the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, 200 other luxury suppliers had installed their exhibition stands, hoping to lure wealthy new Russians into everything from mahogany coffered yachts to diamond-encrusted car grills worth 50 cents.
Mr. Firer looks cautiously at a bright orange Porsche on the stand next door to him."
“It’s a beautiful car, but it’s nickel and kettle compared to us,” he said.
“After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private jets.”
Fueled by the oil boom, the Russian capital resembles Dallas when it was in its heyday.
“We experienced the same thing in 1890, when some wealthy Americans came to meet in Europe, where they were seen as materialists,” says Marshall Goldman, senior professor at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
“Like the Saudis of the 1970s and the Japanese of the 1990s, the Russians are emerging as the world’s biggest consumers and spenders.”
The world’s most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of the pie.
Elsewhere in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry will be held this week with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell luxury goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times company)
Russia has 53 billionaires making a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, the second-degree rich include 103,000 Russian millionaires whose money reaches $670 billion, according to a study of the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists at the Center for Economic and Financial Research, a local think-tank.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8 percent of Russians were below the subsistence level.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow – and that’s why we’re all here,” says Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative for David Morris, the London jeweller.
She attends the fair for the first time alongside the brand’s Russian distributor, the Soho Jewelry group.
"Women are impeccably prepared and men are very worthy."
Visiting the fair on Sunday night, dressed in afternoon attire, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their clients and themselves as millionaires.
“I was looking at the cars and I’m trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche,” said Yumatova, who reeled off the design suit she wore as a veteran red carpet dishing with Joan Rivers.
The fair aims to appeal to the new rich, the kind of buyers who would be willing to stay several hours in a warehouse that mixes brands from Cadillac Escalades, platinum pen cutters, ice creams from Movenpick, custom-made pool tables, apartments in Dubai and teddy bears from Gund.
The general public can buy 30-euro tickets ($44.57).
“The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and the best,” said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically at a stand of Delft royal Dutch porcelains, in front of a mural-sized reconstruction of a Rembrandt painting, made of hand-painted tiles.
“Of course, the Russians are more interested in bling-bling.
In fact, the vendors said that wealthy Russians with more track record (10 to 15 years, by Russian standards) have changed their tastes from flashy logos to limited-edition brands, which would not be exhibited at a trade show.
However, several thousand people: millionaires in cash, emissaries of millionaires or tourists, fill the corridors every day.
And some of them buy.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, managing director of the King Koil beds, said he sold two $70,000-a-piece mattress systems, made of silk, cashmere and cotton interwoven with gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold the bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
Late Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars, said he had sold three chain bracelet-shaped car grilles, for Rolls Royce Phantom, for $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car wheel, designed for a Russian casino owner, with rays embedded in Swarovski-colored crystals, so that it resembled a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for four wheels.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a portrait of his wife made of zircon cubes, is not necessarily going to drive on those wheels," says Mr. Karapetian.
“He’s going to keep the car in his garage, along with 30 or 40 other cars.”
Even if many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian clarifies that the phrase “Russian millionaire” does not mean exclusivity, given the surge in real estate prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you're probably already a millionaire, at least on paper if you're not cash," he said.
“There are more of them than you think.”
Those who weren’t millionaires could at least pretend to be rich by the support of the Continental Alliance, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red telephone booths (British style) stuffed with stacks of counterfeit $1 million bills.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 counterfeit bills for the Millionaire’s Fair.
Visitors would stop to shake off stacks of money, asking their friends to snap pictures on their phones while resting on piles of money, or pocketing a couple of million.
“You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire,” Karryev says.
'Scratch' surgery could lead to death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the window of the “Slightly Healthier” restaurant and saw an ambulance climb up White Cape Cod, two doors down West Scott Avenue.
Suddenly, a police car appeared.
And then another.
“Then I saw the ambulance coming up,” Mr. Livingston, the restaurant’s supervisor, said Wednesday.
"That's when I knew someone had died."
Authorities learned the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, 41, assistant to the Newark police department director.
Now investigators are trying to determine whether she died from a procedure performed by an unauthorized plastic surgeon, who is not yet identified by police, but who works at the home of 212 West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have not yet determined what caused Ms. Arroyo's death, but they are waiting for the toxicology test, though the results won't be available for a few weeks, to help resolve the mysterious death that has the upper ranks of the Newark Police Department distraught.
Ms. Arroyo had been an aide to police director Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
“She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious,” Mr. McCarthy says of Arroyo in a phone interview Wednesday.
"She was my guardian."
She protected me.”
Mr. McCarthy said Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, and left behind two 14- and 11-year-old sons and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokeswoman for County Union Attorney Theodore J. Romankow, said detectives are trying to determine whether Ms. Arroyo died following an unauthorized surgical procedure.
"That's one of the possibilities," Walsh said.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
Authorities said the house arrived at about 3 p.m.
On November 21, they found Mrs. Arroyo on a couch.
She was pronounced dead on the spot.
More than a week has passed and authorities have said little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, named Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs. Walsh could not say whether Mrs. Castro had been questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine which part of the house was used as a medical consultation.
On Wednesday, no one responded to the door at Mrs. Castro’s home, where a withered rose bush sits at the front of the house, and a Dalmatian barks at the back.
A blue drum labeled "vanillin ethyl" - used as a substitute for vanilla in foods and perfumes - stood on the garage door, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hang from hooks on one side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when she arrived in Newark after 25 years in the NYPD, Mrs. Arroyo was invaluable in helping to get to know the new island city and its rough political culture.
“She would say, ‘You have to watch with this or that one,’” he said.
“She was always here when I was, and also when I wasn’t.
It's embarrassing."
The Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates to raise the stock market.
Stocks jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market expected the federal reserve to ease credit conditions with interest rate cuts, which were augmented by soothing comments from the vice president of the U.S. central bank.
Stock markets loosened in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, number two of Ben Bernanke, president of the reserve, declared that policy makers must be “flexible and pragmatic” in responding to the continued strain of financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm markets amid growing credit-exchange samples, Mr Kohn said the recent turbulence was “partly reversed by the improvement in the market at the end of September and during October.”
If the upward trend persists, it would increase the possibility of additional adjustments in financial conditions for real estate and business, Kohn said.
The comments were taken by investors as a sign that the reserve is ready to inject fresh capital into U.S. markets and to make further interest rate cuts, to stabilize credit conditions.
The remarks also helped calm Wall Street amid bad news for the U.S. economy, as home sales hit the lowest record in October.
The fallout from the financial turmoil was accentuated by a notice from Bear Stearns, an investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, equivalent to 4% of its total workforce, in a global cost reduction to offset losses from its investments in U.S. sub-prime mortgages.
Only 20 of those positions are expected to enter London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose by 331 points, or 2.55%, to close at 13,289,40, while the broad S&P 500 index rose 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, to 6,306.2, adding more than 39 billion pounds to the value of Britain’s top-tier companies.
Germany’s Dax index rose 2.6 percent, and France’s CAC40 was above 2.3 percent.
Earlier, the resurgence of credit stress in markets was highlighted after strong demand in a three-month fund auction by the European Central Bank, which considered those loans to European commercial banks at 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Federal Reserve and ECB’s performance and inject extra funds into the stock markets in London, strained credit and rates on three-month “Libor” loans among British banks, marking the biggest rise since September, at 6.59%, after a steady rise since Nov. 12.
England takes the demands of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara with trial
Here are two dilemmas, each as difficult as the other.
Who should hit No. 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, none is less important in the face of the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the president of the team that is on loan - with that particular title at least, is here to help Peter Moores, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and also because the desk of Hugh Morris, director of England, is beginning to be filled with offers to become a national selector, and if not, in a part time.
Whoever doesn’t get sixth will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and so is sport.
It is not easy to throw away what one man does at the top of his profession, while another never goes beyond the lower level, sometimes for lack of luck rather than ability.
Not only in cricket the choice is difficult, as judgments are required that always end up being subjective.
Is it time for Bopara to get up?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same question could be asked in another respect if, says John Edwards or “Tubby” Banerjee, two bright young executives with good grades and who know the business well, had been promoted to the board: there is only room for one of them.
Who should say what a good level is for a cricketer, unless they give him a chance to sink or swim to the next chance?
Figures naturally have a big influence on decisions, but they also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricketer has to catch the eye of the captain while taking a wicket and a hitter to get chances to change the order if he wants to make an impact as a player one day.
But catching the eye of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who improved last season, for example James Anderson, who plays surely in the first test even if Stephen Harmison declares for "fit and bowls" like the wind in the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets in 33 runs each to earn a place.
Chris Tremlett took just 29 on the same average, but both have had their highs and can expect more from these.
Shah’s or Bopara’s games at Asgiriya Stadium may only be a matter of opinion.
The choice can break or make a man’s career, or it can make a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and did well in the first, with 5 wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to establish himself at the same time who went on to become a major player, and despite scoring a hundred double against Australia in Australia, he may still be underrated.
The likelihood is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after further discussion in today’s session at Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservation instincts and favor Shah’s greater experience over young Bopara’s exuberance.
There are arguments for both.
In Shah’s favor is his brilliant and valuable early 88’s debut test in Bombay, 32 hundred first-class versus only 6 Bopara, who, at 22, is seven years younger, and has excellent record against spin bowling.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two at-bats in May against the West Indies in the test at Lords, his home as a Middlesex player, and that caused an immediate pushback from selectors when Vaughan claimed his place for the next match, he seemed to have taken from his "batting" something of élan than in Bombay.
By contrast, the Essex team has joy in living on swords.
He latches on for nothing on the cricket field and his attitude was summed up as when he overturned his vehicle at an exhibition for England’s car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and presumably a shock, but the first thing he did was pull out his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate looking into the distance, to say excitedly, “Did you see that?”
Bopara is the best player, he is including his slippery pass to have effects on his plays that seem to satisfy him, because he bats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the best time, another.
Perhaps that is the true art of selection.
My inclination would be to give Bopara his chance, which doesn’t mean that Shah doesn’t stand out, as tea leaves suggest, it’s him who plays here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work – and to the fight against Al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, expelling the exiles who ran out of cash, no visa extensions and those waiting for the city to return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the militants who drove them out of their homes.
At Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy composed of a dozen buses, the terminal was full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned by private transport.
“I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad,” says Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, about what happened in Baghdad and it’s safe now.”
"They say Mahdi's army stopped killing people," he says, referring to the Shiite militia of religious militant Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops to temporarily cease.
Qassim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher in the Sunni area of Amariyah, returned with her two sons because it was impossible to renew her visa in Syria because the regime does not want Iraqis working in their country.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him on the phone to tell him that a U.S.-allied force helped pull al-Qaeda out of its stronghold west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the head of a Sunni and Shia tribe that had been driven from their home in Sleikh north of Baghdad by a grenade attack, after he urged citizens to rise up against Al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my comrades.”
"That's why I'm back today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said they have been drawn to the growing calm in the capital since U.S. troops entrenched groups of “concerned citizens,” armed and working in cooperation with the U.S. military to defend their neighborhoods.
But many said they had returned because of visa denials and a lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have settled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, a father of three, gave voice to the common suspicion among exiles, that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, called on the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugee visas to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe they have fled the country because of the sectarian death squads.
"We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop granting visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq," the Sunni said.
“I can’t believe in a government that supports the criminals who set fire to my house after I left it.”
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that Sunnis have been driven out of Shia areas and vice versa, easing tension.
There is a fear that a sudden surge of refugees will re-emerge sectarian tensions and the struggle begins.
Little Sarre, good manners.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even shines by the international orientation of its high schools.
As in the whole country, the Sarlandians lack only one educational field.
"Yesterday I explained for the fiftieth time to a non-Sarlander that we are not French" - that was the ironic motorcycle upon themselves of the smallest federal state for its fiftieth anniversary.
At the same time France and Luxembourg have a large role in the educational system of the Saarland which in a study of the Institute of German Economics (IW) called "Bildungsmonitor" ranked fifth.
In this way, high schools by tradition have good relations with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrucken was founded in 1948 by the French.
Until today students can finish their university degree here with two or three diplomas.
Consequently, the percentage of foreign students is high, at 15.6 per cent.
However, the number of students from the Saarland is higher than the average in higher schools, many of whom do not have a baccalaureate.
“The Saarland is taking advantage of the vocational education system,” says Axel Pl?nnecke, the education sector expert at the Institute of German Economics (IW).
More than every five young people do their baccalaureate in the Professional School. Thus, it turns out that the Saar is 7 points above the national average.
On the contrary, the range of possibilities for a professional-academic education is very wide.
The offer of double races, in relation to the number of population, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical vocational training and a growing demand, the number of Engineering Science graduates fell by a third in recent years.
That was why the Saarland Ministry of Education forced higher schools to do more advertising for majors in Engineering Sciences.
“After the first PISA study, we carried out some reforms in general education schools,” a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education said.
Thus the government introduced comparative tests across the country.
In order for children to start studying the last year of the project called "Kita-Jahr" as soon as possible, there is no cost. Meanwhile, this model also mimics the other federal states.
The comparison with the upcoming studies will show if the performance of the students has increased.
According to the 2003 PISA report, the number of students behind in school development dropped from 29 percent to 20 percent.
But overall, the Saarland did not improve as much as other federal states.
In Bavaria, students know how to calculate better.
To the chagrin of the people of Sardinia, the PISA report does not compare knowledge of foreign languages, even if they can achieve good results in this field.
Despite the fact that the Sardinians are not French, the language of the neighbors is a compulsory subject in the Secondary Schools.
Chavez changes the time.
Soon in Venezuela there will be another time zone different from the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chavez allowed the clock to change by half an hour.
Chavez is currently looking like a comedian in Spain.
As reported by the Official Gazette of the Venezuelan State, under the new law, the time will pass at least four hours GMT.
In this way, the South American country will have a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things, Chávez, as an enemy of the United States, justifies his decision by saying that the United States once imposed the obligation on the world by changing a full hour.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Chavez announced the rupture of relations with his neighboring country Colombia because of the action with hostage taking.
The left-wing nationalist said he would not maintain any relationship with either the head of state or the Colombian government until conservative Alvaro Uribe remained Colombia’s president.
“My dignity does not allow me to do it,” says Chavez, who is pushing for a constitutional reform where the country’s citizens must decide Sunday in a referendum.
This reform could greatly expand its power in the country.
The reason for the conflict was Uribe’s decision to withdraw Chávez’s mandate in negotiations with the Marxist guerrillas concerning the release of the hostages.
On Sunday, Chavez said that Uribe’s decision has offended Venezuela.
There is also a lot of talk about Chavez in Spain.
A new tone of call causes a sensation in the country: “Why don’t you shut up?”, is the phrase that half a million people have already downloaded.
This phrase was uttered by the King of Spain who was upset by the continuous interruptions by left-wing populists at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007 the decline in real wages threatened the Germans.
According to one forecast, this year a decline in real wages threatens German employees despite a strong conjuncture.
Experts present a host of reasons for a pessimistic prognosis.
According to calculations by the Hans B?ckler Foundation, German employees should have a lower real-wage account in 2007 than in the previous year.
“The blame for that is the weak evolution of wages, the increase in value-added tax and the rise in food and energy prices,” Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Business Cycle Research told the Bild newspaper.
New unemployment insurance charges may also apply to employees.
Finance Minister Peter Setinbruck told the newspaper "Neue Ostanbrcker Zeitung" that given the current situation, the intention to reduce the burden of unemployment insurance by 3.3% from year to year is fair and reasonable.
Naturally, the labor office does not have to get back into an unpleasant situation, asking for credits and subsidies from the Federal State, in the words of a politician of the German social-democratic party.
On Tuesday it became public that the inflation rate with the explosion of prices in the food sector and the petroleum derivatives sector reached the highest level for 13 years.
When comparing prices with last year, they are increasing by 3%.
Venus is the twin brother of Earth.
Although its atmosphere is not suitable for life, Venus is the planet most similar to Earth, something that until now had not been raised. The European probe "Venus Express" discovered rays in the atmosphere and whirlpools at the poles, the same that appear also in winter on Earth.
For three decades now, researchers have suspected that lightning could exist on Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new evidence: it discovered electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus the rays are silent from a height of 54 kilometers from one cloud and behind another, says Cris Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles to the scientific journal "Nature".
According to Urey-Miller’s famous origin-of-life model, lightning caused life on Earth: tempests may have triggered reactions in the ocean that, in turn, would have given rise to the amino acids that are the building blocks of life.
On Venus it’s not like that: if there was ever life there, that would have to be in one of the first states of evolution,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution of Washington.
Today, on the surface of Venus there can be no life: the atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times higher than on Earth and on the surface temperatures of 500 ° C reign, oscillating in such a way that temperatures can be reached below zero.
"Venus is possibly a 'diabolical' twin of Earth, but it is still a twin," Russell said.
The main goal of the Venus Express mission is to answer the question of why Venus, so Earth-like by its mass and size, has had such a different evolution.
Since there were no special missions since the 1990s, only for research of this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step for Venus research.
The latest research findings that will be presented in many Nature papers, according to the researchers, underscore not only the uniqueness of Venus in the Solar System.
“This also shows that neighboring planets have more features in common with Earth than we had previously assumed,” reports ESA.
Despite the already known stormy winds at the North Pole, the researchers discovered in the south polar region also a vortex formed by the fastest rotating clouds.
This phenomenon is reminiscent of wind flows in the high atmospheric terrestrial layers of the poles, as described by a team of researchers by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet of the Solar System has the mass almost equal to the Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers it is almost as large.
This planet is also called the Dawn Star or Evening Star and orbits the Sun for nearly 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: one day on Venus equals 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and atmospheric pressure of 92 bars does not closely resemble Earth, scientists start from the basis that both planets had formed under the same conditions.
On the two planets water had agglomerated that on Earth stayed in the oceans, but on Venus it disassociated in the universe.
While on Earth carbon dioxide had become carbon stones, on Venus it forms most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel’s rally with the Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insists on the end of the fight between the parties for the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Federal Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the German Social Democratic Party for its attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the rally in September.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, cares about Germany’s reputation and so demanded that the grand coalition end that fight for the Dalai Lama’s reception.
“In this case we should not present ourselves as a divided nation,” Koehler told the newspaper “Handelsblatt.”
At the same time Koehler showed his understanding regarding the reception of the Dalai Lama by Angela Merkel (Christian Democratic Union Party) in September.
“While I have great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are absolutely valid for me,” Koehler said.
Everyone knows that Germany has to act with great balance in foreign policy, underlines the Federal President, defending Merkel for the reproach she received when carrying out a new policy with China.
"The Federal Chancellor did not take the distance from the traditional course of One China policy.
China knows that too,” Koehler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Foreign Minister (Social-Democratic Party), had indirectly shown his displeasure at the Dalai Lama's reception and because of this he was attacked by members of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticised the Union for its inoperative foreign policy.
The reception of the Dalai Lama at the Federal Chancellery caused major misunderstandings in Sino-German relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social-Democratic Party), the Minister of Finance of Germany, but also, according to information sources of the magazine "Spiegel", froze the so-called strategic dialogue of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the Chinese head of government, demanded Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel recognize this reception by the Dalai Lama as a mistake.
Affirming China's position, Wen Jiabao said China would not accept European politicians receiving the Tibetan religious leader in his official position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama showed that he is trying to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now includes other provinces as well.
Schaeuble warns that there will be riots like those in France.
Battles with the police in the streets, shooting, burning cars: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that riots will occur as was the case in France.
The Federal Minister demands that every effort be made to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not spill over into the streets.
Barricades were set up, vandals fired rifles at the police: after serious riots by young people in France, the Federal Minister for Home Affairs, Wolfgang Schaeuble (Christian Democratic Union Party) fears similar trends in Germany.
“We have to look at ALSO that the social problems of our country do not take the violent form.”
"We have to take that seriously," he told the newspaper "Neue Presse," published in Hannover.
Not all young people live in the constant change of social reality.
The Federal State, federal states and municipalities are already working with emphasis to solve these problems, Schaeuble said.
This is not just about the integration of immigrants.
"From the Integration Summit to the Islam Conference: all this is already bearing its first fruits."
It is still early to take the end of the alarm for granted.
At the same time Schaeuble indicated that the German suburbs do not have the same building and sociological problems as they do in France.
The youths staged serious riots in the streets with police north of Paris last night.
Cars and public buildings were also burned in Toulouse.
Kenan Kolat, the president of the Turkish Community in Germany demanded greater efforts from the Federal Government for integration.
Kolat, in view of the riots in France, warns of an imitative effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
In spite of everything, actions are necessary.
Kolat indicated that the unemployment rate among young people of foreign origin under 25 is above average.
There must be more vocational training.
Kolat stresses: “We have to give a perspective to young people.”
The president of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France "there is a great social control in families", greater than the French country.
In addition, most young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat says, “But in spite of everything, we have to be careful.”
It is necessary to "provide the opportunity for young people to receive a job or vocational training more quickly".
Meanwhile the night in the Parisian suburb Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of police participated in the action, a helicopter with headlights flew over the territory.
The authorities responsible reported three arrests, as well as garbage and burned cars.
Since the day before, a team of nearly 1,000 police officers has been taking care of security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Home Affairs Minister, announced that the police will take rigorous action until it becomes necessary.
On the night of Monday to Tuesday around 80 police officers were injured by riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The riots continued the following night in Toulouse.
The riot began in a traffic accident on Sunday, in which two young men were killed.
According to information provided by the prosecution, the death of the young people was not the fault of the police.
In the kingdom of Angela Wolke.
The Federal Chancellor’s performance far removed from reality, shows that the coalition in terms of content reached its last point and that we should not expect anything more from it.
But in what country does the Chancellor actually live?
After her desperate performance, indifferent and without much content in the general debate of the Lower House it must be said: she does not live in the country that would have to be governed by her.
As for the reproach made to her for having repeatedly engaged in foreign policy actions, the Chancellor rejected it with a presumptuous phrase.
He said that would be a provincial way and thus showed that he does not want to understand what interests critics.
In the lower house it was declared very clearly to all that this reproach was adequate.
You could not feel any interest or any kind of feeling for the problems of the country.
But instead, Angela Wolke presented herself in this way: a very high policy that flees in foreign policy and stays there without achieving anything in particular.
An example: the prevention of climate change: she praised herself greatly for the decisions taken at Heiligendamm, but she says nothing about how these climate goals should be realized here.
In general, this way of praising herself – for the last two years the head of the Christian Democratic Union Party has not been able to afford so much modesty.
For it engages in expressions so that a boost comes to the people.
And in this way it damages its public image by the pragmatic conception with which it solves the problems without going through the branches.
But in the reign of Angela Wolke, interior problems are appearances of little value.
Child poverty and concerns for low-wage workers?
All he does is talk about it using subordinate sentences.
It’s amazing how many times you get it wrong when it comes to supplement for kids.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to be able to formulate a more or less good sentence.
It begins to stumble “as if in unknown territory,” when it comes to more concrete information.
The Attacks section.
The two front-runners, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, clashed in a heated debate of Republican presidential candidates from YouTube and must now fear only one candidate from the outside.
Already from the beginning, tensions between the candidates are noticed.
Mitt Romney reproached his adversary Rudy Giuliani for turning New York into "a place of refuge for illegal immigrants."
Giuliani, for his part, responded with grave rebukes: "I would like to say that his own house was a 'port' for illegals." Giuliani responds to the former Massachusetts governor by saying that he was the one who employed illegal immigrants without papers.
The candidates tend to attack: as so far the group of Republicans does not have a clear favorite, the eight presidential candidates take advantage of the debate on CNN, especially to discredit their adversaries.
The small 30-second videos, shot by internet users who were sent to YouTube, also don’t have much content.
"With this mode of isolation we let Hitler come to power," was John McCain's rebuke to his adversary Ron Paul, the only one of the meeting who insisted on immediately withdrawing troops from Iraq.
Romney also gets a lot of criticism from Vietnam war veterans, when he refuses to recognize as torture "Waterboarding," a method of interrogation, by letting a person drown simulate his death.
The reactions of the audience in the room in St. Petersburg in Florida show that meanwhile the most important issues of the campaign are others, not just the war in Iraq or the debates about torture.
The public always applauded loudly when they praised conservative values and denied the tax hike.
So you can better see where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
“I was wrong at the time,” Romney said, apologizing to people and the television audience for being an abortion advocate in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, did not know what to say when asked what he thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time Musharraf rules without a uniform.
A day after his resignation as army chief, the Pakistani president was sworn in as president.
This is how the eight years of military rule in Pakistan ends.
On Thursday, Pakistan’s President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in for a second five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the Presidential Palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the constitution and act for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday he transferred his mandate as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, especially on the part of the US.
Eight years after he seized power in a bloodless military coup, the former general first rules the state as civilian chief.
With his resignation from the post of head of the Armed Forces, Musharraf fulfilled the main condition of the opposition and the west.
The other demand is the end of the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on November 3.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the state’s attorney general, after Musharraf’s oath he will soon annul the state of emergency and fulfill the second condition of the west.
Since being proclaimed a state of emergency in the Supreme Court there have been many pro-Musharraf jurists. Last week the country’s Supreme Court rejected all appeals before the controversial new elections of the head of government on October 6.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a military convoy in the North Watiristan region, five soldiers were killed and four others wounded.
According to the army spokesman, a bomb exploded on one of the streets on the border with Afghanistan.
Krautrock's founders are back.
The most famous German band of the 70s continues its activity: three members of "Harmonia" participated in a concert in Berlin.
As a reissue, a copy of "Live 1974" was made, which was written in the band's prime.
In those days they were already very famous in foreign countries.
The attendance of these three gentlemen at an official meal caused the sensation.
Each of them has before him his box, his cables and above all his buttons.
In the middle is Dieter Moebius who is 63 years old and dressed in a white shirt.
To his left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has his laptop and guitar.
On the right, looking out of the auditorium, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73, who is very busy with the control panel.
Everyone contributes with their sounds, among them there is even rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
This doesn't seem to bother the gentlemen.
Something very exciting for Krautrock fans was the fact that the band Harmonia made music again.
The thing to rebel here is this: the questions have accurately shown that the band’s name rumbled in people’s minds, but it wasn’t something so special that after 32 years the audience missed it so much.
But why can’t the Germans also applaud their living legend of the 1970s?
Especially since Krautrock was always valued more in England and the United States than in his own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded an "Echo" music award to members of Cologne's Can 2003 band for their life work, the hall could see the surprised faces of German pop artists.
And when the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band La D sseldorf und Neu!, they all opened their mouths in amazement.
Michael Rother later spent time on stage during the Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as if he had been an old friend (of the band).
Ignorance at home and recognition abroad are one thing.
It is a problem to remember this band, because the trio only existed for two years and in those times did not achieve a great effect on the public, however, it obtained later thanks to the others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already made music with the artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, that promised a lot of fame.
At first they played in the basement of Berliner Schaubuehne.
Then, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf that was patronized by a church.
For a time, Rother had a job at Kraftwerk and later worked as a guitarist in the band Neu! He managed to improve the fame of this German band that at that time was too radical.
In 1973 Rother followed Cluster musicians into exile at Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a ruin of the 16th century, they lived as refugees from the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in Common I, where Roedelius could complain about his position.
That was more of an artist’s life full of surprises.
One day, they say, an Ottenstein Harmonia singing association pennant appeared in the trash, which turned out to be a good name for the art.
There were also disadvantages to the use of the name Harmonia.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the second "De Lux".
Even though the music was quiet and simple, the band struggled financially.
Life as an artist wasn’t just about getting to know yourself.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded during a concert at Griessem. Someone remembers that, in this recording almost 50 people participated.
Then Rother expressed his desire to propel Harmony and do occasional rehearsals.
For Roedelius and Moebius this demand is against customs.
In 1975, the band announced their split.
Rother ended up getting into esoteric themes and secured his existence with albums such as "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster revived the eighties and since that time has been more successful than Harmonia had.
The live recording of the album on Griessmer, that is to thank Groenemeyer.
His music company Grienland set out to cultivate this own German contribution to preserve it as living music.
Like Roedelius’s work, the Neu! band was also rediscovered.
Harmonia’s performance as a band takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The band was subsidized with public measures from the Wordtronics festival.
There is Julian Cope, the Englishman, the old punk and the author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
In this way, all influences from Krautrock to the next pop music are present.
Harmonia takes the position of a super-band, a post that was empty.
Brian Eno’s line accompanied by special music fills the room: “This music is the only true music, it belongs to the future.”
There are photos where Harmony with producers appears on a farm.
The story of the legend’s development is shown in black-and-white photo projections, where instruments are seen with wires.
In the background there are three veterans who started improvising again.
They do nothing but attach the microphones to the organ and the drums to produce extraordinary tones with the help of the effects devices they had built with their own hands.
Electronic music is how it should be.
Three people who dig deep into the technique.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, in a musical atmosphere is coughed, whispered and in a good moment of emphasis is sung "Aaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always a term of English origin.
It was never about rock.
The origin of the genre was not sought in the blues, but in music schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or fleeing from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever here shouts "68!" is also right, but now Harmonia remains calm.
On stage you reflect very well on what is already evident.
Where does the music start and end?
That can break your nerves or give you a few quick lucky moments.
Richard Gere just lacks more cynicism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moerderischer Frieden" are again devoted to the war in the Balkans.
But the two of them didn’t have much conviction.
Either the concepts are fixed a lot in actions and shootings or the two movies are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" can't help either.
At first there was good news: Karadzic and Mladic, the war criminals, are still hiding in the Balkan mountain, but it was there, in the dark interior of the country during the Bosnian war, that the actor Richard Gere was discovered again.
We had finally lost sight of the handsomest man of the eighties, because no one wanted to see him after his nice and unimportant roles in women’s films and after many press conferences about Buddhism.
Now, all of a sudden, Richard Gere is the most important plot to watch perhaps the movie "The Hunting Party- when a hunter becomes what he's after" (Why nowadays movie titles have to be so long and crazy?).
The film has a wonderful presentation for the eye: deep down, his role as a reporter in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do, if fate and the film industry had not been so merciful to him. He was a man whose better times of life have passed, which as a monument to the ruin of his decadence retained until now most of its charm.
"The Hunting Party", despite this triumph, along with "Moerderischer Frieden" which is the German production and will also be presented this week, turn out to be just a series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
The film "Moerderischer Frieden" can be narrated in a few words: it is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serb from the Kosovo snipers, one of them acts very fast and that also leads him to fall in love with her.
The film’s meaning is lost to actions and shootings, although we welcome the fact that Serbs are not once again presented as the only culprits.
The film is like the German series "Alarm fuer Cobra 11" without a highway, but in a situation of war.
In the example of "The Hunting Party" you can investigate, because there was never really a good movie about the war in the Balkans.
At another time, with another director and another script author (Richard Shepard on two counts), the story about American reporters in the war leaving to spot a Serbian war criminal called “fox,” could probably be a new “Apocalypse Now.”
Thus, the stories are strikingly similar: the small teams go twice to the mountain to carry out something that the army can not do and every time it turns out a trip in madness.
One reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when we are introduced to Simon Hunt at first, whom they don't let be just a cynic with a heart.
No, the script also envisions a love affair with a Muslim Bosnian who will be killed later.
Then "The Hunting Party" is far from reality, especially when in the last five minutes the reporters with impressive speed achieve what they could not achieve for five years NATO, the CIA and all the headhunters of the world, which was to capture the war criminal and leave them to the Bosnian Muslims to avenge in a fair way.
It’s so bad, it makes you want to appeal to the international court in La Hague based on crimes against cinematic logic.
However, the purpose of the film is actually a deeply human one.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karad?i? e Mladi? are still free, and highlights that the Americans and the French are not really worried about persecuting them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and the bad are so similar, so that one comes to mind a very famous poem by Brecht.
In this poem it is a mask of an Asian demon: "In the great wrinkles of his forehead I see, sharing the feelings with him, how hard it is to be bad."
In movies like "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons but they show how hard it is to be good.
The problem lies not only in the genre of war movies in the Balkans.
Recently, a newspaper published that all films about Iraq produced in Hollywood are fiascos.
It can also be added that there has never been a good film about South Africa.
Almost always a rule is worth it: when a star gets through a region of crisis or through the minefields, then something like “Rangoon” with Patricia Arguette, “Across all borders” with Angelina Jolie or “Bloody Diamonds” with Leonardo DiCaprio appears.
Possibly all of these conflicts occurred in a short space of time.
It takes at least decades for Hollywood to make a good holocaust movie with Schindler’s List as an example.
Classics such as the Vietnam War plays "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" in their time were not unanimously celebrated as the masterpieces.
Today we may know too much about world conflicts, and that is why in our times every massacre (Massenmord) is presented directly on two televisions at home.
And that’s because the script authors don’t have the slightest qualms (which is necessary to be able to) in telling good stories.
“To be or not to be” or “The Great Dictator” turned out to be so good in the end, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still didn’t know how bad the Nazi regime actually was.
Maybe you don't have to be a good person to shoot a movie.
Perhaps you have to be like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic and distant look of an artist.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel "Lemprière's Dictionary" and the war in the Balkans, he replied, "That's only because some things never change."
Great cities will always be in danger, men will always be cruelly killed and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.
Von Beust receives negative criticism of the Olympics in response.
Hamburg's mayor has come under fire from politics and economics for not applying for the Summer Olympics.
Many want to keep fighting for competitions in the water sports section.
But Beust remembers to be realistic when estimating possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, director general of the Hamburg chamber of commerce, said Wednesday that his resignation was "not good for the economic situation."
In recent times no other project in the big city fostered as much motivation as the idea of organizing the Olympic Games.
“Without this goal, you couldn’t keep the political, sporting momentum at the same level.”
Schmidt-Trenz demanded that the Senate not forget this project, but find a new long-term application “that refers to another time.”
On Wednesday, Mayor Ole von Beust maintained his statements that Hamburg’s ambitions in organizing the Summer Olympics would not be realized until at least 2028.
“Hamburg does not decide on the application for the Olympic Games, but rather it is decided by the German Olympic Sports Federation,” von Beust says on WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sports Federation (Sportbund) expected in early December, on Munich's application for the 2028 Winter Olympics.
“This preference means for us that in this period of time, which until now we thought we had until 2028, from a realistic point of view we will not have any opportunity.”
Yet this dream did not end forever, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regrets von Beut's statements.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympic Games.
"It's too soon to let the opportunity go, if at this point the plans are ruined," G?nter Plo?, the head of HSB, said on Wednesday.
A renunciation of the request is contradictory to the statement made by the head of the senate at a reception on the occasion of the general meeting of the German Public Federation for Higher School Sport (adh).
There von Beust designated Hamburg's application for 2015 Universities not as "a substitution" for the Olympics in Hamburg.
Only last week the Federation of Sport of the Higher Schools named Hamburg as a candidate of the application.
The Fraction of the German Social-Democratic Party (SPD-Bergerschaftsfraktion) reproached the Senate for not taking advantage of such valuable time for the construction of houses in Hamburg.
“For many years the Senate was holding back with the development of the small neighborhood of Grasbrook, because this was in plans for the Olympic Games or the construction of houses,” said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, deputies of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD).
While the SPD always demanded integrated Olympia planning for little Grasbrook and then the use of the built houses, the CDU stressed the importance of entertainment.
At the time, Hamburg’s application for the 2012 Summer Olympics sparked great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
It's not the wooden boxes.
Who relates the terms Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but does not think of Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently the wooden boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow that weighs on Warhol’s list of works.
Most of the ninety-four "type" Brightness-Boxes on this list are fake.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" put the doubt on the authenticity of Brillo-Boxes of the year 1968 of Andy Warhol, the Museum Moderna Museet of Stockholm carried out internal investigations and reached disappointing conclusions: the six "Brillo-Boxes", that the former director of the museum Pontus Hultén gave to the Museum Moderna Museet, are also fake, and almost a hundred of the others of "market type Stockholm", that are also.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confusing relationship between artistic and sponsored productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, painted the wooden boxes red, blue and white, with the same sample that had cartons of "Brillo" soap powder.
According to Warhol, in the exhibition of his works in 1968 at the Moderna Museet Museum hundreds of Shine-cardboard boxes were exhibited. These were not made by Warhol (because of expenses), but were brought directly from the "Shine" cardboard factory.
These were not works of art, but examples (which were only objects) exhibited.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed the production of wooden Shine-boxes in Sweden, but they were not exhibited at the Modern Museet museum.
Witnesses of those times now speak of that almost fifteen boxes, which at that time entered the history of art and auction as originals of the "Brillo-Boxes" of "Stockholm type" authorized by Andy Warhol.
At auctions some of them were purchased for more than $100,000.
The problem is that after the famous director of the Pontus Hultén museum made false statements that in 1968 in Sweden were produced and exposed almost a hundred of the wooden boxes that Warhol left to him.
But in reality, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 for Hultén and for the exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By this time Warhol had already died for 3 years.
Lars Bystrom, the chief curator of the Moderna Museet museum, investigated six Brillo-Boxes owned by the museum and also three of the Swedish private property that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm.
On the contrary, the structure of the copies from the year 1990 shows that the painting was applied with a roller without directly printing the pressed silvers. In addition it is not about oil painting, but acrylic painting.
“These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from Andy Warhol’s official Shine-Boxes list,” says Lars Nittve, the director of the Moderna Museet museum and adds that if the “Andy Warhol Art” Authentication Commission in New York will not reach any conclusion, the Moderna Museet museum will classify these six boxes as the copies/exhibition objects.”
As early as July, the Authentication Commission formally announced that it accepts these “grave allegations” involving boxes of soap dust.
But from that moment everything there remained in absolute silence.
Rebel soldiers surrender in Manila.
Rebel soldiers who had barricaded themselves in a hotel in Manila and demanded the downfall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo have surrendered in the Philippines.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who blames the president for corruption and voter fraud, told a reporter he could not answer for shedding blood.
Soldiers loyal to the government had stormed the hotel using tear gas.
Nearly two hundred soldiers barricaded themselves in the building a few hours ago.
Almost half of them, including Trillanes, had a trial on Thursday for having tried a coup d’état in 2003 that ended in failure.
He took advantage of the negotiations, to suddenly be able to deposit with about 30 sympathizers.
Evidently the military police who had to watch him had passed into their ranks and continued their mutiny.
They entered the hotel "Peninsula" and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government troops blockaded the neighborhood around the Noble Hotel.
The president called for an urgent session of the Security Cabinet.
Norberto Gonzales, the National Security Advisor, condemned the soldiers’ behavior.
“People are fed up,” Trillanes said.
“We call on people to come into our ranks.”
Gen. Danilo Lim, who previously led the elite Scout Reangers troop, said the other military troops wanted to follow suit soon.
Big government critics called Thursday for a major rally against the president.
His government has been blamed for corruption for months.
In 2003 the financial district in Manila was a site that attracted all the attention for the mutiny that was attempted against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after about 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986 in the Philippines there have been at least seven attempted coups against the democratically elected government.
United Internet will be Versatel’s largest shareholder.
United Internet secured more than 20 percent of the shares of telecommunications company Versatel.
On Wednesday the company reported that the average price for a share is 14, 46 euros.
It has only 20.05 percent of the social capital.
There was much speculation about the company’s absorption.
There are also options to increase the financial part in Versatel.
United Internet reported that with this step it wants to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) market.
On Wednesday they already made the assumptions about entering the business, after the Brendenberg bank increased its stake in the Duesseldorf network operator by 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
In the financial market that means that the financial institution holds the participation titles for a third party partner.
United Internet already in the previous day made participate with almost 10 percent to the telecommunications company Drillisch.
Drillisch in the capital increase measure placed 17.4 million of the new shares that have a value of 106.4 million euros.
United Internet has bought 5.15 million shares for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, the companies began negotiations on marketing cooperations for DSL-products.
"We are strengthening our collaboration," the United Internet spokesman said.
The two companies founded a joint venture MSP, to acquire competitor Freenet.
On Thursday United Internet reported that at the start, the two companies want to be happy with the ten percent stake in Freenet and do not make use of their right, that is, they involve 18.49 percent of Freenet.
That meant both companies kept all options, most notably participation in the Freenet joint stock company.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This "game" with Freenet that will last for many months and is not very understandable is part of the consolidation of the German Telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter Freenet had 2.9 million customers with a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million with a DSL contract or a full contract.
Until now, United Internet and Drillisch had a direct 6.01% stake in Freenet.
So they had agreed that Drillisch is going to get the other four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas was already agreed in August.
