What's up? The SSD in Prague knows neither Voldemort nor the pastry shop
The new SSD councillors in the capital are reportedly going to have to overcome obvious language barriers for the Prague Board and City Council components to understand their renewed SDG partners.
The period Aktuáln?.cz "examined" the members of the new Council of the SSD to check their knowledge of the slang marked language that has emerged in recent years in the Council, when the current members of the coalition ruled Prague.
The codified dictionary that used the political flower and cream of Prague during the previous period, by Mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the most well-known characters, situations and causes of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been proven that the new councilors hardly understand these well-known concepts.
At least, so they say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"The truth is, I don't know."
"Rather I am a novice in Prague politics," said during the examination of terminology of "collegiate" the councilor of culture Lukas Kaucky.
And as far as the veteran politician was concerned, Karel Boezina reacted as well.
You may know the concept of "golf hole."
"Possibly the only expression of all the ones you asked me to use from time to time."
"If not, I don't normally employ slang."
From the glossary, whose definitions were published by the newspaper Aktuáln.cz last June before the SDG voting congress, the editorial staff chose six examples, in particular those that are especially related to Prague’s municipal authorities.
Socialists had to explain the concepts "Voldemort", "Prague's biggest golf hole", "going to the pastry shop", "bull's nest", "betrayal of the capital" and "blinding".
Three councillors agreed to the test and a fourth, Antonín Weinert, who will be responsible for education in Prague in the future, initially agreed, but did not pick up the phone again.
The fifth councilman, Petr Dolínek, directly refused to do so.
“I don’t get into these things and I don’t think I’m going to value how civic democrats are having fun.”
“What I do care about is how we will understand each other in the execution of our programs,” he said.
As has been seen, Councilman Luká? Kauck? allegedly did not realize that the above title is an expression about an influential businessman and a friend of former Mayor Bém, Roman Janou?ek.
The word "Voldemort" doesn't say anything to Kauck; the only term he got right on the exam is "the biggest golf hole in Prague."
“It’s about the Blanka tunnel,” says Kaucka, who immediately adds: “But I rather know it from the news.”
“I’m going to have to sign up for a language course,” he jokes.
Karel Boezina is not the only one who recognizes the Blanka tunnel in the golf hole, but also the Councillor for the Environment Luka Plach.
Afterward, both socio-democrats know who Voldemort and Lukas Plach really are – they even know where to find that character; moreover, they suspect the meaning of "going to the bakery".
"I think it means to go to a company in Prague"; soon it is revealed to Placha that it is the headquarters of the companies in Janou?ek.
Like B?ezina, it indicates that such knowledge was gained from the news, but that it does not employ such vocabulary.
According to the participants in the test, among the socio-democrats there is no glossary so familiar in colloquial terms.
"I asked my teammates, but we don't really seem to have anything like it."
“Rather, among us we use nicknames, sometimes abbreviations or puns with names,” says Prague SSD president Petr Hulinsk, whose party colleagues call Hulda.
“At school they called me B?iza, but I don’t know if my classmates call me that too,” confesses her own nickname Karel B?ezina.
The newspaper Aktuáln?.cz tested the name and it works.
To his party mates, Weinert is D?da (similar to "yay") or, less friendly, D?dek ("old"), Representative Miroslav Poche, with whom he partnered before the election deceptions during the party's sponsorship, is nicknamed "Igrá?ek" ("playmobil") by some of his peers.
Nicknames are also the only expressions that socio-democrats tolerate in speech within the party.
Hulinsk doesn’t like to be called Hulda, but the newspaper Aktuáln.cz discovered even other nicknames for this Prague president.
"The doctor of baton rights" apparently remembers that Petr Hulinski obtained his doctorate in Law at the police academy in Bratislava.
The government wants to limit the torture of “witches”, as it published in a pamphlet
Women considered witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They are usually elderly, unable to work, for example, for health reasons, are single and do not have children.
Women who “turn” witches are sent to an isolated area, so that they do not harm the rest of the village.
"Men seldom suffer such a fate."
“You also don’t isolate healthy young women, because they help in the work and have children,” explains a nun who, in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso, works in a special residence of more than a hundred women expelled from their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual “social measure”.
He issued an information booklet that should help prevent the witch hunt.
However, this has a downside.
“More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso do not know how to read,” warns the newspaper Die Standard about the disadvantages of sensitization in writing.
Accusations of witchcraft are also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, Burkina Faso’s neighbor, Ammy Hemmah, 72, died last week when three women and two men tortured her, covered her with gasoline and burned her.
The news appeared on the BBC.
The authors claim that it was due to an unfortunate accumulation of circumstances.
According to her version, the woman was lit in the oil that is used for ritual anointings.
It caught fire when the group wanted to "eject evil spirits" from the woman.
The isolation of “witches” is supported by people of all educational levels.
The Der Standard newspaper quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso: “Human soul-eaters have always been a danger,” he said.
While in Burkina Faso the government is trying to quell the witch hunt, in Gambia last year the president was still involved.
Gambian President Jammeh, after the death of his aunt, launched a wide-ranging hunt for witches who had allegedly been linked to his death and had attempted to kill the president himself through black magic.
“To help him he brought shamans from nearby Guinea who, protected by police, military and the president’s personal escort, forcibly took randomly chosen men and women from Gambian villages to the president’s property in Kanilai,” Amnesty International said in its report.
On the farm, the arrested people had to drink a potion of herbs with hallucinogenic effects that, in addition, caused them intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of those arrested did not survive the stay at the estate.
Following international pressure, they eventually released around a thousand detainees.
Bakala tenant: heats up with coal stoves and signs a higher rent
The elderly and tough man walked through the doors of the customer service center of the RPG company Byty of the "coal magnate" Zde?ek Bakala, the largest private owner of flats for rent in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he carried documents with the new three-story rental contracts: his own, that of his daughter and that of his son, who is serving a sentence.
All three have just been hit with rent liberalization.
Instead of 3,500 Czech crowns a month, the son will pay from next year 4,100 crowns for a two-room flat with separate second-class kitchen.
"In addition, it does not have hot water and the heating is based on a solid fuel boiler," shows with the finger the man in the new contract of his son, over whose signature he has full powers.
“But I signed it,” he explains half-angry, half-resigned.
The civil association BytyOKD.cz, which called the new rental conditions “incorrect and indecent”, recommends tenants not to sign the new contracts and to wait until December 7, the date on which it will publish a guide informing on how to proceed in these cases.
But, before this, the man only makes a gesture.
“Everyone says one thing,” he says with a bad face.
Ostrava is becoming a major testing ground for liberalisation.
After New Year it will happen with the vast majority of the flats that, in the Czech Republic, were so far under a regulated rent.
Therefore, Aktuáln.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The RPG mining waiting room is one of the four in Ostrava and, by Tuesday at nine o’clock, it was already full.
Right next to the doors are the security guards and next to them a machine to collect numbers.
"Rent 2011" can be read on a bright button on your touch screen.
When pressed, a piece of paper with a number comes out of the machine.
Almost no time to read "157" and the number appears on the big screen located at the top of the room.
In a second, you're in line.
Soon after, an elderly couple arrives to ask, but the crowd in the room is not here for the new rentals.
Most people come to solve common problems, such as in the past: requests for arrangements, insurance issues, and the like.
The letters with the new leases will arrive in Ostrava to the mailboxes of the tenants of most of the 44,000 flats belonging to RPG around mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes in the cards an increase in rent of between 15 and 38%.
On November 18, a special window opens in the customer service center for new rentals.
“It’s been going on for a week, so it’s starting,” respond, after briefly doubting, the workers who are in it when the client introduces themselves as a journalist.
Liberalization and Bakala’s former miners’ flats are the most sensitive issues in the area.
Before the elections, the vice-president of the Ostrava-based parliament, Lubomír Zaorálek of the SSD, already treated them loud and clear and now they appear continuously in newspapers in the area.
"Twenty years later I want a new floor."
“They didn’t even change my fucking bathroom plate,” says the man mentioned in the introduction.
According to the workers, for the moment they come mostly retired to check if they receive a discount on the rent if they sign on time, as the special RPG offer promises.
Half of the February rent discount will also be received by the remaining tenants who sign the new contract before December 15.
However, the window of mining “liberalization” certainly fails to dispel the avalanche of doubts.
"Of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, they only asked about rent in 2011 about forty or fifty people," estimates the window employee.
Meanwhile, RPG proposes on the web and on its boards to hold individual meetings on contracts when necessary.
If the two parties do not reach an agreement on the rental, an independent judge must resolve the issue.
"This is not a threat, but information about the only way to proceed as possible and completely in accordance with the law," the RPG warns in its pages.
“No one’s going to be judged here,” says one of RPG Byty’s employees, and a man standing on the street in front of the customer service center is at least partly right.
“I get a pension of 13,000 and I have 5,000 left for food; I have no means of going to court,” he says.
But, immediately, the employee sows doubt.
"We'll see."
“Mr. Zaoralek warns them in the media not to sign, so maybe people will wait,” he says.
Rent regulation will cease to exist in most of the Czech Republic at the beginning of 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic necessity.
“Current rents still don’t cover even the amounts needed to maintain the community fund,” recalls Pavel Klime, director of the residential portfolio of RPG company Byty, adding that the neglected state of the community fund that angers tenants is, for landlords, the main reason for increasing rent.
While during the five years that elapsed between 2005 and 2010 RPG could with the rents invest in apartments four billion, in the four years that will go from 2011 to 2014 the figure will increase to 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging from the ceiling, in front of the waiting room seats, now repeats some data that stand out in red.
"The increase in rent in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31,200 apartments, that is, more than 90% of RPG properties."
“In addition, there will always be a maximum of 7.50 Czech kroner per square meter,” the statement said.
It only increased by 38% the rental of 400 flats of the RPG portfolio.
“In such cases, it’s an increase from extremely low amounts of 19.66 crowns per square meter,” says RPG.
In 2,600 flats, rent will remain unchanged next year.
RPG Byty promises that liberalisation will not suddenly affect rents, but will escalate between four to eight years.
In addition, it adds the following commitment: the company will invest all the money from the increase in rent (see the graph) again in the floors, mainly in savings in heating: new windows and heating.
Priority will be given to those who sign the rent increase agreement.
Architects have understood that offices also need daycare
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of the Arch.Design company.
No one would say that it also hides in its interior a small nursery with everything appropriate to such facilities: colorful walls, creative furniture and even a miniature park on the outdoor terrace.
Since October of last year, the children of Arch.Design employees can come to it.
The architectural project company Arch.Design, from whose studio came numerous well-known buildings of Brno, thought from the first sketches of the Avriopoint building to include a space for its mini-care.
The company employs around 90 people, mainly in the baby boom age and wanted to allow female architects and draftsmen to return to work soon after motherhood.
Along with the possibility of enjoying a reduced schedule, the daycare is one of the benefits that Arch.Design offers its workers within the framework of its social program.
The builders and architects thus have the possibility to combine a demanding profession with the care of children.
The mini-care was an idea of Arch.Designu’s own employees and, with the support of management, they managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company's mini-care is financed through the European Social Fund under the Operational Programme for Human Resources and Employment, as well as the State budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the funding granted (an endowment of more than CZK 2.8 million) they were able to purchase the equipment and, after two years, to hire qualified personnel and services.
When the funding runs out (two years), the Arch.Design company has the obligation to keep the mini-store running with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and in the submission of the funding application contributed the company Economy Rating.
The care of children is provided by qualified personnel; a nurse and a teacher from the Ministry of Education are present all day for their care; the daycare centre currently accommodates children with no age limit, although most of them are under three years of age.
Since it is a "mini-housekeeper", it can only accommodate a maximum of five children simultaneously, although with the shifts they come more during the day.
The functioning of the daycare is flexible to suit the needs of parents and children of all workers have the same right to use the daycare, regardless of hierarchy within the company.
Although it is an individual teaching and care, the contents of the mini-care program are comparable to the regular preschool program.
In it, children not only play, but also receive quality teaching: from basic learning to school readiness, they teach to English.
The class not only has toys and board games, but also a computer for children.
The presence of young children in the company itself create a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can go to see their children at any time and avoid the stress of picking up children late from school when they are away from their workplace.
Thus, parents are more productive while working.
It is not surprising that this naturally generates a relationship of loyalty between the worker and his employer.
In this way, Arch.Design is among the firms that offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, in short, this program reinforced the personnel marketing.
The house of bones continues to fascinate after 100 years. Look at Gaudí’s interiors
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs are reminiscent of a dinosaur column and the balconies look like the mouth of an open fish.
This is the Casa Batlló, in Barcelona, by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Due to its skeleton-like shape, locals nicknamed it "the house of bones."
Its organic forms, its striking colors, the novel use of stone, the fragments of tiles and mosaics, a facade reminiscent of the scales and the omnipresent gently curved lines, all this is typical of the secession of Antoni Gaudí.
The front of the house plays with dreamlike lines, delicate colors and textures taken from nature and wildlife.
Paying more attention, a certain geometry, rhythm and carefully thought order is observed.
At night, the entire facade of the house seems even more impressive, since it is illuminated in such a way that the brightness of the colors is improved.
Snaking and twisting the shapes continues to surprise us also inside.
Wavy wood copies window frames, railings, door trims, peepholes, and signs.
Casa Batlló, located in the Eixample district at number 43 in the lively shopping street of Passeig de Grácia, emerged from the remodeling of a house from 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction took two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, initially insisted on tearing down the previous building and starting from scratch, but soon accepted Gaudí’s idea of making a new and cheaper reconstruction.
However, Casa Batlló, made up of several apartments, was not designed by Antoni Gaudí alone.
The architect Josep María Jujol collaborated in the design.
In fact, in his plans of the project, ornaments emerged for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the mosaics used in the facade.
On the facade also workers other creators and artists.
The collaboration in the proposals of Casa Batlló was the beginning of Jujol’s successful collaboration with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of Casa Milá and Gaudi’s Park Guell, in which other pieces of it are located.
Due to its organic form, locals soon after its completion nicknamed it "the house of bones".
Others, due to the specific mechanism of opening the windows began to call it "the house of yawning".
It is also said that, at the top of the construction, appears the sword of St. George, patron saint of Catalonia.
Other sculptural elements of the construction hide religious motifs.
Gaudí designed in the house a unique system for the time of central heating with ventilation vents and typical fireplaces.
It may seem strange its inclination of forty-five degrees.
During the construction, Gaudí did not respect at all the building rules of the moment and did not allow himself to be influenced by them.
Even so, the construction obtained the corresponding permission from the beginning, although obviously in it the indicated data on the planned reconstruction were so vague that, two years later, upon its completion, the city council was so shocked with the result that it asked to be corrected.
It bothered him, for example, that the construction included columns even up to the public sidewalk.
The arrangements were never made, rather the opposite: just fifteen days after the request of the city council, Josep Batlló requested (and obtained) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
On the lower floors the owner himself was installed.
In the gallery on the second floor was the living room and on the third floor the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented out to a jewelry store.
The six-storey house is completely crossed by a staircase that leads to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reform consisted of breaking all angles and straight lines, covering them with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of connecting space.
The common part can be completely connected by opening the doors of the salons and a larger group can communicate in this way without problems, without giving up the privacy necessary for more intimate conversations.
The house, with Gaudí’s reconstruction, not only got a new facade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It is also impressive how Gaudí plays with light, white and blue tiles that cover the interior courtyard and skylights.
The play with the two colors provides maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was simply based on the principle that white reflects more light than dark colors, which instead absorb the sun’s rays.
Anyone can visit Casa Batlló, which in 2005 was added to UNESCO’s World Heritage List.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and busiest apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With the visits they confirmed, or discovered, that it is a very beneficial business and extended visits to the common area and the attic, including the roof terrace.
The entrance fee to the monument is not insignificant, it reaches 16.50 euros, although students, retirees and holders of tourist cards get a 20% discount.
The amount considerably exceeds the price of the entrance of other Gaudí constructions in the city.
If you want to enjoy the true atmosphere of the bed with its lizard towers, you should quickly befriend a resident of the neighboring houses and visit him at home.
How to choose the mattress and the box spring: women and men look for different things
Nothing of a pompous frame for the bed; what really confers its quality to a good bed is the surface to lie on, that is, the mattress and the box spring.
First of all, they must be complemented perfectly so that they adapt to the specific users.
During the election numerous elements come into play, including the weight, height, state of health and sex of the owner.
Also important is the type of interior in which the mattress and box spring are located.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cabin that does not usually have heating, latex mattresses should not be used because they "heat up" more slowly.
In addition, they usually weigh considerably more than the usual polyurethane mattresses.
Therefore, it is necessary to turn them more frequently.
If the channels in the center are not properly aerated and, above, they are on a firm base, they keep moisture inside. Mold can even appear underneath.
When choosing a bed, habits also influence.
Anyone who has spent a lot of time abroad often uses a very high mattress with a soft layer and will have trouble feeling good on a lower, harder surface.
“Almost every hockey player who came back from the NHL complained that they didn’t sleep as well here.”
"For their crushed shoulders, heels and hips they needed mattresses with a soft layer of viscoelastic."
"These types of mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes who have long-standing nervous system problems, so they get bad information from the joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in padded furniture.
Many hockey players, like other customers, have long preferred viscoelastic mattresses.
"Today there is no problem, because they have these suitable Tempur and Italian Magniflex, but also the Czech brand Tropico."
You no longer have to be an NHL player to appreciate viscoelastic.
This "miracle" works in a very simple way.
It optimizes its stiffness and shape based on the heat absorbed or adapts to your body heat.
Nothing exerts pressure; during the night, it will not spin like after a hard game.
It just sleeps better.
Viscoelastic also works as a protection against sores.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add to its height the length of your feet, that is, between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of around 180 cm will need a bed between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be, in a double room, 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
In the case of single rooms, for example single rooms, it is recommended at least between 120 and 140 cm.
So that a possible visit is also comfortable.
"If not, a simple rule can be applied to calculate the width: when lying on your back, you should have your hands comfortably shrunk towards your elbows," advises engineer Helena Prokopová, an expert from Cechu "alounik" to dekoratér, who has been dealing with the problem of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture for many years, a subject she teaches in specialized schools.
In double rooms, each needs its own box spring and mattress, so during the purchase you have to pay attention to combine the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to mount the bed bases at different heights, which is not always possible in all beds.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, models with spring interior a minimum of 15 cm, of which at least three centimeter are for the layer that adapts to the shapes and softens.
“Touching it with your hand or sitting on the mattress, you certainly shouldn’t notice the docks,” Helena Prokopová warns.
Each mattress requires a certain type of box spring.
Fully padded bedrooms, in which the mattress and base are like conjoined twins, make no sense in the bedroom.
Mattresses breathe badly and you can not wash your cover, which is often done today.
And, since every night we sweat between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that after about five or seven years the mattress will begin to remind us of a large (and congested) sieve.
For this reason, specialists reject slogans that speak of a mattress life of up to 25 years or even a lifetime guarantee.
However, everything has a but.
That’s why sellers give a tip: on mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, take care of the cleaning and washing of the cover, but better add a mattress protector that can be easily removed and washed.
Although mattress covers with zip closure are currently manufactured throughout their perimeter, so when opened they remain in two parts (something very important for washing and the size of the washing machine!), their manipulation in the largest models (and by only one person) when lifting the mattress can seem like a fight between a flyweight and a heavy weight.
In bed, instead of a box spring, do you have a firm board?
Never!
As much for the beds designed for overnight visits.
However, it must make (if you do not already have them) ventilation holes in the table and must be used with a mattress with springs inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with springs in bags (such as the German Taschenfederkern) and a soft layer.
Polyurethane mattresses should not be used on such bases.
Latex mattresses or sandwich mattresses (for example, a combination of latex and coconut fiber) can be used for non-articulating sheet bed frames and containing between 14 and 18 sheets, although a box spring with a greater number of sheets, 28 or more, in which the sheets of the lumbar area are reinforced and their rigidity can be regulated is always better.
Articulable sheet bed bases should not be used with a spring mattress, as it does not react to reclining.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the blades, shoulder protection can also be used.
This is a special fixation of the sheets that allows you to press or even tilt the sheets in such a way that they "surround" the shoulders perfectly during sleep.
For men who have very wide shoulders, this is very important.
They are even remembered by mattress manufacturers who, in the "masculine", began to use a softer area precisely around the shoulders.
They also remember women, for whom they put a softer area around the hips.
For the most demanding customers, there are box springs with cross structure or slats with so-called multi-twist damping.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the tension is lowered.
You should also keep in mind that even if you use the right mattress and box spring, if you use a bad pillow (big and "mullida"), most of the advantages will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow must hold the head and the corners can only reach up to the shoulders, so that the muscles of the same can be relaxed.
The recommended appropriate size is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
When lying on your side, the pillow should be at the same level (when combined with the box spring with shoulder reinforcement or the softer area of the mattress) as the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses have something to do, it seems, with the original mattresses filled with straw.
Manufacturers continue to use, more and more often, natural materials or, at least, mixtures.
In fact, biological mattresses are in fashion.
Petroleum-based raw materials, from which polyurethane foam is manufactured, are filled with natural oils, for example castor oil or soybean oil.
In fact, virtually all known manufacturers use soy.
“Biologically, in the case of mattresses, it means that the center is made only of materials of natural origin,” explains Petr Vazícek of Tropico Plus.
Also, natural substances are used during the manufacture of the mattress cover, one of the first aloe vera.
But you can also opt for microcapsules, which release a fresh aroma of forest or lavender.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men are "cooled" with plant extracts of breeze, for the mattress cover to absorb heat and cool the body, women prefer to "warm up" the cover.
Red pepper extract improves the circulation of the blood, so that women feel more warmth.
The favorites now?
Mattresses made of cold foam, which are more porous, with a structure of adapted cells, which makes them more permeable than those of normal polyurethane and offer more permeability.
The combination of different rigidities of cold foam and viscoelastic allow to manufacture mattresses of different areas that know perfectly where the head, shoulders and heels go.
A good quality mattress will cost you seven thousand crowns up.
Those who play a therapeutic role usually have a lower VAT, since they are considered as health means.
The first to gain this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It is difficult to save on mattresses and box springs.
Sometimes you can approve offers from manufacturers or sellers, who sometimes offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattresses with a memory foam attached to the case for 11,990 crowns.
The second is available for free.
The era of viscoelastic with an open cell structure and high density began with Tempur's "cosmic" material.
It initially emerged as a material for NASA, because during the takeoffs the astronauts were subjected to a huge overload.
Tempur softens with heat and hardens with cold.
Therefore, the human body, warm, exerts a perfect effect and optimally adapts its pressure.
Therefore, it is ideal to prevent sores from occurring, but also to improve comfort during sleep.
Memory foam is not only used in mattresses, but also for sanitary products, for example for pillows that are placed under the legs and relieve them, as well as their circulation.
Domestic manufacturers, for example, use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and the like.
More and more parents are using people tracking devices to monitor their children
Fear of children leads more and more people to think about GPS monitoring.
The system, initially designed for vehicle tracking, can also track the movement of people and thus contribute, for example, in the case of the disappearance of the nine-year-old girl Anika Janatková.
At the moment the device is about the size of a matchbox, but it will soon be reduced to the size of a watch.
Many people were afraid of the case of the missing Ani?ka and began to report on the means available to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of invading your privacy.
“We’re all trying to tell ourselves that it’s not about spying, but about another means of reducing the chances of a tragedy occurring,” said Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the Czech market’s leading providers of tracking devices.
“I recognize that in certain cases, such devices can be abused, for example if they get into someone’s bag without their knowledge, but we have not yet come across such cases.”
“Most customers actually buy it for security reasons,” Pilin adds.
In his opinion, children should always know what the “box” is for and how it is used in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Boková warns that, if the child does not want to wear it, he will simply throw it away.
“Even the youngest children show great creativity when it comes to intentionally losing certain things if they want to avoid being controlled.”
“Before, parents relied heavily on mobiles, but these could be turned off just as easily as the tracking device,” says Dr. Boková.
In his opinion, it is debatable whether in case of attack such a device is really useful.
“If it is a prepared abduction, the perpetrator will practically always check if the child is carrying some kind of electronic device that can reveal its location.”
"Now it's the phone."
"As the use of tracking devices becomes more widespread, it will also look for them, since their sale will undoubtedly be carried out with a lot of publicity."
“In such cases, criminals are always one step ahead of the police,” says the psychologist.
However, he adds that such devices can help in the event of an improvised attack by a pedophile.
According to Robert Oech of RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both vehicles and people, even if, after an attack, the tracking device is immediately destroyed, its presence can help.
“You can set the device to regularly send the position after a certain period.”
“If it is damaged, it will at least facilitate the last position of the person in question.”
“The most expensive devices have a tilt meter built-in, so if the person simply slips and stands still, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position in question,” says Oech.
In his opinion, such a service can be obtained even with mobile phones with navigation, on which only special software must be installed.
The problem with current tracking units is that at the moment they are devices with a similar size to a matchbox or smaller mobile phones.
Therefore, they can get lost.
According to Macro Weil’s Pilin, for that reason tests are currently being conducted with devices that look like a digital clock.
"In addition, they will have the added advantage that a potential attacker may not be able to identify the device."
“Or that I identify him after a while, which can make the police gain time,” he adds.
Even if tracking devices are worn on the wrist or hanging, they will still use the same technology used for vehicle tracking.
This is the position check with a GPS system (which is used in the usual navigation in the car) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough wicks to encircle the whole of the Czech Republic, but they only last two years.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of wick to light explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defense added 224 kilometers of mecha to its arsenal.
Therefore, they have stock for 225 years.
The problem is that the life of the wick is two years, four at most.
The army bought the explosive wick from the STV Group, a.s. for forty million crowns.
The General’s staff responded to MF DNES by justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of wick by saying that soldiers need 60 kilometers of wick per year for training maneuvers.
According to the calculations of the pyrotechnicians of the army, with whom MF DNES was contacted, however, it is decided that, in such a case, such maneuvers should be carried out with frequent use of explosives every year also all generals, high command officers, and even secretaries and cleaners.
They did not want exempt neither Defense Minister Alexandr Vondr and Army Captain Vlastimil Picek.
Only in this way could it be justified that the army spends sixty kilometers of wick.
Such a length equals 25,000 explosions.
Even if it were, the army would have enough stock for more than ten years.
If on the contrary, as the experts say, for the initial training of each new professional arrives with a maximum of two meters of wick, the army would have with the new purchase (even adding the consumption of the units of engineers or special) sufficient stocks for the 225 indicated above.
The soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade complained personally recently to Minister Vondra because they say they have hardly any ammunition for various weapons, so they limit even the practice of shooting for money.
And let’s not talk about the lack of underwear.
"I also can't understand that they repeatedly buy such quantities of wick from us."
“But it’s their decision and they will certainly know why they act that way.”
“For us, the military is a good customer that we as a company try to satisfy,” admits STV Group’s Chief Commercial Officer Jan Doecki.
Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Pejsek defends the hundreds of kilometers of wick also saying that it will have stocks of this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, STV Group’s Jan D?ck? indicates that the wick only has a useful life of four years and, in the case of pyrotechnic products for the army or the police, two years.
“If stored in perfect conditions, it can last up to four,” says one of the soldiers who, due to possible criticism from the army, does not want to give his name.
After the end of its useful life, each munition must be carefully checked to see if it remains reliable and will not harm the soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require an additional investment.
Another argument of the Ministry is that, by buying 445 kilometers of wick, he got a discount.
"They cost us 60% less than last year's order of 244 kilometers," said spokesman Pejcek of the Ministry of Defense's procurement center.
Just to compare: the annual wick consumption of the pyrotechnicians of the police, who eliminate the ammunition of the Second World War or that left by the Soviet army, has not exceeded 1,500 meters for years.
In addition, the police always ask for only the right amount to exhaust the ammunition before its useful life is over.
They decided it for safety reasons for pyrotechnicians and, in the meantime, more modern and reliable types of wicks can be obtained.
The ministry is already struggling to finish tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact era, when the 200,000-strong Czechoslovak army was preparing for a campaign on the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians with whom MF DNES spoke, after a couple of years the following problem will occur with the current one: we will have to eliminate hundreds of kilometers of old wick, which is now being bought "cheap".
So far I am still living from the contacts I got thanks to the contest
Winning the "Entrepreneur of the Year" competition helped Luká? Pytloun in the sale of his hotel franchises.
In the last edition, the 28-year-old entrepreneur Luká? Pytloun de Liberec won the "Entrepreneur of the Year" contest.
His success story seems to have come out of a movie.
Lukas Pytloun loved to travel.
Abroad he realized that Liberec needed quality accommodation at a good price.
With the savings he gathered with seasonal jobs abroad and a bank loan he bought a house that was half-ruined composed of five stories.
Considering that he was still in his third year of college, he was really brave.
“Currently, the value for money of accommodation in our area prompted me to do something about it,” says Luká? Pytloun.
He began renting the reconstructed first floor to foreign workers.
All the income he earned was invested back into the building, which he gradually converted into a 54-room boarding house.
Since then, in seven years in the business, he gradually managed to open in Liberec four pensions, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of around 300 in all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the four-star design hotel Pytloun.
However, this year opened another of the same quality.
“We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept, and other people are showing interest in a Pytloun franchise,” the No. 1 entrepreneur said last year.
“This sale of licenses for the opening of hotels helped a great deal in winning the ‘Entrepreneur of the Year’ competition,” Pytloun adds gratefully.
The victory increased his fame and popularity both in and around Liberec.
“People recognized me on the street, they still congratulated me often and, I must say, it was very nice,” he recalls.
It certainly recommends to everyone who wants to try some company that participates in the contest.
But he believes that it is not necessary to win, but that participation is already beneficial.
He states that, so far, he continues to live on contacts and acquaintances that, without the competition, he might not have obtained.
"With some people I met thanks to the contest I have started to collaborate regularly."
The fame associated with success, in his opinion, also included employees,
In total about seventy.
“I’ve seen them show greater loyalty and are proud to be involved in something that gained overall recognition.”
“It is by no means my own personal success, but it is the result of the hard work of the whole team.”
“Only my name is on the front page,” says Lukas Pytloun modestly today.
I wish my successor a quieter year than we have had in Farmet
The euphoria for victory was soon dispelled by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the victor, Farmet may have already gone through the worst.
The owner of the company Farmet, Karel ?ársk?, received the first prize in the last edition of the contest of Vodafone "Company of the year", last year in the "Slavic House" of Prague.
The jury valued their efforts, with which they managed to convert a small technical workshop in ?eská Skalice into a firm with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
“I can say that the award not only encouraged me, but all my collaborators and improved our confidence to fight the competition,” says last year’s winner.
The story of the Farmet company begins with the desire to do something useful.
Therefore, when the State proposed to Karel’s father the rental of a small workshop as compensation for the seizure of property during communism, he did not hesitate; he resigned his position in the company in which he worked and, with a couple of colleagues, founded the company with his father of plastic batteries.
Soon after, they began specializing in vegetable oil presses.
Eight years later they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in central Europe.
They gained a greater presence also among the non-specialized public after achieving success in the contest in the media.
“Not only did our customers begin to see the Farmet brand as considerably better, but also foreign partners began to value collaboration with a company that was more successful in their country,” says Karel ?ársk?.
Last year perhaps was not just a sign of the euphoria of victory at Farmet.
It also obtained recognition for commercial results until 2008 and, partially, 2009.
And 2009 was the hardest year for machinery sales.
The worsening of the crisis, which had not yet reached so many citizens, caused companies to stop their investment projects and begin to limit the purchase of new machines or technologies.
“We obviously don’t get rid of such a situation either.”
“Revenues were cut by 40%, we had to limit production and we even had some layoffs,” explains Karel ?ársk?.
A viable company must sometimes adopt even unpopular measures.
However, they controlled the situation and maintained the profits of the company, even if it was at lower levels than before the crisis.
Despite everything, where Farmet did not cut expenses was in research and development.
“With the grants we have built a research and training center, strengthened our presence in the international market and obtained magnificent valuations at national fairs,” says ?ársk?.
Everything indicates that they have already left the crisis behind.
Revenues are increasing again and, with them, the number of new employees.
"The new achievement is expected to bring a sense of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," Karel ?ársk? points out.
A Survey Revealing Ridiculous Rules
The Absurdity of the Year survey is part of the business tournament for the fourth time.
It has already succeeded in eliminating some ridiculous rules.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the Absurdity of the Year survey was the obligation to bring to administration documents that officials can access online.
The decision was made by more than a third of nearly 4,000 voters.
For example, the social security administration requested an extract from the commercial register, although its officials can obtain it with two movements of the mouse.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
"The Czech social security administration will no longer ask for an extract from the business register when it carries out a check on the insured's taxes," said Jana Bura?ová, spokeswoman for ?SSZ.
The aim of the Absurdity of the Year survey is to consult the rules and regulations to be followed by businesses and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and to try to eliminate those that are absurd.
This year, for the fourth time, it forms part of the business tournament of the publication Hospodá?ské noviny and begins to create a hobby among the general public as well.
While last year’s edition counted with the participation of three thousand voters, this year it practically reached four thousand.
And it is not surprising, since we still have several legal obligations to spare that must be respected simply to trade.
“Perhaps the number of papers needed for tax returns is the world’s number one,” says Karel Havlí?ek of the Czech Association of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs.
Simplification of business rules has been a stated goal of all governments for years.
However, compared to the rest of the world, the situation is improving especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions to have a company, the Czech Republic is in 74th position, that is, eight positions worse than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year contest was held for the first time in 2006 and is repeated in the same way every year.
Anyone can indicate some administrative or bureaucratic absurdity every year between April and the end of September, when the contest closes.
Proposals can be made on the website www.firmaroku.cz. The contest organizer then selects seven candidates for the "anti-prize" and, during October, allows the public to vote on the Internet through www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the absurdity that receives the most votes.
More than 100 were submitted for this year’s survey, in particular 105 rules and regulations that don’t make sense.
The examples were sent by entrepreneurs as well as professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the contest was, for example, the requirement that vehicles for the maintenance of roads and highways pay the toll or that employers with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint the walls every two years.
The list of this year’s 70 proposals is posted on the contest pages.
The announcement of the contest, which always takes place at the beginning of November in the Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of an event in which personalities from the political and social world usually participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, director of the Czech Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs, and Petr Kucel, president of the Czech Chamber of Commerce, attended the event.
“Economic prosperity cannot be maintained if the state continually hinders entrepreneurs, so my goal is to eliminate every year a minimum of thirty paragraphs that currently unnecessarily complicate trade,” said Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
Efforts to eliminate absurd regulations do not remain in the water of drunkenness.
In 2007, what bothered people the most was the obligation of the entrepreneur to communicate three days in advance to the business office of the permanent operation area, the intention to go with a post to a fair or exhibition.
This obligation was eliminated in the new industrial law.
The obligation that ended second in number of votes in 2007, that is, the communication to the labor office by its foreign workers of work trips of up to 30 days, was eliminated in the law of the so-called green card.
And on the third is the winner.
The Absurdity of 2009 was the regulation for physiotherapists to have in their office a large mirror, a refrigerator and two floor scales.
That’s why this year the Ministry of Health issued a communication saying it had eliminated the obligation to have a refrigerator.
A new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Ecological, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are valued.
The novelty in this fifth edition of the contest of Hospodá?ské noviny is the category called Responsible Company of the year 2010.
The purpose of this competition is to support responsible and fair companies.
“In this way we want to support companies that deal with the impact of their activity on the environment and that support socially responsible activities,” says Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of Vodafone’s mobile operator, organizer and sponsor of the contest, as in the case of the Rebel of the Year contest.
For this new special subcategory of this year’s edition of the main contest of Vodafone Enterprise of the year 2010, companies were presented for which commercial success is not the only long-term objective.
The story of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write a stand-alone article.
Although the type of activities varies completely from one to the next, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, it is for example disabled people, in another the personal or health problems of employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Republic was, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the formation of informal sports teams among its workers, who then participate in tournaments of various sports.
Another example of a responsible company in the Pardubice area is the Isolit-Bravo company, which has been the main funder of sponsorship for disabled children for seven years.
In Pod?brad, there is a stationery store that is especially concerned about the health problems of its workers, since they constitute more than 70% of the workforce; That is why it received the title of Company responsible for the central area of the Czech Republic and in the Vodafone Company of the year competition finished in third place in the region.
In Olomouc, he won the accounting firm MiRyz Soft, which reduced working hours, even below the 35-hour-a-week average, without reducing wages.
The title was also awarded because it buys primarily from Czech manufacturers, supports community activities in the area and respects the environment.
“We try to recycle as much as possible so that our production and management activities produce the least possible impact on the environment,” explains businesswoman Miluze Ryznarová.
The IT manager Enlogit from the region also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each laptop, offered them an ergonomic chair and keyboards; in addition, it supports work from home and at its business events uses the catering services of a local protected company.
“In addition, we support the Person in Trouble grant, which specifically helps the local Roma community,” says company representative Ond?ej Such?.
There is also a good mention of the laundry company Praní a ?i?t?ní in the Karlovy Vary region, whose employees receive bonuses in a special way that have an impact on their pension funds.
“We provide benefits in terms of food, transport, skills improvement and leisure,” says Josef Strapá?, from Bruntál Czasch’s construction company, winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
In the Responsible Company of the Year category, all regional finalists in the Vodafone Business of the Year competition were automatically appointed to answer the questions on the registration form and sent it to the organisers before 15 August.
The organizers removed incomplete or erroneous forms from the evaluation.
"If the representatives of the competing companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the Responsible Company of the Year contest, but they are not disqualified from the "main" Vodafone Company of the Year contest."
“Individual entries for this competition are not allowed, as this is a subcategory of the main Company of the Year competition,” explains Karel Goldman of Bison & Rose.
Police made arrests during a public auction at the Agricultural Fund building in Pilsen.
Anti-corruption police have made several arrests at the Agricultural Fund building in recent days.
Detectives handcuffed a local media entrepreneur and real estate entrepreneur Lubo G.
It appears that the latter attempted to manipulate an ongoing public auction for the restitution of the rights in such a way that the auctioned land was received by a precise interested party.
He had to pay Lubo-G half a million crowns for it.
“At the moment I can only say that the police are looking for a person for bribery during a public auction and public bidding,” Antonie Zelená, head of the Pilsen attorney general’s office, told Právo, adding that at the moment she cannot divulge more details about the ongoing investigation.
After 24 hours, police released the 46-year-old businessman.
How he might have influenced the public auction, given the little official information, can only be speculated on.
Agricultural Fund spokeswoman Lubomíra ?erná responded to Právo’s questions by saying that the police actually carried out the arrest at the Pilsen headquarters and it was during a public auction.
“This is a customer, not one of our employees,” he said.
The public auction is called “Call for the submission of land transfer proposals in accordance with the land law” and is held when several interested parties appear in relation to the land offered.
"These people, during the call, offer a value greater than that of their restitution, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced."
"Based on the bids, the order of the buyers is determined, and then the Agricultural Fund transfers the land to the person offering the highest bid," the fund spokeswoman explained.
Lubo G. had information on who was going to apply for the call and, since he was also an interested person because he acquired various restitution rights, he proposed to the interested parties in the field that he would not participate in the auction.
Please, he was charging a commission.
This would explain why, at the time of the arrest, he had so much money on him.
Lubo-G. had special contacts in the Pilsen Fund for a long time.
He was involved in the case of former PF chief Václav Sankot, who was charged with clearing the replacement of land for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Lubos G. has just obtained from the Fund land intended for the construction of public infrastructures, in particular on the site where a large road should be built to the industrial zone of Borská pole.
Later, he changed them very beneficially with the magistrate for a house in the historic center of the city itself with a much higher value.
In this case, the city council had to intervene because, otherwise, the blocked land would prevent construction.
Families will have to pay additional expenses of several hundred crowns per month
Households will have to pay from January not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, heating supplements and, in some cases, larger rents.
As a result, families will have to take several hundred kroner a month out of the portfolio as of January.
The price of electricity increases by 4.6%, gas by around 2%, in some cities they will have to pay up to 10% more for the water supply and many also increase the price of central heating.
The increase in electricity for families living in apartments should amount to about 100 crowns more per year than now.
However, major electricity suppliers have cut prices as support for renewable energy production, particularly photovoltaics, has increased.
However, gas is moderately more expensive, especially at the time when heating is most used and, therefore, consumption is highest.
In this case, they must also have a couple of hundred crowns more per year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive across the country, the price change of central heating varies from place to place.
The increase in prices is mainly planned by the largest municipality.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay an additional 50 kronor per month from January, while families in Liberec will pay an additional 1,000 kronor per year.
Residents in Prague will also have to endure a 9% increase in the price of water and heating, especially in case the city increases infrastructure rent.
If the rent does not vary, the Prague residents will pay an additional 6.8%.
Prices in Prague, however, will remain among the lowest in the entire country.
In northern Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates will rise 7.4%.
They can significantly increase the rental prices of 450,000 rented flats in Prague, where regulation will end in January.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which owns around 2,500 flats, will increase rent from January by up to 100%.
The company will take to court anyone who disagrees with the new lease.
Regulated rents, which benefit residents of around 300,000 flats, could increase next year by as much as 10%.
Young Czechs get drunk on Fernet and rum. The beer is no longer in mode, because it takes effect slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka and even good whiskeys stolen from their parents.
These are the drinks that cause young drinkers with less than fifteen years of age to end up in medical care.
Children who end up lying in the hospital continuously to overcome the hangover are no longer an exception.
This stems from the experience of physicians who encounter such cases in hospital pediatric admissions.
"Drinking beer or wine is no longer fashionable, because they take a long time to get drunk."
"Now the fashion is strong alcoholic beverages," Luduk Pelikan, head of pediatrics at Hocovice Hospital in central Bohemia, told Pravo.
“When they manage to take a bottle from their father’s cupboard, it may be whiskey, but it’s usually Fernet and vodka.”
“Vodka has the advantage of being lightened with juice and not smelling as much,” he explains.
Motol University Hospital spokeswoman Eva Jurinová also confirmed this.
"Normally, it's usually Fernet or rum."
“Those are modern alcoholic beverages, particularly among schoolchildren.”
“In some cases, they use brandy that they picked up at home,” Jurinová adds.
According to Chief Pelikán, it is drinkers between the ages of thirteen and fourteen who usually appear in hospitals.
Prior to this year’s work in Hocovice, he worked for a decade in paediatrics in Motol, where ambulances were taking young people from nearby areas.
"A girl had to come in maybe four times."
"She started at the age of twelve, when she was brought in with 3.5 drops of alcohol in her blood, plus a mixture of ecstasy," the department's doctor says of the case.
"He was at the fair in Holesovice at some dance party."
“The interesting thing is that his mother was not even surprised that her daughter disappeared 48 hours,” the boss is surprised.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or even their clear tolerance towards drinking by their children that is considered the main cause of the increase in alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts point out that, in the case of children, one cannot properly speak of dependence.
"Alcoholic means a person who has been chronically dependent on alcohol for several years, with all the phenomena associated with it, which does not occur in children."
“In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, it is more due to a systematically failed social or family environment,” explains Chief Pelikán.
According to spokeswoman Jurinová, forty drunken children were hospitalized in Motol’s pediatric clinic this year until mid-November.
However, statistics only show those who come with severe poisoning and must remain in the hospital.
Young drinkers who go home with their parents or the police after a medical examination do not count.
In addition to the cases in which children simply gather after school and drink aguardiente, for Pelikán there are three seasonal ups and downs that can be mentioned: the witches’ day, New Year’s Eve and the end of the school year.
"In such a circumstance, they drink for bad grades or, on the contrary, celebrate the beginning of the holiday."
“On witch’s day, I’ve seen up to seven drunken children at a time in admissions,” says Pelikán.
Drinkers who spend the night in detoxification under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day they do not suffer a terrible hangover at home.
Morning headache, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, is avoided with the injection of a serum with glucose and with the nutrients that the body lacks.
"They get on much better, because after the hectic night, they get up well and nothing hurts."
“They’re just confused about where they are,” says Pelikán, adding that patients often lose their good spirits at least when they see the expenses they’ve generated.
Ambulance transfers and hospitalization in a serious room cost tens of thousands of crowns.
“I have often used cost as a means of educating them, when in the visit I tell them directly to the children how much their drunkenness has cost and that they would have to spend the entire summer in a job for young people so that you would earn enough to pay for yourself that night,” adds Pelikán.
Health insurance, in his opinion perhaps as a retrogressive measure, which usually reimburses people for the costs of treatment, does not do so in the case of children who drink.
Two L-159 aircraft are in foreign hands for the first time in Spain
Two L-159s out of a total of five, with which the Czech Ministry of Defense replaced the Casa C-295M aircraft, departed on Tuesday for Seville, where the manufacturer of the Casa - EADS aircraft is located.
It is the first time such a device has been in the hands of anyone other than the Czech army.
At the moment, they were only abroad to carry out practical or demonstration flights.
It is the two-seater version L-159T1, which so far used the Czech army and was still in a state of flying.
The remaining three aircraft are single-seat L-159s.
These are still held at Aer Vodochody and the broker of the sale, Omnipol company, already took care of them last week.
Jan Peje?k, from the defence press department, says it is not yet known when the planes will be physically removed from Vodochody.
“The L-159 single-seat aircraft, on the other hand, were separated from the long-repaired aircraft, with no additional investments or contributions by the Ministry.”
"The two-seater L-159T1 was exchanged in its current state," he told Právo Pejoek.
He added that the army is not running out of two-seat aircraft, since in May 2009 the army signed a contract with Aer Vodochody for an amount of 200 million crowns for the construction of four unnecessary L-159 devices for two-seaters.
One of the new aircraft was already received by the army in July, the other will be delivered by the end of the year.
According to Pejsek, EADS committed to have the aircraft added to the equipment of some allied countries.
“The contract clearly states that EADS is the one to retire the L-159 aircraft and that they will be used for pilot training in NATO countries.”
“It is therefore up to the buyer to decide how they are going to use them in this framework,” says Pejaek.
The newspaper Hospodáské noviny published ahead of time that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159s.
The exchange of five L-159s for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns were approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not call for a tender for the purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current defense leadership claims that the exchange promotes the future export of L-159 overseas.
The Czech army acquired 72 aircraft from Aer and only uses 24, so it wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft is likely to have legal consequences.
The European Commission has already reported the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice because it should choose the aircraft by placing a European tender and not by contacting a single manufacturer.
The army already received three Casa aircraft and the last should arrive at Prague's Kbely airport in fourteen days.
An index finger longer than the ring finger indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have the index longer than the null are subject to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday in a British cancer journal.
It could depend on the level of testosterone, the male hormone.
"Our results indicate that relative finger length may constitute a simple test of prostate cancer risk, particularly for men up to the age of 60," said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
Therefore, the finger could help determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, particularly if this characteristic is associated with a genetic risk or other harmful factors, such as family health problems, Eeles says.
During the period 1994-2009, he followed up with a British counterpart more than 1,500 prostate cancer patients and, simultaneously, 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had the indica finger of the right hand shorter than the ring finger.
They were as likely to have prostate cancer as 19 percent of those whose fingers were the same length.
For men with a longer index than the ring finger, this risk was reduced by 33%; for men under the age of 60% the reduction reached 87%.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers in question, determined in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the fetus is exposed in the womb.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies have indicated that testosterone influences the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pañes, told TK that he is aware of the study, but that he does not think that the relationship between finger length and cancer can be "fully demonstrated".
Czech Republic under snow: D1 and D5 closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, dawned on Thursday covered in snow.
Roads and sidewalks are mostly covered by compact snow and snow plows circulated throughout the night in numerous areas.
In the morning, the D5 road between kilometers 89 and 93 in the direction of Rozvadov was closed due to several accidents of commercial vehicles and passenger cars, as was the D1 in Brno in the direction of Prague.
The news was relayed by the operator of the Automotoklubu (AMK).
At kilometer 91 a truck broke down, at kilometer 93 two commercial vehicles collided, causing injuries.
Several cars also ended up in the ditch.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway at kilometre 185 in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks collided there.
Drivers must drive slowly after Brno at kilometre 190 or cross Brno and enter at kilometre 182 at K?valce.
Traffic jams of several kilometers have formed there.
There has also been an accident on the D11 road, right next to Prague.
Prague is covered by a layer of snow of several centimeters and thermometers indicate -7 oC.
Traffic jams are forming, for example, in Prosek, although the city is also congested.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Trams run late, for example on the line between Karlovo nám?stí and Nám?stí Míru.
At eight o’clock in the morning, another state of crisis will occur in Prague.
The problems also affect the railways and the airport.
Because of the snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven connections by three fast.
The problems affect, for example, the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travelers should check what the current situation is.
Ruzyno Airport was closed from 11 p.m. on Wednesday until 5 a.m.
Most roads in southern Moravia are now open, but with extreme caution.
Three secondary roads are closed to traffic in Vy?kovska, snow-tongued roads in Br?nska and chains are needed in Blanenska to access certain access roads to the highest points.
One of the most affected places was Vy?kovsko.
So far the connections are closed: Rousinov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Ku?erov and also ?aratice - Mile?ovice.
To clear them will require milling machines.
At the moment you can not tell when they will open to circulation.
In Hodonínska, caution is required in the Bílé Karpaty (White Carpathians) area.
Roads in the region, which, since it is a protected natural area, must simply be left in an inert state, accumulate up to five centimeters of snow, according to TK.
Between two and ten centimeters of snow fell in the Czech Republic, more in northern Bohemia, where the snow cover reaches 18 centimeters.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
Snowfall gradually recedes in the Czech Republic.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The U.S. military is using a new “smart” weapon in Afghanistan, known for the moment only by the code name XM-25.
The generals hope the new rifle will influence the local conflict with the Taliban and "change the game's progress" towards its victory.
The new weapons are like a small gun with extremely precise aim.
Its bullets are fired with a laser with an accuracy of several meters.
The special 25mm caliber munition created for this rifle and the high explosive charge it contains causes it to actually function as a small grenade.
The projectiles can be programmed to explode not only when hitting the target, but at any point in its ballistic trajectory.
They can be used against enemies hiding behind an obstacle, a wall, or a trench.
You certainly can’t use normal protection, and when it rains murderous metal splinters, it can prove essential in battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "smart" technology.
“Soldiers manipulate it in such a way that they find the target, aim at it their laser beam, which determines the distance, then get a precise point of view and, depending on it, correct the projection line and pull the trigger.”
"Let's say we've measured 543 meters."
“When the trigger is pressed, the weapon is loaded and launches the projectile at a distance of 543 meters, plus minus one, two or three meters,” says Audette.
400 jobs moved
The Fujitsu consortium moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of the following year, 400 employees will change their workplace from their previous office building at the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese consortium Fujitsu moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As reported by the giant of the sector specialized in computers and their maintenance on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move in July of the following year from their previous office building in Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large office complex on Lyoner Street in the district of Niederrad in Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokeswoman explained that in the medium term another 100 employees of the consortium, which were previously scattered around the region, will be staying there.
The offer is highly attractive, and the collective office in Astro Park will favor the way employees work.
In addition, Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner said, "In Franfkurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure."
The brilliant connection to the airport is very important today for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company in the region yesterday caused joy among those who were in favor and disappointment among those who were against.
Markus Frank (CDU), Frankfurt’s head of economics, said it earned him a “Global Player”.
This is a "magnificent recognition of the site".
Fujitsu is based in the city, the settlement is a big boost for Niederrad.
Bod Hombruger Mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) laments Fujitsu’s decision.
The management informed the city earlier about their intention.
“We have naturally offered the company our help,” Korwisi said.
However, the good contacts of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property in Marienbader Platz have not been able to change in the difficulties.
After all, economic reasons caused the downturn.
In such a way, there is now a great empty place to cover in the famous stall.
"I expect the owner and landlord of the building to be cooperative."
The building previously used by Fujitsu on Rathausplatz and the neighboring "Kleine Vertikale" were part of the leftover buildings of Marienbader Platz for ten years of a controversial construction project of the spa city.
As a joint project of the city and a private project company between the station and the city council, a new entrance to the city is formed, which is responsible for the criticism in terms of the massive building that previously used the voids as parking spaces and in terms of the level of the buildings.
In 2001 they have installed investment counseling and appraisal companies, the manufacturer of Software for reservation systems, Start Amadeus, as well as then joined Siemens with the computer manufacturer Fujitsu.
In 2006, the building used by Fujitsu was acquired by the Frankfurt real estate group, Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe together with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later resold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu consortium is recognized as the world’s third largest IT provider.
It has companies, for example computers and servers, and also provides the necessary services.
The branch in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, however Fujitsu has more business in Munich.
The Fujitsu Technology Solutions subsidiary is based in Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, followed by Fujitsu Services and a company under the name TDS.
That’s why 7,000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park office building.
The old complex of the 1920s, its name alludes to its star-shaped plane, houses among others the central association of electrotechnics and the electronics industry.
Amazon cancels server - Threats against Assange
Anger is increasingly taking hold at Wikileaks.
Internet service provider Amazon has removed the disclosures platform from its server.
Political pressure may lie behind the release of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, is reportedly being held in England.
The Wikileaks disclosure platform is always the target of criticism, always stronger in the United States.
Internet activists lost access to their former American server and are currently seeking an internet homeland in Europe.
Well-known US Senator Joe Lieberman calls on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol’s wanted list, must remain detained in Britain, according to an article.
"Wikileaks kicked out of Amazon server."
"Speak freely in the country of freedom," the revelations activists tweeted Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the internet company, Amazon, had removed the Wikileaks documents from its server.
Internet activists had resorted to publishing secret diplomatic documents on the Amazon services website in order to deal with the high numbers of access to the documents.
Wikileaks tweeted: “Perfect, we will be putting our dollars towards hiring people in Europe.”
If Amazon has problems with free speech, “they should stop selling books.”
Amazon stopped using its server through Wikileaks after an employee of Sen. Joe Lieberman had requested investigations, CNN reported, according to a call to Lieberman’s office.
The presidency of the Senate security council had threatened Amazon with a boycott, Britain’s Guardian reported.
“I had hoped that Amazon would take these steps sooner, before previous releases of classified information via Wikileaks,” he said.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also ban server use in other countries.
“WikiLeaks’ illegal, monstrous and thoughtless process puts our national security at stake and threatens life in the world,” the independent senator said in a statement.
“No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should help WikiLeaks with its service to spread stolen material.
WikiLeaks founder Assange, who is wanted in Sweden on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol’s wanted list.
According to an article in the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian is being held in Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact location.
The internet activist has consistently called the investigation in Sweden a plot by his enemy.
Wikileaks spokeswoman Kristinn Hrafnsson said there had been threats.
"There were even calls about a murder of Julian Assange."
That’s why he fears for Assange’s safety, Hrafnsson said.
Therefore, the location of the WikiLeaks founder remains undisclosed.
Hrafnsson evidently reacted to the North American statements.
In America, former Arkansas Republican Gov. Mike Huckabee said the person responsible for the Wikileaks revelations must be tried for treason and executed.
In Canada, an adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper claimed, clearly with irony, on television, Assange should “be killed” and Obama could “use a drone.”
Between the White House and Assange grows a great dispute.
Robert Gibbs, the spokesman for U.S. President Barack Obama, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had asked for the secretary of state's resignation, should she be responsible for recently ordering diplomats to engage in espionage.
“I’m not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website,” Gibbs said.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than your website.”
The U.S. government needs to demonstrate the effectiveness of protecting its databases in general.
Russell Travers, deputy director of distribution for the National Counterterrorism Center, was named exceptional manager, the White House announced.
So Travers is responsible for developing "major structural reforms", which are necessary in light of the Wikileaks leak.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as change the overall information about the government and protect it.
In addition, the U.S. government announced that to take care of the security of dissidents and activists, they must jeopardize the publication of Wikileaks.
"We have done everything we can to get in touch with them," State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
“We are prepared to help protect them if necessary.”
The University of Ice Cream
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna ice cream parlors are prepared at the best times of the year.
The basic three-day course for future ice cream parlors has the maximum influx and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice cream actually come from?
From the gelatiere and the gelataio.
The gelatiere makes the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of ice cream making.
The gelataio scoops the cream out of the ice cream from the counter, spreads it over the wafer and sells it.
To know this, you do not need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice cream should not visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped the university of ice cream with freezer in the year 2003, so that the ice cream cream cream of its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The basic three-day course for future ice cream parlors has the maximum influx and visitors from all over the world.
There are also more special courses of more days on chocolate ice cream and practices in the ice cream parlor of the house itself.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new professional career, others risk in the soft ice cream their vague desires.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
Jacky, a California art teacher, loves the slow movement of food and in the future wants to offer a quality European product in the land of industrial ice cream.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business consultant and wants to create something of her own in a few years within an enervating job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream parlor in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Master ice cream maker Luciano Ferrari explains to the participants later the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream.
Not only its good taste is decisive, but also its silky softness and good consistency.
Luciano does not forget his training nor the cream cover of the superior national and mainly southern house of the country: "Italian ice cream is simply the best, and that is why every ball has something romantic."
The first step to elaboration seems very easy.
Luciano puts the basic ingredients: milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a large mixer, which heats everything with an electronic program up to 85 degrees and instantly cools it down to four degrees.
Then he turns on the machine’s tap and comes out a basic white pasteurized cream, the basis for all types of milk ice cream.
Suddenly, the professor asks: Can ice cream be made only with natural elements or without a shelf?
How can you give free rein to some desire to experiment?
Luciano advises you to get rid of the trends of the time.
The one who talks about ice cream "not only natural ingredients", maybe has used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably guar gum, of guar beans.
Of course you can make ice cream without stabilizer, you only have to buy it one day, place it in a bag and the customer will bite a sonic granite ice cream.
Certain variations in the basic mass are allowed.
Aromas are used.
As for the taste of ice cream, maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that are bought in the fruit or candy section of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powders and pastes.
"All suppliers will try to sneak flavored ingredients into their merchandise."
"Yet they must ever experience."
Either with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or even with the ice cream cream of the basic white dough, which with eggs will become a yellow cream and with cocoa powder as a base for all possible pleasures of chocolate.
Course participants can now use the ice cream machines.
Luciano lets them each time make four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice cream, with or without eggs in the basic dough, with more or less aroma of vanilla or other natural ingredients.
They perform the same experiment also with types of fruit ice cream.
That it tastes better does not necessarily depend on it having more tofe aroma or more fruit puree.
Hazelnut ice cream does not need to taste like nuts, if it contains more hazelnuts.
The task force makes the beloved kiwi ice cream, which uses more fruit, less water and slightly less stabilizer.
First, a balanced blend highlights the flavor of the ice cream, Luciano says.
The making of ice cream is a problem of artimetics: Peach puree with a lot of sugar is used, we must reduce the proportion of sugar in the basic recipe.
For lemon ice cream you need an extra serving of sugar.
Luciano takes out a utensil with which he fixes the amount of sugar of the types of fruits (measurement of the winemaker for Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make it easier to count.
Making ice cream requires nothing more than the physical application, as before.
Not only does the utensil help for the automatic preparation of the basic dough.
There is also a utensil, in which the prepared ice cream mixture is simultaneously whipped and cooled to sub-zero temperature.
In spite of everything, all the automation is left out in terms of the small pasta.
Brazilian Gustavo smears himself and his teammates from top to bottom with fruit puree, as if it were an uncontrollable giant mini-first.
“In all courses,” says Master Luciano, “it is only a matter of time before something like this happens.”
Inspectors in a complicated situation
The European food safety authority Efsa has infiltrated the industry experimenting with transgenic plants.
This issue is currently formulated by the expert group Testbiotech, which is considered an institute for the independent evaluation of the impact of biotechnology.
“It looks like a conspiracy theory but we haven’t documented it well,” Christoph Then, director of Testbiotech, said Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the director of Efsa’s expert group on genetically modified plants, and another Efsa expert have also been employed for years in the Ilsi association.
Consortia such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer pay for it.
Kuiper has been a significant contributor to Efsa’s testing standards for genetically modified plants, putting him in a clear conflict of interest.
Efsa’s provisions are in paragraphs with the same terms with documentation of Ilsi’s situation and mimic the company’s deed, which is actually controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
This is the second time Testbiotech has criticized a collision of interests.
Thus, recently, a high-ranking manager of Efsa went without the support or the time of transition to the Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngenta, and has changed her side with that.
Recently, Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also revealed personal connections between EU inspection authorities and industry, which were carried out by the Office General for the Environment as well as an EU parliamentary clairvoyant.
However, Efsa cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
All formal data is used, including some from the industry, as long as they are of a high and technical quality, they are ordered in a report.
Experts working at Efsa are not required to have any contact with the industry.
But they must expose these contacts.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) in USA
It calls itself a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and policy, among others, for risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
On this topic, independent experts, such as Then, criticize that transgenic plants are currently allowed without investigating food for animals and that the influence of genetically modified plants on the environment is not proven.
“We want to know what, for example, genetically modified corn does in agriculture,” Then says.
Current practice is to verify only isolated proteins, but not the entire transgenic plant, which does not offer reliable results.
“If you don’t look for the risks, how are you going to find them?” asks the accuser, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck feels the same way.
The scientist has been researching the field of genetic engineering since 1994 and currently works at the Technical Institute of Zurich.
In this area, the industry is increasingly trying, in the US and in Europe, to influence or discredit critical scientists.
Therefore, there are few scientists who are not influenced by consortia.
For companies, critical studies are not published as a rule.
“Industry controls security research,” Hilbeck said.
The Trail of the Stones
Uli Gsell has achieved some, in total about 400 kilos.
On Monday I was in front of Stuttgart station, with the Tuba behind my back.
There were demonstrations
It was snowing.
The story is known: In September the bulldozers arrived and began to shoot down a large chunk of the north wing.
The land of Stuttgart was never the same again: thousands and thousands demonstrated against the s21, suspending millions at the station.
As it was sealed, most of the wing became debris.
Broken into 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rough soft stone, erected between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, he is 43 years old.
He's secured a couple of pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He enthuses: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and natural."
As he once said, he smelled cigarette smoke.
He still doesn't know what he'll do with the pieces.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell as well.
The trail of Stuttgart stones leads to a forest in Tubingen in a former French Navy ammunition depot, where Manuel Rongen erected his Stein-Reich stone.
The 44-year-old man deals with ancient stones.
He bought everything that resulted from the demolition in Stuttgart.
“There would be dishonor, they would grind the gravel or send it to the dump,” he says in his office, a small wooden house that was once a guardhouse.
He was insulted and threatened, he explains, when, in September, he appeared in the newspapers, which had bought the remains of the north wing from the takedown company.
He spoke to the enemies of 21S for several days.
And he explained to them that he could do absolutely nothing for the takedown.
And when it happened, then it was most reasonable, when the stones continued to be used.
About 200 enemies of the S21 took the 80-kilogram mace cut, with a price per piece of 6.50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a memory but also in the hope of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
Rogen had bought 500 tons, a load of 25 trucks.
About half are still in the woods, the rest have long since been sold.
Garden owner, landscape gardener, project manager.
They came from everywhere and took what they could carry in the trunk and on top of it.
The Stuttgart stone of impulse has long since become "the wall" or the delimitation of Kr?uterbeeten.
“This stone is really nothing special,” says Rongen.
"If it weren't for the political component."
Climb to your SUV, take a tour of your great 20-hectare kingdom.
He studied law, interrupted his studies, and later biology, he is interested in computers and finally works with stones.
He is a lover of stones.
It holds 4,000 tons of stone.
It transports its treasures throughout Germany.
He claims to be the country's largest ancient stone dealer.
Stop it.
In the snow there are artistic chopped sandstone stones.
"They belonged to the Dresden Marienbrucke Bridge," he explains.
Caliza alba, yellow, warm, gets excited.
"My dear stone."
The road crosses the forest.
Points a lot: Red sandstone, an earlier piece of Karlsruhe station.
And go on.
"Nice travertine."
Formerly the cornfields belonged to the grandstand of the Neckarstadion of Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, yellow travertine of the Stuttgart police headquarters, red granite of the church Sankt Blasien, tuff of the hospital of Heilbronner.
What a job, what an effort, what a sweat.
When Rogen thinks about how he sculpted the stones before and moved them with a simple rigging and a cart, he feels very devoted.
"It would be a scandal if something were destroyed."
He has not become rich, not at all immensely rich.
But today 14 people had to make the stone dealer, in addition to stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassmaker and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
“We work hard, but it’s satisfying,” says the man who is in charge of taking advantage of the remains.
Soon you will have to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to be salvaged.
Talent fight around great potentials
There is an active influx at the buffet.
16 students crowd around the muffins, tomato soup and sweets.
Braunschweig Technical University and car manufacturer Vokswagen have invited students of mechanical engineering and design to a workshop.
In a sort of brainstorming contest, they have to talk about the car of the future with VW workers and also learn everything about Volkswagen.
Rivaling and in the same way, many companies, such as VW, come together in a hand-to-hand struggle around the most privileged minds in collaborations with universities.
Their mission: Hire the most talented students from universities as soon as possible, before they enter the job market and are hired by others.
And because universities don’t provide posts about their students’ skills, they try to catch glimpses of exceptional talents in hands-on projects and capture them.
On the second day of the project at the Technical University of Braunscheig, the consortium wins over the talents.
A lady from the staff department hands out pens, gummies and folders with the VW logo.
He explains to the excited young talents the internship programs and student jobs and shows them his ways in the consortium.
Nico Selle of Braunschweig Technical University takes the project with VW.
It sees advantages for both parties: “Students come into contact with the industry and gain experience.”
“In turn, VW can get to know students, take a closer look at interesting candidates and consider them as potential future workers.”
Some collaborations, Selle says, are not uncommon.
The new thing is that students are wanted so directly.
“Previously, the main focus was on technical projects,” Selle says.
The fight for fresh graduates is getting tougher.
In many branches, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large pool of applicants.
If not they have to advertise and, above all, to get a highly qualified workforce.
All students in the engineering disciplines are in an excellent bargaining position.
According to the German Engineers Association (VDI), there were 40,000 vacancies in October.
And, according to VDI forecasts, this engineering gap will grow even more.
In the audit and advisory firm, KPMG, Roman Dykta is in charge of talent hunting.
It organizes expensive hiring events, such as the KPMG race, a type of modern jincana, in which participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the U.S. next year.
In addition, participants can observe KPMG subsidiaries and learn about the company.
It is decided who should go in two rounds of election at the start.
Only the crème de la crème of many participants goes to the United States.
Universities are increasingly striving to choose and polish the high potentials of universities, according to Dykta.
"With the race we want to stand out from the crowd."
"The simple journey on its own came up short."
For the headhunter Dykta the notes give results.
“We have a similar action in the last year with all the participants.”
“Some are nearing their end, and they want to apply to work with us,” he says.
In addition to the direct approach on campus, small and medium-sized companies, classic with their job fairs, are also on the hunt.
"We're trying to get students into specialty fairs."
“Something about Intersolar,” says Sitha St?be, chief of staff for solar technology maker Solarworld.
The Bonner company has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
The problem of the new generation is known to Stubbe.
Currently, there are 35 vacancies on the company's website.
"It's been very difficult to fill the vacant positions."
“It costs a lot of time and money,” he says.
A shorter path is contact with university professors.
Solarworld collaborates with several high schools, for example, the University of Freiberg.
"Teachers advise that you can do internships with us or carry out your theses.
There are no expensive advertising campaigns for solar specialists.
That is why the company needs to promote itself with other advantages: personal environment, flat hierarchy and comfortable communication.
“A large consortium normally cannot offer it,” says Stebe, the head of staff.
In the search for a job, money is no longer the most important thing.
The decisive factors are flexible working hours, attendance at children or good chances of promotion.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Institutes, Solarworld holds the 55th place among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The institute compiles an annual list of the best German employment providers.
Ask the employee how satisfied they are with the work and the environment and observe the employee’s pre-conditions.
The staffer also expects extra points in her ranking from her job seekers.
“I think the applicant looks especially at the external classifications of a potential employer,” he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Deutschen Employer Branding Akademie advises companies that want a long-term strategy to earn a good reputation as employers.
Advise your customers more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all, internal measures.
“The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is through the employees themselves,” he says.
In the jargon of the sector it is called Employer Branding internal, also promotion of corporate identity within the template itself.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
When you treat people well and identify them with the company, then you get promotion directly to the employer from friends and acquaintances.
“It’s like a gang game,” says Kriegler.
Obama halts new oil drilling
From the coast of the U.S. state of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico, no new oil drilling has appeared in recent years.
The government of Washington issued a strong ban and with it annulled its previous plans without appeal.
Also off the Atlantic coast, new drilling remains banned for the time being.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
What caused this strict ban, which will at least be in force for the next five years, is the explosion of the "Deepwater Horizon" oil platform in April.
Before the disaster that killed 11 workers and caused the biggest environmental catastrophe in the U.S., President Barack Obama had admitted new drilling in the western part of the Gulf of Mexico under pressure from opposition and industry.
Supporters wanted to lessen the U.S. dependence on new supplies of oil from abroad.
To date, it has not been fully clarified who is responsible for the irreparable oil slick in the Gulf.
At the center of the criticism is the British energy consortium BP, which is faced with millions of demands.
A committee of inquiry commissioned by Obama will present its findings in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the interior minister, lifted the drilling moratorium after the explosion.
Subsequently, different petroleum consortiums submitted applications for new drilling attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe by using tougher controls and tighter safety regulations.
Currently, the responsible supervisory authority, which after being accused of corruption charges has fallen into disrepute, is reformed in its tracks.
Obama also announced that lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas consortia would be closed.
The industry publicly announces that total extraction in the gulf will be lower thanks to tighter regulation, to date.
“Government plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industries,” says the result of the current survey conducted by the advisory firm BDO – ahead of Wednesday’s extraction ban.
American Energey Alliance complains about insecurity in the sector: “Nobody knows what exactly changes with regulation.”
Investments in new extraction projects are continuing for the time being, to the detriment of growth.
Ogonilandia is ruined
River water is marron oil, it smells like a gas station: Millions of liters of oil spills have destroyed nature in Nigeria’s Ogonilandia.
People live off theft, corruption and the illegal oil trade.
Celestine Akpobari is fine.
"Don't get tired," the environmental activist reassures reporters: "Today enough oil will pass before your eyes."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has managed to photograph boys wading in the water to the chest with the brightness of the lights reflected in turbulence on the surface: With the colorful brightness of the water, the scene seems almost pretty.
There are no brown oil smudges on the surface.
Earlier, she used to pick shrimp from handfuls, explains Esther Badom on the bank of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the flowing waters are totally dead.
Five years ago an impressive amount of oil was poured into the formidable wetland by a broken pipeline.
Fish from around the small town of Bodo had to swim six hours to reach waters full of fish: Which, in the heart of the Niger Delta and located in Ogoniland, is considered as one of the most stinking regions in the world.
In the path of the river that passes through mangroves, the extensive desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the boat engine removes a brown broth, who dips his hand in the water, will take out some full of oil.
The roots of the mangrove trees rise from the ground like dark licorice sticks, sadly isolating the palm trees that collide and hang their palms.
In vain are flocks of birds, as if they were in the wetland as usual: As soon as the barrier outside is silenced, a kind of ghostly calm of a previous paradise with the smell of a gas station expands in it.
"What is happening here is an ecological struggle," says Celestine Akpobari. "We live in constant danger to health."
The war comparison proceeds.
The Ogoni settlement area has been a hard-fought battleground for years: Here the first European explorers broke in more than 60 years ago, here the first resistance was organized in the 80s with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here he had to place his first Shell consortium factory in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for oil employees.
Even today it is forbidden for companies to return to Ogoniland: While they pumped more than two million barrels of black gold daily from the entire delta region, three times the size of Switzerland, with more than 5,000 sources of extraction and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland were calm, the location is too unstable for the consortium.
Every two hundred meters steel platforms protruded like bizarre sculptures of water: "Christmas trees" affectionately called the heads of the drills.
They are up to 50 years old, most have total corrosion.
Every moment a head fails, Akpobari says, then a steady stream of oil gushes into the water.
According to experts, more than two billion liters have been dumped in the delta ecosystem in 50 years: Year after year, the amount of oil penetrates, as in the failure of the ship "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the Alaska Sea, one of the largest ecological catastrophes in human history.
Whoever is responsible for the enduring environmental region will deal with it.
While Shell’s consortium and organized oil thefts are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see the heads about to break and leaking pipes as the main culprits.
In Nigeria, Shell applies mainly low safety standards normally in the conventional world, reproached the scientist Richard Steiner to the consortium in 2008: Only the indices of defects of the pipes are "about a greater multiple than elsewhere".
In a place that seems forgotten from afar, a workshop full of oil appears under the free sky, figures emerge from among the mangroves: They are naked and covered with oil.
Among one of the many barrels, which are sometimes attached to boreholes, sometimes scattered arbitrarily on the ground, is a fire: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, the oil heats up in the fire more hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First, the gasoline enters through the pipes in the container, later the oil pipe leaks and finally diesel exits.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce daily up to four barrels of 300-liter diesel: “It gives us 34,000 naira”, about 22 dollars.
Delta dwellers take advantage of fuel shortages in one of the largest oil states in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
With the absurd and cheap price of diesel of just 40 euros-cent per liter, illegal heaters can offer even less: This is how they reduce the value of their raw material.
It comes from “the bunkers”, who tricked the network of pipes that runs through Ogoniland: According to experts, at this rate at least 16 million liters of oil a day are lost throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a negligible part of the provisional raw material stored is clearly illegally refined: Organized criminal networks, to which politicians and senior military officials also belong, keep the best part in cisterns and sell it cheaply on the world market.
Activist Akpobari considers purely academic the debate on whether the environmental catastrophe is due rather to the management of the population or the weak way of production.
“If the oil companies did not behave like invaders and had not completely destroyed the natural habitat of the fish, there would be no sabotage, no theft, no illegal refineries.”
While the conditions of the Ogoni are mostly shattered by Shell to the point that only one deduction from the consortium appears: "Perhaps it is better to present another nationality, like the Chinese one."
Michael gets nervous.
“It’s about time you disappeared,” says the muscular Ollmann.
"Soldiers can come in any minute."
If the army’s special unit catches the illegal refiners, it does not threaten them with arrest, but with a painful bribe.
Soldiers from the north also want, like all Nigerians, to profit from the raw material.
“This damned invention has completely shattered our country,” Akpobari says.
Investigators detect dangerous factory defects in A380 engines
Apparently, the A380 has a big safety problem.
In an investigation of a crash-landing machine, investigators found a possible factory defect, which can result in “catastrophic engine failure.”
Qantas wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
Passengers on the Qantas Airbus that made an emergency landing in early November were far luckier than you can imagine: Australian air safety authorities perceived from their investigations a major safety issue in the engines of some A380s, and warn of a possible factory defect.
The potential flaw has complicated repercussions: In a cuff connection, fatigue cracks or cracks can be caused, ATSB officials announced in a report released Thursday.
This could have caused “catastrophic engine failure.”
This affected Rolls-Royce-made engines belonging to 20 A380 series aircraft.
Among them is the Qantas-Airbus that had to make a forced landing on November 4 in Singapore.
The Australian airline is taking legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
He filed a lawsuit in Sydney federal court that allowed for more legal action against the company.
Alan Joyce, director of Qantas, said his airline will seek compensation for the incident in early November.
In the brand of the engine they have lost parts and its wing is deteriorated.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gasoline as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines from around the world have to be replaced.
Australian investigators have announced that they will conduct further safety tests on superjumbos fitted with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The security issue has become important enough to inform all those affected.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline kept its A380 fleet ashore for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines kept approximately three of its eleven A380s temporarily grounded.
Lufthansa restored the engine of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
This double-deck aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
A Nevada Across the Country Causes Traffic Chaos
Totally white Germany: It has snowed all over the country overnight.
In many streets chaos reigns, trains and planes fail.
At least three people have lost their lives in traffic accidents.
Winter freezes Germany: Almost all of the country reached freezing temperatures overnight on Thursday, triggering traffic chaos at many points.
In some parts of the north and east, there is a layer of snow 15 centimeters thick.
Traffic is very limited on most highways and on many streets.
On the A7 at Flensburg, the snowplows are in continuous operation, removing the new snow again and again, but it is not ready.
In addition, strong gusts of wind sweep the Baltic Sea coast.
The German Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) expects live tides with water level 1.2 meters above their usual level on the Baltic Sea coast Schleswig-Holsteins.
In Saxony, the accumulation of snow caused considerable problems on motorways and national roads.
According to the Meteomedia meteorological service, the red alert is called in Sochsischen Schweiz, actually the highest alert.
There is partially 30 centimeters of freshly fallen snow and cold and strong winds are responsible for swirling it.
Many trucks and cars were trapped there during the night.
Also in Saxony Anhalt the police authorities reported major disturbances in the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind paralyzed traffic and created traffic jams.
In Thuringia, snowfall affected the A4 and the A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, major upheavals are expected in Saxony, Saxony Anhalt, Thuringia and in northern Bavaria.
Snow on the road, trees fallen on rails or catenary mangled and holes are the main problems.
Intercity service from Leipzig to Nuremberg is suspended in Saxony.
In Saafeld, Thuringia an ICE train had to stop its journey to Munich.
Firefighters and the rescue service treated the 165 passengers on the train with woolen blankets, food and drink.
Winds of snow sweep the streets.
At Germany’s largest airport, snowy winds led to numerous flight suspensions.
According to a spokeswoman for the flight information center, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a Fraport spokeswoman, 40 flights have already been cancelled.
Snow plows are in continuous operation.
However, there are few passengers stranded at the airport, despite that there are 400 field beds prepared for them.
On many streets, Wednesday afternoon there were already many accidents.
In the afternoon a truck driver was killed in a collision with a train at a crossroads in Ostholstein.
The driver suffered minor injuries.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg a similar accident occurred because of the snowy streets: Here too a truck was hit at a road junction because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver lost his life.
On the train four passengers were injured, the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason in the morning.
A 30-year-old woman died after her car rolled over near Aschaffenburg on a slippery road.
Meteorologists have good news: The snow will become softer and dusty and therefore swirl in gentle gusts.
But the wind will diminish.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and fast winds.
It will certainly continue to be very cold, in some places up to 15 negative degrees.
Deusche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to part with its symbol: According to an article, the financial institution is looking for a buyer for its office towers at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could contribute up to 500 million euros.
Recently Deutschen Bank fixed its headquarters: The twin towers in Frankfurt’s banking district were modernized; while the bankers returned to their old workplace.
But now the financial consortium apparently wants to take advantage of the costs of the renovation, and is looking for a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as the "Financial Times Deutschland" claims based on a spokesman.
The spokesperson does not name the reasons for the proposed sale.
“We always check to see if it’s appropriate to own the properties or sell them and then re-rent them,” he said.
That’s why Germany’s largest lending institution once again relinquishes its company headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from an investor in a fund of the house and then made the relevant arrangements.
The energy reforms reached figures of approximately 200 million euros.
A sale would mean a lot of money for the bank.
Experts in this field calculate the value of the towers of the newspaper renamed as "Greentowers" at around 500 million euros.
Whether the renovated buildings are sold at a bank fund or to an independent investor has not currently been disclosed, the spokesman said.
Thousands mourned for deceased miners
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought of the buried miners, who were presumed dead after many explosions in a mine.
The bodies have not yet been found, because security measures remain precarious in the place of misfortune.
Nearly two weeks ago an intense explosion took place at the Pike River mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners aged between 17 and 62 were buried in the mine.
A probe was inserted at the site of the misfortune, but found no sign of survival.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosions, no rescue team was able to descend for safety reasons.
After the second intense detonation, authorities and experts deduced that there was no chance the miners had survived.
The bodies have not been recovered to date.
Today, family and friends remember the deceased with a commemorative act.
Ten thousand people have changed with the resplendent glow of the sun at Greymouth on New Zealand’s South Island.
They are silent for two minutes.
In tribute to the buried miners, 29 tables were placed with the helmets, lamps and names of the miners.
There were also photographs and personal items, under clothing and surfboards.
Flags flew at half-mast before the country’s government buildings.
New Zealand waited for the miners to return to the surface “from the depths of the earth,” John Key, the president of the New Zealand government, told participants at the memorial event.
"But they never came home."
He can't assume his son's death until he's seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Along with the president of the government and the relatives of the victims, many foreign diplomats participated in the commemorative event.
In the first explosion on November 19, British and South African miners were also buried.
Rescue workers began extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases have been removed, scorching temperatures inside the mine will begin to drop, police chief Gary Knowles told reporters.
To hell, warrior!
Does Gore fit into art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn re-explores the frontiers of the genre with his epic "Walhalla Rising" battles.
What audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when shooting "Walhalla Rising"?
A one-eyed imprisoned Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and murders his enemies with almost superhuman struggles, sounding ideal for young onlookers looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to employ brutal methods to kill and rip their enemies’ guts out of their bodies alive when he’s in a bad mood.
Moreover, Unojo, as he is actually called, says almost no words throughout the film and the other characters get carried away by at most a sentence or two or a couple of grievous deadly screams.
Otherwise they shut up and enjoy the beautiful and terrifying mountain landscapes of Scotland, which the racks offer to the Viking world of about a thousand years ago.
Rather ideal for grown filmmakers interested in existentialism and very calm camera movements.
When a film has several target groups it is a shame that they cannot rule each other out.
Director Winding Refn considers his savages and the trilogy about the drug-dealing hairstyle "Pusher" to be some sort of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but stoically refuses to make his works for all audiences with any more mainstream humor or any less artistic house brutality.
A budding brain mass and guts cannot deter most fans of artistic cinema.
Most fans of the action die of boredom, if Unojo takes a ship to Jerusalem with a troop of violent, interpretable-motived missionaries and gets stuck for an eternity in the calm and fog before his team reaches America and goes back to shut up there.
It is a pity that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a film distributor in Germany and is only published on DVD.
It is a calamity against magnificent images, but also because, behind the presumptuous and bloody facade, hides a sometimes exciting piece of cinema, which deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or logical action, everything is atmosphere, a fever dream transformed into a film.
That is why there is no escape for the spectators.
Refn is given just a moment of relaxation and his glacial images and the mournful trance soundtrack make a knot in his throat, above all, the incredible hatred, which from the hearts of the characters goes to him.
Only a little blond young man, who faithfully supports Unojo, retains something like innocence, everyone else is possessed by anger.
Above all, the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, becomes at any moment a warrior out of hell for enemies and provisional allies, possibly the ambassador of the devil himself.
He represents perdition, but perhaps only for those who are lost anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that you can hate and admire, to get angry, upset and surprised.
An experience.
Mysterious earth movements
The nuclear energy organization IAEA has new indications of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country refuses to comment on this issue until controls are allowed.
About midnight on September 5-6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is located on the shore of Euphrates; the nearest and largest city, 30 kilometers away is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), it is about a reactor that apparently the Syrians built with the help of North Korea in the bucket, hidden in a valley that leaves the river.
According to information from the US international intelligence service of the CIA at the end of April 2008, a current reactor was designed under the name of the proximity of el-Kibar very appropriate for the production of plutonium, with which nuclear weapons are built.
On the other hand, the technique hardly serves other purposes than those of the fifties.
The CIA showed a video presentation with fuzzy satellite images.
They showed with a computer animation where the components of the reactor were before the destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
They also showed photographs showing the building from the vicinity or from the inside.
The reactor had been in operation for a short time, he says, but was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, three years after the bombing, it is hardly better known than back then, the enigmas grew larger over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently disclosed in his memoirs that before the attack the CIA was absolutely certain that the Syrians had built a reactor in el-Kibar, but that he saw little sign of a "nuclear weapons program" in the country.
In Europe, several secret service agents prefer to be even more cautious and only talk about an “alleged reactor”, although they consider the CIA’s presentation “plausible”.
They lack solid evidence, as does the IAEA.
When asked how safe it was to have a reactor ahead, a senior UN diplomat told reporters in the summer that the IAEA has “enough material to ask questions.”
The Syrians quickly got rid of the rubble of the alleged “unusable military building” and searched the ground thoroughly.
However, in June 2008 an IAEA team under former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium in el-Kibar, which had been manufactured by people.
In addition, the IAEA obtained satellite images of a member state from commercial vendors in the moments just after the attack, which must have a higher informative value than the CIA presented.
However, these photographs did not reach the market because an unknown customer, perhaps Israel, bought them exclusively.
That is why the IAEA cannot independently verify its authenticity.
Syria always implied that it had never had a secret nuclear program or built any reactor.
Uranium came from Israeli weapons, Damaskus explained.
The IAEA rejected it as implausible after analysis of the particles.
Since then, Damaskus has refused to discuss the matter, as well as satellite imagery.
In addition, controllers are forbidden a second inspection in el-Kibar and entry to the ruins of the bombed building.
Israel is also strictly silent.
"We will never comment on it," Ehud Olmert, acting prime minister at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not yielded results since June 2008 and “progressively becomes a serious credibility problem for the authorities”, as a senior Western diplomat corresponds to a place at the IAEA in Vienna, finally a serious violation is pending against the treaty on the non-proliferation of atomic weapons, which oversees the IAEA.
The IAEA sees three more teams as the key to progress in the clarification, which must be “in functional connection” with the alleged reactor, and others like these still exist.
The inspectors have not publicly disclosed so far what equipment they are, or what functions they have, or if they appear suspicious.
According to the newspaper, the IAEA has designated Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah as inmates, again derived from the vicinity of the located cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these sites and located a complex of buildings near Masyaf with satellite imagery, most likely one of the suspicious objects.
Possibly located at or immediately next to a military base, Syria forbids entry to all three locations to the IAEA.
In Vienna it is said that Syrians fear a record that the US has requested from the IAEA to spy on military plants.
Nuclear detectives were alerted to the equipment thanks to warnings from the U.S. secret service.
Using satellite photographs, the IAEA has indications that material is being moved between the three sites and the cube on the banks of the Euphrates.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the teams may be “related to fuel production.”
But there is “no indication of sensitive activities,” either uranium enrichment or reconditioning; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is powered by uranium that is not enriched.
Where uranium should come from and where plutonium should subsequently be separated for bombs, for these central questions there are, at best, plausible assumptions.
There is also no doubt about whether the ruins, the valuable clues that can be recovered, are found in all three places.
As the hundreds of truck loads disappeared from the ground, no one has any information on where the debris remains.
The OIAE considers unlikely the al-Tibni salt mine, located in the few kilometers from el-Kibar to the other part of the Euphrates, which the Syrians recognized in 1998 for its suitability as a zone for radioactive waste.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former IAEA inspector, linked it to the reactor in a satellite image analysis for the prestigious Jane’s Intelligence Review.
But photos from orbit show the Syrians made earthworks at the three suspected sites and disposed of large containers after the IAEA requested entry.
It may be chance but it hardly helps dispel suspicion.
In addition, in the diplomatic sector it is said that the IAEA has taken a few months to develop a plan of inspections there, which the Syrians would allow, to maintain possible military secrecy, only the deployment shows the magnitude of the inspectors’ interest.
In the meantime, Damaskus also criticizes this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago were reassured that the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter is not very urgent, for a couple of months, Glyn Davies, a type of U.S. ambassador calls for so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means that the Viennese nuclear authorities have to establish controls.
Yukiya Amano, the IAEA director, who is due to propose these inspections, has spoken of “an option I am open to in the future,” but he still hesitates.
This path is very risky: this requires the majority of the IAEA’s governing council, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not exactly eager for an escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat reflected: “What if in the end they don’t find anything?”
Love in the Time of War
There have been problems since Angelina Jolie began directing her as-yet-unnamed debut this summer.
She has written the script herself, a love story between a Bosnian and a Serb.
Not much more is known about it, but this is enough for agitation.
The rumor is very persistent, the woman, Muslim, falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women's associations have been quick to protest, moving a few days of planned shooting in Sarajevo to Hungary at the last minute.
The film has been shot in Hungary and in post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the women’s organisation of war victims wrote to the UN High Commissioner, UNHCR, for Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, reported a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the UN High Commissioner’s ambassador for refugees.
He is not diplomatic, weeks ago women offered him a meeting in Hungary that he rejected.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, says Hasecic.
No love stories are given in rape camps, and Jolie's position on the matter betrays the victims enough about the script.
Her organization, in agreement with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, has recommended removing Jolie as ambassador, the Guardian reports.
But what exactly has Jolie written for the scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which read the script, issued a recording permit in Sarajevo after a tug-of-war, it is not entirely clear why Jolie did not go anyway.
The young author reiterates that she does not pursue political purposes with her film, she enters the Yugoslav conflict with great effort, she wants to show the horrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all parties involved.
Its content remains imprecise.
The lovers were together before the start of the war and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different is the variant "rape victim falls in love with torturer".
It is certain that Jolie’s film really begins before the war.
The pressure on her, Jolie says, is “unfair and based on misinformation.”
They can currently make peace with Hollywood hackers: While the script is still on the network illegally, like many others before it.
Nothing like away from here
This afternoon is finally good for the Irish again.
No trace of affliction
Instead, the home team dominates over its customers in Sweden, Finland and the US.
Fans shout for joy as the loud music rumbles, hitting the ground with their feet.
The Bailey club vibrates in the South Irish Cork, because the players throw themselves, and find, pingpong balls to the beer glasses from a distance of three meters
The strange show is called "Beerpong", and the prize for the winner is 500 euros plus a few airline tickets to Las Vegas for the world beerpong championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this quirky drinking game and the discreet computer don't actually make good crumbs.
And the 26-year-old tries to have fun with it, distract himself from the overwhelming question, what the future holds for him.
The fun in Las Vegas is not in his plans, in January he will conduct a personal interview in New Zealand.
“I have a bad feeling,” he says.
"It's a long way from home and I don't have a job there yet."
At the very least: His girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland, “she got the job of her dreams as an event manager, maybe it’s a good sign,” says the young man and smiles.
Because of poor prospects at home, two of Tanners’ three brothers have already sought their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin currently works as an IT advisor in London.
Young people leave: On the island there are many families like the Tanners.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in the near future, forecast economic experts and Dublin’s ESRI social research institute.
As of 2015, there are 200,000 emigrants.
A great loss for this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
The forecasts are confirmed, there is a migratory wave comparable to the one suffered by the island in the eighties.
After a decade of progression that brought great well-being to the Irish, melancholy is now widespread.
The economic crisis confuses above all the young, well-trained Irish, for whom so far, everything is uphill.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone needs money in abundance.
But three out of ten men and women under the age of thirty are unemployed.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the director en masse of young emigrants, who complain that: "In Ireland everything sinks."
“There should be an uprising against the politicians and the bankers, but who can, leaves and loses our country and with it an entire generation.”
"The last one to close the door."
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and president of the Irish student union sees a bleak future appear because the government is only dedicated to montages and no longer offers future prospects to young people.
“They reduce minimum wages, but they don’t have strategies to get new jobs,” the 20-year-old says.
Observe how your colleagues go from one non-resumed practice to the next.
His biggest concern, he explains, is having to emigrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
People like Stephen McLarnon try to look at this issue in a positive way.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a fair that offers a service around the theme of working abroad.
“For those who start working, doing it abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to direct your career,” says the manager.
His website features photos of one boy surfing in Australia and another snowboarding in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not like doing it in the galleys, but it brings freedom and fun.
For half a year, Seán O'Donovan has known what it's like to build something somewhere else.
Since there was no longer anything to do for the 29-year-old engineer, he currently works with 15 Irish construction partners in Germany.
Now they set up a fashion store in Gelsenkirchen.
In January he goes to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan sees his homeland only rarely because he works overtime so he can pay off a loan for his home in Ireland.
“The situation is a little crazy,” she says, since it was a long time ago when she first stepped on the threshold of her home.
“I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland that I’ve never been so good at.”
He laughs a little embarrassed and leaves for icy rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with manicured gardens in front of the houses, at the entrance are parked large and expensive cars.
O'Donovan bought the house with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100 percent financed by a loan.
“It was crazy times, there was easy money without a lot of questions,” he says.
Are you afraid of failing with credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, pours more hot tea and says, "I don't have kids to feed and I'm young; if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The civil engineer does not like the complaints he often hears today.
“No one should go hungry, our situation is by far not as dramatic as in times past here on the island,” he says.
“Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen, maybe we feel like Irish for the first time.”
He laughs and tells about his father, who in the last great economic crisis went to England.
"After seven years he came back and life went on in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes these ideas.
Leave the future and just see what life is like elsewhere.
He’s already worked a couple of years in London, and why wouldn’t he and his girlfriend do well in New Zealand?
But these days there is one thing that worries him greatly: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He's afraid it might degenerate into a farewell party.
“Just not too many emotions,” he says and gives his beer a big drink.
"Goodbye, it sounds very distressing."
“We better call it a marching party, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games.”
The Democratic Routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as does support for private companies.
Crime is more of a concern than unemployment.
Moreover, in much of the region, Brazil is seen as a more influential country than the United States.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, it allows for the monitoring of changes in attitudes in the region.
The results of this year’s survey, conducted in September and early October, highlight two related issues.
The first is the relatively lively humor that reigns in Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries along the Pacific coast of South America (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a reduced 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after suffering a big decline in production last year.
However, only half of the respondents from Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the area, are convinced democrats, which lowers the regional average (see graph 2).
Some 44 per cent of respondents in the region said they were satisfied with the way democracy works in practice in their country, the same as last year, but considerably higher than the 25 per cent recorded in 2001 (figure 3).
Some 34 per cent said they trusted their country’s Congress and 45 per cent their government, the same as last year in both cases, but considerably higher than in 2003 (17 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively).
A decade ago, economic turmoil in Latin America severely affected support for democracy.
The fact that it has been sustained during the global financial crisis is probably due to the fact that many Latin American countries were only affected by a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, the existence of a stronger social safety net has helped to protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only marginally in 2009 and has fallen again this year, to 32 percent.)
However, the mood varies considerably from country to country (see Figure 4).
Brazil’s strong economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a general feeling of progress.
Such sentiment is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and violent crime has increased.
For the second time since surveys began, more respondents in Latin America cite crime, rather than unemployment, as the most serious problem facing their country (see Figure 5).
Some 31 per cent say they or a close relative have been victims of crime in the past year, down from 38 per cent last year and the lowest percentage since 1995.
The most positive economic returns are reflected in greater support for private enterprises and the market economy: about 71 per cent of respondents in the region say that private enterprises are indispensable for development, compared to only 56 per cent in 2007 (see figure 6).
Some 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, up from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela say the same (and 80% support private companies), although its leftist president, Hugo Chávez, is expropriating numerous private companies.
Brazil is the country with the highest leadership in the region, as indicated by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, the same figure as last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% a year ago).
However, the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela holds such a title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Elections in the trash
No one expected Haiti’s November 28 general election to be perfect.
However, they went much worse than feared for foreigners trying to help the country recover from its problems.
Votes were introduced at the polls, some people voted several times, ballots thrown in the sewers, polling stations destroyed and acts of intimidation.
Polling stations opened hours late.
Numerous Haitians, including groups displaced by the January earthquake, roamed the area trying to figure out where they needed to vote.
Some of them, in the end, gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, denounced fraud and called for the election to be annulled.
Protests, some of them violent, spread across the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the highest-ranking United Nations official in Haiti, declared that it was “a relatively good election in many ways.”
Observers for the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously stated that "we do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, necessarily invalidate the process."
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, which its opponents say is committed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, should announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The tiebreaker is expected to take place in January.
Not all hopes have been lost in connection with the elections.
The two main opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, have withdrawn their initial petition calling for the vote to be invalidated.
But problems can still arise if the electoral authority declares that Mr Célestin, who has little, if any, support, has moved on to the second round.
With the cholera epidemic sweeping the country and more than a million earthquake survivors still living in tents, abstention is expected.
At the time, many Haitians wanted to vote, but failed to do so due to a lack of organization.
Some 250,000 identity documents, needed to vote, had not yet been distributed shortly before the elections.
There's a lot at stake.
Aid donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an essential step in Haiti’s reconstruction.
And, as it has become clear, so do Haitians themselves.
Advancing tiptoeing towards the center
In the weeks since she lost her husband, Cristina Fernandez, Argentina’s president, has enjoyed great sympathy among the public who have increased her popularity rating by 20 points, to more than 50%, the highest level she has recorded since her election in 2007.
Still, whether she can turn it into a successful campaign for a second term in next year’s election will depend on whether the clearly affected Mrs. Fernandez sidesteps the intransigence of her late husband, her predecessor and political partner, Nestor Kirchner.
And, at this point, the indications are inconclusive.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to take charge of economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, was in the habit of drawing up budgets that undervalued tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential couple to spend the additional income at their discretion.
In theory, Mrs. Fernandez’s government lost its majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened following Kirchner’s death from a heart attack on October 27.
Some dissenting members of the Peronist movement in power have clashed with Mrs. Fernandez.
However, after chaotic sessions in which one MP punched another in the face and other MPs accused the government of bribery, Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," the president said.
The 2010 budget will therefore be applied to the coming year, giving the president even more scope to spend it.
The economy is improving considerably: it is likely to grow by as much as 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently at 11.1%, but many private calculations, in addition to the wage demands of the unions, place it near 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took power in 2003 when Argentina was on the verge of economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction his priorities, rather than controlling inflation.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressured the private sector and had INDEC, the statistical institute, adapt official inflation statistics.
Will President Fernandez now moderate these policies?
It has convened meetings between the private sector and union leaders.
In addition, its officials say they want to limit wage increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been boosted by the high prices of Argentine agricultural exports in the world.
However, inflation has limited the momentum to growth achieved with a major devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps for this reason Mrs. Fernandez is showing signs of wanting to restore Argentina’s financial ties with the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the government reached an agreement with bondholders who had refused a prior forced restructuring of the debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
At present, it seems that Mrs Fernández is about to conclude an agreement with the creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which she owes around 6.7 billion dollars.
The Kirchners always insisted that this would not involve IMF surveillance, as usual.
However, last month Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund will offer "technical assistance" to develop a new index of national consumer prices, which seems the prelude to the cleaning of the INDEC.
It is not clear if President Fernández wants to remain in politics when her term ends, bearing in mind that she no longer has her husband by her side.
If it does, it will need to win the support of the middle class, much of which has grown tired of Kirchnerism.
When Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have waned.
If she wants to win another election, she’ll have to decide whether or not to quietly repudiate many of her husband’s policies.
Half a hurrah for China
Taiwan’s voters are slowly closing in on a kind of closer union with the mainland.
What does Taiwan think about its big brother on the other side of the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70 percent of those eligible, turned out on Nov. 27 to elect mayors and councilors from five urban districts in what appears to be a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become an advocate of feelings for the continent, forging innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, the biggest change in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but narrowly.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) ended up winning three of the five mayoral elections, it failed to get a majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has leaned toward full independence from Taiwan, won virtually 50% of all votes compared to 45% for the KMT.
If it had been the presidential election, Mr. Ma would have been in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, his party’s share of votes has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the PPD tied with the KMT in the city councils.
Typical elements of Taiwanese elections could be seen in the elections, including noisy campaign trucks and large crowds with small flags and light girls in dancing clothes.
Nor was the mysterious attempt at de rigueur murder lacking.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, honorary president of the KMT, was campaigning for one of the KMT candidates the night before the election.
A man in the crowd shot the young man directly in the face, wounding and killing a passerby.
The curious thing is that it has not been possible to determine if the man intended to harm Lien or take revenge on the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PPD, the shooting affected the election, sowing suspicions about the PPD and causing voters to lean for the KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that the issue of the continent itself was not addressed.
Instead, candidates talked about public housing plans and job creation.
Taiwan normally enjoys its de facto independence and detests the military threat from China.
Consequently, the KMT often avoids publicizing its links to the government in Beijing.
But this time also the PPD avoided encouraging anti-China sentiment.
It responds to the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential to Taiwan’s economic survival.
For his part, Mr. Ma stated that his policy towards China had been confirmed to be acceptable to most Taiwanese.
The Beijing government is expected to continue to bribe them with trade, in line with its strategy to bring Taiwan back into the fold.
China wasted no time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare for a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
He would certainly like to achieve political integration as well, but first things first.
It is best to wait for the 2012 presidential election to pass for it.
In any case, the PPD has been reinvented.
Two years ago he was in a bad situation: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was jailed on corruption charges.
President from 2000 to 2008, he openly instigated explicit independence.
However, under Ms. Tsai’s leadership, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the PPD is striving to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai has been welcomed as a PDP candidate for the presidency, as has Su Tseng-chang, who served a term under Chen.
Now his party is doing its best to show that it can also have relations with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans to set up an expert group to act as a point of contact between the PDP and China, provided that negotiations can take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a “reliable alternative” to Mr. Ma’s hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems furious at the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he said that the PPD candidates would have been better off if they had insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
Even without Mr. Chen interceding, the PPD will have a hard time choosing between its potential candidates.
The KMT must also do an examination of conscience.
Mr. Ma’s valuations have been poor, despite impressive economic growth; the KMT candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Its lack of popularity seems to be mainly due to unemployment and the growing differences between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman says it will restructure its cabinet as well as local teams.
Large samples from the PDP suggest that Taiwan’s support for a rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, “the point of no return has already been crossed.”
Grammy Nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprise choice in the Breakthrough Artist category.
Act at the request of a president and possibly people will notice you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old bassist and jazz singer handpicked by President Obama to perform at his Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in 2009, was one of the Grammys’ surprises this year with a top-level nomination in the Best New Artist category.
Considering Spalding has been an acclaimed jazz figure since his 2008 album, "Hope," the nomination is mind-boggling, but it respects Grammys rules that an artist must not have released more than three albums before recording one that "determines the public identity of that artist."
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", certainly was a breakthrough and, given his light and pleasant vocal style, as well as great skill with pop, funk and Latin rhythm influences, one can at least draw a distinction between Spalding and Norah Jones's road to success in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammy voters, who have lately focused on the jazz realm for this category.
In the remaining categories, Grammy voters rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio’s “Historicity,” an exciting and magnificent record that was a favorite last year.
Among Iyer's competitors are veteran saxophonist James Moody with "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley for "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a raucous New Orleans favorite and regular on HBO's "Treme," was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which for the rest leans considerably toward fusion as on the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Darcy's wild punk James Argue's Secret Society earned well-deserved recognition in the big band category, competing against the great chamber jazz of the Billy Childs Ensemble and the ever-risky Dave Holland, whose live album with his octet, "Pathways," was a great example of the bassist's democratic leadership in his band.
Grammy Award Nominations: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey for Best Direction of Classical Albums
Nominations in the classical music arena for the 53rd Grammy Awards include a mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
The top nominations went to Michael Daugherty for “Deus Ex Machina,” for piano and orchestra, five-movement, and Steve Mackey for “Dreamhouse,” a work for eclectic three-movement orchestra.
Nominees with ties to Southern California include Estonian composer Arvo P?rt for his Symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles," a piece commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman is also nominated for his Mandolin Concerto.
Classical music nominations are distributed in thirteen categories spanning orchestra, opera, choral and solo albums.
The Classic Producer of the Year category includes five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The nominees for the classical music album are Bruckner for Symphonies No. 3 and No. 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey for Boston Modern Orchestra's "Dreamhouse" Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castiti" by the Boston Modern Orchestra and the Chicago Orchestra's "Recrificium - the Art of the Castiti.
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg for "Lulu" by the orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse for "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho for "L'Amour de Loin" by the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin for "The Arthur Wanderer" by the orchestra and chorus of the Mariinsky Theatre.
Composers nominated for a Grammy for contemporary compositions include P?rt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer".
Part's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a session recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The piece, about 30 minutes long, is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" is nominated for instrumental solo performance with orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for Avi Avital to play on mandolin, which performed the concert with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
"He composed it with sounds from the Middle East and numerous scales and rhythms from North Africa," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, was nominated in the orchestral performance category for conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra during a recording of Stravinsky’s works.
Nominated instrumental soloists include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
The vocal solo nominees are all women this year: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the mix category of classic, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The proposed mosque in Temecula gets the approval of the commission of ordering
The Temecula mosque project has garnered unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of often heated public testimony.
Critics attacked the project saying it encourages terrorism and traffic jams.
However, members of the commission decided Wednesday night that the new religious center respected local legislation and would be aesthetically impressive.
“Many good people came to show their support, both Christians and Jews or Baha’is, of all faiths,” Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic center of the Temecula Valley, said Thursday morning.
“The truth is, as an American citizen, I’m proud.”
“It shows that justice prevails.”
“The opposition is really minimal,” he adds.
"They just talk too loud."
"There are wonderful people in this valley."
The meeting began at 6 p.m. and lasted almost until midnight; most of the time it was dedicated to people who intervened for or against the center, practically the same amount on each side, according to Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
“The United States no longer exists,” reads one of the comments.
"This is another Planet of the Apes with Mrs. Liberty dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
Plans to build Islamic centers have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including near ground zero, the area of New York where the September 11, 2011 attacks occurred.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has reported acts of violence.
His congregation of about 135 families has been living seamlessly together in Riverside County for years, but he wanted a bigger and better space than the warehouse he rented on a property shared with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new 24,943 square foot mosque, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two minarets and rise to 43 feet.
It would occupy a 4.32-acre area on Nicolas Road, about two miles east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal the bill to the City Council.
Arsenic-resistant microbe raises the possibility of new life forms on Earth... or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the possibility of finding new forms of life on Earth and possibly on other planets.
Although researchers discovered the curious bacteria here on Earth, they say it shows that it is possible that there are life forms without the main elements they considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"It can grow with either phosphorus or arsenic."
"That makes it very peculiar, although it's a little short of a really 'alien' kind of lifestyle," said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report appearing in Thursday's online issue of the journal Science.
There have long been six major elements considered essential to life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur.
However, researchers have found that the bacteria, found in Mono Lake, California, may continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
“It makes you wonder what else is possible,” said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, a co-author of the report.
According to Anbar, the finding is important for the search for life on planets other than Earth, given that researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what it looks like.
The study focuses on a microbe discovered on Earth.
However, the call for a press conference to discuss it, in which no details of the discovery were disclosed, generated great speculation on the Internet about the possibility that the report indicated the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
He didn't.
What the discovery "does show is that in other planetary environments, there could be organisms that use other elements to boost their biochemistry and that the set of "standard" elements that we consider indispensable for life may not be so fixed," said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is novel because it demonstrates the substitution of one element for another in biochemistry and basic biochemical structure," Cockell added.
The discovery was not made by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA’s Institute of Astrobiology, who led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it has elevated levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, so he speculated that a microbe exposed to both could replace one with another.
“Arsenic is toxic primarily because its chemical behavior is similar to that of phosphorus.”
“As a result, it can be difficult for organisms to differentiate them.”
“However, arsenic is different enough that it doesn’t work as well as phosphorus, so it enters and, so to speak, clogs up the biochemical machinery,” Anbar explains.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, to which they managed to adapt and used to grow.
The microbe grows best with phosphorus, but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a form of life that uses arsenic can exist naturally, either in other areas of the Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea that arsenic can be replaced by phosphorus is not new, but an example of how it works has never been found.
Arsenic was more common in the early Earth eras, he said, so researchers speculated that early life forms may have used it.
“It does suggest that there might be other means of generating life, not just the way life formed on Earth in the past,” said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon’s research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
Stolen dogs found missing in Compton
The two missing dogs from the four stolen dogs have been found in front of the Bellflower Motel, Los Angeles County sheriff’s officials said Thursday.
The four competition dogs, two Akitas and two Welsh Corgi Pembroke, went missing Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van they were spending the night in, in front of the Bellflower Motel 6, authorities said.
Two of the canines recovered Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two were found late Wednesday, according to Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is that the dogs are doing well," Whitmore said.
"They're in good shape."
“They have returned to their rightful owners.”
Whitmore declined to say exactly where the dogs were found, in which neighborhood, or the circumstances of the discovery.
"An investigation is under way."
“We don’t want to say anything,” Whitmore said.
"We're following some leads."
The dogs' owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be found for comment Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas at a county animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff’s deputies found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month-old dog) had not suffered any damage.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis Rickard and Peek intended to exhibit at area competitions this week on behalf of the Japanese owners of the dogs, remained missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town for the AKC/Eukanuba national championship in Long Beach this weekend and intended to showcase Trace.
The other dogs were to be exhibited in other competitions planned for the days leading up to the AKC/Eukanuba championship, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the couple’s nearly two-month tour of dog competitions.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They usually stay in motels and park the van right in front of their bedroom window.
They carried three other dogs (a boxer’s calf, a Parson Russell terrier, and a Brittany) who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they have a very thick coat and would be cooler.
They left the windows slightly open so the dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the van was stolen at 6 a.m.
Peek had said that they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the Corgis, equipped with microchips to identify them.
It was unclear Thursday whether a reward would be given.
The lion is ready to roar again, as MGM’s restructuring gets final court approval
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has finally gotten the green light to start over.
On Thursday, a federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially approved the plan “pre-armed” by creditors to erase roughly $5 billion of debt, paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on producing and releasing movies and TV shows.
Thursday’s ruling confirms that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, so there are no other legal hurdles for MGM to relaunch under Spyglass Entertainment founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the lead executives of what will be a small studio.
Staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320.
In reality, MGM won’t exit Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a planned $500 million loan facility to fund operations and production of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently syndicated credit, which on its own is contributing $75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The restructuring process of the study began in May 2009, when investment bank Moelis and Co. was hired to give advice on the management needed to order its finances, while struggling to make interest payments of $300 million a year.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former Enron Chairman and expert on recovering bankrupt companies, known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper’s attempts to resolve MGM’s financial woes and satisfy the studio’s more than 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, in late 2009 the parties agreed to put the company up for sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders and none willing to pay the more than $2 billion sought by creditors.
Before the spring of this year, he returned to the design table as the MGM team began work on a restructuring plan that, after months of debate and internal disagreements, was finally backed by creditors in late October.
When MGM officially emerges from bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper’s companies will receive multi-million dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will get a $9.5 million payout.
Cooper’s companies, which have been raising $375,000 per month for their company management services, will receive a “successful fee” of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which released only one film this year, and put together an annual slate of seven or eight films due out in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit," along with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to arrange a separate loan of between $265 million and $275 million to fund its share of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM’s debt, had been trying to arrange a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent talks between the two companies did not result in a deal.
Tech Toys wants to keep its gift budget in balance
While the iPad is the leading candidate to be this year’s most wonderful toy, followed, perhaps, by the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both can mean a significant dent in your gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad you can buy five $99 BMX bikes each, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic beaded jump ropes, or roughly 48 cans of the Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
I recently visited three national toy vendors, Wal-Mart, Toys “R” Us and BJ’s Wholesale Club, to see which electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore’s Law has been working; this year’s tech toy will likely have more power, costing the same and even a little less compared to last year.
Also, while there are usually fewer new toys with partner websites, two of the most well-known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more deals.
And toys powered by button batteries are on the rise, as are toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are for Toys "R" Us unless otherwise noted.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for 3 years and up) are guinea pig-sized stuffed toys that sing a note when their bellies are tightened.
One squeeze equals one note, and a second squeeze starts putting together a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Caution: Once you start squeezing, you can’t stop.
For singing combined with dancing, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for 2 years and up) is the best choice.
Borrowing from last year’s Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays shift-changing games like Simóm Dice, and can do the moonwalk, thanks to its innovative wheeled articulated feet with locking device.
The children who tried the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor, though their parents complained about the lack of a volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you can remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He has returned (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for 3 years and up), with a backpack full of question cards designed to turn a car ride into a session with a witty self-correcting workbook.
If you are hesitant to give your child your smartphone, here you will find three independent alternatives.
VTech’s MobiGo ($60, ages 3 to 8) is the cheapest and easiest to use, featuring a qwerty keyboard; although the games don’t teach as effectively as the Leapster Explorer ($70, ages 3 to 12), it’s the first major overhaul of the Leapster line, with a newer, brighter display.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
Fisher-Price’s iXL ($90, ages 3-7) uses an iTunes-like system to present games and e-books, and has an SD card slot that lets you view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and up) is a set of five blocks barely larger than a matchbox, each with its own LED display.
The goal is to put words together by putting the blocks in a row before time runs out; it’s formidable for an impromptu word-making competition.
More and more toys have some kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toy stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a pet online in Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, ($5, ages 6-12) that includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you redeem the code online, your child gets enough credits in the Club Penguin store for two items.
These could include roller skates or a pet Puffle toy.
Slightly larger than the bristle on his toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and up) is the latest in a line of microrobots powered by button stacks.
The false insect quickly moves on 12 vibrating silicone legs, in random directions.
It’s fun to do a maze of blocks to see if you can find the way out.
It is also durable.
Ours was able to leave the kitchen table and even spend some time inside our dog’s mouth.
A more moderate side of law enforcement in China is promoted
As an urban drill sergeant, Tang Shenbin marked the pace in a city square, sternly inspecting the nervous people in his charge, quietly issuing orders with military authority.
He wanted the female members of chengguan, the burly policemen of China’s urban order, feared and despised for their capricious crackdowns and their penchant for violence, to communicate a certain impression to a handful of onlookers.
"Firms!"
"Attention!"
Show them, he whispered, "what pretty girls look like!"
Four girls who barely passed adolescence wearing white gloves and identical olive green jackets and tight pants to get attention.
Four pairs of perfectly aligned black shoes.
Four elegant hats perfectly placed on top of hair tied with blue and white striped bows.
“Personally, I think they look normal,” Mr. Tang said, dismissively.
"Models are cute."
More than one government has tried to clean up the image of China’s urban inspectors.
One city ordered all new recruits to have a bachelor’s degree.
Guangdong Province changed the grayish-green color of the uniforms to a supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the use of force with intimidating looks: In 2009, according to one report, 50 officers surrounded a wayward snack cart, and watched it frown steadily for half an hour, until the hawker picked up his things and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 in Chengdu, has chosen a radical makeover.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its urban police force, specifically chosen for their appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give the rough cop a softer, feminine side.
Sadly, even Scarlett Johansson would have to fight to increase China’s meager respect for these city squads.
And for good reason, critics would argue.
Unlike the police, these officers are authorized only to enforce city ordinances, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese news media routinely portrays a different reality.
In January 2008, Hubei Province inspectors beat to death a bystander after using his cellphone to film them as they broke up a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for inspectors from Beijing was stolen and posted online, describing how to effectively whip criminals without making them bleed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon street vendor suffered brain damage after a scuffle with five officers.
A violence-filled video game, available for download online, features Chinese-trained inspectors attacking street vendors.
“Chengguan has left a scar on the government,” lamented China Daily, a national publication, last year after another controversy over tactics.
The newspaper demanded “a really meticulous clean-up.”
Skeptics say the current approach is a far cry from this.
After the district requested through a notice eight new female recruits in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News wondered if the women had royal duties or were simply a stage distraction.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district’s notice called for female candidates ages 18 to 22, with a good figure “and the five harmonious facial features.”
They should have been above average height, above 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is mandatory.
Officials said the work was physically too arduous for women over 25.
“Your image is the important thing,” an anonymous district official told Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temperament "and inner qualities."
The female chengguan are like vases, he said, adding, “besides being vases, they will have other responsibilities.”
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district’s city administration office, isn’t eager to support that description.
But he noted that height requirements were standard in many Chinese job advertisements for both sexes.
Then comes the requirement for harmonious facial features.
Whether this means being handsome is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Surely, the disabled or disfigured should not show up.
“We cannot allow a lame person or a hunchback to come to work here,” Mr. Zheng said.
"His image wouldn't be right."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22, with red cheeks and a subtly curved mouth.
She doesn't think the accent on her appearance is sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with a sardonic look.
His dimpled co-worker, Xu Yang, 21, said “Our work should present the image of the city.”
They also don’t object to their time-bound work, they said, because they harbor greater career ambitions than simply scaring off salespeople in the alleyways where they’re supposed to circumscribe their business.
Each morning, the squad faces about a dozen street vendors who throw themselves on foot or bicycle, trying to sell as many buns or bowls of tofu as possible before being thrown out.
"Mr. Wang, you have to go."
"We have told you many times!" said Miss Xu as a salesman escaped on foot, temporarily abandoning his bicycle-drawn cart with noodle garnishes.
Officers describe their duties as more monotonous than exhausting.
“This is pretty much the same every day,” said Huang Jing, 20, who studies marketing in his off-hours.
"Very routine."
One reason is that female officers lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate merchandise from vendors.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male supervisors.
This tends to protect them from the sudden public displays of animosity against bureaucracy, which are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, rioted after a false rumour spread that a vendor had been killed by chengguan officers.
More than a dozen police or chengguan officers were injured in the nighttime episode; 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has so far avoided such violence.
But calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks from peaceful Baoguang Square, where female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered at a corner.
Officers had seized a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a workshop, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the bike screamed rudely.
The situation stalled for 15 minutes before the officers, with a bad face, made way for the elbows to their vehicles and quickly left with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator assigned to the men’s squad, remained behind, with his white badge turned over to hide his name.
As female officers, coordinators, men aged 40 and over, play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to maintain an elegant image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
“Sometimes we struggle physically,” Mr. Li said quite naturally.
“Most of the time it’s the audience that starts the fight.”
Prosecutors won't press charges against Senator Ensign
The senator’s lawyers announced Wednesday that Justice Department prosecutors have cleared Sen. John Ensign of criminal charges stemming from his affair with a former campaign aide and his efforts to secure lobbying work for the woman’s husband.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat facing Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal over his affair made national headlines last year and damaged his career.
Ensign’s office said it was “surely pleased” by the decision, which came after a full-year investigation.
The senator could still face disciplinary action from the Senate ethics committee.
Ensign’s lawyers said the Justice Department had “informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer a target of its investigation and that it has no plan to bring charges against him on this issue.”
The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.
The announcement came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, who said there appeared to be significant evidence to indicate Ensign may have conspired to violate a federal criminal lobbying ban.
Interviews, email and other documents that were first released in October 2009 in the New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his aides, get lucrative lobbying work to silence Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as an Ensign campaign treasurer.
Ensign contacted several political backers to find Mr. Hampton a job and advocated on their behalf after they had hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
As Hampton had recently been an assistant to Ensign, he was excluded under the lobbying law for his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts said the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, appeared at odds with the so-called "revolving door lobbying ban," which seeks to restrict former state employees from using their connections to do personal business.
From the evidence that has been made public, “it appeared to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to substantially violate the revolving door statute,” said Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney who specializes in defending clients investigated by the government.
While Justice Department officials declined to explain the reasoning behind the Ensign decision, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department appeared cautious about accepting political prosecutions after several major setbacks for its public integrity section, including last year’s decision to drop prosecution against former Senator Ted Stevens amid charges of procedural misconduct.
Federal prosecutors “are clearly cowards,” said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a advocacy group that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
“This basically means that high-ranking government officials can now assume that the laws don’t apply to them,” he added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign’s lead attorney, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a Justice Department prosecutor on Monday and another call the next day, telling him that the department did not want to press charges against his client.
Ensign’s defense team had been cooperating with prosecutors in attempting to persuade them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement Wednesday, “acted in accordance with the law.”
Coggins declined to elaborate on the legal arguments he gave prosecutors.
“I don’t feel comfortable going into details about my discussions with the Department of Justice, I can only say that we think they made the right decision,” he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to change an investigation into a separate complaint by the ethics group, which alleges that a $96,000 payment from Ensign’s parents to the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The electoral commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove the money was nothing more than a gift.
NV Energy is a major Nevada company that had long supported the senator, who got a lobbying job thanks to Ensign’s help with Hampton.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, Ensign’s chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Hampton and told him he was “crushing” the Home Office over a disputed issue.
Ensign also attended a luncheon with Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and called the transportation secretary to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Hampton to lobby.
When news of the affair first surfaced last year, Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned his position as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for many months, two weeks ago Ensign told reporters that he planned to run for a third term in the Senate.
When Ensign spokesman Jennifer Cooper announced that Ensign was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, he said the senator hoped the ethics committee would quickly follow the Justice Department’s lead and conclude its investigation.
“Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his difficult work on behalf of the people of Nevada,” he said.
Cheshire's appeal will target Twitter
There were half a dozen of them "chatting" in the rows of the courtroom.
Minute by minute, they sent reports of the gruesome testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defense says, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process that addressed the rape and the children tied to their beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the widely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a Cheshire, Connecticut, family, is set to come to an official end, with the death penalty judge’s imposition voted on by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes’ lawyers have filed briefs in court outlining the arguments of appeals that are likely to occupy the courts for years.
One of the most provocative claims that the intense reporting on the process, including the widespread use of Twitter by mass media journalists, created “a circus atmosphere,” and such widespread and immediate saturation with exhilarating details caused public passions to exert inappropriate influence over the jury.
The claim could force appeals judges to grapple with the question of whether new technology requires new rules in the courtroom.
“Based on what I experienced during this process, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technology in the courtroom is affecting the rights of the individual to have a fair trial,” said Thomas J. Ullmann, senior counsel for Hayes’ defense.
Magistrate Judge Jon C. Blue of the State Superior Court laconically rejected the lawsuits in a ruling last week, saying the news media was “carefully monitored” and that there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passion.
But it probably won’t be the last word on the subject.
For decades, appellate courts have recognized that coverage of celebratory cases can raise questions about the fairness of a process.
In a landmark 1966 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in his decision, in the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case, that there was “a carnival atmosphere in the process” due to the media.
The crime is believed to have been inspired by the TV show and movie "The Fugitive."
Some lawyers said that the appeals courts that examined Mr. Hayes’ conviction half a century later might be intrigued by the argument that new rules might be needed to control the form of communication from the courtrooms, something unimagined at the time of Dr. Sheppard’s case.
“There is a general cause for concern about the impact of new media” on high-profile processes, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied Connecticut’s death penalty and wrote a report saying it was arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said some appellate judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from courtrooms could make trials fairer.
The Twitter issue is just one of many issues outlined by Hayes’ lawyers, which will likely be discussed for years, delaying an execution.
Defense attorneys also claim, for example, that Hayes could have been harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors, showing them creepy photographs of the crime scene during jury selection.
Some jurors have said they were horrified by the photographs of the victims, 48-year-old Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her daughters, 17-year-old Hayley and 11-year-old Michaela.
Defense attorneys say they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge improperly removed a jury that had criticized prosecutors, and that he had improperly pressed for a verdict for his bizarre decision to order the jury to deliberate over a weekend.
The jurors were not kidnapped.
But his arguments about the effect of the intense coverage of the process may attract most of the interest.
They noted in a recusal of the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the media continually poured fuel into the fire of excitement over the case.
“The daily agglomeration of media tweets, cameras and reporters out of court,” the lawyers wrote, “was something never seen here in New Haven and perhaps across the state.”
His focus on Tweeter coverage is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said that the complaint about the fact that immediate news was more important than slower-delivered reports was a luddite view that would make the court’s policy on control of coverage weak in future proceedings.
But some lawyers said appellate courts were often drawn to the arguments about adaptation that were required in the courts because of social and technological changes.
Hayes’ lawyers are pressing for that claim.
In their brief, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision, which overturns Dr. Sheppard’s conviction because of the coverage of the process, and made it clear that they would demand that new media would require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case of the 21st century."
Can civility build a bridge to bridge divisions?
After a remarkable campaign for invective and negativity, a bit of civility has broken out in Washington this week.
Is it a harbinger of genuine future bipartisan cooperation or an illusory moment before a quick return to partisan combat in the capital?
Tuesday’s meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders produced no progress on the big issues that need to be addressed during the outgoing session.
But from everyone’s point of view, it was at least a courteous discussion of the two sides’ differences, as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another empty episode to gain partisan points.
Wednesday’s public meeting of the president’s deficit commission was equally civilised, despite the political differences that remain between members.
It seems clear that the close interaction over a period of months generated a mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap that still separates members.
That is hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Now both sides are in a period of trial, probing each other to identify signs of cooperativism and compromise, as they try to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed partisan war.
That’s why Tuesday’s meeting and subsequent evaluations by participants were made with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and deep-seated to suggest any rapid climate change that existed over the past two years.
Whether it’s taxes, spending, healthcare or welfare, the two sides are at opposite poles.
Anyway, the November election has softened the mood in Washington, at least in the short term.
“There’s no doubt that things have changed with regard to the way things are said,” said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the Center for Ethics and Public Policy.
“It’s inevitable after the election.
Elections arouse party passions, which are then extinguished.
That's good."
On some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the outgoing session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush’s tax cuts are due at the end of the year, and no one is in favor of this.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all of the reductions, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, there is likely to be a commitment to expand unemployment benefits, probably because Republicans can’t make believe they are in favor of tax cuts for the wealthy, denying unemployment benefits for unemployed workers.
After Tuesday’s meeting at the White House, there is greater optimism for a possible deal on these issues during the outgoing session, along with the ratification of the new START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) nuclear disarmament pact.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on the pressing issues of the outgoing session will not necessarily lead to continued bipartisanship when the new 112th Congress convenes in January.
He claimed, on the contrary, that it is very likely and even inevitable that a period of disagreement will begin.
“After the things that need to be done are done, in the short term psychology will revert the situation to one of confrontation,” he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism (which is widely shared) about the fact that civility can lead to real cooperation.
“I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as a rehearsal for the main event of 2012,” he said.
The reasons have a lot to do with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and the Tea Party voters, who contributed decisively to its creation.
As much as Republican leaders are aware of the dangers of overstating their position, they know they must try to keep their promises to cut state spending and repeal the new health care law.
Those party lines are already clearly seen in the initial reactions to the deficit commission recommendations, which include reforming the tax code and raising some taxes and raising the retirement age, and cutting spending.
Co-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, by their own assessment, have forcibly introduced the deficit issue onto the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes on the 18-member commission to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and have been struggling to get close to that figure.
The greatest resistance is among the elected officials on the panel, suggesting that on fiscal issues there is, at least today, little basis or desire for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between White House and congressional Republicans.
The first will happen next year in the form of partisan clashes, when Republicans challenge Obama on budget, taxes and health care, followed by a period of increased bipartisan cooperation.
What would cause the change?
Public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If confrontation leads to a stalemate, as happened in 1995, then both parties will watch the reaction of the people closely.
Whoever they think is losing is likely to change course and seek compromise.
However, this may be an optimistic view.
The partisanship and polarization are now greater than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and congressional Republicans than there was between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as the mere prelude to a more momentous election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civility shown this week can be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort on the part of both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
Leaked US document portrays Moscow as a corruption haven
Control of the city is in the hands of a “kleptocracy,” leaving a portion of the bribes and protection money it collects directly to the Kremlin, the U.S. Embassy in Russia said in February.
Both the police and the Federal Security Service are reported to be running huge blackmail systems, which helps explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They raise money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal groups.
Every stratum of the bureaucracy, what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has termed the “vertical authority,” takes its share as money climbs the ladder.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted by WikiLeaks on its website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow, and blames him for much of the corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev fired him in October, but there has been little evidence of a cleanup since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a major construction company, have consistently denied allegations of corruption over the years, and he has won several libel lawsuits over such allegations.
In September, when asked on a Russian TV channel about a documentary that suggested he was corrupt, he said: "It's crazy, a hoax, a nuisance."
According to polls, Russians overwhelmingly believe that their society is corrupt.
But it’s unusual to find the details explained in detail, as they were in the embassy report, and it’s unheard of for diplomats from a foreign country to do that.
“The Moscow city government’s direct links to criminality have led some to call it ‘dysfunctional,’ and to claim that the government functions more like a kleptocracy than a government,” the note states.
“Criminal elements enjoy a ‘krysha’ (a term from the criminal and mafia world that literally means ‘roof’ or protection) that cleaves the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the prosecutor’s office, as well as all sectors of the bureaucracy of the Moscow city government.
"Analysts identify a three-tier structure in Moscow's criminal world".
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The SFS, the MVD and the militia are on the second level."
“Finally, common criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level.”
“This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a void in some areas, because the city doesn’t provide some services.”
The report states that the SFS collects money from the largest companies, and that the police target small businesses.
One source, the report stated, “explained that Moscow’s business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and SFS (rather than organized crime groups) as they not only have more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but they are also protected by law.”
“For this reason, protection against criminal gangs is no longer a priority.”
The note notes that while money collection is complete, protection can be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who don’t pay quickly find their businesses closed for one pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but has confessed that he has made little progress.
The embassy note reports on men taking suitcases, likely filled with cash, inside the Kremlin itself.
“In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to trust bureaucrats,” Georgy Satarov, head of Indem’s Moscow think tank, said in a recent interview.
“But he’s a part of this bureaucracy.”
“He does not belong to a political class, because there is no longer a political class in Russia.”
Without politics, without opposition, without a separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
Nationwide, Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion per year.
In a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption conducted by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was ranked 154th (countries are ranked from least to most corrupt).
The disclosure of the U.S. Embassy memo, which did not occur until late at night Moscow time, will surely cause displeasure within the Russian government, and even though Luzhkov may be blamed for Moscow’s weaknesses, it could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed for CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested the WikiLeaks documents might be lies and reacted angrily to a revelation claiming that US diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
“The truth of the matter is that this relates to our interaction, which is an important factor of domestic policies in this country,” he said.
“But to be honest with you, we don’t suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you know, done in such an immoral way.”
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to face the past
In a dimly lit concrete classroom, with stained and peeling walls, the principal of Anlong Veng High School remembered the man who had built it, the last leader of the Khmer Rouge Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
“He was a good leader and cared about his people,” said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as “the Butcher” for his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule, the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwest Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and where thousands of the organization’s former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-held loyalty is finally being challenged at Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed victims to publicly confront people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed here a high school textbook that for the first time teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And in July, a joint United Nations-Cambodia court issued the first conviction of a former Khmer Rouge member, sentencing the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture center, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of those developments, anxiety has grown among Khmer Rouge veterans of Anlong Veng, complicating efforts for reconciliation and their attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
“There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they can’t do anything,” said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Center, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
“For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil.”
“This is creating divisions within families.”
During the rule of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, approximately 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the government led by Pol Pot in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to Cambodia’s border with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last movement that surrendered in December 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led guerrilla warfare from their bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace deal led to the country’s first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began defecting to the government, culminating in the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without the support of their benefactors, the older Khmer Rouge fighters fell into the utter misery that is common in rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgia for the movement.
Although a few elite Khmer Rouge officials retained their local administrative posts in exchange for laying down their arms, the privates remain poor and unskilled farmers.
“These people have made little profit after surrender,” said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which provides public forums across Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
“They have incorporated the regime’s utopian agrarian ideology.”
“They were raised with no concept of doing business.”
Sister Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, struggled in the jungle near Anlong Veng before turning to life as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
“Life with the Khmer Rouge was fine,” he said.
"Ta Mok fed everyone."
“But now life is hard because we have to supply ourselves.”
The current Khmer Rouge court has also raised concerns here.
Early next year, the court is expected to begin prosecuting Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court's mandate is to prosecute top leaders and those most responsible for the crimes, but it has not said whether it will pursue cases in addition to those four.
This did not serve much to calm fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has centered on Im Chaem, 64, who was a district chief in Banteay Meanchey province during Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project in which thousands of forced laborers are thought to have died.
On a recent muggy afternoon, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to his home on wooden stilts on a dirt road on the outskirts of Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows on the parched grass, Im Chaem refused to speak of his past in the Khmer Rouge.
She claimed that if the court convened her she would not show up.
“Cambodia is at peace and stable,” he said.
“If there are more prosecutions, there will be war.”
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court pursues more suspects, though experts and historians question this.
“Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past,” he said.
But confronting the past is just what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the documentation center.
“Reconciliation, according to Khmer, is to put the broken pieces back together,” he said.
“It’s our obligation to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand.”
The center produced the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, called the 75-page “A History of Democratic Kampuchea.”
It was distributed at Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education’s high school history textbook, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city’s link to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their story.
But her parents reacted with skepticism when she took the book home to study.
“My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the court,” he said.
“They have suspicions because they are not sure how many people the court will prosecute.”
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, the textbook and the court are starting to make an impact, he said.
Anyway, here the Khmer Rouge retain a powerful charm.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a path with too many weeds and covered with discarded plastic bags leads to a rectangle of black soot covered by a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot’s body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a roadside cellphone salesman, said he didn’t know much about the man who was cremated there.
“But he has a strong spirit and many locals go there to pray to him,” she said.
It was Nuom Sothea’s birthday, and later that day he decided to walk to the place of Pol Pot’s last break, where he would leave a bunch of ripe bananas in the hope of good luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its stockpile of weapons-grade uranium
In a surprise victory for President Obama’s campaign to protect nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced Wednesday that it will give up its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a joint statement released after Foreign Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the sidelines of a security summit.
For years, the U.S. government had been trying to persuade Belarus to give up its highly enriched uranium and it seemed they had reached a point of no return last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that a pair of classified operations were conducted with Belarus in the past two months, to remove 84.82 kg of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
This paved the way for Wednesday’s agreement to remove the rest of the material, about 227 kg, according to an official, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the confidentiality of the matter.
The deal appeared to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit chaired by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And apparently it was a good achievement to secure the former Soviet republic’s invitation to the next summit in 2012.
“I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.”
“This shows that this process is working,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Society for Global Security, a group that promotes nuclear safety.
Clinton called the deal "a very significant and important step" taken by Belarus.
In April 2009, Obama pledged in Prague to protect all vulnerable nuclear material worldwide over the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries dispose of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama’s Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko had stated that the nation would never give up its uranium.
“We have preserved highly enriched uranium (hundreds of kilograms of what is basically weapons-grade uranium) and low-enriched uranium,” Lukashenko said at the time.
“This is our raw material ... we’re not going to make dirty bombs, and we’re not going to sell them to anyone.”
“We use it for research purposes, that’s all.”
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, indicating interest in reaching an agreement.
Officials said the first task of removing uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated, as the material had been lightly irradiated.
Officials said it was loaded onto a special train that traveled more than 2,000 km to a Russian facility for storage and disposal.
According to officials, the second operation ended Monday and was carried out by plane.
The U.S. government spent $13 million on the tasks, and most of the money was used to supply Belarus with the low-enriched uranium research facility, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, an Energy Department official working on Global Threat Reduction, said “this was very carefully coordinated and orchestrated to strengthen trust” that led to the deal signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus possessed at least 40 kilograms of weapons-grade uranium, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will seek to eliminate its reserve by 2012, according to the joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly due to Lukashenko’s harsh repression of human rights.
But Wednesday’s statement suggested a potential détente.
While welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue for improving bilateral relations, and is essential to the progress of the country and its citizens.
The Spanish Government did not object to CIA flights
The Spanish government did not object to CIA flights with Taliban and al Qaeda prisoners bound for Guantánamo on Spanish soil, the US ambassador in Madrid said in a telegram.
This is reflected in the documents leaked (cables) by Wikileaks to the newspaper El País, where it is added that the then First Vice President of the Government, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, requested that the Spanish Executive be informed in order "to be able to demonstrate that they exercised an appropriate surveillance on the foreign planes that cross Spain."
In June 2006, following a Council of Europe report accusing a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in anti-human rights practices, there was a meeting between former U.S. Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The vice president acknowledged that the Council’s report “had taken Zapatero’s government offside” and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no qualms about intelligence flights through Spanish territory."
“They just want to be informed” to avoid being “caught off guard,” Aguirre recounts in a cable.
The then Minister of Foreign Affairs, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also told the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this matter the lowest possible profile, although, being in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity for influence."
For his part, in January 2007, the prosecutor Vicente González informed the Embassy that he would not try to block the judge’s initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Ministry of Defense on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any incriminating elements or any sensitive information," the embassy said after speaking with the prosecutor.
However, the US reflected its concern about the “apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors”, rather than the declassified information of the CNI or the Ministry of Defense.
“This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between governments,” Aguirre said.
In March 2007 at a luncheon between the U.S. ambassador and Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, Rubalcaba told him that "although Spanish judges are rabidly jealous of their independence and will do what they deem appropriate," he had instructed his aides "to avoid comments of inflammatory rhetoric, in an attempt to lower the temperature."
The ambassador also expresses his concern about the PP’s action in this matter.
“Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on any indication that the Zapatero government condoned or deliberately ignored U.S. actions that could be interpreted as potential human rights violations, even if these disclosures have negative consequences for the U.S. government.”
The confessed parricide complained in the network of the "agobio" of being a mother
The young woman spoke of the child when he was already dead and had a blog: "Terror to the Galician"
Monica Juanatey Fernandez is "Muki" on the net.
With this nickname, which she used since she was a child, she communicated with a cousin and, at least, a friend; the two natives of Noia, the A Coruña town of which she is a native.
The messages belong to 2008.
To understand them, it is necessary to know their sentimental life, which ABC reconstructs through testimonies of their relatives.
The young Galician, 30 years old, began a relationship in 1998 with Iván Túñez, an industrialist.
They lasted a year.
When they left him, it soon became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him get a DNA test.
It was not long before he was known for another courtship.
The chosen one was Alberto, a boy from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
He came to live with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to probe the labor market, the little boy stayed with his partner, who even came to accompany her for a week to Palma.
But from the content of the communications, it is seen that their romance fractured, they broke up.
In March 2008 she is in Menorca, alone, and writes: "Alberto is very strange and pissed, because I have come to work."
“When I told him it was fine, but of course, now he realizes what it’s like to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do whatever he wants.”
Then, he talks about a message to the mobile he just received: "I want you to turn around this month or give me an address to send the child."
She complains, "If you don't like me leaving the kid with my mom, I'll pick him up when I get back," she alleges.

The people would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lleida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and experienced deputies in the recent regional elections, the Catalan PP already has its sights set on the general elections because, whether there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes that this formation obtains in those elections usually double that it receives in the Catalan ones.
Thus, the popular Catalans obtained 610,473 votes in the general elections of 2008, while in the regional elections of 2006, the figure rose to 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC won 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend continues, which has been nourished by a transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the PP electorate, analysts of this formation have calculated that, if general elections were held, the PPC could go from 8 to 12 deputies in Congress, while CiU would also win four (now it has 10) and the PSC would lose no less than 9 deputies (25).
These calculations would confirm that the Catalan square is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the popular, ERC would lose one deputy - now it has three - while ICV would stay with one deputy or win one.
But, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the most immediate appointment will occur in May 2011 with the municipal elections, where the popular can also be decisive in the end of socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in its replacement at the head of the Diputació de Barcelona, one of the administrations that manages the most budget - 661 million euros for 2011 -.
Both nationalists and popular agree on the possibility that the PSC will lose the municipalities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lleida and Girona, where the socialists would not obtain a majority or the possibility of resorting to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the Republican debacle, it would not be unreasonable for this formation to lose its representation in the Barcelona Consistory - 5% of the votes need to be obtained -.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lleida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can lead the turnaround in the Tarragona capital, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lleida, the PP has stood just 500 votes behind the PSC, whose mayor, Angel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met on several occasions.
The popular ones have also grown in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
Catalan cell provided thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, there were three in Thailand.
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerian arrested by agents of the General Police Information Commission in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, directed from Thailand, provided passports to different groups of Al Qaeda, including "The Tigers for the Liberation of Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the latter author of the Bombay attacks that killed 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior has attached great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that “operation Kampai” has “weakened” Al Qaeda’s falsification apparatus internationally and, “therefore, its operational capacity.”
The researchers estimate that the cell, in the two years it has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were falsified and then distributed to groups that make up the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda so that their “combatants” can cross the borders of Europe and other Western countries with total impunity.
The clean-up cell is not the only one that the jihadist network had operational in Europe, hence the investigations have involved, in addition to the Thai services, other European police units, so it is not ruled out that in the coming days in EU territory similar to the blows developed last Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested), another one was carried out in Thailand with the capture of the Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Sidique Khan Begum.
These were the ones who ran the cell based in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of it was hit in 2009 - mainly stole passports from tourists who met the requirements marked by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents had to be in the name of men between 25 and 45 years old, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
In the media of the investigation, it is stressed that, at the moment, no data has been found that links those arrested in Catalonia with the Bombay attack, despite the fact that the author of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the receiving groups of the passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it should be remembered that days before this attack was committed, about a thousand dollars were sent from Catalonia through a transfer agency that were "invested" in the purchase of mobile cards that were later used by the members of the "commando" that ended the lives of 106 people.
Police have seized extensive documentation.
The PP demands that Mas park the tax concert
The leader of the CPP, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally explain to Artur Mas his conditions to support his investiture as president of the Generalitat, identical to those already raised during the campaign and which are summarized in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and dispense with philosopher-sovereignist adventures, such as the economic concert that the nationalist leader wants to raise at the equator of his mandate.
The president of the Catalan popular attended the meeting of Artur Mas with the security that gives to have obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, a figure more than enough to make itself liked, because the candidate of CiU needs at least one of the formations that will exercise the opposition to abstain in the investiture vote.
On a possible entente with the PP depend the future alliances that the nationalists want to maintain in the Congress when general elections are held, but, for the moment, the conversations that Mas holds these days with the rest of the political leaders are made in a Catalan key.
And as far as the president of the PP is concerned, to support an investiture "it will be necessary to park all the sovereignist and independence speeches", as well as the economic concert - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader even intends to submit to a referendum.
Both leaders do have in common their commitment to thin the political apparatus of a highly inflated regional administration and the elimination of inheritance and gift tax.
The details of the negotiation on the investiture of Mas will be dealt with by the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a tough opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do it with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric claims that the deaths were not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of the Olot center do not rule out that their keeper killed more than 11 elderly people
The heads of the nursing home La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) offered a press conference yesterday to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who while employed there killed at least eleven elderly people in his charge.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by the lawyer of the center, the lawyer Joan Cañada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to exercise the accusation against the responsible" of the deaths but "the legality and the responsibility force us to assume the procedural situation of civil responsible".
In addition to the social discredit that the entity may suffer for not having detected in time the criminal activities of the jailer, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of substantial compensation that is already being calculated by the legal representatives of the families of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that since then he has not stopped killing.
The judge already pointed out in the order that ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the geriatric - that he suspected that in many cases no doctor personally explored the deceased but, taking into account the age and pathologies of the patients, the procedure was processed by phone.
La Caritat, through its director, denied this yesterday and pointed out that "the lack of measures can not have been at any time the cause of what has happened."
La Caritat's lawyer added that "in the case there is not a single indication that there has been a reckless action on the part of anyone other than the accused."
He confessed the day before yesterday to 11 murders and detailed that the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009 to, a month and a half later, kill a second grandmother.
In this case he caused his death by pricking an insulin overdose, unlike the first crime that he committed with the aid of a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat points out that it is difficult to control that the staff of the center have access to medicines.
Insulin punctures and the cocktail of sedatives were the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his eagerness to alleviate the suffering of the inmates, used to kill them.
But it will be the analyses that are being done in the laboratory that will have to clarify if Vila does not lie and sought for his first victims a less cruel death or if, on the contrary, he burned them inside giving them bleach as he has already confessed he did with the three women he killed between October 12 and 17.
In La Caritat they do not give credibility to the demonstrations of the jailer, not even to the number of confessed murders, which do not rule out that it is superior, and justify his attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the court and in the little sense that he has to change his way of proceeding after having committed, successfully, eight murders.
That is why they say they are at the disposal of justice to clarify the scope of this event.
The ECB Threatens
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to Trichet’s threat that warned “markets should not underestimate our responsiveness.”
Peripheral spreads have closed strongly and the shares of European banks have risen more than 5%.
Nor should we underestimate the ECB’s ability to make mistakes, however, and the euro has barely picked up, which is a worrying sign.
What has occurred yesterday is typical of an illiquid market that just as it collapses recovers but motivated by the closing of short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will be slow to lose his fear.
A month ago the ECB summoned us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to retract tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those that remain.
The Bundesbank demanded to finalize the plan to buy public debt as ineffective and eliminate all extraordinary measures of liquidity in term and leaving only unlimited access to week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect them to extend the current liquidity measures “at least until March” and to maintain the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We also expect them to continue their bond-buying program and even signal to step it up.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they remain obsessed with withdrawing liquidity measures, God help us!
As at their May meeting where they claimed they had not even contemplated buying bonds and markets collapsed, the story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka on Monday and on Wednesday said he had already bought a lot, causing a new market crash.
Yesterday the auction of letters to a year in Portugal has been very poor.
The Treasury only issued $500 million at 5.28%, versus $750 million at 4.81% of the previous auction.
Still, rates in Portugal fell 30 basis points across the curve, clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment following Trichet’s words.
In Ireland, figures from the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole have been made public.
The estimated figures are about 10 billion in the short term and another 15,000 potential and have until February to raise private capital or become nationalized.
Although Ireland does not have any credibility after failing to detect the problem in July with the stress tests, the figures are assumable within the Aid Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the government will have to get parliamentary approval of its new budget and still does not have enough support, so Ireland remains a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech to ease the tension ahead of the upcoming Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December which requires a political commitment that shows that we are a union and that we all play the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest Beethoven’s hymn of joy.
In Spain, the president had the gift of opportunity when he presented yesterday the plan of measures that will be approved on Friday by the Council of Ministers.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to revive employment sound to investors like Vivaldi’s four seasons.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explains that the Spanish Stock Exchange has risen 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike in February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been quick and overwhelming and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect so we hope it will be resolved with strong demand and help dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to ask for a Plan of Assistance would be self-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity that we do not need, the Treasury have more than 40 billion in liquidity available triple that in March, at very expensive rates and closes the access to the markets sine die.
However, the strategy must remain that of Caesar’s wife, “besides being, appearing to be”.
Come on, we can.
The president of Eulen will contest the board of Vega Sicilia requested by his children
The storm does not subside in the open conflict in the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will contest, considering it "null in full right", the judicial board of El Enebro next day 16, requested by five of his seven children and in which they will try to assert their majority and take over the management bodies of the owner firm of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Alvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José are fine-tuning the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their litigation for control by the group.
The founder of the largest holding company for business services to the company does not seem willing to give in his litigation to be present in the governing bodies of El Enebro.
His board of directors was disbanded by five of his seven children who were appointed directors at the meeting of shareholders on January 18 of this year and whose challenge is noted in the Mercantile Registry.
The judicial board of El Enebro for next day 16, convened by the magistrate of the Mercantile Number 2 of Madrid, has reopened the thunder box within the Alvarez family.
The recourse to the judge to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the convocation of the board.
The latest movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz, is described by David Álvarez as a "desperate resource of the applicants their five children to, through procedural trickery, in clear fraud of Law and abuse of right, try to validate and clean up the radically null meeting of January 18," according to their official spokespersons.
This argument will be the basis for that, once the board is held, it proceeds to its challenge when considering that it is “null of full right”.
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully to have the magistrate convene a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, a patrimonial company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, David Álvarez’s seven sons control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the group of services claims, however, the usufruct on 51% of the capital, according to family protocols.
This case is the substantive issue to be decided by the judge after the hearing on the challenge request, for which there is still no set date.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with secret Siemens weapon
Software designs improvements in cars in real time.
Since Red Bull broke into the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select universe of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
At first no one took into account the options of a newly arrived team and, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the final stretch of the championship everyone bet on the victory of Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without detracting from the ability as a driver of the eventual champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, or the ability of the Renault engine that powers his car, in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend the "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to make it a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German put on the market in 2007 for purposes far removed from high automotive competition.
Called PLM, this powerful computing instrument has been used to design assembly lines of manufacturing factories around the world, power plants, high-precision instruments.
The goal is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding failures and avoidable expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi airplanes or Nissan’s most famous utility cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens’ industrial division, explains that the use of this computing instrument in its Formula 1 factory has allowed Red Bull to design and carry out “in a few hours, almost in real time”, the modifications, changes and improvements that are detected during the races and in the tests.
Russwurm explains that the teams in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians in their team who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements to the vehicles during each season.
The Red Bull team today employs 180 highly qualified young professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all kinds of modifications in the cars.
The Siemens executive explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all the elements of the Red Bull cars with the exception of the engine, which is the entire responsibility of Renault.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
The changes can be taken from simulator virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limitation to this madness of technological improvement is the $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend at most each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech factory to design and produce its cars in a town about 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings in which visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered "top secret".
The roster for this task amounts to 580 people, including its two drivers, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull Formula 1 is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the energy drinks brand has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other protagonists whose contest is invaluable and its notoriety null.
The factory’s chief technology officer, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago it could be said that R&D advances in wagon cars contributed 50% of the victories and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have varied and technology accounts for 85% of the success, while pilots contribute 15% of the added value.
Nevey acknowledges that the Vettels or Webbers will never be replaced by computing as they “are unpredictable gladiators.”
HP to set up 20 own stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened its first exclusive collaborative store in Barcelona yesterday with its partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the network of 20 shops of between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain during the next two years.
The company will make this initiative compatible with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave as an example the remodeled store located on Barcelona’s Gran Vía, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom she has collaborated for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to locate 200 brand points of sale in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first to open were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible openings, although he recognized that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HP personal systems assured that the philosophy to install the stores will always be the same, relying on a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and is in charge of the exclusive furniture design of the stores (with products that can be touched interactively), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of facility personnel.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of shops aims to "improve customer service and SMEs in the purchase, attention, after-sales and even packaging."
The Barcelona store includes a space with a pioneering pilot program worldwide that is responsible for solving the possible problems of HP computer equipment under warranty.
An online service connects with a technical center located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"So, in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can sometimes take up to two days."
"This system is designed especially for SMEs and users, since large companies already have contracted technical assistance services," remarked Helena Herrero yesterday.
Sabadell bets to 'steal' a million customers from rivals in three years
More optimistic than other executives, Banco Sabadell CEO Jaime Guardiola believes that 2011 will be a tough year for banking, but initially rules out a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the liability war.
Despite this, it foresees a collapse in interest margins, which will be tried to compensate in part with increases in commissions and the price of credit.
Sabadell expects to attract one million private clients in three years, its pending subject.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new three-year master plan in 2011.
The objective, in addition to surviving without the need to resort to public aid from the FROB, is to gain market share with the acquisition of one million new private customers -700,000 if those who can leave the bank are discounted-, its great pending issue, since until now it had pampered SMEs and companies more than the retail client.
This year it has attracted 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share in individuals is 3.5%, while in companies it exceeds 10%.
Another of the bases of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment to productivity, or what is the same, of austerity, with cost reduction as an objective, and whose challenges will be exposed by the bank when it presents the results of the year.
Few banks today dare to set goals and make them public since the financial crisis has disrupted all the plans of the world banking.
Sabadell, in fact, will close this year its Optima master plan, set four years ago, although initially it was for three, but the situation of the markets made it expand one more year.
Customers who let the savings banks slip away will be their main target.
At a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a “difficult and momentous” year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", something fundamental for the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And, although he believes that the liability war – which penalizes margins – is shrinking, the price of risk premiums that banks and banks are paying for their emissions to obtain liquidity are already moving to the price of credit to compensate for the fall in margins.
“The issue of liquidity and financing is structural, and it’s going to be a pressure factor on credit.”
“We haven’t closed the tap, but the spreads are higher,” Guardiola acknowledged.
Banesto already gave orders to its network on Thursday to limit long-term credit and raise the price of spreads – see CincoDías on November 22 and 27.
He also acknowledged that the tendency of banking now “is to raise commissions,” but “there is a competitive framework.”
Sabadell’s master plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
Not surprisingly, he assures that in Spain "larger sizes are going to be required."
“Next year it’s all going to move,” he said.
He affirms that capital needs are "up a lot" and does not rule out that any Spanish financial institution enters in red numbers.
And he points out that the FROB can supply the market in raising funds in the face of new recapitalizations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, he downplayed what some bankers already predict as a new liquidity crisis.
He points out that it cannot be issued, but contrary to what happened in June, short-term financing can be obtained through repos, which cushions the crisis.
The ECSC rules out a second wave of mergers in the boxes
The director general of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out yesterday that there will be a wave of mergers of savings banks and again insisted on the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being executed.
When the process of concentration of the Spanish savings banks began, several entities assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would be reserved for the second round.
However, the general director of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out that this new wave of operations will occur.
"I think the biggest part of the mergers has been done, the incorporation of Cajasol to the Civic Banking group can not be said to be a second round, what there are adjustments."
"Most of it is completely done; instead of 17 we may go to 13 or 14 but all the great processes have already been done and supervised by the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated a lot also," said the director.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta has stated that the concentration process is being undertaken "at the highest possible speed, and we have to be very satisfied with how it is being produced in the deadlines that in their day, not now, were marked in the business plans with the Bank of Spain," he stressed.
“Going from 45 boxes with an average of 28.5 billion assets volume to 17.5 billion is a process that has no parallel in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to make them much larger to comply with Basel,” he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a series of rather unlucky opinions about the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and sense", because "what the Bank of Spain does is to remember that we have to be within the deadline before the end of the year".
The director general of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in Europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed to those who question it a "lack of knowledge".
The director said that, within the current economic situation, "we can be very calm" with the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, a system that has undertaken a process of concentration "very important" and that "goes at the fastest possible speed."
He also recalled that the Spanish bank came out very well from the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Shoemaker and the German Red Line
Berlin has chosen to stay in the euro but has set the conditions for the whole Union.
Tensions in the markets have provoked a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures, from tax reductions to SMEs, regulation of private placement agencies or elimination of the 426 euros of aid to the unemployed without provision, to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, has joined the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility in unleashing the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
Go ahead that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another twist in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future must be, which clashes with that of maintaining the old traditions of many of its partners.
Faced with European resistance, in Germany there is speculation about the three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, made up of itself, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, while the south would leave the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the framework, although it now seems science fiction, with a very favorable current of opinion, close to 50% of the population.
The third, a redesign of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines to the transgressor countries, possible suspensions of payments of some of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defined for a long time, so now there are no excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were stimulating deficits, the German government scrapped a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany believed should be done (plans of fiscal rigour and stability in public finances), and what its European partners, including France, were practicing.
The second in the forehead was given by the Central European country when Merkel painfully extended the decision of rescue of Greece.
Already then it was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion and published it were very much against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, again Merkel emerges with a clear position, demanding the reform of the treaties of the Union, to make possible the rescue of a country and, at the same time, to force private lenders to bear part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But his proposal, although somewhat sweetened, has been approved and, in the coming months, we should attend the process of reform of the Union that enables those measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And it is telling all of us that, although we must now take measures with which we may not agree very much, from that date the old functioning of the euro will be over.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which the offending countries will be severely sanctioned, they can be forced to declare in suspension of payments and, in that case, the private sector will also bear part of the cost.
Germany is signaling to us that we must follow a severe growth path with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the one that has presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, they will simply not tolerate it.
The envy is clear.
And we would do wrong not to understand it.
It’s not just about bringing the government deficit back to 3% in 2013.
What we are required to do is much harder.
And the worst thing we could do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will give way to greater tranquillity.
And let’s take advantage of the window of opportunity they have given us, until spring 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also understood this and his double manifesto (the reforms promised after last Saturday’s meeting with big companies and yesterday’s announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite the criticism of Merkel, the thesis that it is necessary to put order at home has made its way.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and it doesn’t look like they’re going to move it.
And, among the possibilities that are contemplated, to leave a monetary zone too crowded with unserious countries, it cannot be excluded.
Then, Germany will always be able to tell us that it had already warned us.

Shots like Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate ingenuity but not the will to escape a penalty.
The expulsion allegedly concocted by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the match played on November 23 against Ajax in the Champions League has caused rivers of ink to be written about whether or not such behavior is unsportsmanlike and whether, eventually, both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, with only a few minutes left to finish the game (which their team clearly had already won), the two players deliberately lost time when it came to taking the fouls to cause the referee to show them the second yellow card.
That way, and since Real Madrid will end up as leader of their group, both players will comply with the regulatory sanction the next game of the league, against Auxerre, and they will be able to pass clean of cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee has sanctioned the team's coach, José Mourinho, with two matches and with different economic amounts to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, but rather frequent in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, of the unwritten rules, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate that arose in the case reported is due to the fact that it has been starred by a team of the Real Madrid entity (which in its anthem boasts of nobility and honor, and that on past occasions has fined its players for analogous acts) and the dramatization orchestrated, apparently, by Mourinho, who adds one more episode to his long history of histrionic and provocative coach.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this type of behavior not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, that is, if these actions are committed fraud of law; because, in fact, they are actions respectful of the sports regulations, but they seem to avoid their meaning.
The question is to examine the type of damage they cause to sportsmanship.
One of the assets that includes sportsmanship is the physical integrity of opposing players, an aspect that with these actions was not endangered, that is, there was no violent game.
Another of these assets that is alluded to with fair play is to prevent the team of the offending players from unfairly taking advantage of the opposing team, which also did not happen.
Now, the paradox of the action of the Real Madrid players is that they did not accommodate what we normally characterize as cheating or fraud of law, because their violation of the rules was not done in secret to try to avoid the sanction, but precisely their action tried to be the most evident in order to receive the punishment of the referee.
They waited and gladly accepted the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offenders gain in the intentional faults examined.
Here it seems necessary to verify that the opponent is not placed at a disadvantage or profit in the same game, because obviously the result of the action means leaving the team itself with fewer players.
And it is not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club will not be able to count on those players.
The advantage, obviously, is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But it is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indeterminacy, because the team can be eliminated at the first exchange, and also with this action the players fulfill a sanction match and move on to the second cycle of cards, in which the suspension for accumulation of cards occurs with one less than in the first cycle.
So, if you go through rounds, it is not so clear that it is an advantage.
In short, these actions do not go against the sporting spirit, of which it is part to make strategic decisions that favor making the most of what the rules allow.
In the case at hand, the players did not act to evade the application of the sanction (this would be a clear case of law fraud), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without getting around the punishment or running away from it.
Although the boundary between wit and law fraud is blurred, this time I think it was a clear case of wit.
The controversy, it seems to me, arises from two factors: because it was two self-expulsions and the way in which the transmission of the directive to provoke them was carried out.
The damage caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not so much ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive of offers to capture Christmas dinners of groups in BCN
The dictatorship of the calendar concentrates this year an avalanche of reserves for the 16th and 17th.
The celebrations are self-suspended by the employees, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the nougat and the lottery, with the arrival of December also return the group dinners before Christmas, which continue to act as an oxygen balloon for the restoration and leisure of Barcelona, but because of the crisis they have resulted in an offensive of adjusted prices to be able to capture the majority client: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals, agree the businessmen and associations of the sector interviewed.
To complicate the accounting, this year’s calendar (as New Year’s Eve falls on Friday) has concentrated requests in the week of December 13, with the result to date of an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (the 16th and 17th) and barely movement for the previous week.
As has already happened since 2008, when the lean cow stage began, there are many companies that have eliminated collective dinners due to budgetary issues.
In order not to do without tradition, many workers keep it paying out of their own pocket.
Whatever the situation, both demand battle prices, confirms the president of the Restoration Guild of Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the employer, to this day, does not dare to predict what the celebrations of this month will be.
"People think about it a lot before booking."
"He wants to leave but he has the alerts turned on on on the issue of prices," he says.
The business will go well "to those who give quality at a good price and with good service," he adds, and recalls that customers tend to go down a step with the crisis, so that the band around 25 euros has become the majority in demand.
A survey in several downtown establishments shows the collapse of requests for the night of the 17th.
In the Soteras group they indicate that there is a real boom of applications for that Friday, with the intention of spending less than 30 euros, to which they have responded by adapting their menus to the situation, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to more advance booking, even since the beginning of November.
“We have done everything possible to maintain the same prices as last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros,” they detail.
In AN Grup, which leads El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and up to a total of 23 stores, they remain optimistic after detecting a boom in turnover since the second semester and good, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources of the group highlight that the 18th will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends who pre-celebrate the holidays.
To their six group menus they have added a Christmas menu, with the 30 euros or more as a star budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year in exchange for demanding more details, such as cava.
They also see green shoots in some companies that re-invite their employees and feel that the volume of groups is somewhat higher.
On the part of the employer Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure of Barcelona), its vice president, Enric Gomà, is confident of starting to see the end of the tunnel and maintains that together the reserves are "animated", although the customers "negotiate to the maximum".
Of course, the illusion for the celebrations has not gone down, pay who pays, he says.
Pakistan’s nuclear program is causing concern in the US
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at “a faster rate than any other country.”
Wikileaks leaks confirm links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the US embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department leaked by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns that the Pakistani nuclear program causes in Washington.
Apart from the enlightening and juicy details they offer about the content of the talks and the thoughts of the US diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal that the cooperation between the two countries in matters of atomic security, instead of increasing, “declines”, and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons “at a faster rate than any other country in the world”.
The peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program – that the weapons are not assembled but remain stored by components to hinder their destruction in case of attack – is one of the main reasons for vigilance in Washington.
As Ambassador to Pakistan Anne W. Patterson lists in a report prior to the visit of then-National Security Adviser James Jones: “The proximity of some nuclear facilities to territory under Taliban attack, the rumored dispersal of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials.”
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is seen, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason to stand guard.
“Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the drop in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working in nuclear or missile programs,” Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev told a meeting with his American counterparts.
What is new in the documentation leaked by Julian Assange’s website is the decreasing cooperation between the US and Pakistan on issues of nuclear proliferation and the high Pakistani rate of production of nuclear weapons.
An embassy dispatch in May, calling communication with Pakistan "frustrating," said: "Transparency is often non-existent; offers of aid go unanswered or are discarded."
Peter Lavoy, South Asia’s national intelligence official, said: “Despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world.
Ambassador Patterson also called on Washington, during a visit by Army Chief Gen. Ashfaq Kayani, to make it “very clear” to the commander that “Pakistan’s Army must end tacit support for terrorist groups.”
On the hunt for the head of Wikileaks
Obama appoints senior counterterrorism official to prevent further leaks.
Interpol issues a red alert in order to track the movements and locate Assange wherever he is.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to be certain about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a “red alert” to “locate and follow Assange’s movements”.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
It is not new, but dates back to November 20th.
And it has nothing to do with the latest leak of more than a quarter of a million US diplomatic documents but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
Mark Stephens, a lawyer for WikiLeaks, said: “Police know where and how to contact Mr Assange.
It was on the 20th when the international police force based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not reveal it until yesterday, after receiving authorization from the authorities of that country.
All 188 Interpol countries have indications to identify or locate Assange “with a view to his provisional arrest and extradition.”
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, as explained by the organization, do consider the so-called freeway notice network to proceed with an arrest - which must be undertaken by the national police body -, especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The movement has outraged Assange’s lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks has shown himself willing to respond by videoconference to questions from the Swedish authorities.
They also remember that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which they compare with the mythical Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin’s head of security.
“This looks like a hunt, not a legal persecution,” the letter said.
As the world searches for him – and from Australia his mother defends the innocence of her son – Assange remains unaccounted for, but not silent.
On Monday, he gave an interview to the editor of Time magazine via Skype from an unspecified location, in which he called for the resignation of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“If it can be shown that he was responsible for ordering U.S. diplomats to spy on the U.N. in violation of international treaties that the U.S. has signed, he should resign,” she said.
His opinion was reviled yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the request for his resignation “ridiculous and absurd.”
"I'm not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website," he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior counterterrorism official, Russell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama’s attempt to downplay Assange contrasts with views these days proclaimed by conservative politicians and commentators.
Peter King, the congressman who will chair the House Homeland Security Committee in January, has asked the State Department to study the possibility of including WikiLeaks on the list of terrorist organizations “to intervene and its funds and persecute anyone who gives them any contribution or aid.”
Further afield has been Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who has had to back down after saying Assange should “be killed.”
“Obama should make it a target and use a drone or something.”
The one who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible candidate for the presidency.
"Whoever in the government leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything other than execution would be too kind a punishment," he told Fox News.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with winks to those related to Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to circumvent the umpteenth internal revolt in the ranks of ERC, with no north by the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The president of the party is aware that his threat of resignation is insufficient for those related to former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of that sector is today as diluted as his own mentor and that it can not cause him the headaches he had with other extinct currents.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra will try to win over the new critics with winks that allow him to shield himself until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that the more than 200 national councilors of ERC will be able to pronounce on its continuity in secret.
By ballots, and not by freehand.
If the Carodists want to drive a certain vote of punishment to the president, they will be able to do so without fear of reprisal.
In fact, the leader of the ranks wants to avoid the image of division as much as the image of subjection to his person.
In several interviews, he stated that he would not consider himself ratified with half plus one of the votes, but added, without specifying percentages, that a result "to the Bulgarian" would not be good either.
Those close to Carod demand more from the president than putting his office at the disposal of militancy, a gesture that is not valid when Puigcercós controls the highest body between congresses.
But since they do not have the majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive a road map between now and May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document that the management will submit to a vote of the national council on the 18th.
His intention is to endorse Puigcercós in exchange for this promise to advance the congress to autumn 2011, something that the dome already takes for granted.
The ERC leader acknowledged that “polyphony” harms stability and that his goal is to make the organization capable of washing dirty rags from doors in once and for all.
In this line, it is symptomatic the article that the acting advisor Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
Considered the ideologue of Puigcercós, the head of Innovació assumed that the leader will be endorsed "in exchange for various objectives."
And he listed five, of which two stand out.
The first, "recompose" the executive to represent at least 90% of the militancy, that is, include new faces that come from the sector related to Carod.
The second may be the big news.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquidate assembly as a functioning mechanism.
Thus, it advocates a reform of the statutes that allows congresses to be held through delegates elected by suffrage.
Ending the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which already fought in this regard in the last two congresses.
In fact, the conclave of 2008 left the task to the direction to review the assembly in a specific congress of reform of statutes.
This appointment is still pending, as the internal tide of recent years discouraged addressing the issue.
Now, with no critical sectors lurking, it may be a good time to pick it up and try to shut it down forever.
23 executed in November; 290 during 2010
According to the Millenium State of Mexico count, there was a decrease of four cases compared to 2010.
During November, 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four fewer than the previous month according to the content of MILLENIO Estado de México.

In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water channel of the Playa Golondrina colony.
Emergency corps conducted a thorough search of the other members of the corps, however they were not located.
Neighbors of Tepotzotlán alerted about the discovery of a corpse that was in the Peña Colorada area, which was tied with the hands back and with the head bandaged.
The man had a gunshot wound to the neck.
In the middle of the month, the execution of two men was reported, who were wrapped in blankets and abandoned in the trunk of a vehicle in the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda subdivision in the municipality of Atizapán de Zaragoza, along with the victims two messages of death warnings were also discovered.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.

In Ixtapaluca, with gunshots to the neck, the lifeless body of a woman was found in the town of San Francisco Acuautla.
On the woman’s skin were detected tattoos of Santa Muerte, as well as necklaces with her image.
In the latter part of the month, the body of a man in the municipality of Zinacantepec was found aboard a car with at least three gunshot wounds and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of a pair of men with a taped head and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies was a message allegedly signed by a criminal organization that said: "This happens to those who do not align."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and tied hands and feet, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Center of the San Agustín neighborhood.
On the last day of the month the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz, and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first of them was decapitated in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and was wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with cinnamon tape and next to a message; while, the second was tortured and found in a plastic bag in streets of the Colonia Juárez.
Next to him the agents found a card with a message.
China aims to reduce greenhouse gases
The representative of that country at COP16 assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and explained that it supports its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, China’s representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei said his country has made enormous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and reconvert its industry.
In fact, in the last four years, his country has invested 245 million dollars in efforts to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases.
However, he made clear that China will not change its objectives, but will continue to work together with the international community on this issue.
China’s climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity-building; institution-building; and support for pilot programs.
In all these areas, progress has been made, including the approval, last year, of a new Energy Law, which includes the objectives set in terms of reducing emissions of gases, he explained.
In China, federal authorities have been working in coordination with state and local authorities to achieve the goals of energy saving, efficient energy use and emission reduction.
In addition, several multi-year plans, both financed by the Chinese government and by governments of other countries, are underway or already concluded.
For example, he said, the Energy Efficient Use Program, which was implemented over the last five years and received investments from the United Nations (UN), the government and the private initiative.
A provincial climate change project is also underway, another for the change of incandescent foci for savers and one more for mitigation and adaptation, he explained.
At the same table, Martin Krol, scientific advisor to the government of that country on climate change, said that China’s efforts have been greater than generally thought.
For example, per capita greenhouse gas emissions in China are six tons per person, while in the United States they are 100 tons; China is responsible for 9 percent of the historical contribution to pollution.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, such as increasing energy efficiency by 20 percent in the last five years and plans to do the same by 2020.
Expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN explained that the former PAN leader is in his right to go to the National Order Commission to claim what is in his right.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was attached to legality and that the former PAN leader is in his right to go to the National Order Commission to claim what is in his right.
In an interview before Gabino Cué Monteagudo took office as governor of the state, he said that in any case the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right to appeal, if any, to the Commission of Order of the National Council, so that it is a decision taken within the scope of a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that it is not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance for the presidential candidacy was never at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez said he is convinced that Acción Nacional will emerge strengthened from the internal election on December 4 and 5, in which his successor will be elected.
"That (a 2012 alliance) is an issue that was never on the negotiating table, at least not for now, it was an approach to the local election that was successful and met the objective," he said.
The PAN leader said that 71 years of dialogue support the PAN, so "we are not afraid of internal competition; on the contrary, we enjoy it and it strengthens us," he said.
He said that the council will undoubtedly know how to choose the best or the best leader that requires National Action for the next three years, hence he will deliver the scam "to whom the council determines."
“I have that absolute peace of mind and openness, any one of the five would be proud to hand over the party president’s office.”
He predicted that the rebound that the party registered in the last elections of July 4 will be reflected in the next races, although "it is not yet time to think about 2012. "
"For now, it is about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments emanating from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, hence that "many hopes, longings are placed in them, and I am sure that Gabino will live up to expectations."
When asked about the PRI’s criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his speech during the four years of his government, César Nava called on the PRI to reflect on the six-year terms of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
“If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, let them start defending them, let them come out of the closet,” he said.
He opined that the head of the Federal Executive can make expressions like those he made in his speech in the National Auditorium, because in the country there is no gag, much less censorship.
Obama Promotes Twitter Law for Undocumented Students
“If you agree that passing the Dream Act is the right thing to do, call your senators and urge them to pass this legislation,” Trump tweeted.
President Barack Obama today joined the national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message on his personal Twitter account.
“If you agree that passing the Dream Act is the right thing to do, call your senators and urge them to pass this legislation,” Obama tweeted.
His brief message keeps open a cyber link to a broader document that asks the public to immediately communicate with senators, given that the legislation’s vote is imminent.
“With a vote expected to happen soon, now is the time to make your voice heard,” he says.
The message came after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote on any legislation unless the extension of Bush-era tax cuts and government funding is approved.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other bills such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned by the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other bills, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs hoped that once the fiscal issue was resolved, a timetable could be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think there's a lot of time..."
"We all agree that we have to resolve the fiscal issue before the end of the year..."
“I think we can get a deal at some point in that and then we can plan the sequence of the rest,” he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he would call for a “debating vote” on the Dream Act, so the bill to legalize undocumented students could be voted on starting next Thursday in the Senate, though it’s more likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act would legalize about 800,000 young people who entered the U.S. before the age of 16, have remained in the country for the past five years, and have entered a higher education institution or the military.
But supporters require 60 votes to pass the bill, requiring the concurrence of a handful of Republicans, at a time when pro-project organizations are lobbying hard to secure passage of the bill.
Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, hold 58 seats.
But at least one of them, Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said he will vote against it, and only one Republican has expressed support for the law, Indiana’s Richard Lugar.
Therefore, supporters of the Dream Act require adding several Republicans in case other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most courted Republicans are Maine Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as outgoing Sen. George Lemieux of Florida, who completed Sen. Mel Martinez’s term.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past include Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but have said they won’t support it another time.
Another Republican he supported, John McCain, has not defined his stance at this time.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
With literature they put their finger on the sore
The second round of The Pleasures of Language was a walk where the participants showed off the narration
"That of sex in the language I understand it but ... the finger in the sore? what is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second round of The pleasures of the language, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and this time used the subtitle of his question (in another fair the round table was dedicated to sex in the language, he explained).
The finger in the sore... "puts us in trouble", sweetly snapped the Argentine writer to the public, mostly young people, who met at the Guadalajara International Book Fair (FIL) to listen to this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz and where Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would later define as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who in search of knowing what the "sore" is, goes from doctor to doctor, from which she does not get answers although she does get clues in the same narrative thread.
From the infectologist comes out convinced: "patience is not my strength, maybe it is my wound."
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who has stolen his breath in the middle of the corridor, but who clarifies that sore is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the sore is the open real, the symbolic is the scar."
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded "from the sore I only managed to know that it is the real open and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the language must be very intertwined.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also exhibited a delightful narration that he titled In Praise of Invention, where the finger in the sore is not named but at one point is discovered.
With brushstrokes of magical realism, the story of a famous sorceress, who touched clouds, brought back men who had gone far or repaired the virtues that a maiden had lost, a narrative that turned to speak later America, the great novel that was not lacking from the beginning by its own chroniclers who told it and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticizes the excesses of what was told by the conquering captains.
"Cervantes who invented us all (the writers) made fun of the pretended witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise the story of America would never have come to be told with imagination that lacked even modesty."
However, he stressed "it is the fools and liars who best imagine" and it is where reality and lies converge, where it is no longer known that what is narrated belongs to one side or another, where fiction literature reaches its peak.
He calls it, in fact, the "Cervantine tradition."
"By his inheritance we are what is told."
In her turn, the writer Mayra Montero noted and applauded the variety of interpretations that gave rise to the invitation of the FIL with her round table The finger in the sore.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican pointed hers towards the great wound of social violence that crosses her country - and shares Latin America - product of the disputes of drug trafficking and sale.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that of course is not premeditated," he said, citing that the reality of literature is communication and the dimension of the commitment that is established between author and readers, and that in a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The night was closed by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero whose intervention also emphasized "that finger in the wound of the committed writer of the writer".
He considered that in a world that lives in a hurry, also in intellectual customs and control of consciences that results in dogmatism, forgetting "that behind every affirmation there is a small no and behind every denial there is a small yes".
“To be masters of our thinking and to be masters of reality we have to nuance: and nuance often means putting our finger on the sore and disturbing those people who are much more comfortable thinking of caricature, in black and white, in established ideas and without nuance and also disturbing the powers that prefer a world in black and white,” he said, inviting to recover the sense of writing.
Romano goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in finals, has had ups and downs in his career, but has already managed to reach the decisive series on three occasions.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, they also face two different styles marked by their technicians, who find each other with a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has already managed to reach the decisive series on three occasions, although so far he has gone blank and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentine has ended up consoling himself with the medal of the runner-up, he has been a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he has played consecutive finals.
The Santiago strategist reached his first final as a coach in the 2002 Apertura Tournament, when he was in charge of Morelia with which he fell 4-2 against Toluca; subsequently, in the Clausura 2003 he also reached the decisive match and also lost it with a 3-1 aggregate and it was precisely against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, again against the Devils, Rubén again suffered a setback, since his team finished tied 2-2 against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalt set a 3-1 lead with two chances to seal the title for finally three players failed from 11 steps and suffered the 4-3 flip.
Rubén already lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, therefore does not want to run the same fate, seeks to get rid of the curse and be able to celebrate for the first time a title, although he says that for him the most important thing is the institution.
"I want to be champion, I do not want to break any statistics, this is for a club, for a hobby to which I owe myself and consequently the title will come for me, but the above is the most important," said the helmsman when questioned about the numbers he has against playing finals.
“The only teaching we can have is that until the referee whistles the end we can not celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players too, because the previous time, with two penalties for shooting we were already prepared to run and I think that is a teaching, until the game is over we can celebrate.”
Knowing that this series could be defined in penalty kicks, something that does not worry him, because he trusts his players: "One never seeks to reach the penalty shoot-out, one seeks to finish in regular time, but sometimes there is no other and we must be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately we made a bad move to fate, sometimes because of the nerves or anxiety of having the title in our hands, but it went away, that left us something for us."
Romano has it in his hands to stop being a technical runner-up and try for the first time the glory that titles give.
Changing the rules to get a visa
Individuals should go to the Visa Applicant Service Centers prior to their Consular Section interview; the cost will be lower and so will the waiting time.
Beginning January 10, 2011, the visa process at the U.S. Embassy and consulates will change.
With the new procedure, most applicants will need to go to the Visa Applicant Service Centers (ASCs) prior to their interview in the Consular Section.
ASC staff will take the applicant’s biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for applicants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to arrange the appointment, another payment to process the visa application and another one for the courier to deliver the document.
The applicant will only make a one-time payment that will cover all three services.
The current fee will remain unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for petition visa cases (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for merchant and investor visas.
People who wish to renew their visa will not have to attend an interview with the Consular Officer, but will only go to the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and take their fingerprints.
Because biometric information will be taken at the ASC, applicants who require a second appointment to be interviewed at the Consular Section will remain at the ASC for less time than in the past.
Likewise, those who apply for a visa at the Consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of 26 dollars.

NASA Announces Discovery of Extraterrestrial Life
The US space agency has summoned the press to present tomorrow a finding that will impact the search for living beings in space.
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will unveil an astrobiological discovery tomorrow, Thursday, that could prove the theory that extraterrestrial life does exist.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference on Thursday at 1:00 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, a science described as responsible for studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
Citing the press, NASA said it would present "a finding that will impact the search for extraterrestrial life," prompting speculation from experts in other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that creatures exist alongside us and in hostile environments that were thought uninhabitable, and would put on the table the possibility that they will become intelligent beings like humans if the conditions in which they live improve.
Apparently this is a microbe that was found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was thought too poisonous for any form of life, since the lake is rich in arsenic.
Somehow, the creature uses arsenic as a way to survive and from this capacity increases the possibility that similar life could exist on other planets, which do not have our benevolent atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be shown that "there is another way of life, a second way of life, different from the one we know".
The space agency will unveil the true scope of the findings at tomorrow's press conference Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturn’s largest moon), from the perspective that its chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergence and Opponent 'Block' Pattern
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, it gives rise to the arrival of ‘bipartisanship’, they denounce.
The 60 Legislastura was not installed when an opposition bloc emerged in Congress, headed by the deputies of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared himself independent, and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of ‘bipartisanship’ in the Chamber.
Before starting the session of installation of the 60 Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergence; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of the PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, 'thundered' against the reform to the Organic Law, since it excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, “bipartisanship” begins, because now it will be two people, of equal number of parties, who will control Congress.
These four deputies, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Board, headed by the PANist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, in his capacity as vice president.
Corvera Quevedo explained that these institutional reforms constitute political marginalization on the part of the PRI and PAN.
He explained that in the coming days they will talk with the representatives of the PAN and PRI to modify the scheme, starting from a political will, and if they do not have it, then they will be subjugated again by both parties and with this the opposition coalition ended.
“This is what I look at, because we are excluded, from any decision, they don’t even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest.”
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, from Convergencia, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Patrón, there are coincidences and therefore they are forming a plural group.
Congress, after having been monopolistic, cannot now be allowed to be “duopolic.”
“It is not the spirit of law reform that there is eternal bipatidism in Congress.”
For starters, this group is starting with 5 legislators, and they are conversing with other colleagues to make them more, the convergent abounded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT, explained that currently the Congress became a 'booty' between two, in allusion to the PAN and PRI.
“It used to be just one game, now they’re splitting it between two.”
Patron Montalvo, asked to respect the personality of the deputy, to give him his place at the negotiating tables.
"That not by cupular agreements, it is left out 5 that we will probably make 9 deputies, right now to the five that see us, separated into different fractions, we have decided to unify to find a place at the negotiating table, that is the issue that in the reform that they made that they agreed, we are out and we do not agree with that reform."
$200,000 more for "supplier"
Mazatlan City Council pays another check to the questioned owner of an electrical equipment company.
One more check for just over 200 thousand pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Council.
With this, the amount that has been paid in this second semester to the owner of the company of electrical material, amounts to 1 million 200 thousand pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipality, this last check number 9258447 was issued on November 16, for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, under the concept of "liquidation of accounts payable".
The Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had anticipated that more money would come out of the Commune in favor of this supplier, which was observed by the Superior State Audit for selling at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total that is still owed and, consequently, how many more checks are missing to be issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
“You haven’t bought anything, you’re just being paid what you’re owed, just like the rest of the suppliers,” he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29 and the latter, on November 16.
Although the provider has not yet been published in the Official State Gazette, as marked by the Law when a company is questioned by the ASE, in order to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer assured that they have not used their services again.
This, after that on July 25, Northwest published a review of the checks issued by the City Council to its suppliers, in which it was revealed that, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, in the triennium of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, Camacho Palazuelos was paid by the Municipality more than 10 million pesos, through 42 checks.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, where he cashed checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Urge to attend tourist sites
Tourist businessmen lament foreign tourist accident due to bad conditions of the Sánchez Taboada Glorieta in Mazatlan.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a sinking of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourism sector of Mazatlan asked the authorities to pay attention to the areas and sites that are in poor condition and that project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Merchants of the Golden Zone, recalled that on different occasions they have denounced that the image of the destination is taken care of and reverse the bad that tourists find with new activities or routes.
He said the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks has affected because tourists come for a walk and see the mess and take him around to nearby businesses.
“Politicians don’t know what it’s like to shut down a company one day and have no idea how much money is lost, or else they wouldn’t do the work this way in such a long time and without proper planning.”
The hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the City Council.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do it by giving preventive maintenance and not just falling into the corrective," he said.
“We are eager to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must be maintained, but as inhabitants we deserve a clean place to live and the City Council must change its strategy to keep the city well.”
There are other sites that also look sloppy and incomplete, he said, such as the Mazatlán Shield and Vendadito.
"Today, for the tourist to come does not depend solely on the promotion, there has to be a good product, a city that has cleanliness on its beaches, in its avenues, permanent maintenance in what are the tourist attractions," he said.
"Due attention has not been given and this type of fact highlights something that is notorious by all, maintenance is needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Undersecretary of Tourism Promotion, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlan is urgent, because they are not used correctly and project a bad image.
He talked about a series of places that must be put online in conjunction with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up to date, clean, orderly and that is attractive because it is a tourist vocation.
"Fortunately Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural sites and places that will have to be sorted first, cleaned and put online to make them attractive to add to the inventory we have to promote the destination."
Requesting results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, president of the CCE, proposed that deputies assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa because of the diverse challenges it faces.
A Legislature of dignified work and free of agreements between parties and the State Executive claims the business sector of Mazatlan, because there is a convulsed Sinaloa that faces major problems.
Since yesterday the 60th legislature was installed, composed of seven political forces, 19 deputies of the PRI, 13 of the PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of Convergence and one more of the PVEM, which adds up to a total of 40 popular representatives.
Among the list of expectations of the new members of the State Congress is that they come to carry out a clean management and commitment to society and the different sectors that require responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of partisanship or paternalism are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, president of the Business Coordinating Council, proposed that the newly inaugurated 40 deputies of the State Congress assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa because of the diverse challenges it faces.
“We hope that the deputies really exercise their right, free of agreements between the parties because it is customary that they make arrangements to look after their own interests and become carnival troupes of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary fractions.”
Hence, he spoke of certifying the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that bring forward the Ruler in turn.
“We make sure that they come to do a dignified job and above all committed to society and sectors because it was the Sinaloans who gave them the vote of confidence in the last elections.”
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Three Islands Hotels Association, considered that one of the great challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to push and join forces in search of the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is very complicated.
“The most important thing is that they push economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure and that will somehow encourage job creation.”
As for tourism activity, he demanded that the new legislators give him the weight that he has within the state budget to strengthen the state Secretary of Tourism.
"I understand that it is the second Secretariat in the state with the lowest budget and is incongruous as an important economic activity and generator of foreign exchange and investment and that it directly competes with the agro-industry."
In addition, it is required to label resources to detonating tourist projects and that help to give security to the state and in the update to the Alcohol Law that they have not been able to solve in previous legislatures.
Looking for a Magic King
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the longing of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For his parents, the next Day of Kings will be difficult to please their illusions, since their home is made up of nothing more and nothing less than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaias, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house in Colonia Salvador Allende and live up to date because the father does not have a permanent job.
“Well, sometimes we look tough because my husband doesn’t have a chamba, but we sell mandarin and potato ... already in the afternoon I go out with the ‘plebes’ to sell on the street,” said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, mother of the little ones.
Adelaide, 4, wants a doll or a bicycle, while her sister Isabel, 3, would like a Barbie doll.
For his part, José Alfredo, 10 years old, has long aspired to have a monster car and for his little brother Jesus, 8 months old, Cayetana suggests clothes size for a year.
“He said (José Alfredo), ‘I would like this monster,’ but I said ‘let’s see son,’ because it was very expensive,” Cayetana recalled sadly.
For older children, who were in school, clothing and footwear would be ideal.
Maria Guadalupe, 11, is a size 12; Isaiah, 10, is a size 10, while Michael, 8, wears a size eight.
Jose Juan, 14, lacks tennis, so a pair of size five and a half or six would be very helpful.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true, you can participate in the campaign Se Busca un Rey Mago, donating a toy or cash at the reception in Noroeste.
Fourteen suspected drug traffickers arrested
On Wednesday, in Estrie, a dozen persecutions have been carried out in the framework of the dismantling of a network of production and sale of Cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The persecutions have occurred in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in the places where the production of the drug was carried out.
“About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment destined for production have been seized,” said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for Quebec Security.
In total, eleven men and three women have been arrested, including the two alleged leaders of the network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The detainees had to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse in the hours following their arrest.
They could face accusations of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These persecutions have occurred after a long investigation that has lasted about a year.
“It was the information provided by the public that allowed us to make the arrests,” Mr Ruel said.
About seventy officers from the Quebec Security Estrie investigation module, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department participated in this police operation.
The fight against illegal migration can be fought without problems
The Conservatives’ bill, which the government says should solve the problem of smuggled migrants, is sure to face strong opposition, as all three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I rely primarily on the Charter."
“I’m meeting here with a party that has created the granite you step on,” said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by MPs after the weekly caucus meeting.
The Liberals argue that the bill in its current form, which would allow anyone from a vessel identified as transporting illegal immigrants to be detained for up to a year, violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Quebec Bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill because it points to the wrong target.
“We are against it and it seems that all the opposition parties are against the project, so we will see what the government does,” Duceppe said.
The NPD’s immigration critic, Olivia Chow, has snubbed criticism that her party isn’t strong enough with illegal immigrants.
“The neo-democrats agree that measures should be taken against those in charge of the clandestine pateras and that is what we intend with another bill, the C-35,” points out Mrs. Chow.
“We don’t support the Conservative bill because it attacks refugees and imprisons children for a minimum of one year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused parties of playing politicians and ignoring the will of Canadians.
“The vast majority of Canadians tell MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal operations against Canada and that they treat the country like a doormat.”
“They expect Canada to take firm action,” said Minister Kenney.
The government has not announced a confidence vote on its bill, which could lead the country to an election as a result of its rejection.
However, a conservative has told the QMI Agency that the government was going to request a vote so that each member who is going to oppose it is explained later to his voters.
The new unity does not achieve unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent anti-corruption and anti-collusion unit by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public consultation commission on the issue.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, supports that this idea has not been raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted with the Department of Investigation of New York is question since January last year.
The metropolis has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
Tuesday’s announcement has therefore caught more than one by surprise.
It should be said that during a meeting of the Permanent Council on Quebec Police Services held on October 29, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was enough for the Quebec-based critic of public safety, Stéphane Bergeron, to call the announcement “a rabbit out of the hat” and “a sloppy last-minute solution.”
Minister Dutil, for his part, has responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence over possible future unity.
“You’ll see the results when we announce it,” he says simply.
“We are aware of this problem.”
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launch of a public survey.
“The more Mr Charest persists in avoiding the creation of this commission of inquiry, the more people share our opinion, that is, that he has something to hide,” he explains.
“The only way to have a commission of inquiry is with the resignation of Jean Charest,” explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this impasse, he suggests Quebec grant a special mandate to the Comptroller General to conduct a survey on collusion and corruption.
“We must be able to expand the mandate of the Comptroller General,” he concludes.
It also considers that Quebec could grant the auditor the same powers as a commissioner, thus allowing him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent crew is not the only project in the making in the Charest Government.
Quebec also requests Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to make it better suited to this type of crime.
This request appears to have come from the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who has informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in this type of investigation.
The Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed for his part that his counterpart of Justice, Rob Nicholson, is currently inclined to make certain amendments in relation to this issue.
During the Spring 2001 operation involving groups of bikers, although the Penal Code had not been adapted, 131 persons were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently pushed for the adoption of the Gangster Act.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Several watercourses are being closely monitored due to heavy rainfall that has been recorded in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
On Wednesday afternoon there was a landslide in Shawinigan, in Mauricie.
As a preventive measure, two houses have been evacuated.
In the evening, another landslide occurred at Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road sank.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, different regions recorded heavy rainfall, between 40 and 70 millimeters of rain.
An additional 20 to 40 millimeters are expected between now and Thursday night, depending on the region.
The sectors north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to a total of 100 millimeters of rain.
Since these precipitations add to the snow melt that had already accumulated in certain sectors, it is feared that several rivers will overflow.
On Wednesday evening, Quebec’s civil security unit issued alerts for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
Rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérème, in the Laurentides, and in Lotbinière, have already caused floods in the past and are under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has caused lakes to overflow in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, heavy rains have dragged a temporary bridge.
As a precautionary measure, 10 residences have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the overflow of certain lakes has led to the closure of several roads, in particular in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The civilian security unit remains on alert and monitors the situation closely, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
Quebec’s Flood Prediction Center on Wednesday issued announcements communicating the heavy flooding of several rivers, notably the Maskinongé, the Assomption, the Ouareau, the Achigan, the Batiscan and the Loup.
Partially blame Dupont
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont has suffered a certain setback before the Canadian Council of Radio Television Standards (CCNR) for controversial statements regarding welfare and Haitians, as well as for his rude language on the radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements contained “inaccurate information about social assistance, an unduly negative representation of Haitians and rude language that should not be used in broadcasts broadcast during the day.”
The Council also indicated that the discussions on suicide, including the release of the names of two people who had committed suicide, do not violate broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received a number of complaints regarding comments made in broadcasts broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was issued following a complaint by the Quebec Common Front of People Receiving Social Welfare.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the issuance were not correct.
Presenters should report reliable data and not misleading.
In relation to suicide, the presenter Stéphane Dupont had stated that suicide was an act of cowardice.
Most Committee members had concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be considered as a solution to life ' s problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the disputed episodes of 'Dupont le midi' have dealt with a sensitive issue in an equitable and appropriate manner."
Therefore, any fault has been dismissed in this respect.
The latest litigation concerned statements made in the aftermath of the Haiti earthquake.
At that time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had staged a media confrontation that had aroused numerous reactions.
The CHOI host stated that he had not made any donations to help Haitians because he could not know for sure if those in need were going to actually receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already served my three-day suspension up there."
"My file has been clean for a year and a half," he said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the issuance of rude language.
In any case, the radio network CHOI-FM has collaborated “even more than required”.
The consequences will be minimal for the broadcaster, which must, among other things, announce the decisions once in prime time within three days.
A King of Kung Fu in Montreal
The Algerian-born Montrealer Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar run.
The athlete, who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and thai box, climbs the tatami mats and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
“I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria,” explained Zemmal, who has lived in the metropolis since 2008 to advance at the professional level.
“In my case, I’m looking for fights everywhere because, for those who don’t enjoy the on-the-ground play that mixed martial arts involves, there are few competitions in North America.”
The athlete, who works as a security agent and as an employee of the UPS company, has recently given bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the amateur World Championships of the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), held from 23 to 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
“I’ve won in the full-contact kickboxing and Thai-box categories,” he explained.
"I am currently preparing to participate in the San Shou World Cup in China."
“They will invite athletes who have finished in the top four in the last world championship in each category.”
"In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto".
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished in eighth place."
“In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, but I reached third place in Toronto in 2009,” he added.
“The interesting thing is that I’ve been making progress in every competition.”
"At this rate, I'll be the first this time or next year!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originally from China in which it is allowed to hit with the fists and feet, as well as throw opponents to the ground.
Clashes are originally held on a platform and, less frequently, in a ring.
The most famous pugilist in this type of combat is the Vietnamese-born American Cung Le, widely recognized in the martial arts world.
Although Nacer Zemmal only has to maintain a competition in his career, he will undoubtedly attend the great "King of Sanda" tournament, the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
"This competition is the most notorious and prestigious in China," explains the friendly boy.
“It’s like the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (Thailand’s biggest stadium).”
“It’s been an amazing experience.”
Zemmal has won his first match, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), but lost in the final.
“The one who beat me is a real professional,” he says.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"Semifinal winners face off in their category final".
"Next, the champions of each category face off to crown a single champion, the king of kung-fu."
$450 million in non-tender contracts
Hydro-Québec has awarded $450 million in direct contracts to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than a hundred contracts is a consortium formed by the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has obtained without a prior tender the most important contract, that of project management, for a sum of 295 million.
The consortium, called Énergie gérance, was created in 2004 following Hydro-Québec’s decision to entrust the private sector with its responsibility for managing this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
In early 2005, the Énergie gérance consortium won the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Quebec Party, the use of consortiums of companies poses a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and cause a rise in prices.
“This is a new method of collusion and eliminating competition.”
"That is, the people, instead of doing it in secret, now do it openly," Quebec Party MP Sylvain Simard told a news conference yesterday.
Earlier in the morning, Mr Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because, he claims, he does not understand how it can benefit the public interest in this way.
Natural Resources Minister Nathalie Normandeau responded in the afternoon, firmly denying that collusion with this contract has occurred.
“I’m starting to get tired,” he protested, arguing that the PQ had acted “dishonestly” and “with lack of rigor.”
He said the “minimum” would be for the PQ to apologize.
The consortia formula is a common practice throughout the world.
Typically, this is a partnership with a time limit that allows two or more companies to pool their knowledge to respond to a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the magnitude of the works.
The works have already begun and will last until 2012.
In all cases, the contract was awarded without competition; it was a negotiation.
In addition, the consortia formula is no longer the exception to the standard in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir published last week, the formula of the consortia in the field of technical advice is being subjected to an investigation in the Government.
A quick look at Quebec’s trade register allows you to identify more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
In this way, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal person, that is, Dessau.
Regarding the Énergie gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the James Bay territory responds to a particular labor dynamics and Hydro-Québec responds specifically to it since the 1970s."
The head of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has given an explanation that has highlighted the fact that the project management contract has been granted directly.
“If you respond to a tender and there are few participants, your prices are going to be higher.”
"You have two options: you can get in touch with the players in the sector and tell them: we are going to negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price."
"However, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competition of people," Mr Laporte said.
The contract awarded to the Énergie gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts worth more than $50,000 obtained by the Québec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following verification, Le Devoir has identified 109 technical advisory contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has won 22 contracts, Génivar has won 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account its participation in Énergie gérance.
All contracts were negotiated.
In total, they amount to $449,783,344, including Énergie gérance ' s contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard has implied that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well-known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau has dropped that the PQ is also linked to these companies, which "finance" it, before specifying that it is more about their leaders.
Barometer of responsible consumption. The "green" label does not inspire confidence
Greener, but deeply skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little faith in sustainable development actors, as well as fair trade brands and green certificates to guide their choices.
According to the Barometer of responsible consumption, whose first results were published yesterday, the situation is even worse. The consumer is immersed in a media universe where messages that defend more responsible consumption swarm, but regrets the lack of reliable information and considers that this even slows down their commitment.
Even if consumption of so-called “socially responsible” products has increased in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those trying to sell them.
Two-thirds of them say, in fact, that they do not trust the environmental commitment of companies or the environmental advertising of them, reveals the measurement tool prepared by the Observatory of responsible consumption of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another conclusion: half of consumers question the reliability of official certificates that carry so-called fair products, as well as the credibility of products and brands that bear labels indicating that they are “equivalent,” the Barometer notes.
Similarly, only 14.6 per cent of Quebecers take politicians’ speeches on this issue seriously.
In any case, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this consumer sector, currently supported by about a third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, the gaps and doubtful nature of the information mean that 46% of consumers discard this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
In addition, a third of Quebecers say they also distrust the supposed returns of the ecological products or services that they are trying to sell.
Moreover, almost half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, especially, changed the brand of one or several products to respect their convictions.
61% have given priority to shopping in their neighborhood stores and have preferred to buy food products grown in their region, says the Barometer.
Greener and more responsible (the index of responsible consumption has reached 64 points out of a maximum of one hundred this year), the Homo consumerus of Quebec loves to occupy the position of the king of recycling that tries to reduce its impact on the environment by worrying about the protection of the fauna.
However, according to the Barometer, that social awareness seems to be from outside: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers indicated that they have used public transport or have shared a car to defend their environmental principles.
In addition, 39.1% of participants in this comprehensive behavioural survey, which has just completed its first edition, support cycling and walking.
A loan for the State to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to commit financially to the recovery of the eXcentris cinema complex after the Société Angus and the Parallèle, agrees to collaborate, but only by means of a loan.
The Société de développement Angus and the Parallèle, who were expecting a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the eXcentris film complex on Boulevard Saint-Laurent and return his true film vocation, have not obtained what they asked for.
The government has agreed to be involved in the matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan that would, in fact, be below initial expectations; this could be a viable solution on advantageous terms, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected a first action plan and a $12.8 million request last spring, but applications have since been revised down.
The president of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), Francois Macerola, who heads the eXcentris dossier, referred a proposal and an action plan to Minister St-Pierre.
He sent you a final report a dozen days ago.
However, the SODEC received a counterproposal from the cabinet on Tuesday.
The Parallèle and Angus have until December 31 to respond to it.
In any case, it seems that the hypothesis of a State donation must be completely discarded.
Recall that the Association of cinema owners and cinema complexes of Quebec opposed a direct investment by the State to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not finance real estate projects, since it has not done so with other cinemas.
On the other hand, several representatives of the sector do demand considerable economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the complex, has carried for ten years the burden of auteur cinema in its premises of the complex, after financing its own construction, which could justify a repeal by the Treasury Council.
The lack of rooms for independent films is evident in Montreal and eXcentris had managed to retain its clientele.
Angus and Parallèle, led by Christian Yaccarini, are running a private financing campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to make their way to the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of these venues, the Parallèle, continues to screen films at eXcentris.
The objective of the future buyers is to reopen the three halls on February 27, screening the beautiful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
However, Christian Yaccarini has not contacted Le Devoir again and we do not know what he and his group think of the downward proposals they have received.
The veil of Canada is lifted.
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks reveal what the U.S. regards as the Canadians’ complex with respect to the Americans, but at the same time reflect the latter’s sense of superiority towards Canada.
U.S. diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters don’t think about Canada-U.S. relations when they go to vote and believe that President Obama’s visit has helped the Conservative government get its budget passed in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington that were made public yesterday offer more juicy details than really substantial content.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, that is, during the full federal election campaign, recounts the extent to which the United States does not enter into the issues debated by political leaders.
This caused great surprise to the American ambassador sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations on this situation.
“Perhaps political leaders are conditioned by an inferiority complex virtually inherent in dealing with everyday domestic issues, rather than leaving such an election to the United States (as during the 1988 free trade campaign),” he writes.
Consequently, he concludes, the United States is “the proverbial elephant of this choice: omnipresent, but potentially too dangerous to talk about.”
The ambassador has even more trouble understanding this “deafening silence” because the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
“Logically, he believes, the ability of a candidate, a party, and even more, a party leader to manage these essential relationships should be a key factor voters should think about when voting.”
This feeling of importance can also be seen in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, charge d’affaires in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“His trip will help ensure the survival of the government during the vote of confidence in early February on the federal budget, whereby Canada will run deficits for the first time in the last decade due to a recovery plan of between $30 billion and $40 billion,” Breese writes.
Nowhere is there any mention that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to prevent the coalition from replacing it or that opposition parties conditioned its survival on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another communication from January 2008 signed by Ambassador Wilkins alerts Washington to the increasingly negative image conveyed by the drama series broadcast on the CBC in the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about the issuance of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which little subtle references are made to Maher Arar, the “No-Fly-List” or even kidnappings for the CIA to perform energetic interrogations.
Another cable says that during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to take in some Guantánamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner replied that he did, but that it depended "on each case."
At the end of the meeting, they wrote, “You have delivered a document to the Secretary of State regarding Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin.”
"The Secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, we can mention that tempers have warmed in relation to the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, Stephen Harper’s longtime close adviser, told CBC radio that the man responsible for this massive leak should be “killed.”
In the United States they echo Mike Huckabee.
A Global Plan to Renovate Lighting
Yesterday, the UN proposed in Cancun a plan to renew domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in one hundred countries to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) by an amount that corresponds to almost a third of the additional decrease that must be carried out to stabilize the planet’s climate before 2020.
This ambitious plan is part of the set of concrete large projects that the UN expects to be adopted in Cancun to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments in industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if incandescent bulbs, which still monopolize between 50 and 70% of the market, were replaced by fluo-compact bulbs or, even better, by bulbs of electroluminescent diodes (DELs or “LEDs”), much of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet to illuminate humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
It is equivalent to 70% of the emissions of the planetary car park.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that were to lower global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt of this amount should still be decreased to stabilize, before 2020, the increase in temperatures by two degrees Celsius to prevent it from getting out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat and the rest, that is, 5%, produces light.
In the case of fluocompact bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, energy consumption is still reduced twice more.
Fluocompact bulbs last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, like those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week (a company that has also participated in the UN study), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which allows us to get an idea of the savings that can be achieved with the replacement plan that would be applied in a hundred countries.
These new bulbs can also work with rheostats and emit very little heat.
Above, they do not contain any mercury.
Specialists have expressed reservations about fluo-compact bulbs, as they contain mercury and must be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless manufacturers issue instructions.
However, the main source of mercury emission on the planet is not fluocompact light bulbs, but coal-fired power plants, which emit a large amount of mercury to produce the electricity that is wasted by incandescent light bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the advantages that this international program would offer to each country.
For example, Indonesia would thus save one billion dollars a year in electricity and eight million tons of CO2, that is, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast looks forward to the announcement of the election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the “immediate” publication of the results of the presidential elections in Ivory Coast, given that the deadlines have expired.
“The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results immediately,” a spokesman for the UN chief said.
“Call on all parties in Ivory Coast and the institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until provisional results are announced.”
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission has allowed Wednesday's midnight deadline to pass without the results being released, three days since Sunday's vote.
About forty minutes before the end of the deadline, the president of the CIS had told television that the commission “was still working” to announce the results.
Calls for the CIS to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara have multiplied in the world on Wednesday.
However, Gbagbo’s side is counting on the Constitutional Council to annul the “fraudulent” votes in the north, at the hands of the old rebellion of the New Forces (FN) since the failed coup d’état of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N’Guessan, campaign manager for the president of Ivory Coast, said the FN’s voter intimidation maneuvers in the north of the country had deterred supporters of the outgoing president from going to vote.
The entire election could be annulled if the Constitutional Council accepts Gbagbo’s complaints.
Gbagbo’s opponents consider the country’s highest court to be non-neutral, as it is led by Paul Yao N’Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any relationship with the former rebels, has judged the delay in publishing the results "unacceptable" and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone so far as to claim victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows he has lost and that filing a complaint with the Constitutional Council after having prevented the electoral commission from disseminating the results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections, on Sunday, should have put an end to the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country divided in two for years.
The United Nations on Wednesday warned Ivory Coast’s political class that they could be held responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished in the first round, on 31 October, with 38% of the vote compared to 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who publicly received the support of former president Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable at 9.3% in the mainland (9.7% taking into account the overseas departments), as indicated by the data corrected with the provisional seasonal variations (CVE) published on Thursday by Insee.
The number of unemployed remains at 2,631,000 in mainland France.
The data for the second quarter have been confirmed, 9.3% of the labor force in the continental territory and 9.7% with the DOM.
In one year, the unemployment rate has increased by 0.1 points.
Overall, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter, but they want to work, whether or not they are available in the two weeks to work and whether or not they are looking for work.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to worsen, with a further increase in the unemployment rate to 24.2% in mainland France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year), 25% including DOMs.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed within the meaning of the ILO.
For its part, there has been a slight increase in unemployment among the elderly, up to 6.4% in continental France (+0.2 points in three months and one year), that is, 482,000 people over 50 years old, a figure that amounts to 6.6% with the DOMs.
Unemployment has only been stable among people aged between 25 and 49 years, with 8.3% in continental France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
The Insee has not published the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, after a controversy over its methods of calculation.
Eurostat, the European Union’s statistics agency, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a 9.8% rate for France (DOM included) in October, up from 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini investigated and arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53, director of waste treatment companies and brother of President PS of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhone, is being investigated and has been imprisoned in Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into allegedly fraudulent public contracts.
Alexandre Guérini is being investigated for abuse of social goods, embezzlement of funds and public goods, cover-up, active corruption, influence peddling and possession of ammunition, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is going to fight and answer all the questions the magistrate asks him, not ghosts."
“It’s easy to go after him for a multitude of reprehensible acts, it’s another thing to prove them,” his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before her client’s appearance.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the PS leader in the department, Jean-Noel Guérini, wanted to transmit through his lawyers to the judge, before his appearance, a document to explain himself.
On Wednesday night they began investigating and also imprisoned one of their close associates, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, all his client has done is take care of the landfills he must manage.
As for the allocation of the contracts or the destination of the funds related to their execution, he knows nothing about it, according to lawyer Simon.
Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the urban agglomeration of Aubagne, is also being investigated for embezzlement and complicity, but he has been released on parole and is prohibited from meeting with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that have been reproached."
"The investigating magistrate took account of the explanations and released him," his lawyer, Yann Arnoux, said.
On the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, four other people were interrogated and released, under judicial control in the case of two of them, according to the deputy prosecutor of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy general manager of the Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM) property, has been charged with “influence trafficking and passive corruption.”
Two officials from the Aubagne agglomeration, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, have been questioned for “sequestration and embezzlement of public goods by a person dedicated to public service” and for “complicity in the embezzlement of public funds”, respectively.
Finally, Alexandre Guérini’s partner, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated for “covering up the abuse of social goods.”
Among the people who have faced Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Corsica.
Researchers suspect that their societies have served to launder the capital of the great banditry.
The investigation is being carried out within the framework of several court orders initiated against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous communications, for alleged fraud in the allocation of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
A source close to the investigation points out that the investigations focus especially on the conditions of allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as from other cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss: Elisha has exaggerated Syria’s mediation
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher detained in Iran for “espionage,” has been on the lookout for the public in France, alerting diplomacy and accentuating the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of U.S. diplomats.
U.S. documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal certain unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how the Elisha has explained his strategy to the Americans to the point of giving them advice to manage their own “hostage” crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young Frenchwoman did not come about in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian arrested in France and wanted by US justice for trafficking materials for the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they reveal the stark reality of how the French presidency attempted to manipulate the media to give the idea that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad had played an essential role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris bears the title "Iran: French comments on how to manage hostage-taking cases".
The Elysee’s advisor for strategic affairs, Francois Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d’Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, speak with the US diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
Explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do the following to repatriate their own citizens forcibly held in Iran.
“Make noise,” they say, “continually release” in the media the words “fundamental human rights,” “innocence,” “immediate release.”
All to shame the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
“When Iranians ask you to stop, do it even more often.”
Because, once the attempts to negotiate through discreet channels have been exhausted, "silence will not solve anything", the Iranians are "experts in delaying maneuvers".
Mr Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is “a common Iranian tactic: the taking of hostages for political blackmail”.
He announces that the release from prison of Clotilde Reiss (which will occur on August 16, the day she will take refuge in the French embassy) “will require the payment to the Iranians of a large amount of money” (230,000 euros of reward).
In addition, he points out that the Elisha anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that “is going to increase.”
The Iranians could “in the near future detain another of the about 1,800 French citizens living in Iran,” he says.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is released from prison after 12 days, but she is blocked in Iran.
The following information was disseminated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States requested for illicit trafficking of sensitive electronic material into Iran, had been released in Paris by a judge ' s decision.
The U.S. Embassy, like many observers, doubts this strange coincidence.
For Washington, which is closing Iran’s clandestine nuclear procurement networks, the release of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Has France accepted an exchange?
Releasing the Iranian in exchange for the French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, Francois Richier guarantees that this was not the case.
Elisha, he says, has not only “been greatly surprised by the judge’s decision,” but has attempted to oppose it.
“There have been intense negotiations between the French presidency and the Minister of Justice” (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but “the French government cannot overturn the judicial decision,” he says.
Mr Richier also wants to prove that Majid Kakavand is still under the "narrow" surveillance of the French intelligence services.
Elisha’s adviser dials a phone number, hangs up and then informs the U.S. diplomat that the Iranian “is currently in Paris buildings run by the Iranian embassy.”
During the arrest of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysee spares no effort, using statements and "leaks" organized in the media to make believe that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential" role of "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity with a certain irony and see that the manipulation bears fruit, since several press articles transmit the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 mentions "the media blitz of French officials".
What is the reason for this “gratitude” towards Mr. Assad, the embassy in Paris wonders.
“Despite their praiseworthy statements, French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have really done.”
Next, the document deals with the reasons that have led Elisha to give rise to this fiction.
The communication effort “is aimed at validating Sarkozy’s policy of opening up to Syria,” he said.
A policy initiated in 2008, which "in the opinion of numerous critical voices in France and abroad, had just been branded as premature and undeserved."
By “exaggerating the Syrian role,” Paris tries to “show Syria the praise it can reap if it plays a constructive role in the region.”
The goal is also to “sow the seed of discord between Syria and Iran.”
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, Francois Richier confides in him: “Of course, we don’t know if the Syrians have done anything or not.”
“But anyway, we thanked him.”
“At the very least, this should lead to confusion among Iranians.”
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at the Elisha.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for playing an "active role in favor of the release of our compatriot."
After Midnight, Young Koreans Cannot Play Online
The South Korean government will adopt a so-called "Cinderella" law that will prevent teenagers from participating in online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials have said.
In December, a bill will be submitted to Parliament to ask online gaming companies to block access to such games after midnight for young people under the age of 16, according to representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family.
"Many children play all night and then find it difficult to study in school and lead a normal life during the day."
"We believe this law is necessary to protect your health and your right to sleep," said Jo Rin, the minister responsible for the bill.
Online games will be available again at six in the morning.
Companies will have one year to prepare for law enforcement, he said.
The government also plans to ask companies to limit the time of daily access to these games when the parents of the young people request it, added the responsible.
In addition, it will make available to those who request it free computer programs that allow limiting the time of Internet connection.
South Korea is one of the most “connected” countries and newspapers regularly report on various events linked to heavy Internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, where it faced off against 58 other countries.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA designates the organizing countries
Amid the storm of corruption suspicions, FIFA’s executive committee on Thursday designated the countries hosting the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a clear political choice where influence struggles and lobbying may come to take precedence over technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition will be held in Europe, traditional bastion of the discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, given that the International Federation hopes to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a premiere on the African continent in 2010, or continue with its implementation in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities who were part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) attests to the economic and political interests at stake in a World Cup.
Behind-the-scenes transactions, therefore, may last until the last minute.
Moreover, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) candidates have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not carry much weight for the 22 members of the executive committee when it comes to voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have thus ruined the opportunities of his country, the cradle of football, which only hosted the World Cup once, in 1966.
The BBC added fuel to the bonfire on Monday by airing a documentary that has exposed three influential EC members, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to upset FIFA and embarrass the English officials, who have thrown themselves into intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron at the helm.
The Head of Government hopes to re-edit the coup successfully carried out by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had managed in 2005 for London the organization of the Olympic Games.
Will this intense activity be enough to bring England back to the EC?
It is not clear, since the Spain-Portugal duo also has numerous strengths thanks to its stadiums, ready, its experience (World 82 in Spain, JJ.OO in Barcelona in 1992, European Cup in 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, the bleak economic and financial prospects of both countries could bring down their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal all they manage to do is give points to Russia, which has become a major outsider despite the gaps in its candidacy (stadiums, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to move to Zurich and has denounced an "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a direct allusion to the accusations of the English press against the members of the EC.
“They are bringing out their dirty rags, trying to compromise them,” Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, which has the experience of 1994, looks like the most logical favorites.
As the world’s leading economic power and home to FIFA’s main sponsors, the country appears to be ahead of Japan and South Korea, which have separately developed an excellent project.
However, these new candidacies seem premature for two countries that have jointly organized the championship in 2002.
Another risk: the awarding of the 2026 World Cup to China, fervently desired by FIFA, which would cause Asia to run out of possibilities by 2022.
Together with Qatar, which has presented its project based on futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion towards new horizons, but both countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be hurt by the weakness of TV rights paid (depending on the time difference) by European countries, the backbone of the war for FIFA.
Second mandate: the test
De Gaulle had really hesitated.
Mitterrand had implied that he doubted.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had not the slightest doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less.
One command in the Elisha leads to another.
Therefore, the current head of state will be a candidate again in 2012.
However, the evidence does not match well with the mystery usually associated with the presidential function.
Therefore, we must always appear to doubt.
To one side and to the other.
In 2006, even if they did not believe it, Jacques Chirac’s friends claimed that he did not rule out a third term.
In a serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy said he would make his decision “sometime in the autumn of 2011.”
Therefore, the fact that he deals with the UMP deputies on Tuesday night in the Eliseo, the possibility of "two terms" has caused some stir.
Is this the official announcement of your candidacy?
Not at all.
The president only indicated that the 2008 constitutional reform limited the number of five-year terms to two.
It simply conveyed the facts, not an announcement.
It is not the first time he has spoken about the presidential elections, with a humorous tone, in meetings of this type.
"At worst, or better yet, you'll still spend seven and a half years with me," he had released in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010: "Don't think that I don't ask myself what will come next."
His statements from the day before yesterday do not bring him closer to the candidacy, nor less.
They elicit comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for candidacy in the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Ségolène Royal has come to the fore that leads Nicolas Sarkozy to open up.
On the contrary, the fact that his candidacy in 2012 is evident is what leads many people in the PS to demand that the battle be organized ahead of schedule.
On the other hand, the bad polls.
For the first time, right-wing voters prefer the candidacy of Francois Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
“We have a candidate and in the UMP there is no discussion on the issue,” the Prime Minister’s environment has reacted immediately and prudently.
"If he thinks he can lose, he won't be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
“He will always think he can win,” corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the evidence.
Euro: ECB is forced to keep its acquisitions of State Letters
The last meeting of the European Central Bank’s (ECB) Board of Governors of the year should make it possible to specify the modalities for exiting the crisis or, at least, announce the interruption of a large number of unconventional monetary policy operations that should end by the end of the year.
Because of the European sovereign debt crisis, the Frankfurt Institute will certainly not be able to afford to be so peremptory if it does not want to risk aggravating a more than complicated situation in European bond markets today.
The political cost would be just as high.
Yesterday, during a press conference, the French Minister of Finance, Christine Lagarde, supported the active role played by the ECB in favor of the solution of the debt crisis of the European states.
He declined to say whether he felt the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its bond-buying program.
"I reserve my opinion for my European colleagues."...
The day before, in Brussels, during his hearing before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the president of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, was not more eloquent in terms of his intentions, indicating only that the program of buying State Letters in the secondary market “continued” and that “we will see what we decide” during the meeting on Thursday.
The only thing that is clear is that the ECB will keep its main rate unchanged at 1%, the lowest level in its history since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB’s purchase of Treasury bonds has doubled last week to about 1.35 billion euros.
In addition, according to the indiscreet operators of the market, yesterday would have bought again Irish and Portuguese securities.
In total, the Eurosystem’s central banks have acquired securities worth 67 billion euros since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt at all that purchases will follow (see page 29).
Nor do economists foresee any significant course changes.
Although lending operations over three months have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, the ECB still makes unlimited liquidity allocations at beneficial terms and with durations ranging from one week to three months.
Economists expect this device to be extended for a few months today.
"I can't imagine you're going to significantly modify your program."
“If not, it would risk sparking new tensions in the short term,” said Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
"It seems more likely that there will be a progressive exit announced during the first quarter of 2011," predicts Norbert Brams, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In relation to government bond market interventions, "the ECB should maintain a purchase volume of such bonds in order to keep the market stable," adds Norbert Brams.
Given the importance of European banks’ exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institute has no choice but to maintain its market presence.
"It must compensate at any price for the lack of investors in the market and act in a way that prevents a marked rise in the returns paid by the most fragile states," said a senior bond manager yesterday.
Because, if interest rates go through the roof, states will have even more trouble reducing their debt, or even stabilizing it.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government weathers the storm
After Italy has started the week in an unsettling way, the situation improved slightly yesterday with the ebb in 10-year bond rates.
A recovery of precarious calm.
Upon leaving a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents have stated that they heard Giulio Tremonti call the situation “undecipherable” and that a weekend “unpredictable” was expected, statements later denied by the interested party.
If anything, on Tuesday the difference with German long-term rates had reached a record 210 basis points and the price of bankruptcy risk hedging (CRQ) contracts had skyrocketed to 263 points, causing a stir in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that, in Spain, the difference with the German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, said he was "deeply concerned" about "market turbulence" and possible contagion from Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the third largest economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that it’s like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In reality, its problem is the lack of growth and the stagnation of income associated with it, which causes the State to run the risk of not being able to meet its financing needs.
The latest forecasts from Brussels have meant a jug of cold water for the government.
Italian growth is estimated to reach 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, while the budget being examined in the Senate is based on figures of 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will represent 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% predicted by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumor that new budgetary provisions can be applied after the holidays, for an amount of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, further austerity measures will have to be taken," said Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
At the moment, Italy has the support of international institutions.
“The foundations of its economy are in order and its accounts are in good condition, as we have been saying for a long time,” says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy at the IMF.
“There is no immediate problem, either in the short or long term, because despite its considerable debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested from Italy are less than those required from other countries,” says Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist at the OECD.
There is the problem of political instability.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, after which elections could be anticipated by the end of March.
In such a case, a period of inadequacy would open up for decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening mechanisms to fight the crisis
Christine Lagarde said at a press conference in Paris: “I think we have already shown on Sunday, night and day, that Europeans are clearly in solidarity, determined, committed to defending their currency and their currency zone.”
Although it was relative, the relaxation yesterday in the rates of the obligations of the European States has driven the governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot yet speak of a principle of normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's announced that it could lower Portugal's debt rating, the most frequent target of speculation today.
“As in May, there is a real lack of political clarity and transparency, which weighs heavily on banking systems,” say economists at Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially since “the political pace is much slower than the pace of markets.”
Aware of this hiatus and the dangers it hides, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen the existing mechanisms for resolving the crisis.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers who are most directly affected and, in general, with their G20 counterparts are on the right track.
And this also taking into account the meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the agenda, the type of unconventional measures to support euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), its chief executive, Klaus Regling, started a tour of Asia on Tuesday in Singapore to inform investors in the Far East about developments in the crisis in Europe.
Although the goal of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the ground.
The first issuances of EFSF securities are expected to take place next month.
Yesterday, a U.S. official told Reuters that the United States would support a potential increase in funds mobilized through an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
As for the frontline countries, Portugal and Spain are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in relation to the organization of the labour market.
These reforms add to austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to advance along a different path than Greece and Ireland followed.
Both want to avoid asking for international help at all costs before implementing their own budget corrections and deciding on the structural reforms they consider essential to build confidence in a lasting way.
Finally, the capitalist partners of the European funds are considering the options available to accelerate the process of normalization of public bond markets.
Passing through Paris, on November 24, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that, if the 750 billion euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to take out the portfolio again.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a front-line player in the European public debt market, believe that an amount of around 100 billion additional euros would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of direct injection of liquidity.
There is the instrument for this: the European financial stabilisation mechanism, currently worth 60 billion euros.
A tip that, without a doubt, could examine in detail the European capitals.
Especially if market conditions worsen.
Snow and ice: 24 apartments on orange alert
Snowfall continues to cause traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary network in Brittany, and can affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are currently on orange alert due to the risk of snowfall and ice formation.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have joined the twenty departments that were already on orange alert, eighteen from Wednesday at noon and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group in the evening.
According to Météo France, heavy snowfalls affect the north of Gironde and Charentes, although it also snows slightly on the Ile-de-France.
Snow layers of between 2 and 5 cm, punctually between 7 and 10 cm, are expected in the affected departments, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Paris region.
The departments affected are Charente, Charente-Maritime, C?tes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions of Lower Normandy, ?le-de-France and Limousin.
Snowfall is strong enough to cause circulation difficulties and affect some economic activities, warns Météo France.
Heavy vehicles over 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axles, have been banned from several departmental roads.
According to the gendarmes, circulation in the secondary network of Brittany is complicated, so they recommend that you do not drive except in case of need and the circulation of certain TER vehicles has been prohibited during the day.
On Thursday, school transport was banned in Picardy.
No specific measures were planned on Wednesday evening to limit the movement of heavy vehicles.
The prefecture "urges all drivers to drive with the utmost prudence on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) on Thursday asked airlines to cancel 25 percent of their flights at Paris' Roissy airport and 10 percent in Orly due to expected snowfall.
The DGAC advises air passengers to contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, in Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Grand Paris Metro: First Financial Drafts
Ever since the debate over modernizing transport in the Ile-de-France has reached its peak, it has rained billions.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we are talking about the $23 billion for the Grand Paris metro to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To start this GSP, the State has announced an allocation of funds of 4 billion euros.
Theoretically, this amount will allow the GSP to obtain loans in the markets to finance part of its double loop.
Today, finally, we have the first accounts.
The amending finance law of 2010, reviewed in the finance commission of the National Assembly this morning, contains the arrangements provided for finding the first part of that money.
There are two modes: the creation of an excise tax on equipment and the increase of the tax on offices in the Ile-de-France.
The first, as we read in article 15 of the text of the bill, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
In addition, it is fixed in numbers: "The product of this tax is 117 million euros a year."
The second is a modification of an office tax that already exists "to modernize it, increase its product and allocate said increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would you get with this method?
Who knows.
No figures are given in the text.
But it's far from $4 billion.
"It is specified that the fiscal resources are added to the 4 billion euros of the allocation of funds that will be mobilized by the State and that will be granted to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses," we can read in the explanatory statement.
The SGP is not surprised by this system.
“From the time revenue is created (the two taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the $4 billion later, as we explained.”
“It will be recorded in the budget and used on an as-needed basis.”
The GSP estimates that it will start receiving the $4 billion in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This arrangement, in which the $4 billion pledged is not on the credit, may spark a slightly heated parliamentary debate.
The first public session will be on December 7.
Hackers Avengers and Diligent Spies
The WikiLeaks affair has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals an apparent scandal, a scandal that only seems scandalous in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between States, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes on an international scale and foresees a future dominated by regression.
But let's go step by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is confirmation of the fact that every file created by a secret service (regardless of the nation to which it belongs) is made up exclusively of press clippings.
The “extraordinary” American revelations about Berlusconi’s sexual mores only reflect what has been written for months in any newspaper (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and Gaddafi’s sinisterly ridiculed profile has long given cabaret artists ideas to create their sketches.
The rule that secret files should only be made up of news in the public domain is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not just in this century.
If you visit a bookstore devoted to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chéteau, the Templars or the Rosicrucians) exactly what had been written in the previous works.
This is not only because the authors of occult texts do not want to do unpublished research (or do not know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who dedicate themselves to the occult not only trust what they already know, what reconfirms what they had already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown’s success.
The same applies to secret files.
The informer is lazy, just as he is lazy (or has little desire) the head of the secret services (if he could not be, I do know, editor of the Libération), who only considers true what he can recognize.
The top-secret information about Berlusconi that the U.S. embassy in Rome sent to the State Department was the same as that published by Newsweek the week before.
So why have the revelations in these files caused such a stir?
On the one hand, they only say what every cultivated person already knows, that is, that embassies, at least since World War II and since Heads of States can call each other or take the plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some limited representation exercises, have been transformed into spy centers.
Any viewer who watches investigative films knows this perfectly well, we just pretend we don’t know it out of hypocrisy.
In any case, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad image of American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can consult the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world greatly affects the prestige of the State Department.
Therefore, the scandal affects both the victims and the "executors".
But let’s get into the true nature of what has happened.
In former times, in Orwell’s time, one could conceive of all power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell’s prophecy has come true since, being able to control every movement thanks to the telephone, every transaction made, hotel visited, highway taken, the citizen thus became a complete victim of the eye of power.
But when it is shown, as it is now, that not even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the relationship of control ceases to be one-way and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, chosen as the citizen’s avenger) can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power endure that can no longer even keep its own secrets?
It is true, as Georg Simmel said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that all knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is in fact an empty secret, without secret, since it comes from the public sphere; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks has done, that Hillary Clinton’s secrets were empty secrets means to take away all power.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but it has done a lot to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound caused to such a powerful power?
It is clear that, in the future, States will no longer be able to post any classified information online, since it would be like posting it on a poster in the street.
But it’s also clear that with today’s technologies, you can’t expect to have confidential conversations over the phone.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a Head of State has flown in and contacted one of the counterparts.
How will they be able to maintain private and confidential relationships in the future?
I know perfectly well that, for the moment, my foresight is a matter of science fiction and, therefore, novelistic, but I imagine government agents who travel discreetly in errands with uncontrollable itineraries, carrying messages that have been learned by heart or, at most, hiding some data written on the heels of their shoes.
That information is then preserved, in a single copy, in locked drawers: in the end, the Watergate spying attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that technology currently advances like a crab, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet has re-created a wired (telephone) telegraph.
Videotapes (analog) had allowed film researchers to study a film step by step, moving forward and backward, uncovering all the secrets of montage, while now CDs (digital) only allow to move forward or backward from chapter to chapter, that is, to enormous proportions.
With high-speed trains, we can get from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, with the travel it entails, we need three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is nothing out of the ordinary for politics and communication techniques to take us back to horse-drawn carriages.
One last comment.
In the past, the press tried to understand what was secretly being plotted in embassies.
At present, it is the embassies that request confidential information from the press.
Climate: France’s botches in its funding pledges
One year after the Copenhagen Accord, it is time to examine whether the rapidly unlocked funding pledges (called fast start or early) made by developed countries have been respected.
And the French botches have been unveiled.
In the Copenhagen Accord, developed countries committed to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union pledged 7.2 billion euros over three years and France 1.26 billion euros (i.e. 420 million a year).
During the opening of COP16, the EU has put its best cards on the table to convince its partners that its commitment to fast start financing is true: a report detailing the measures of its member states, a press conference, a large complementary event, the distribution of brochures...
The transparency operation was appreciable and appreciated for what it really was: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same and with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released EUR 2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on track to meet its commitment of EUR 7.2 billion in 2012.
But, if we study the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Accord, the money must be “new and additional” to ensure that a complementary effort is made, without harming official development assistance.
Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached on what "new and additional" means.
When the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
For example, the European Commission has taken as a reference the year 2009: international financing is maintained and 150 million are added in three years as fast start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks in terms of the year or level of official development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers the financing of "all new projects" for 2010 to be "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to expenditures in previous years or to the total level of official development assistance.
In particular, the total amount of France's aid to developing countries may remain stable (or even decline), while it seeks to respect its commitment to "new and additional" funds...
Another crucial element, the distribution between donations and loans.
Again, there is no standard and everyone chooses the method of calculation.
Some, such as France, consider each euro borrowed to be equivalent to a donated euro.
Evidently, such a thing is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans may be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to the reduction of emissions that are based on more effective technologies), it is fallacious to present a euro that is going to be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is donated ... At most, only the cost of the loan should be computed for its commitments for the country that grants the loan (that is, the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France does not find such reasoning useful: it “respects” its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros); consult the EU document to see it for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union that uses the loan so frequently.
Germany uses it by 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia, among others, respect their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union contributes one euro to meet its commitment, France only contributes ten cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
A good trick!
In short, in its fast start financing, France performs a double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to actions over time and, on the other, in relation to the real financial effort.
Spending only 36.1 million euros, he manages to give the impression that he spends 420 million "new and additional", as he had promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it is Bercy who has dealt with arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to donate when they can simply lend?) and in negotiations, since developing countries are not fools...
The chapter on early financing is a relatively short-term minutiae of the climate negotiations as a whole.
But it could be an extra grain of sand in the immense machinery that is the UNFCCC.
Let's hope it doesn't.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
First, France could announce a change in its calculation method for the years 2011 and 2012, with the intention of respecting its commitments and in the same way as the other countries of the European Union.
But, especially, France could move the debates on the stakes in relation to long-term financing forward (another essential chapter that is currently being debated): we will not get rid of the question of the "additional character" or the method for computing loans.
France could change its stance to become as progressive on this issue as it is on others.
We therefore have the hope of the new Minister of the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancún next week.
A surprise announcement about France’s fast start and its vision of “additional character” and the use of loans would help to improve the level of international confidence needed to move the negotiations forward.
Warning about pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old boy ingests 81 different chemicals on one day, according to a study published Wednesday by the association Générations Futures (the ancient movement for rights and respect for future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "do not have significant statistical value taking into account the limited number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem treated", acquired in supermarkets in Oise and Paris between July and September the foods that a child of about ten years old usually consumes in four meals and a snack a day.
These model meals, which comply with official recommendations (five parts fresh fruits and vegetables, three parts dairy products and 1.5 liters of water a day), as well as treats, were examined in laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminants.
The balance of the dish is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five substances classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances likely to act as endocrine disruptors (EPs), according to studies by various institutions such as the International Cancer Research Center.
“Although, in virtually all cases, the legal limits for individual chemicals are not exceeded, our study clearly shows that consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic contaminants and/or PE is of concern,” the association said.
For breakfast, butter and tea with milk alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three considered as safe carcinogens, as well as about twenty residues that can harm the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, intended as a snack for school, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to Kenyan green beans, included in food, where the study has detected traces of a potent insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, Russian steak, canned tuna, and even loaf of bread or gum were seasoned with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the tap water, analyses found the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon slice was the most “nutritive” with 34 chemical residues detected and even the analysis of the plastic dish used to heat the food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The ultimate risk these “contaminant cocktails” generate for the consumer “is likely to be underestimated,” the study says.
The Europe Ecology-Les Verts Alliance (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "against the gravity of the situation" to apply a moratorium on the use of pesticides to curb "the increase in diseases associated with civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) indicated the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in the fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
