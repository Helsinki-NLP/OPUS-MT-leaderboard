Members of the Welsh assembly concerned about "identifying them as Muppets"
Several members of the assembly have expressed their dismay at the proposed amendment of its title by MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Welsh parliament).
This controversy has grown out of the plan to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Assembly members of all the different political parties have expressed concern that this measure may become a cause for ridicule.
A member of the Labour party assembly has stated that his party was concerned about the fact that MWP "rims with Twp or Pwp".
For non-Welsh readers: In Welsh, twp means stupid and, pwp, excrement.
A member of the party assembly Plaid Cymru has commented that the whole of his party "does not see it with good eyes" and has proposed several alternatives.
For his part, a Welsh conservative member has claimed that his group was "open" to the change of name, but also commented that there is a too small difference between the term "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, it should be said that the letter "w" in Welsh is pronounced similarly to the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
According to the assembly committee responsible for drafting the legal draft to introduce the name changes: "The final decision on any qualification to appoint the Assembly Members will of course fall on the members themselves."
The 2017 Law of the Government of Wales grants the Assembly of Wales all power to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, with broad support for the proposal to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Regarding the title of the members of the assembly, although the committee opted for "Members of the Welsh parliament" or "WPM", the option of "MWP" is the one that received the widest support in the public consultation.
Apparently, assembly members are suggesting different alternatives. However, the attempt to reach a consensus can be quite a headache for the Assembly President, Elin Jones, who is expected to present the legal draft on the changes in a matter of weeks.
Legislation on reforms will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of its members and the design of the committee system.
The members of the assembly shall hold the final vote on their denomination during the debate related to the legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change their country's name
Citizens will choose Sunday whether or not they want to change the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was decided in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which already has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a way to reclaim its territory and has repeatedly opposed attempts by that country to become part of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opposed to the plebiscite on the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, those in favour, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, are of the opinion that the name change is simply the price to be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Bells Stop Ringing: The Difficulties of Harlem Churches
"Historically, the elderly people I have spoken to say that there was a bar and a church on each corner," says Mr Adams.
"Today, there's none of them left."
According to Adams, the disappearance of bars can be understood.
“People have another way of socializing today,” he says.
"Bars have already ceased to be that kind of living room for the neighborhood where people went periodically."
As for the churches, he worries that the money they get from the sale of assets will not last as long as their leaders foresee "and that sooner or later they will return to the place where they left."
The churches, he adds, could end up being replaced by apartment buildings and condominiums with the kind of people who won’t be of any help to the temples remaining in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white," he says, "and so what they will do is accelerate the closure of all churches, as it is entirely unlikely that most people who move into these condominiums will end up being members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis; the Metropolitan Community church in 1870 and St. Martin's ten years later.
The white Methodist congregation that was there originally left during the 1930s.
A black congregation nearby acquired ownership of the building.
St. Martin's passed into the hands of a black congregation led by the Reverend John Howard Johnson, which led a boycott of retail merchants on 125th Street, one of Harlem's main shopping streets, who resisted hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire caused serious damage to the building, and when Reverend Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it, it was then that they commissioned the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor to St. Martin's Church, described the carillon as "the bells of poor people" all proudly.
The expert who blew the carillon in July described it differently: "A cultural treasure" and an "irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be touched by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had to move to the largest carillon in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has sounded in St. Martin's over the past few months, on the contrary, have been the complicated stories of architects and contractors, some of them brought by lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The council, the parish's governing body of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese last July expressing concern that the diocese "intended to pass on the costs" to the council, although the latter was not involved in hiring the architects and contractors the diocese sent.
Some parishioners have complained of the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old boy while searching for locusts in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy Saturday while on a dive to look for lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, according to authorities.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego, he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy's screams for help. Then they rowed with a group to the spot where the boy was to help him out of the water.
Hammel says he first thought it was about the joy of having caught a lobster, but then realized he was screaming 'I've been bitten!
I've been bitten!'
He had the whole collarbone torn," Hammel observed as he reached the boy.
"Because everyone got out of the water, I shouted, 'There's a shark in the water!'" adds Hammel.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in serious condition.
It is not known what species of shark is responsible for the attack.
In a press conference, lifeguard Larry Giles commented that it had been a few weeks that a shark had been detected in the area, but that it was decided that that species was not dangerous.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper torso area.
Authorities closed access to the beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours due to the investigation and for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of shark in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans for the UK beauty products market
Sainsbury's has decided to compete in Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty products aisles in the style of large warehouses occupied with specialized employees.
These large corridors are only part of a considerable investment in the beauty products market in the UK, a market that moves some GBP 2.8 billion and continues to grow while the fashion and household products sectors are left behind, and will be tested at 11 stores across the country to expand to more stores next year if tested.
The investment in beauty products is the product of the avidity of supermarkets to take advantage of the space on their shelves that was previously intended for televisions, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury’s says it will double its beauty offering to offer up to 3000 different products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space with branded areas similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket company is also in the relaunch phase of its Boutique makeup product range so that most products are now vegan-friendly, an aspect increasingly demanded by younger consumers.
Retail chain The Fragrance Shop will also open concessions at two Sainsbury's stores. The first opened last week in Croydon, south London, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and switching to a habit of buying food in smaller quantities every day at small supermarkets has caused large supermarkets to have to find other ways to convince people to come.
According to Mike Coupe, Sainsbury's executive director, stores will increasingly resemble large warehouses in an attempt by the supermarket chain to fight off discount supermarkets Aldi and Lidl with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has been introducing Argos outlets to many of its supermarkets, in addition to a number of Habitat stores since it acquired both chains two years ago, which, he says, has served to boost grocery sales and increase the profitability of acquisitions.
The supermarket chain's previous attempt to relaunch its beauty and pharmacy products departments resulted in failure.
Sainsbury's did a joint operation test with Boots in the early 2000s, but it all ended up hastily disagreeing on how to divide the profits from the chain of pharmacies inside supermarkets.
This new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sale three years ago of its business of 281 pharmacies in Celesio, owner of the LloydsPharmacy chain, for 125 million GBP.
According to Sainsbury's, Lloyds will play an important role in the global plan, as it will expand the range of luxury brands of skin products, such as La Roche-Posay or Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Chief Commercial Officer, comments: “We have transformed the look of our beauty product corridors to improve the environment for our customers.
We have invested in specifically trained workers who will be of great help when offering advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit any need; on the other hand, the attractive environment and practical location make us now one of the preferred destinations for beauty products and challenge the traditional way of shopping."
Peter Jones "furious" after Holly Willoughby backs off on an 11 million GBP deal
Dragons' Den star Peter Jones left "furious" after television presenter Holly Willoughby took back an 11 million GBP deal with Jones' lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time to devote to the joint business of household products and Truly accessories.
The business of these two media personalities had come to be compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning used Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' star Den Peter Jones enraged to retire in the last minute of the lucrative lifestyle brand joint business to focus on his new own contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which will bring him also great benefits.
According to several sources, Jones was "furious" when the blonde TV star admitted, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at the headquarters of his empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the new agreements of the presenter, worth 1.5 million GBP, meant that he would no longer have enough time to devote to the joint branding of household products and accessories Truly.
The business had come to be compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and aspired to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million GBP.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones took a private plane to one of his holiday homes outside the UK.
According to one source: "Truly was by far Holly's top priority.
It was meant to be her long-term future and where we would see her for the next twenty or thirty years.
His decision to stand back left all parties involved speechless.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, we were so close to launch...
Right now there is a warehouse full of goods at the Marlow headquarters ready to be sold."
According to the experts, the departure of the presenter of This Morning, one of the most profitable stars in the United Kingdom, could cost the company millions due to the significant investment that had been made in products, from cushions and candles to clothing and clothing for the home, and the possibility of delays for its launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin had been in an intimate relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly along with Capp in 2016, and the 52-year-old Jones joined as president last March.
Both couples spend the holidays together. In addition, Jones owns 40% stakes in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will be M&S's next brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity program.
A source close to Jones commented last night that "We will not be making any comments about his business."
And then we fell in love."
He joked about possible criticism he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider "little of a president's own" and for having such a positive opinion of the North Korean leader.
Why did Trump give up so much?
Trump claimed, all while mocking a news anchor's tone of voice:
"I haven't given up on anything."
He noted that Kim had an interest in holding a second meeting after the first one held in Singapore in June was declared a major step toward North Korea's denuclearization.
Negotiations for denuclearization are stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, senior North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho commented Saturday to United Nations General Assembly leaders that North Korea does not see a "corresponding response" by the US to the first disarmament initiatives made by its country.
However, he observed, the US continues to apply sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump’s view, on the other hand, was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We are doing very well with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to declare war on North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
And now we have this great relationship.”
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results: ending missile tests, helping to free hostages and returning home from the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about relations with Kim.
"It's very easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get into this crowded room, we'd have about 200," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
An Island Destroyed and Hundreds Killed by Tsunami and Earthquake in Indonesia
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organizations in other countries were told they were not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10% of Lombok's population had to be displaced, no kind of national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for being able to catalyse international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not seek international assistance, so the situation is quite demanding," says Ms. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it is not safe even if foreigners can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, commented that Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether or not international agencies are allowed to contribute in offering aid.
Given the constant earthquakes that Indonesia suffers, the country remains woefully unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although shelters have been built in case of tsunami in Aceh, they are not frequent on other coasts.
The apparent lack of warning sirens in Palu in the event of a tsunami, although there was a warning in force, is very likely to have contributed to the number of deaths.
Moving between Indonesia’s huge number of islands is, at best, quite a challenge.
And natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship docked at Lombok to attend to earthquake victims is now heading for Palu; however, it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo had as a central element of his election campaign the improvement of Indonesia's crumbling infrastructure, and has invested huge amounts of money in roads and railways.
However, Joko’s government is facing next year’s re-election loaded with funding shortfalls.
Joko also faces pressure from the country's ongoing sectarian tensions, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a faith of a more conservative nature.
More than 1,000 dead and tens of thousands displaced are the result of fighting taking place in the streets between Christian and Muslim gangs with machetes, bows and arrows, and other bloodthirsty weapons.
Notice: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge makes the goal of the tie with a far kick against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with his goal scored in the 89th minute Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 metres from Chelsea's goal as his team was losing 1 to 0.
He accommodated the ball to the left before letting go of an incredible shot aimed at the second pole.
The shot crossed the entire area with a large lift as it propelled towards the right cross of the goal.
The ball finally started the descent over a Kepa Arrizabalaga in the middle of the jump to try to stop it and ended at the bottom of the net.
"I was just trying to get to that position to be able to shoot, and players like Shaqiri always play it forward as much as possible, so I tried to create as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that Kanté was coming, I did a touch and I didn't think about it much, I just dedicated myself to kicking."
Chelsea won 1-0 on the break after scoring a goal in the 25th minute via their Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In the play, the Blue team forward heeled back a pass to Mateo Kovacic before starting from almost midfield and sprinting towards Liverpool's field.
Kovacic made a quick combination from midfield.
He then made a magnificent in-depth pass, which left Hazard inside the area with the ball controlled.
Hazard overcame the defense to finish at the second pole with a left leg shot where Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker could not reach.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage next Wednesday at 15:00 at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea, meanwhile, will play with Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to 832
The number of deaths as a result of the earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832, according to data from the country's disaster agency reported on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings due to the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that took place on Friday and caused waves of up to 6 meters, according to Sutopo Purwo Nugroho agency spokesman at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was completely covered by the rubble of the destroyed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on murder suspect after finding woman stabbed
The murder investigation has been initiated after the woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with several stab wounds in Grayson Mews, John Street; then a 32-year-old man was arrested as a murder suspect.
Police have asked residents of the area to have seen or felt something in connection with the crime to come before the authorities.
According to Inspector Brian O'Hagan: "While the investigation is still at a preliminary stage, I would like to appeal to everyone who stood near John Street in Birkenhead and who would have seen or heard anything suspicious, please contact us.
I would also like to make a call to anyone, especially taxi drivers who have been able to catch anything via the car's onboard camera, to get in touch, as they might have vital information for the investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman have arrived at the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
As investigations continue, police have commented that they are reporting the facts to relatives closest to the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get back to his flat, but police have told him that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
When he knew what had happened, he was speechless.
Residents are being advised that it will be hours until they can re-enter.
He could feel a police officer explaining to a man that the entire area is treated as the crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene crying.
She keeps repeating "It's terrible!"
At 14:00, two police vans were inside the area cordoned off with another van parked outside.
A number of agents remained within the cordoned off area controlling the apartment block.
Anyone who may have information is asked to send a message directly to the company, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 and file 247 on September 30.
Cromwell's statue of the British parliament becomes the last monument affected by the discussion around "rewriting history"
His disappearance would be a kind of poetic justice for the destruction in the purest Taliban style of so many cultural and religious objects in England perpetrated by his fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society has described Crick's proposal as a "crazy" and an "attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, comments: "In the current debate around the withdrawal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's figure in front of the Palace of Westminster would become one of the main targets.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps he would end up sacrificing the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor he did during the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is proof of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe to be worthy of commemoration.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than now, as an advocate of parliament in the face of external pressure, in his case obviously of monarchy.
Whether or not this fact constitutes a fully accurate representation remains a matter of historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognisable figure who represents a side of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of being celebrated and commemorated."
Killer Pig Kills Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, local sources report.
The man, identified solely by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a cut artery and all covered in blood near a pig court at Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer was preparing to inject vaccines into pigs at a courthouse in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
As far as is known, he had traveled Wednesday with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door leading to an adjoining pig court.
He said there was a large male pig with blood in its mouth.
Forensic examination confirmed that the 250 kg piggy had been fatally injured by the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin had torn legs and full of blood," said the cousin, surnamed "Wu," as mentioned in the Guiyang evening news.
Scenes recorded by the security camera show Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his cousin.
One market official commented on the evening news that the pig remained closed and isolated in order to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police gathered evidence at the crime scene.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating a compensation for his death.
Although very rare, there have previously been cases of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm, and left the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing almost 300 kg took a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife was able to scare the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC news that pigs are usually not aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as "triggering."
"They like to play.
They are like children, they are very curious ... they do not go with the idea of hurting.
You just have to give them the respect they deserve,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rains throughout the southwestern United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the coldest waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
El Rosa had winds of 138 km/h, typical of a Category 1 hurricane, at 5:00 a.m. on Sunday morning, U.S. Eastern Time, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression is forming in the Pacific Ocean, which is moving eastward toward the west coast of the U.S. When Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to leave strong tropical moisture northward toward the south.
El Rosa will leave up to 250 mm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Next, tropical moisture will interact with the approaching depression to generate widespread torrential rains throughout the Southwest over the next few days.
At various points, the 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous floods, waste flows and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates near 50 to 75 mm per hour at various points, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
They expect 50 to 100 mm of rain in parts of the southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
There is a possibility that they form floods, since the situation is getting worse very quickly due to the scattered nature of the tropical rains.
It is strongly discouraged to enter the desert on foot in the face of the threat of tropical rain.
Torrential rains could cause the gorges to become runaway rivers. In addition, storms can bring wind streaks and dust clouds at particular points.
The approaching depression will bring torrential rains at certain points along the coast of southern California.
It is possible to register total rainfall above 50 mm, which could lead to minor waste flows and slippery roads.
This is the first rainfall of the rainy season in the region.
Isolated tropical rain showers will begin to arrive in Arizona between Sunday night and Monday morning, before the rain becomes more widespread between Monday night and Tuesday.
Torrential rains will spread into the Four Corners region on Tuesday and will persist throughout Wednesday.
There will be several major temperature swings across the U.S. in October as the Arctic cools, though the tropics will remain quite warm.
This phenomenon can sometimes cause drastic changes in temperature in a short distance.
The central U.S. on Sunday is a clear example of dramatic temperature differences.
Temperature differences of nearly 20 degrees have been recorded between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the persistent summer heat will try to expand again.
The month of October is expected to begin with heat in much of the central and eastern U.S., with temperatures around 27 degrees from the Southern Plains area to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would represent about 10 degrees above the average.
According to the long-term weather forecast, there are many chances that temperatures above average will be recorded in the eastern U.S. during the first half of October.
More than 20 million viewers saw Brett Kavanaugh's statement
More than 20 million viewers saw on Thursday the passionate testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, which allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford. The testimony was broadcast on six different television networks.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular Friday programming due to a last-minute turn of events: an agreement designed by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct an investigation of the charges for a week.
Ford explained to the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely convinced Kavanaugh touched her drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an exalted testimony, claimed that he was absolutely convinced that this never happened.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million viewers are likely to have seen this testimony on Friday.
The company counted average viewers from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC chains.
Audience figures were not immediately available by other chains that relayed the testimony, such as PBS, C-SPAN or Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen often has trouble calculating the people who see it from her office.
Put in perspective, it is a similar audience to that of an American football playoff game or that of the Oscars ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders have clearly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was the most-watched network, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the entire day's testimony, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS raised 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen data.
The interest remains high after the testimony.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying they would vote for Kavanaugh, Flake was caught by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as he was rebuked by protesters when he tried to climb into an elevator to go to a court hearing.
Flake remained several minutes with his eyes down while being taken live on television on CNN.
"Here I am, in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth in the country?
They said, 'You have power, while there are so many women who don't have it!'"
Flake said his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator doors closed, commented that he will have more to say in view of the committee.
Within hours, all cable and broadcast networks were already broadcasting live the moment when the Committee on Judicial Affairs had to vote on whether or not to proceed with the appointment of Kavanaugh to the full Senate to put it to a vote.
Flake said, instead, that he would only understand that the FBI would investigate allegations against the nominee for next week, a condition demanded by the Democratic minority.
Flake was convinced in part by the conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a subsequent conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
The option chosen by Flake had influence, as it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to support Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" in relation to Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticized her plans to leave the European Union of "play politics" with the UK's future and of disregarding the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview in addition to the one with May on the front page of the newspaper, May’s former foreign minister Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on Chequers’ so-called Brexit plan, where he states that the proposal that the UK and EU mutually collect taxes is “absolutely absurd”.
Wayde Sims shooting murder: Police stop suspect Dyteon Simpson for death of LSU team player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who was a member of the LSU team.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and sent to prison on charges of second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge police department.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson. According to police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and claim they have found Simpson's DNA in them, CBS affiliate WAFB reports.
After questioning Simpson, he admitted to killing Wayde by gunshot, according to police.
His bail has been set at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
The East Baton Rouge District Coroner's Office released a preliminary report on Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head in the direction of the neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police fugitive operative group, the state police crime lab, Southern University police, and the citizens of the area for help in the investigation that has culminated in this arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva expressed his gratitude to the area's law enforcement for their "diligence and for pursuing justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
He averaged 1.98 m, played as a winger and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player on the LSU team.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds to start last season.
On Friday morning, LSU team basketball coach Will Wade commented that the team is "destroyed" and that Wayde's death was "once very strong".
"Things like this are what make you suffer at all times," Wade said.
An ash spit volcano in Mexico City
Ash spewed by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital.
The national disaster prevention center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity was detected in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded over a 24-hour period.
The center was overseeing several recent tremors and tremors.
Images on social networks show a thin layer of ash on the windshields of cars in Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in activity of the volcano located 72 km southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has remained active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists shortly before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona last Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police and thousands of people joined counter-demonstrations to remember the first anniversary of the vote that took place in Catalonia over its secession.
A group of pro-independence individuals held by riot police began throwing eggs and powder paint at them, causing dark clouds of dust to appear in the streets usually invaded by tourists.
Later the same day, riots occurred with the police, who used their batons in order to contain the violent protesters.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted "Don't forget, don't forgive" face-to-face with unionist protesters shouting "Long live Spain."
Fourteen people had to be treated for light injuries suffered during the protests, according to local sources.
Tensions have not diminished in this region of independence mentality a year after October 1 a referendum was held considered illegal by Madrid but also carried out by the Catalan separatists.
Voters chose independence by a large majority, although the turnout rate was low, given that opponents of secession mostly boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting by entering polling stations across the region, leading to violent clashes.
The pro-independence groups camped out all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration of support for the national police.
The demonstration took place equally, but the protesters were forced to take another route.
Narciso Terme, a 68-year-old electrician and one of the participants in the independence demonstration along with his wife, said he no longer had much hope about the possibilities for Catalonia to achieve independence.
“Last year we had one of the best times.
I watched my parents cry with joy about being able to vote, but now we’re stuck.”
Despite achieving a vital victory, although by little margin, in the autonomous elections last December, the Catalan independence parties have suffered to maintain the push this year, given that many of their main leaders are in self-imposed exile or arrested waiting to be judged for their role in the organization of the independence referendum and the subsequent declaration.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, records the demonstration of support for the police with his phone, and claims that the conflict has been stoked by politicians on both sides.
“The tension is only increasing,” he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders jailed before trial since the end of last year, announced he would take part in the European Parliament elections next year.
“To stand as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the setback in democratic values and the repression we have seen on the part of the Spanish government,” he says.
Londonderry: Men Detained After Investigating a House with a Car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car repeatedly ransacked a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 19:30 local time.
Inspector Bob Blemmings says damage was caused to the gates and to the building itself.
It is also possible that, at some point, someone has shot a crossbow at the car.
A move by Menga gives Livingston victory 1 to 0 against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston was a victory.
Livingston, who had risen this year, surprised Glasgow Rangers in what is just Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as Ibrox neighbourhood club coach.
Dolly Menga's play made a difference, as, with this win, Gary Holt's team climb to second place, which they share with Hibernian.
Gerrard's, on the other hand, are still not winning away from home in the Premiership this season. Next Sunday they will face the leader, the Hearts, with whom they are separated by a difference of eight points.
But before that, the Rangers receive this Thursday the Rapid from Vienna in the Europa League.
Livingston, meanwhile, extend to six games their unbeaten streak in the league, with a Holt as coach who still doesn't know what the loss is since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston does not take advantage of its opportunities in the face of the direct play of visitors
Holt's team should have gone ahead of the score long before the goal, given that their direct play caused all sorts of problems to Rangers.
Scott Robinson made his way between the defense, but squandered his chance when he found himself in front of the goal. Then Alan Lithgow sent the ball out by stretching to try to finish off the pass of Craig Halkett's head, who crossed the goal.
Locals were already good at letting Rangers get close to their area, as they knew they could put visitors in trouble on isolated plays.
And that’s how that decisive goal came about.
The referee whistled a foul against Rangers interests and Livingston made an opening towards the band, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined so that Menga could play it first and finish from the central part of the area.
Up until that point, Rangers had dominated possession, but found themselves with an impenetrable defense and a goalkeeper Liam Kelly who had very little work throughout the game,
The scenario was repeated in the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a stop of merit.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor stopped with his feet on an occasion by Scott Pittman and Lithgow ended up deflecting another Livingston combination play.
Rangers set out to hang one shot and one ball in the Livingston area, only to be rejected. In addition, two penalties were claimed, one for an alleged Halkett entry to substitute Glenn Middleton, and another for hands. Both were dismissed.
Livingston "phenomenal": analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and great result for Livingston.
One man thinks they were excellent, and they continue to exceed all expectations in this ascending trajectory.
His style of play and staff have hardly changed since his return to the top category, although much of the merit has to be attributed to Holt for the way he has galvanized the team since his arrival.
There was a good bunch of heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, leading a perfectly organized defense, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall had to be pending of Menga throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked inspiration, however.
Despite the brilliant moments exhibited with Gerrard as coach, they definitely have not been able to maintain the level.
They did not know how to create occasions (only once they clearly overcame the local defense), and that the Rangers, which is in the middle of the table, should be taken as a warning.
Receipt of Erdogan's aggression in Cologne
All were smiles and clear skies on Saturday (29 September) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the first day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aimed to mend relations between the two NATO allies.
These had deteriorated due to issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then moved to Cologne to inaugurate a new giant mosque.
Turkey has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police alleged security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from congregating in front of the mosque, although a large number of followers gathered around it to see its president.
Hundreds of protesters opposed to Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also made themselves heard as they condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Both demonstrations reflect the division of opinions around the visitor, considered a hero by some German Turks and titled dictator by others.
Deptford Traffic Accident: A Cyclist Dies When He Hits A Car
A cyclist has been killed as a result of a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a heavily trafficked area of Deptford, southeast of the city, at around 10:15 local time.
The driver of the vehicle stopped and, although paramedic services attended the cyclist, he died on the spot.
The accident occurs months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run case on Childers Street, 1.6 km from the crash site on Saturday.
Metropolitan police have said their agents are working to identify the man and report the facts to the closest relatives.
The street has been cut and deviations have been applied for bus routes. In addition, drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin jail: six officers injured in altercation
Six prison officers have been injured in an altercation at this high-security men's penitentiary, according to the center's office.
The events occurred in Long Lartin Prison, Worcestershire, around 09:30 on Sunday, local time, and it still endures.
Specialized "tornado" agents moved to the scene to end the altercation, in which eight prisoners have been involved. The avalanche has been able to be contained on the one hand.
The officers had to be treated for light injuries to the face at the scene.
According to a spokesman for the prison service: "We have deployed specially trained prison personnel to try to solve an incident that occurred in Long Martin prison, which still persists.
Six employees had to be treated with injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons. We are clear that those responsible for this altercation will have to be held accountable by the police and may have to spend even more time in the garjola."
More than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous offenders, are held in Long Lartin Prison.
In June, it was learned that the head of the prison had to be treated in a hospital after being attacked by a detainee.
In addition, in October last year, the anti-ballot agents made an act of presence in the prison to solve a serious altercation in which staff of the center was attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with major floods (dry areas could benefit)
It is unusual for a tropical depression to affect Arizona, but this is precisely what is likely to happen early next week when what is left of Hurricane Rosa passes through the southwest desert, with the consequent risk of flooding.
The national weather service has already issued alerts for floods for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to arrive directly in Phoenix on Tuesday and is expected to approach Monday night with rain.
The Phoenix national weather service commented in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within a 322 km radius of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) remained 64 km from the Arizona border."
The most recent models of the national hurricane center forecast 50 to 100 mm of rain, with isolated spots where up to 150 mm would be recorded in Arizona's Mogollon.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the central Rockies and the Great Basin, could record 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated spots up to 100 mm.
For areas that are off-risk for floods, the rain of the Rosa could become very good news, since the region suffers a strong drought.
Although the floods are a serious cause for concern, some of the rainfall could prove very beneficial, as the southwest region is currently suffering from a drought.
According to the U.S. drought control service, more than 40% of the state of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, weather.com reports.
But first, Hurricane Rosa will make landfall on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
El Rosa continued to have hurricane strength Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 137 km/h, and is now 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, which causes it to lose strength.
Therefore, it is expected to touch land in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or evening of Monday.
Precipitation in different parts of Mexico could be strong, with a considerable risk of flooding.
According to weather.com, "total 75 to 150 mm of rain is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with the possibility that they reach up to 250 mm."
After that, the Rosa will head north across Mexico with tropical storm force, before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning with tropical depression force, to finally cross the state of Arizona and reach southern Utah well into Tuesday night.
"The main risk we expect from Rosa or what's left of it is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the desert of the southwestern U.S.," according to the national hurricane center.
Rains are expected to cause dangerous flooding and waste flows into deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found with injuries in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 on Saturday, local time.
He was transferred to the hospital, where he is "stable".
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested the next day in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset police.
The agents have made a call for anyone who may have any kind of recording of the facts with the mobile phone to get in touch.
Trump says Kavanaugh has "suffered the meanness and anger" of the Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the rejection vote for the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said in an election speech in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has "suffered the meanness and anger" of the Democratic party throughout its appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress Thursday, bluntly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation of sexually abusing her decades ago, when both were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing in connection with his allegation.
The president said Saturday that, that day, "the American people saw the genius, the human quality and the bravery" of Kavanaugh.
"The vote to ratify Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to ratify one of the most brilliant minds in the legal world of our time, a jurist with an admirable track record of serving the citizenry," he told the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's appointment while talking about the importance of the Republican voter turnout index in the midterm elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I didn't run, but I actually did," he said.
"That's why I'm everywhere fighting for our great candidates."
Trump argued that Democrats are engaged in "resisting and obstructing."
The first key procedural vote to be held in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place no later than Friday, an assistant to Republican party leaders told CNN.
Hundreds killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, where death toll continues to rise
At least 384 people have died, and many have been swept away by the giant waves that hit the beaches, due to a serious earthquake and tsunami that has affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday for a festival held on the beach in the city of Palu when waves of up to six meters hit the coast towards dusk, dragging many of the people to death and shattering everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arrived yesterday, people were still carrying out their activities on the beach and did not run right away. That is why they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the BNPB disaster mitigation agency in a statement in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it destroyed everything that was on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved through the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before impacting the coast.
There are people who climbed atop a tree fleeing the tsunami and were able to survive, he says.
Some 16,700 people had to be evacuated to 24 different centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster mitigation agency show the number of shops and buildings destroyed, bridges turned and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
Replicas continued to shake this coastal city Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
Indonesia's technology assessment and application agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's intense earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to the agency, the geographic features of the city, located at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have exponentially increased the magnitude of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "considerable" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims, he says, were found trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 lost.
According to Nugroho, the dead and damage could increase on the coast about 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were totally paralyzed and therefore no kind of information came" from Donggala, Nugroho states.
More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its workers and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
“It’s a tragedy, which unfortunately could end up much worse,” he says.
The agency was heavily criticized Saturday for not reporting the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although agents said the waves arrived during the time the warning was issued.
In a recording of an amateur shared on social media, it can feel like a man located on the top floor of a building gives desperate shouts of warning to the people on the street about the approaching tsunami.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water bursts by the sea, taking away buildings and vehicles.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused a widespread power outage that has disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Despite the fact that the army has begun sending humanitarian aid in cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, the evacuees are still in desperate need of food, in addition to other basic needs.
The city's airport has been reopened only for relief work and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia’s tsunami death toll stands at over 800.
The situation is very serious.
Although World Vision workers in Donggala were able to reach Palu city safely, where employees are sheltered in canvas shelters installed in their office yard, during the journey they had to witness scenes of total destruction, says Doseba.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It is a catastrophe.
Although the aid groups made the bleak gesture of starting the relief work, some people complained that humanitarian workers were being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, collection of funds, provisions and staffing from abroad can only begin to flow if the site where a catastrophe has occurred is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“Once the government says, ‘Well, it’s a national disaster,’ we can start asking for international assistance, but that level hasn’t been declared yet.”
While he was on the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami that took place on Friday, friends and relatives of the missing people held out hope that the miracle would occur and their loved ones would evade the bleak account of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a child trapped in a sewer was rescued.
On Sunday, rescue teams released a woman who had been buried under the rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding national team, had coached two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which concluded earlier this month in Indonesia.
In addition to Mr. Mandagi, among the people trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, were his students.
“As a senior in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon explained that, in the hours after news of the Roa Roa hotel collapse circulated among the paragliding community, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Palu competitors who were participating in the beach festival.
However, messages appeared with a gray check mark instead of a blue double mark.
"I think that means the messages were not received," he added.
Thieves take $26,750 during filling of an ATM in Newport on the Levee
Last Friday morning, burglars stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker who was filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release issued by the Newport police department.
Officer Dennis McCarthy indicated in the statement that the driver of the vehicle was emptying the ATM at the entertainment complex and was preparing it to distribute more money.
While doing his job, another man “came running up behind Brink’s employee” and stole a bag of money intended for distribution.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
On Saturday, as he announced the change on Twitter, he wrote: "The being formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, was nicknamed Ye, and used the alias as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, in which he is expected to present his new album, titled Yandhi.
The rapper replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her participation for "emotional reasons," according to the show's author.
Apart from being an abbreviation of his current artistic name, West had previously commented that the word has religious meaning to him.
“I think that’s the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you,” West said earlier this year, while discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
“So it’s you, it’s us.
I've gone from Kanye, which means the only, to just Ye, which is a reflection of our good part, our bad part, our confused part, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
West is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known by various names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, a former collaborator of West, has used his nickname with or without script and in capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use military force against civilians
The president-elect of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has promised never to use military force against civilians, when the country will soon turn the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that "military force would never be used again to repress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the army opened fire during a peaceful demonstration and caused the deaths of 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
López Obrador, who has pledged to support Mexican youth by granting monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities,
He has stated that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities make young people feel attracted to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its funding for AI
“While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount of money it spends on AI research,” says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several members of the U.S. government have announced measures on AI, despite the country's general lack of formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: its goal is to become the world’s No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that the rest of the countries are far behind the US and we want to be the pioneers of the next advances in the field of AI,” Lee said.
“Doubling funding could double the opportunities for the U.S. to achieve the next big discovery in AI,” Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book titled AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of the company Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China’s most prominent AI companies.
In 1980, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that surpassed the American Othello player with the best ranking and later served as an executive at Microsoft Research and as president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee positively assessed previous technological competitions of the U.S. Government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Robotics Challenge, and wondered when the next one would take place in order to identify the next visionaries.
“U.S. researchers often have to work hard to get public grants,” Lee said.
According to Lee, "It's not China that takes the academic leaders; it's the companies."
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university eminences to work in the AI field.
Lee commented that the US's work in the field of AI could also be driven by changes in immigration policy.
"I think permanent residency cards should be automatically offered to doctoral students in AI," he added.
In July 2017, the State Council of China presented its state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
"China's National Natural Science Foundation awards funds to individuals from academic institutions in the same way that the Natural Science Foundation and other U.S. public bodies give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is inferior in China," Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, designed to involve industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the Natural Science Foundation, it currently spends more than $100 million a year on AI research.
Meanwhile, no measures have been in place for months in relation to U.S. legislation that was intended to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians hold referendum to decide whether to change country's name
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people held a referendum on the name change to “Northern Republic of Macedonia”, a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia’s applications for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, contends that its northern neighbor's name constitutes a claim to its territory and has barred its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic-majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not take part in the referendum, and a boycott campaign casts doubt on whether the required minimum 50% turnout will be reached for the referendum to be valid.
The question indicated in the referendum ballot is: "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU, with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?".
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to achieve accession to Macedonia, one of the countries created following the breakup of Yugoslavia, to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, so that the young people of Macedonia can live in freedom within the European Union, because it means that all of us will have a safer life,” said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have stated that they will abide by the result of the vote to make it decisive.
To change the name, a two-thirds majority is required in Parliament.
The State Election Commission reported that no irregularities had occurred at 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% registered in the last parliamentary elections, held in 2016, in which 66% of registered people voted.
“I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted in the Macedonian referendum on the country's name change, which would open the way for him to join the European Union and NATO in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and placing chairs in front of tents set up by people who would boycott the referendum.
“We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to stick to it with our heads held high, not by the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and be part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says that joining NATO will be accompanied by more than necessary investments in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
“I think the vast majority will vote for it, because more than 80% of citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said before casting his ballot.
Zaev stated that a “yes” would mean the “confirmation of our future.”
In a poll published Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research, between 30% and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure below the minimum required turnout.
According to the results of another poll, conducted by Macedonian broadcaster Telma TV, 57% of those polled are scheduled to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote “yes.”
For the referendum to be valid, the turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would be the first hard blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it took over in May last year.
Watch the video: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero scores a goal after dribbled all of Brighton's defence
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling nullified Brighton's defence in Manchester City's 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium, Manchester (England) last Saturday.
Aguero scored a goal in the 65th minute on a play that seemed ridiculously simple.
The Argentine forward received a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the sequence.
He left for speed between Brighton's three defences, sweeping away what came his way across the pitch.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green T-shirts.
He dribbled a defence before overtaking a few more on board the Brighton area.
He then made a pass on his left that Sterling found.
The English forward returned the ball to the first touch, inside the area, to Aguero, who with his right leg beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan, with a shot that sneaked inside the net on the right side.
"Aguero has discomfort in his foot," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We decided I would play between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We’re lucky he scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the initial advantage to the Sky Blues in the fight for the Premier League.
His goal came in the 29th minute.
In that play, Aguero received Brighton's in-depth field ball and
made a lovely pass in space on the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane drove the ball before passing it to Sterling on the long pole.
The Sky Blues' lead capped the ball inside the net before going off down the back line.
City face Hoffenheim on Tuesday in a Champions League group stage match at 6:55 p.m. at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer, with no options, wants to eliminate the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the play-off fight, there was little reason to force another opening.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to get on the mound of the next pitcher Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, in case the Rockies, who hold an advantage game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West National League, have a chance to play the play-off.
The Rockies secured a wild card with a 5-to-2 win against the Nationals Friday night, but are still looking to get their first division title.
“While we don’t play anything, at least we can get out there knowing the atmosphere here in Denver, and knowing that the other team will probably play every point at the highest level, like no one has done this year.
Why would I want to lose this game?”
The Nationals have yet to announce an opening pitcher for Sunday, but apparently are determined to let Scherzer throw if this situation occurs.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th opening, made a warm-up session Thursday and pitched Sunday, on his usual rest day.
Washington's right-hander has an 18-7 record, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation around his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of Republican participation in the half-term elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
Five weeks to go until one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big, big ones.. I’m not running, but I’m actually running. That’s why I’m everywhere fighting for the fantastic candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You can see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, it’s happening right now.
They are determined to regain power by all means necessary, you see their meanness, their bad intention.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to go through to get power and control. That’s what they want: power and control. But we won’t give them to them.”
The mission of the Democrats, he said, is to “resist and obstruct.”
“And this can be seen in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry, mean, dirty and false.”
Trump mentioned Dianne Feinstein, the highest ranking Democratic senator on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which led to a strong public outcry.
Do you remember his answer?
Did you filter the document?
Hey, hey, what?
No, uh, no. Wait a minute... That was a very bad body language expression, the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party must cease to be a diverse party.
He is intolerant of those who say what they think.
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, I was not surprised.
After all, I am the latest in a series of British MPs who have been told that we are not welcome, all to say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she demonstrated with determination against anti-Semitism.
In my case, with the motion of censure I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Ironically, they are similar issues with respect to which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In the notice of the Nottingham Labour Party meeting on Friday it was communicated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the meetings of the General Committee held on Friday night have been exactly like that.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings, and the promise of “more generous and kind” policies has long since been forgotten, if it ever existed.
It is becoming increasingly clear that divergent opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as colleagues who previously thought he shared a similar political vision hoped that I would take a 180-degree turn and take positions I would never have taken, whether on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, say what I say, social media is filled with aggressive messages in which a call is made for my candidacy not to be renewed, centrist policies are denounced and I am told it should not be the Labour Party.
And that doesn’t happen to me alone.
In fact, I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, because the messages I get are usually political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who every day have to deal with a torrent of sexist and racist attacks, and they do not arransen.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is to see how the level of abuse has normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn stated last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that diverse party, and with every move of “no confidence” or every change in the rules of selection, the party becomes more narrow.
In the last two years I’ve received a lot of advice and I’ve been advised to keep my head down, not to be so expressive and “everything would be fine”.
But I didn't go into politics for that.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago, in my time as a student, spurred on by Thatcher’s negligent government, which left my entire class literally sunk, I have tried to advocate for better public services for those who need it most, whether as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I have never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way doubt my political positions and points of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who promoted the motion on Friday, I would say that at a time when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will hurt households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in reality, the message I want to convey is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of non-renewal of my candidacy or any political interest will prevent me from acting, in my opinion, in the interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: unbeaten Ayr lead
Two last-minute trials are distorting the final result, but there is no doubt that the Ayr deserved victory in this vibrant game of the day from the Tennant's Premiership.
The Ayr, who are the only unbeaten team of the ten, occupy the first position in the classification table.
In the end, the home team prevailed thanks to its defensive superiority and the fact that it knew how to take better advantage of the opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had reason to be satisfied.
“The games we’ve played so far have put us to the test and we’re still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, “Congratulations to the Ayr, they’ve taken advantage of it better than we have.”
Grant Anderson's 14th minute trial, converted by Frazier Climo, put the Ayrs ahead, but a yellow card for Scottish international Rory Hughes, loaned for the Warriors game, allowed the Melroses to take advantage of numerical superiority and Jason Baggot scored an unconverted trial.
Climo extended the Ayr's advantage with a sanction and, just in the middle, scored and converted an essay to put the score 17-5 in favor of the Ayr at rest.
But the Melroses started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's trial, converted by Baggot, reduced the differences to five points.
The match was then interrupted for a long time due to the serious injury suffered by Ruaridh Knott, who retired in berth, and in the hold the Ayr extended the distance again with an essay by Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
Next, alternate captain Blair Macpherson was reprimanded with a yellow card and, again, the Melroses took advantage of one more man's superiority with an unconverted essay by Bruce Colvine at the end of a few moments of heavy pressure.
However, the home team reacted and when Struan Hutchinson saw yellow card to make a tackle to Climo without a ball, from the sanction lineup, MacPherson scored a counter-test behind the Ayr's penetrating mole.
Climo scored, as he had scored again almost since the restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up a shot from David Armstrong and passed the ball to third line wing Gregor Henry to score the home team's fifth trial.
The star of the Still Game series seems to be about to start a new career in the catering sector
Ford Kieran, star of the Still Game series, appears to be about to move into the hospitality sector, after it has been discovered that he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the character Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and co-stars with Greg Hemphill, his long-time comic partner.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last in the series, and it seems Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, though a source in The Scottish Sun newspaper pointed out that Kiernan intended to enter Glasgow's "flourishing catering sector".
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, landless, hopes the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
Sailors patrol through the naval headquarters covered with elixirs in La Paz.
Public buildings wave a sea blue flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are packed with the slogan: “The sea is ours by right.
Getting it back is a duty."
Across Bolivia’s landlocked territory, the memory of a lost coastline off Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century remains vivid, as is the longing to sail back across the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the deepest in decades, as Bolivia awaits the ruling that the International Court of Justice will issue on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the drive, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, needless to say, it awaits the result with a positive stance,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the TIJ's resolution on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague Court will rule in favor of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate the granting of a sovereign outlet to the sea for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, who faces a contentious battle for re-election next year, also has many hopes in store for Monday’s resolution.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised last August.
However, some analysts think that the Court is unlikely to rule in Bolivia’s favor and that, if it did, things would not change much.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territory and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The TIJ’s resolution, which comes just six months after the final allegations were presented, indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean specialist in international law.
And far from being favored, Bolivia's cause may have experienced a setback in the last four years.
“The current Bolivian administration has hijacked the issue of access to the sea,” Zárate said.
“Morales’ belligerent rhetoric has undermined any gesture of goodwill on the part of Chile,” he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be very difficult to maintain conversations after this episode.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision-making was exceptionally quick.
Next Monday, Bolivia will have “an extraordinary opportunity to begin a new era of relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end 139 years of disagreements, with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of Latin America's most popular presidents, was using the maritime issue as a political cross.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
“Resolution is an opportunity to realize that we must overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will not eliminate nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke last Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
The minister urged the United States to keep promises made during a summit held in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
His remarks come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears poised to resume stalled nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a pipe dream to think that continued sanctions and U.S. objection to a declaration ending the Korean War may ever cause North Korea to kneel.
Washington is wary of accepting the declaration if Pyongyang does not first make major disarmament moves.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up an arsenal that the country considers the only means to ensure its security.
Pompeo is scheduled to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest range of oversized hats, on the way to a main street near you
If you want to increase the size of your hat collection or want to completely protect yourself from the sun, you don’t need to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the catwalk a range of extravagant hats of disproportionate dimensions from their SS19 collection, which dazzled the style defined at Paris Fashion Week.
This summer Instagram has been ravaged by very impractical hats, and this designer has brought his amazing creations to the catwalk.
Valentino's highlight was an exaggerated beige hat, adorned with a broad, feather-shaped wing, which flooded the head of the models.
Among other oversized accessories, there were jeweled sinkers, a sorcerer's hat and even a pineapple, but these are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of quirky masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the vividly colored masks had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation resembled a complete scuba gear, with tube and glasses, while another looked like a cone of melted ice cream.
And if you follow the big trends of fashion, you’re in luck.
Style observers predict that huge hats could implant in the main streets near you.
Large hats trample the heels of “the Bomb,” a two-foot wide-brimmed straw hat that everyone has worn, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the hat so impractical that it spread on social media brought another great creation to the catwalk: a straw bag for the beach, almost as big as the swimsuit-clad model who wore it.
The dark orange raffia bag, adorned with raffia saddles and finished with a white leather handle, was the highlight of Jacquemus's La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famed stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see people wearing large hats and beach bags on the main streets next summer. Given that the designer has had a big impact, it would be a shame to ignore the demand for large accessories.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a track record of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another series of excellent exam results, which is reinforced with individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to offer top-notch service to pupils and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher studies, for the career they choose and for their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a personalized school curriculum, we observe that modern languages remain a very popular and desired matter of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you will reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart.”
This is a very important reminder that we can not depend only on English if we want to establish relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of this year’s exams, we can see that languages lead the ranking tables with the highest qualifications in independent schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages earned the top A grade.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools reflected that 72% of students earned a higher A rating in Mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students also earned an A.
This shows that Scotland's independent schools support foreign languages as vital competences that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, languages, as a subject of choice, are held in the same consideration as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) to curricula from independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK's Employment and Skills Commission revealed that of the reasons employers gave to the fact that they struggled to fill vacancies, 17% was attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly indispensable to prepare young people for their future careers.
As there are more and more potential job opportunities that require languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career that a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future with a permanent competition like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a 2013 survey conducted by YouGov among more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and French, with 15% of speakers, was the only language with a double-digit percentage.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is important for today’s children.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developed economies, will give children better opportunities to find important work.
In Scotland there is diversity among schools in terms of the languages they teach.
Some schools focus more on more traditional modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be more important for the UK going forward, by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, you can always choose from a range of languages in independent schools, which have specialist teaching staff in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of what the future holds.
In the global business environment of the current era, it cannot be denied that languages continue to be of vital importance for the country's future, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered "international communicative competences".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
I wish he would do well.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron to make Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday
The wait is practically over for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Sunday's first preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But you still have to determine the minutes you will play.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48," Walton told the Lakers' official site.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play a few minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to be ready,” he said.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump begins a wave of campaign events tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five scheduled Trump rallies for next week, which include visits to sympathetic sites, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote for his candidate to fill the Supreme Court vacancy is on hold, Trump intends to get support for the upcoming half-term elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump’s rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump's rally in West Virginia can be viewed online at the link specified below, via live video streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address the hearing started this week with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which was strained due to sexual abuse allegations he faces, while the Senate's planned confirmation vote remains on hold for up to a week and the FBI investigates the case.
But the main goal of this wave of rallies is to help Republicans running in the delicate November elections gain momentum.
President Trump’s five campaign rallies scheduled for next week are therefore aimed at “stimulating volunteers and supporters, as Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
“Control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as he can, as we head into a busy campaign season,” a Trump spokesman said.
Tonight's rally, scheduled at Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling, could congregate supporters "from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract Pittsburgh media coverage," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the West Virginia Senate, who is getting unfavorable results in polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come and give him a boost in polls,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team shows ambition to keep hopes alive ahead of Sunday individual matches
After three uneven sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes were probably what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of dynamics is an invented sporting concept, in which players really believe, especially in competitions like this.
So which side is the positive dynamic now?
“They had a six-point advantage and now it’s four, so I think we’re in a little bit of a positive,” Jordan Spieth said as he left at the end of the day.
Obviously, Europe has an advantage, four points ahead, with twelve more at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel the wind blowing a little in their favor and have plenty of reasons to be encouraged, largely because of Spieth's and Justin Thomas' state of form, who played together all day and both have three points out of four.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and is setting an example.
The guttural shouts of celebration went up in intensity as he continued his lap and he put a crucial putt to tie the fourth game, when he and Thomas had been two down after two holes.
He celebrated the putt that made them win the match at hole 15 with a similar cry, of the sort indicating that he believes the American team is not yet out of the competition.
“You have to do your best and worry about your own game,” Spieth said.
That's all that's left for these players now.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed sensation of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple wear four out of four and make no mistakes.
"Moliwood" were the only couple who didn't do a bogey Saturday afternoon, and also avoided bogeys Saturday morning and Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes Friday morning.
For this result and the way in which their energy seems to flow to and from the bullish public, it is reaffirmed that they are the players to bat on Sunday, and there is no player more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari to close a possible European victory as the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, speaking of European glory seemed premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly broke up with Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of the morning, who paired up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes sank the Spanish and Swedish into a hole from which they never had a chance to get out.
On Sunday, however, there is no one to help you out of the hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are very fascinating to see for the interactions between pairings, the advice they give and those they don’t give, and the way a strategy can change all at once.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and will face the last day with an important advantage, but this foursome session has shown that the US team has the motivation to fight that some, especially in the United States, had questioned.
Europe reach the final of the Ryder Cup with a favorable score of 10-6
Europe will face the final day of the Ryder Cup with a comfortable advantage after finishing fourballs and foursomes on Saturday with a 10 to 6 win over the United States.
The inspired duo formed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made a great effort to get two wins against a Tiger Woods in difficulty and leave his record, so far, in four points at Le Golf National.
The European team, captained by Thomas Bjorn, who aspired to retain the trophy he lost two years ago to Hazeltine, dominated an unsuccessful American team to the fourballs of the morning and put the series at 3-1.
The US presented more resistance to the foursomes and won two matches, but could not reduce the differences.
Jim Furyk's team needed to score eight points in the 12 individual Sunday games to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European starter to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair to win four points in their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After slamming Woods and Patrick Reed into the fourballs, they qualified for a brilliant performance to beat a deflated Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau for an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who had trailed in two games Saturday, showed sporadic sparks of genius, but has lost 19 of 29 games in fourball and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the fourballs of the morning, re-teamed with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and fell 2 to 1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, ranked first and third in the world, respectively.
However, Europe didn’t have it all on a nice, windy day in southwest Paris.
Jordan Spieth, a three-time tournament champion, and Justin Thomas set a benchmark Saturday for the Americans by getting two points.
They won a 2 to 1 determination win against Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and later won again Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 to 3 at the foursomes, having lost the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history had a team made a four-point difference to individual matches, although the title defender Furyk's team only needs to draw to keep him.
However, after being the second best for two days, it seems that a coming Sunday counterattack is out of reach.
North Korea says it won't disarm unilaterally "in any way" if no signs of trust are seen
The North Korean foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were intensifying his distrust of the United States and that, under such circumstances, the country would not unilaterally eliminate its nuclear weapons in any way.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important goodwill measures" during the previous year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test center and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not observe any response in U.S. consonance," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in these circumstances, we will not unilaterally initiate disarmament in any way."
While Ri resumed North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” denuclearization approach that North Korea would be rewarded for as it gradually took action, his statements seemed significant because he did not reject unilateral denuclearization outright, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump’s joint statement at the first summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim pledged to work on the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump pledged guarantees for North Korea’s security.
North Korea has tried to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has communicated that Pyongyang must first eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted the call to relax the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
“The U.S. insists that denuclearization must first occur and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal coercively, in addition to opposing the ‘end-of-war declaration,’” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions will make us kneel is a pipe dream of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that continued sanctions are intensifying our mistrust.”
Ri did not refer to plans to hold a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added, "If the party involved in the issue of denuclearization were South Korea rather than the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this stagnant situation."
Still, the tone of Ri’s speech was very different from what he maintained last year, when he declared at the UN General Assembly that targeting U.S. territory with North Korean missiles was inevitable after President “Mr. Evil” Trump branded Kim of “Rocket Man” on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but stated that much remains to be done and sanctions must be maintained until North Korea denuclearizes.
Last Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for this and that "it doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “the implementation of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without exception until we confirm full and final denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously pushed sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to cut off funding for Pyongyang's ballistic and nuclear missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri outside the U.N. General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go very well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, but within hours North Korea accused him of making "gangster's own demands".
In a meeting with Moon earlier this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile center and nuclear complex if the United States took "measures in consonance".
He said Kim had told him that the “measures in line” he was seeking were the security measures Trump had promised in Singapore, in addition to actions toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a rest room course
This year, a new course at Harvard University has allowed its students to sleep longer, in an attempt to combat the ever-widening culture of studying throughout the night, stimulated by caffeine.
An academic noted that students at the world's number one university are often clueless as to the basics on how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course after making a talk about the impact sleep deprivation had on learning.
“At the end of the talk, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why are you saying this to me now, all of this, in my last year?’
He said no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
In the course, first implemented this year, students are explained the basic concepts about how good sleep habits improve academic and sports performance, in addition to general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University's health services, claimed that the University decided to introduce the course after learning that some students suffered severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a bedroom, where students have to click on coffee cups, curtains, showers and books to receive information about the effects of caffeine and light, about how sports performance affects sleeplessness, and about the importance of maintaining a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
Next, a map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily route.
“We know that student behavior will not change immediately.
But we think they have the right to know, as one has the right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes,” said Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in staying up all night still exists, he said, and added that modern technology and the increasing pressure students suffer make sleep deprivation an ever-growing problem.
Making sure to enjoy good quality sleep for long enough should be a “secret weapon” of students to combat stress, tiredness and anxiety, he added, even to avoid gaining weight, as sleep deprivation puts the brain into starvation mode and makes students always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies Chemistry and Physical Biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, having attended one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
Raymond commented that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote the course throughout the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask graduate students to pursue a similar program of study before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to be aware of the fact that they set an alarm when they go to sleep and when they wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can alter the harmony of the circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal ends with Gerrard's men
Dolly Menga's goal condemns Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston's home which is another upset away.
Ibrox's side sought to add their first home win since last February's 4-1 win at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted the second defeat to Gerrard in 18 games as coach to leave their team adrift, 8 points behind the Hearts, unstoppable leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored the goal seven minutes before the half, and it never seemed that Rangers, lacking inspiration, were about to even the score.
While Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston rise to third place, behind Hibernian by goal difference.
And the Rangers could face more difficulties later, as line judge Calum Spence needed medical attention for a head injury caused by an object that apparently was thrown from the bleacher.
Gerrard made eight changes to the lineup that swept the Ayrs to the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same eleven starter who kicked a point against the Hearts last week. He surely felt satisfied with the way his well-organized team suffocated their rivals at all times.
While the Rangers dominated possession, Livingston created more danger when they had the ball.
In fact, they should have scored within two minutes of the game, when Menga's first intervention left Scot Pittman alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder sucked off and missed the big occasion.
A blunt foul throw from Keaghan Jacobs ran into Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only took a deflected shot at the rear pole.
The Rangers took over, but seemed to have more hope than faith in their game in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos really believed he should have had a penalty at the fifteen minute mark, as he and Steven Lawless stumbled, but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers only ran two kicks in the first half, but Ibrox's first goalie, Liam Kelly, had no problem with Lassana Coulibaly's header and docile forward Ovie Ejaria.
While the Livi's first act in the 34th minute could have been against the race, no one can deny that they deserved it just for their effort.
Again, the Rangers couldn't cope with Jacobs' hard-fought play.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm to choose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted on the break by switching Coulibaly to Ryan Kent. The change had an almost immediate impact, as the end made a pass to Morelos, although the imposing Kelly ran into the block.
However, the Livingstons continued to capture visitors' attention by playing exactly as they like, with Lithgow and Halkett doing long passes, one after the other.
Holt's band may have given up direction in the final stages, but McGregor remained firm to reject Jacobs before Lithgow made a detour from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton still asked for a final penalty for a dispute with Jacobs, but again Thomson made his eyes wide open.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from the "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and counting... the day on which the physicist of the future, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually resulted in the device we know as the "Geiger computer".
The Geiger counter, which has been a pillar of science ever since, also became a pile of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, a seemingly unsuccessful cowboy physicist:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of the atoms emanating from the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "Sure it's bursting now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to ‘See’ Malicious Cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” and eliminate malignant cells
Vaccine Teaches Immune System to Recognize Malignant Cells as Part of Treatment
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
You can "see" a protein common to many cancers and then reinject them.
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with various types of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw ovarian cancer disappear that she suffered for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein present in many types of cancer (HER2), and then re-injecting them.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland (USA): "The results we have obtained suggest that we have a promising vaccine."
The HER2 protein "favors the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofsky said.
A similar approach consisting of extracting immune cells from patients and "teaching" these cells how to treat cancer cells has worked in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West engaged in a pro-Trump tirade wearing a MAGA cap after his performance on the SNL program.
It didn't end well
Kanye West was written into the studio during Saturday Night Live after a chaotic performance in which he congratulated US President Donald Trump and said he would run in the 2020 election.
After his third song of the night, titled Ghost Town, in which he wore a Make America Great Again cap, he began criticizing Democrats and reiterating his support for Trump.
"I always talk to white people and they say, 'How can you like Trump if he's racist?'
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago," he said.
The SNL program began with a parody of Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee for allegations of sexual assault filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not aired, comedian Chris Rock uploaded the recording of West's disapproval to social media.
It was unclear whether Rock intended to ridicule West with the publication.
However, West has complained to the public that he was not well treated behind the scenes because of the cap he wore.
"I was threatened behind the scenes.
They told me not to go out with that cap on.
They harassed me.
And then they say I'm in a lower position," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the bottom position?" while saying he would put on Superman's cape so they couldn't tell him what to do. "Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love.”
His comments prompted calls from the public at least twice and members of the show's team seemed embarrassed, according to Variety, which had a reporter who explained to the publication, "The whole study was completely muted."
West was brought in as a last-minute substitute for Ariana Grande, whose ex, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West perplexed much of the audience with the performance of the song I Love it, disguised as a bottle of Perrier.
West obtained the support of the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU TO HIGHLIGHT BETWEEN THE MULTITUDE."
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "being who he is and that he is absolutely wonderful."
But I have chosen not to reward someone (by buying their music or clothing or supporting their "art") who I believe adopts and spreads an ideology that harms my community.
He is free.
And so do we,” he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that the name had been changed and that it was now "the being formerly known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, was formerly called Snoop Lion and the missing music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and, later, the artist formerly known as Prince.
Murder charge in attempted stabbing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after the stabbing of a man Friday in east Belfast.
According to police, the incident has taken place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear in front of the Belfast trial court on Monday.
The prosecutor will review the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington denounces toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for playing the role of swordsman Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor has denounced the male hero stereotype, stating that these roles hint that young boys often believe they have to be strong to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times' Culture magazine, Kit said that he believed "something had gone wrong" and that he was questioning how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the age of ?MeToo.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, has admitted that she is determined to tackle this problem.
"Personally, now I wonder where we got it wrong in terms of masculinity," he says.
"What have we taught men during their development in relation to the problem we are experiencing now?"
According to Kit, television may bear some responsibility for the increase in toxic masculinity thanks to its manly characters.
He added: "What is innate and what is acquired?
What is taught on television and on the streets that makes young boys feel they must have this facet of virility?
I think that’s one of the big questions of our time: how do we change it?
“Something went wrong with the kids.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make any prequels or sequels to Game of Thrones when the series finale is scheduled for next summer, all saying that he is fed up with battles and horses.
Starting in November, Kit will star in a revival of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his partner Rose is the best that Game of Thrones has provided him.
"I met my wife on the show, so she gave me my future family and my life forward," she said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love of the character Kit plays, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health officials.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases are sexually transmitted, unlike in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some regions of China due to infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contract HIV from this cause has dropped almost to zero, according to statements by Chinese health agents at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination from the LGBT collective is common.
Taking into account the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men who have homosexual relationships will end up marrying a woman.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are due to the lack of adequate precautions for sexual intercourse.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee leaked data from Republican Party senators and disassembles "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on the pages of the lawmakers' Wikipedia.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed the lawsuits were driven by far-right critics and websites.
"Lies, lies and more despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
Allegedly, the published information contained the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday and was posted by someone unknown to the Capitol during a Senate committee session on allegations of sexual abuse against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The information leaked after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was related to Waters' office and that it revealed information from a Waters staff member, the Capitol reported.
"This unsubstantiated allegation is completely false and a pure lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, the identity, personal data and security of which have been compromised due to these false and fraudulent allegations, was not responsible in any way for this leak of information.
This unsubstantiated allegation is completely false and a pure invention."
Waters' statement quickly drew online criticism, including that of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is filled with outrage," Fleischer wrote.
"This makes you think you don't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven’t done, they shouldn’t get angry.
It doesn’t have to be challenging.
You don't have to question the accuser's motives.
You have to stay calm and calm.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to criticism from Judge Kavanaugh's Democrats, whom critics accused of looking too angry during the Thursday session.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to oust Waters in the midterm election, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Important if true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted the relevant authorities and security forces of these fraudulent statements.
"We will ensure that the offenders are revealed, and that they will be held legally responsible for all actions they have taken that have harmed each and every member of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again Review: Rowan Atkinson's Limited Spy Parody
It is already tradition to look for references to Brexit in any new film with a British focus, and this replenishment of the action-comedy parody franchise of Johnny English, who was born in 2003 with Johnny English and reappeared in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn, is not an exception.
This humorous self-satisfaction on how despicable we are will be a new export opportunity from the country?
In any case, the incompetent out-of-the-box and rubber-faced Johnny English has been able to renew his license for a second time to make it all happen. His name indicates more than anything else that he is a comic creation designed for non-English-speaking territories with a tradition of going to the movies.
Of course, it's the stupid secret agent who, despite his rare pretensions of liquefied glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a point of Mr. Bean and a touch of this guy who brings a single note to the theme of Chariots of Fire at the inaugural ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
Originally, it was based on the mysterious international traveler Atkinson who represented Barclaycard's now-forgotten television ads, where he was sowing chaos everywhere.
There are one or two good times on this last journey of JE.
I loved the Johnny English who was approaching a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the blades of the propeller were ringing him in the helmet.
He sees the gift Atkinson has for physical comedy, but the humor seems fairly fluid and strangely superfluous, especially because "serious" cinematic brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now already include comedy as an ingredient.
Humor seems destined for children rather than adults and, to me, Johnny English's absurd adventures are not as witty or focused as the mute gags of the Mr. Bean character Atkinson represents.
The repeatedly topical premise now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A computer hacker has infiltrated the British supersecret web spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents on the ground, causing the service agent dismay, a regrettably small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last resort for a prime minister who is a pretentious and besieged figure, who already suffers a total collapse of lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this charred character of Teresa-May, but the script does not reach further.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that, as each active spy is put at risk, she will have to recover some retired one.
And this includes the mischievous Johnny English, now employed as a teacher at some luxury institution, but teaching unofficial classes on how to become a covert agent, with some good gags, such as when English offers an espionage academy that looks like a rock school.
English is quickly returned to Whitehall for an emergency meeting with his sequestered sufferer Bough, a role he reprises as Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, tied to the commander of a submarine, an enthusiastic role, in which Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat wasted.
Thus, the Batman and Robin of when things get very ugly in Her Majesty's secret service come into action once more and find Olga Kurylenko the spectacular "femme fatale" Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously under the spell of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, represented by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous madness: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a fast food French restaurant, they sow chaos by smuggling aboard the luxury yacht of Volta and English causes a great deal of confusion when trying to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize themselves with the inside of Volta's house.
All the stops have certainly been taken from this last sequence, but with all the simplicity and noise it presents, it all seems like a children's program.
Pretty normal stuff.
As with Johnny English's other films, it has been of no help to think whether the film industry has given Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is devising a plan for the British to have a four-day working week and cover five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party will have to consider a radical plan under which the British will work four days a week and get paid five.
Supposedly, the party wants the heads of the companies to pass the savings obtained with the revolution of artificial intelligence (AI) to the workers giving them one more day of partying.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but would receive the same salary.
According to sources, the idea would fit with the party's economic agenda and plans to tilt the country in favor of workers.
The change to a four-day working week is supported by the Trades Union Congress confederation as a method for workers to profit from economic change.
An experienced Labour Party source stated in The Sunday Times: "A review of the policy is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It won’t be overnight, but a four-day workweek is an aspiration that fits the party’s perspective of balancing the economy in favor of the worker and the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not support this aspiration jointly at present.
According to a spokesman for the Labour Party: "A four-day working week is not party politics and the party is not considering it."
Shadow Minister John McDonnell used last week's party conference to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell expressed his determination to restore the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" to utilities.
The shadow minister's plans also imply that shareholders in water companies might not recover all the investment, as the Labour government could apply "deductions" for the crimes it perceives.
It has also confirmed plans to place workers on company boards and create inclusive ownership funds to deliver 10% of the shares of private sector firms to employees, who expect to pocket annual dividends worth up to GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy explains to "60 Minutes" if the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation could make them change their mind.
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote of his nomination for Supreme Court by at least a week, and has raised the question of whether the agency's findings could influence any Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be published Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring to light something that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“Speak seriously,” Kennedy said.
"At the session I said I had spoken with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when everything happened and the accusations were made public, and I asked him if he had done so.
He was firm, determined and confident.”
But Graham's vote looks like it's on fire.
"I have my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and would bring an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett flatly denied it," Graham added referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people who are appointed will be able to verify it.
He's 36.
I don’t see anything changing again.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Has it done anything to reduce poverty?
New York City will host the annual Global Citizen Festival on Saturday, featuring a program of absolutely stunning stars, who carry out an equally impressive mission: eradicating poverty around the world.
In this year’s seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people gather in the Great Lawn area of Central Park not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to awaken awareness of the event’s global goal of ending extreme poverty in the world by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who help actively fight it.
To receive a free ticket for the event (unless someone wants to pay for a VIP ticket), attendees had to do a number of tasks or "actions," such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other activity to raise awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
What successes has Global Citizen achieved now that it has 12 years left to reach its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a good way to persuade them to demand a call to action or just one more case of what we call "clichivism" (people who think it makes a difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million "shares" of its supporters, which have helped achieve several goals.
It states that these actions have helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies equal to more than USD 37 billion, which will have influenced the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements derived from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that so far the protected funds have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the major commitments include the foundation The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based investor-maker association, which pledges to “help children grow as much as possible” and promises to send $35 million to Rwanda to help fight malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens members, like you, we can turn the social injustice of undernourishment into a footnote in history," said The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also explained that after more than 5,000 actions calling for the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of their website’s P+F’s asking “what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”,
Global Citizen responded: "It will be a long and hard road. Sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the big civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.”
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York, which will feature Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a "block" to hinder Russian energy exports (Home Secretary)
Washington can, "if necessary" resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting markets, including those in the Middle East, US Home Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke has denounced Russia’s intervention in Syria, mainly where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government, as a pretext to explore new energy markets.
“I think the reason they are in the Middle East is their willingness to negotiate on energy, as they already do in Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this issue.
"The United States has the capacity, along with the Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, for blockade, to prevent their energy from entering the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing attendees at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that defines itself as the "energy consumer voice" in the US.
He compared Washington’s strategies for negotiating with Russia and Iran, and pointed out that they are indeed the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is more or less to take advantage and replace fuels," he said, while indicating that Russia has only one resource, since its economy depends on fossil fuels.
The statements come as the Trump administration has been on a mission to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the most economical option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to exit the "inadequate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump, made Berlin a "captive" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the US$11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fierce opposition to the project is simply due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I think we share the view that I'energy cannot be a tool to pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers, declared Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US Energy Department Secretary Rick Perry, held in Moscow in September.
The US stance has provoked a negative response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s main industry organisation, FDI (Federation of German Industries), has appealed to the US to back away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, director of BDI (Federation of German Industries) said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has said she will "think carefully" about her candidacy for the presidency in 2020.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren claimed Saturday that she would "think carefully" about her candidacy for the presidency after the midterm elections.
During a municipal meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and fix the fracture in government, for women to take over senior positions," she said.
"After November 6, I will take my candidacy for president seriously."
Warren weighed in on President Donald Trump during the town hall meeting and claimed he "was taking the country in the wrong direction."
"I am frankly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren has been outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet Friday, Warren said, "Clearly an FBI investigation is needed before the election."
However, a poll that was published Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters believed he should not run for 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts "likely" voters have said the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The poll revealed broader support for former Gov. Deval Patrick’s candidacy, with 38 percent in favor of a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile names among Democrats who were taken into account in connection with a possible 2020 candidacy include Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially reveal his decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes PTSD-affected Track Palin at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after enlisting on September 11, 2007
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“With what my own son is going through since he came back, I can understand other families suffering from PTSD ramifications and some of the emotional wounds our soldiers are returning with,” he told the audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said the following of his son and other war veterans: "They come back a little different, they come back tough, they come back wondering if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, as well as any other member of the army, have given to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, with a statement for domestic violence and possession of weapons under the effects of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and DC support challenge to new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence
Representatives from 18 states and the district filed a friend curiae Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker challenging the policy, according to NBC News.
The full name of the Grace vs. Sessions lawsuit that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and the violent gang member's children" assaulted her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers from states that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where large numbers of asylum seekers are generated in the U.S., as countries facing widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals, which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to seek asylum.
Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine declared Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation."
Federal laws require that asylum claims be adjudicated according to the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and this prohibition violates this principle, according to the amicus curiae.
The lawyers also argued in the report that the policy denying immigrants entry hurts the US economy, as they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide needed jobs."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gangs.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their country for persecution or fear on grounds of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in his June 11 announcement of the policy.
Asylum has never sought to alleviate all the problems, not even the most serious, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as human losses multiply in a sprint to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is becoming increasingly desperate.
"The atmosphere is very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she tranquilized her fever-stricken son at an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute, an ambulance carries bodies.
There is a lack of drinking water.”
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes to take flooded belongings and try to save what they can.
There are hundreds injured, and hospitals, battered by the 7.5-magnitude quake, are saturated.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who has fractured his shoulder, are found outside the Palu military hospital, as patients are treated outside due to repeated heavy shaking.
Tears denied his eyes as he explained how the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel where he was with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save us.
He was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had attended a wedding in the village.
“I heard my wife crying for help and then I didn’t hear her anymore.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they are okay.”
US ambassador accuses China of harassment with "propaganda ads".
A week after an official Chinese publication published a four-page advertisement in an American newspaper promoting the mutual advantages of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China has accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump addressed last Wednesday the China Daily payment supplement to The Des Moines Register, Iowa state's best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of getting involved in the November 6 U.S. Congressional election, an accusation China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to meddle in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials have told Reuters is a new phase of Washington’s campaign to step up pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to insert advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an intensifying trade war that has seen tariffs on mutual imports rise.
China’s vengeful tariffs at the start of the trade war were aimed at punishing state exporters, such as Iowa, who supported Trump’s Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an op-ed in The Des Moines Register of The Sunday, "is doubling down on harassment with the publication of propaganda ads in our free press."
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses America's beloved tradition of free speech and free press by inserting a paid ad in The Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the kiosk down here in Beijing, you will find few dissenting voices and see no real reflection of the differing opinions Chinese citizens may have about China's worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is dominated by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers dodged the offer to publish" his article, but did not say the name of the publication.
Republicans set aside women's voters ahead of midterm election with Kavanaugh disaster, analysts warn
As many of the top Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who faces several lawsuits for sexual assault, analysts have warned they will see a negative response, especially among women, to the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this case are extremely high and most Republicans already officially show that they want to take a step forward with a vote.
These things can't be undone," Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill for an article that was published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) last-minute pressures for an FBI investigation are enough to calm angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday, tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, Friday, according to the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
Friday morning, Protestants shouted "November is coming!" as they demonstrated in the Senate lobby while Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee decided to continue Kavanaugh's nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, according to the Mic.
"Democrats' enthusiasm and motivation will be left out of the chart," Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst at the news site, said.
"People say they've already been high; it's true.
But they could have been more so, especially among voters of younger suburban women and voters, ages 18 to 29, who often don’t vote while they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ford's public testimony, where he detailed his demands for sexual assault on the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that a negative response could occur if Republicans pressed for confirmation.
"This has become a bottleneck for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the board vote or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh sits on the defendants' bench. It's also about how Republicans have handled this issue and how they've treated it," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
However, Americans appear to be divided between those who believe in Ford's wake and Kavanaugh's witnesses, with the balance leaning slightly towards the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents unquestionably or likely believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent claim to believe unquestionably or likely Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh had likely lied or undoubted during his testimony, while 30 percent claimed the same of Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating lawsuits filed by Ford and at least one other whistleblower, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted him under the effects of alcohol when he was 17.

World Wide Web inventor plans to create new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that is based on the Berners-Lee Solid open source platform.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people can access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's hidden intention was "to dominate the world".
"We have to do it now," he said of the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid platform technology to allow users to create their own "personal online data store" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify. They're all available in one browser at a time.
What is unique about the personal online data store is that the user is the one who decides who can access certain information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."
Inrupt’s idea, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, is for the company to integrate adequate resources, processes and skills so that the Solid platform is available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some in-staff developers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said no one on his team is talking to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce radical change where all business models are completely emptied overnight.
"We're not asking for permission."
In a Saturday Medium post, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web integrated into the Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Clergy of the Victory Cross of the I GM
The only clergyman in the Church of England who won a Victoria Cross during World War I as a combatant has been honoured in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann obtained the award on 29 September 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was shot by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the most important British military honour.
His two grandchildren uncovered a memorial tombstone at a parade Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" that the tombstone would be presented exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning feat.
According to The London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion down the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a very thick fog and under intense fire from guns and machine guns."
He later ran towards the line of fire and, with the "greatest bravery" he advanced the line before throwing himself over a cannon with one hand and shockingly leaving three members of the detachment.
The lieutenant colonel was shot down by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather's actions were a feat he could never match, which gives you a feeling of humility.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also left a crown after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was very honored to be part of the parade and added that the value of an authentic hero is demonstrated by support he will receive from many people.
MMA fans who went without sleep all night to see Bellator 206, saw the Peppa Pig instead
Imagine staying up all night to see Bellator 206 and being denied to see the most important event.
The San Jose sign contained 13 fights, including six from the main card and had to be seen live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the match, UK viewers were stunned when the programming switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were upset to have spent the night up until the early morning to watch the fight.
A follower on Twitter described the change by the cartoons as "a kind of vomitous acuity."
"Government regulations say that at 6:00 this content is not suitable, so they switched to children's programming," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's vice president of marketing and communication, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the scoundrel, yes."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they would work on programming to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about repetition, I think it can work," Coker said.
"But there are six in the morning on a Sunday and we will not be able to solve it until Sunday in our hour, Monday in yours.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when I switched channels, there were a lot of messages coming and going, and not all of them were pleasant.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't. It was a government problem.
I promise it won’t happen again.
We will leave it in five fights, instead of six as we normally do. We tried to show it again by the followers, but it was over.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels "Inferior" About Sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to the rest of the people because of his sexuality, but that this provided him with the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete has stated that he didn't realize until he went to high school that not everyone was like him.
On Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give "hope" to other people.
He also said that being a father had downplayed him in winning the Olympics.
The long-running show's regular host, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Daley, who appeared as a castaway on Laverne's first show, said he felt "less than" others because he "wasn't socially acceptable like boys and girls."
He said the following: "To this day, those feelings of inferiority and difference, have been real things that have given me the power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove it was "something," he said, to not disappoint anyone when his sexuality was finally discovered.
The two-time Olympic bronze medal winner has become a high-profile promoter of the LGBT movement and has used his image at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to ask more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he had spoken so that he felt fortunate to be able to live openly without ramifications and that he wanted to give "hope" to other people.
The three-time world champion explained that he had fallen in love with a man, the American filmmaker, Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "took me by surprise."
Last year, Daley married the Oscar winner, 20 years older than him, but says the age difference has never been an issue.
According to him, when you go through so much when you’re young (he participated in his first Olympics when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later), it’s hard to find someone of the same age who has experienced similar highs and lows.
The couple were parents in June to a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley. According to Daley, "their whole outlook" has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, all I needed was to win an Olympic gold," he said.
"There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
According to Daley, his father did not accept that he had to die and one of the last things he asked for was if they already had the tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to be on the front row.
"I couldn't tell him "father, you won't be there to occupy the front row," he said.
"As I held his hand, he stopped breathing and it wasn't until then, that he was already dead, that I finally accepted that he wasn't invincible," she said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life: jumping in front of a crowd at home at an Olympic Games. There was no better feeling," he stated.
He also inspired the choice of his first song (Heather Small's Proud), which he had heard during preparation for the Olympics and which still put goosebumps on him.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
A worse Mickelson showed up at the Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will break a Sunday record in playing his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to change his physical state if he doesn't want to become an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, who will participate in the biennial event to break a record for the 12th time, was introduced by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's "fourballs" and "foursomes" modes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as has been usual for the United States, the winner of five major tournaments splits his time between playing animator and working on his game on the field, hoping to rectify what hurts him.
He has never made the most direct drivers, not even at the height of his career, but the 48-year-old is not the ideal option for the difficult trajectory of Le Golf National, where the long rough tends to punish the deviant blows.
And if his own career isn't daunting enough, Mickelson, in the ninth game Sunday, will face the precise British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, four points down at the start of the 12 individual games, start strong, Mickelson's game could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, unable to say much more.
"He perfectly understood his role for that day, patted me on the back and surrounded me with his arm as he told me he would be ready the next day," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It is a hall of fame and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that’s how I trained and that’s how we thought we had to move forward.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup games played.
It may mean the end of a race in the Ryder Cup that has not matched his individual record.
Mickelson has earned 18 wins, 20 defeats and 7 draws, although Furyk has stated that his presence has contributed intangibles to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, joking, likes to make fun of people and is a great teammate," he said.
"I think younger players were also having fun getting in with him this week, which has been fun to watch.
He brings a lot more to his game."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows the advantage can fade soon
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that starting with a considerable advantage the individual duels of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a hard day.
The Danish debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, when the team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the American team, but in the end they achieved the victory by the minimum, 14.5-13.5.
"You keep reminding us that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but narrowly," Bjorn said, in the image, after seeing the 2018 team win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday, which leaves the score at 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The story has taught me and all the members of the team that it is not over yet.
Tomorrow he has to go to every machine.
You have to go out and do everything right.
This doesn't end until the points go up to the marker.
We have a goal, we try to win the trophy, and we have to stay focused to do it.
I have already said it, I focus on the 12 players we have in the team, but I also have in mind who our rivals are: the best players in the world."
Delighted with the performance of his players on a demanding golf course, Bjorn added: "I will never rush with this.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow individual performance will make a difference and change everything.
It's great to be with a partner when everything's going well, but individual duels test your ability to play golf to the fullest.
This is the message you have to convey to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Right now, you leave your partner and he has to go out and get the best out of himself as well."
In opposition to Bjorn, rival captain Jim Furyk expects his players to perform better individually than as a team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points out of four.
Furyk knows both sides of the coin over the last day's rides, as he was part of the winning team at Brookline before ending up losing in the "Miracle of Medinah" which won Europe.
"I remember exactly every word," he replied to the question about how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, motivated his players before the final day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but we want to start on the right foot, as Brookline and Medinah saw.
When there is a team that is inspired, a lot of pressure is generated in these central duels.
We have prepared the alignment according to the circumstances and in the best way to try to make magic tomorrow."
Thomas has the challenge of trying to start the rally against Rory McIlroy in the main duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the rest of the Europeans in the first half of the order.
"I've chosen this order because I think it covers all possibilities," Bjorn says of his selection for individual matches.
Germany's new warship postponed again
The German Navy’s new frigate should have been completed in 2014 to replace the former Cold War-era warships, but it won’t do so until at least next year following faulty systems and an increase in cost, according to local media.
The completion of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the new Baden-Wurttemberg-class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, citing a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but post-construction problems have marked the timelines of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wurttemberg-class ships commissioned by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is believed to include a powerful cannon, a suite of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as anti-poaching technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other notable features include longer periods between maintenance: it should be possible to use the new frigates for up to two years without going through national ports.
However, these continued delays mean that the state-of-the-art ships, which were expected to be able to project Germany as a powerful force abroad, will already be obsolete when they come into operation, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate frigate F125 was already news last year, when the German Navy rejected the ship and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss of Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the builder once delivered.
Few details are known of the reasons for which it has been returned, but the German media have cited several "material and technical defects" of the ship that made it unusable if used in combat missions.
Technical problems are important, as approximately 120 sailors, half the crew needed for the former Bremen-class frigates, operate on Baden-Wurttemberg-class ships.
In addition, it has also been known that the weight of the ship is excessive, which reduces performance and limits the ability of the Navy to add future improvements.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to weigh twice as much as similar-class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from the defective materials, the cost of the project, which includes the training of the crew, also begins to pose a problem.
It is believed to have reached an astonishing 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) from an initial budget of 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of the new frigates have become a matter of special importance, if one takes into account recent warnings that Germany's maritime military power is weakening.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defense committee of the German Parliament, has acknowledged that the Navy "is running out of ships that can be used."
The officer has claimed that the situation has worsened over time because the old ships were stopped from being used, but none were provided again as spares.
He lamented that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wurttemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Foundation spies on the secret lives of batsmen
New research conducted on an estate in the Highlands of Scotland aims to discover how bats use the landscape to feed themselves.
The findings are expected to provide new insights into the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help in future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Foundation of Scotland will follow soprano and common bats, as well as northern eardrum and water bats at the Inverewe Botanical Garden, located in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations on the property to keep track of bat activities during the season.
UK National Health Service volunteers and staff will also conduct mobile surveys with portable detectors.
The sound analysis of recordings by experts will determine the sound frequency of bats and what each species does.
With this information, a report and habitat map will be created to create a detailed landscape-scale image of your behavior.
Rob Dewar, a natural conservation advisor at the National Foundation of Scotland, hopes the results will show which areas of the habitat are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the advantages of habitat management work, such as the creation of grasslands, and how to improve forest maintenance for bats and other associated species.
The bat population in Scotland and the rest of the UK has declined considerably in the last century.
Building construction and restoration tasks threaten bats, as they affect nests and can cause habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose a risk, as do fly killer paper and chemical treatments used in building materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
Actually, bats aren't blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo location technique to place insects and obstacles that get in the way of your flight.
The National Foundation of Scotland, responsible for taking care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes batting very seriously.
It has ten experts with the right training, who conduct surveys, nest inspections and sometimes rescues on a regular basis.
The organisation has even created Scotland's first and only reserve dedicated to bats on the Three Estate, located in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The administrator of the estate, David Thompson, claims that it is the ideal territory for the species.
"Here, in Threave, we have a large area for bats," he says.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all good habitat.
But we still don’t know many aspects of bats, so the work we do here and other properties will help us better understand what they need to grow.”
It highlights the importance of checking if there are bats before doing property maintenance tasks, since it may be that the possible involuntary destruction of a single maternity nest kills more than 400 females and young people, which could lead to the disappearance of an entire local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, attack them, disturb them and destroy the nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an officer at the Scottish bat conservation foundation, has encouraged people to take a step forward to help.
He said: "We still need to learn a lot from bats and, in the case of some of our species, we don't have enough data on their population."
Ronaldo denies rape allegations as lawyers prepare lawsuit against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape allegations against him "fake news" and said people "want to become famous" because of his name.
His lawyers will sue the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, responsible for publishing the accusations.
The forward of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly paid at the time $375,000 for the incident not to be made public, according to information published Friday by Der Spiegel.
In an Instagram Live video addressing his 142 million followers hours after the allegations became public, the 33-year-old Ronaldo claimed they were "fake news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news," says the five-time Golden Ball winner on camera.
"They want to become famous because of my name.
It's normal.
They want to take advantage of my name to become famous, but it's part of my job.
I'm a happy man and everything is in order," added the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are already preparing the lawsuit against Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called "inadmissible information of suspicions about private life," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz has stated that the player will seek compensation for "moral damages for an amount corresponding to the gravity of the offence, which is probably one of the most flagrant personal rights offences in recent years."
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms hotel and casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to reports filed with Clark County District Court.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo kneeled after the alleged incident and told him he was a "99% good boy", except for a "1%".
The documents allege that Ronaldo confirmed that they both had sex, but were consented to.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had pictures taken of the injuries at the hospital, but later accepted an out-of-court settlement because she was "afraid of retaliation" and worried "being publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old woman says she is seeking to overturn the deal, as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to sign for Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged incident and this summer he has signed for Juve, the Italian giant, in an operation of 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK ‘would always regret’ losing car manufacturers
The UK would “always regret” if it lost the status of world leader in manufacturing after Brexit, according to Greg Clark, Secretary of Economic Affairs.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota's UK base had claimed to the BBC that, if the UK left the European Union without reaching any agreement, it would temporarily halt production at the Burnaston factory, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer has indicated that the impact of delays on borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cause job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which makes Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% was exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal by the end of March, production in our factory will stop,” Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director in Burnaston, said in a statement.
Leaving the EU with no agreement on how trade with other EU countries will work has sparked fears from other UK car manufacturers, such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW claims it will close the Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what manufacturers consider risks in the production chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is done on a “just-in-time” basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the European Union for car manufacturing.
If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without reaching an agreement on March 29, there may be unrest at the border, which the sector believes could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, according to the company, and production should be stopped as a result.
Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls."
"We have to come to an agreement. We want to get the best deal that allows us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
“Testing not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, indicates that we need to be able to continue with a successful set of production chains.”
Toyota has not been able to confirm for how long production would stop, but, in the long term, has warned that the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and could cause the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite the Union coordinator at the plant, has stated that the members start to be very concerned about the situation: "From experience, when these jobs are lost, they never come back."
A government spokesman said: “We have designed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.
White House says Trump-Rosenstein meeting could be delayed again
Donald Trump's expected meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "postponed a week" as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues in White House statements Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, links between Russia and Trump’s aid, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump fired the deputy attorney general and jeopardised Mueller’s independence has fueled rumors in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times already reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of bringing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and also the possibility of deposing the president with the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein has denied the information.
But on Monday he went to the White House amid rumors that he was about to resign.
However, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump has claimed he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct testified to, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate-wide vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied the following: "No date has yet been set, it could be this week, although it may be that it will be delayed for one more week by all matters with the supreme court.
But we'll see. I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists might refute this claim: Sanders has not held a White House briefing since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the lack of briefings was not because he did not like the bragging of television journalists, although he said, "I will not deny that they are bragging."
He then hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
"The president does more question and answer sessions than any previous president," he said, before adding the following without citing any source: "We've consulted that data."
Sanders has stated that the briefings will continue to take place, but "if the press has the possibility to ask the president of the United States directly, it is much infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do it often, you've seen us do it a lot in the last few weeks and they'll replace the briefings when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or takes part in open sessions or press conferences with dignitaries on official visit.
Individual press conferences are rare.
This week, in New York, the president has perhaps demonstrated why, after an informal and, at times, bizarre appearance in front of assembled journalists.
Health Secretary writes to Scottish National Health Service EU workers following Brexit fears
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working at the Scottish National Health Service to express the country’s gratitude and wishes they would continue there after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months after the UK's departure from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to covering the cost of applications for residency status for EU citizens working in the delegated public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote the following: "Over the summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union over the exit have continued, and everything seems headed towards the decisions expected this fall.
But the UK government has also begun preparations in the event of a possible no-deal scenario.
I know it's convulsive time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to reiterate now that I very much appreciate the contribution of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Comrades across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare, while benefiting the patients and communities we serve.
Of course, Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, rearline of the Tennessee State Tigers has undergone an emergency operation after suffering a head injury Saturday in the 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to information from Mike Organ, of the Tennessean.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed has told the press that the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
"He came on the sideline and collapsed there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen to the band before placing him on a bunk bed and taking him away for further testing.
A Tennessee State official has reported Chris Harris, of WSMV of Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of surgery at the Vanderbilt medical center.
Harris has added that "there is still no information on the type or extent of the injury" and Tennessee State is investigating when the injury occurred.
It is Abercrombie's first season, second year, with Tennessee State after posting from Illinois.
He had completed five tackles Saturday before leaving the game, making a total of 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK with the additional money used to help the homeless under the new Conservative Party plans.
This action will neutralize the success of Corbyn's movement to attract young voters.
The increase in stamp duty will be levied on those people who do not pay tax in the UK.
The Treasury expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers are expected to be taxed a higher stamp duty on buying a property in the UK and that money will be used to help homeless people, a move Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's movement to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing that would affect higher rents.
The increase in stamp duty will be levied on those people and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK; this money will go towards government action to combat the figures of homeless people.
The surcharge, which will be added to the current stamp duty, including the highest levels introduced two years ago in second homes and real estate speculation, could be up to 3%.
The company expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13% of London’s newly built properties are from non-British residents, which increases prices and makes it difficult for new buyers to open up to the property ladder.
Many affluent areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost towns" following the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new measure comes weeks after Boris Johnson has called for a reduction in stamp duty to help young people have their first home.
He accused the big constructs of keeping property prices high by buying land quickly and not using it, and urged May to quash quotas on affordable homes to correct Britain's "real estate disaster".
Corbyn has announced a series of attractive proposed real estate reforms, such as checks on rent and the completion of "blameless" evictions.
It also wants to give more power to city councils to build new homes.
May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream: life must improve for every new generation.
And that means fixing our broken real estate market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and create a life here.
However, it cannot be right that it is just as easy for people who do not live in the UK, as well as for companies based abroad, to buy housing compared to hard working British inhabitants.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is too distant and the indignity of the homeless makes it all even more real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to train Scotland"
Sunderland coach Jack Ross has stated that his "ultimate ambition" is to be Scotland's coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot has accepted the challenge of reviving the northeast club, which currently occupies third place in League One, three points behind the leader.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after returning St Mirren to Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
I was summoned once as support and that’s it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound programme.
"But I grew up watching a lot playing Scotland in Hampden with my dad when I was little and it's always something that makes me go back in time.
This opportunity will only come to me if I am successful coaching clubs, however."
Ross's predecessors in the Sunderland coaching position include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach claims he does not feel the pressure to be next on a list of names enshrined in such a large team, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For the moment, my criterion for measuring my success will be whether I can bring this team back into the Premier League.
With the structure and facilities of the club, it is clear that their place is in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I would only consider that I've been successful here if I can bring the club back."
Ross only has three years of coaching experience, after a stint as second coach at Dumbarton and 15 months in the Hearts coaching staff.
He helped Alloa avoid the downgrade to the third category and transformed St Mirren from fighting for salvation to Championship champions the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than during his playing time at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a decisive moment," he recalled about accepting the position at Alloa.
"I had always believed that training was what I was best at, rather than playing.
It sounds strange because I did well, I got out reasonably and enjoyed good times high enough.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things you have to overcome every week.
I still go through things like the stress and pressure of the job, but I feel good as a coach.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm doing it, it's the most comfortable I've felt since I've been an adult."

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on a Saturday, according to a study
The summer heatwave has triggered consumption in Britain's struggling bars, but has added more pressure to restaurant chains.
Bars and bar chains saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, but consumption at restaurants fell by 4.8 percent, statistics show.
Peter Martin, of the financial consultancy CGA, the company that has collected the data, states the following: "The continuous hours of sunshine and the participation of England in the World Cup, which has been extended more than expected, have made July follow a pattern similar to June, with the increase of 2.8% in bars, except for the increase in the number of bars, which has remained the same in July.
The 1.8% reduction in consumption in restaurants in June has worsened in July.
Bars and taverns, led by the consumption of drinks, have obtained the best results, while consumption in restaurants has gone down.
The bars that offer food have also suffered with the sun, although it has not been as dramatic as in the case of restaurants.
People just wanted to go out and drink.
In the bars and taverns we have consulted, beverage sales have increased by 6.6% during the month, while food sales have fallen by 3%."
Paul Newman, of leisure and hospitality analysts RSM, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social or sporting events continue to be the main factors related to sales from the external leisure market.
It’s no surprise that restaurants continue to struggle, but a 4.8 percent year-on-year decline in sales would be especially damaging, rather than continued cost pressure.
This very long and hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the shops that serve food and the weather will tell if the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide that much-needed breath."
The total increase in sales of bars and restaurants, including those recently opened, was 2.7% in July, indicating a slowdown in the presentation of brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker for UK restaurants, bars and taverns collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined loss of over 9 million pounds and is the industry’s established benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that hide from parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, have secret social media accounts that hide from parents and teachers, according to a survey.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has indicated an increase in "fake-instance" pages
The news has raised fears about the publication of sexual content
20% of students say they have a “primary” account they show to their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, create social media accounts that hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has indicated a rapid increase in “fake Instagram” accounts, a reference to Instagram, the photo-sharing site.
The news has raised fears about the publication of sexual content.
20% of students say they have a clean "primary" account that they show to their parents, while they also have a private one.
A mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret account saw a message from a teenager urging others to "rape me."
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent Schools’ HMC Committee, has revealed that 40% of 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles, of which half have admitted to having private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan has stated the following: "It's disturbing that many teens are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" in the directive of the Scottish athletics federation
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Federation's board at the organisation's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most medal-winning field and track athlete and President Ian Beattie described the movement as a great opportunity for those who guide the sport to benefit from his dilated experience internationally in the last decade.
"Eilidh has the respect of the athletics community in Scotland, the UK and around the world and we are confident that Scottish athletics will benefit from its incorporation into the board," Beattie said.
Doyle has stated the following: "I am very much looking forward to acting as the voice of the athletes and hope to be able to grow the sport and contribute to Scotland."
The American, who won gold in the 200s and 400s at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, among a total of four Olympic golds and is currently a regular BBC commentator, was prevented from walking after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that only time will tell if I can recover or to what degree.
It has been exhausting, but I have recovered completely, I have learned to walk again and today it is time to do agility exercises!
Thanks for the messages of encouragement!"
A trailer ad comparing mothers to cows divides opinion on the Internet
A scrapbooking company has split opinion on the Internet with an ad comparing nursing mothers to cows that mingle.
To mark the launch of what’s considered the “world’s first silent pull,” consumer technology company Elvie has issued an ad inspired by a prank music video to show the freedom the new pull gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of farrowing and cows to the rhythm of a song that includes lyrics like, "Yes, I die to myself, but you won't see any tail" and "If you hadn't noticed, they're not panties, but my boobs."
The return continues: "Pump, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, muyo the girls."
However, the ad, posted on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mix of reactions from those who have seen it, many of whom claim it shows the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, with the difference that they are taken away from their babies a few days after giving birth," one person wrote.
The Elvie strap is discreetly hidden in a breast milk holder (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented as follows: "Comprehensibly traumatic for mother and baby.
But why not use them to advertise a tug for mothers who will keep their babies?"
Another user added, "It's an out-of-place ad."
Other people defended the ad; one woman admitted that she found the song to be "fun".
"I think it's a great idea.
I'd buy one if I still had to breastfeed.
Bombing for the tug made me feel exactly like a cow.
The announcement is a bit crazy, but it has to be taken for what it is.
It’s a great product,” one user wrote.
Another person commented as follows: "It's a fun ad intended for mothers who pump with straps (usually at their workplace or in the bathroom and feel like they're cows.
It's not an announcement that praises or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the women show that they have all danced with the strapped discreetly to the bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women feel as if they are cows when they use the strap.
However, the Elvie strap is completely silent, has no wire or tube and fits discreetly into a breast-feeding bra, giving women more freedom to move around, hold babies, and even get out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, a partner and early childhood developer at Mother, has stated the following: "The Elvie trailer is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a daring and provocative campaign.
In tracing the parallelism between women and cows, we wanted to show the public how a strapping is used and the challenges involved in doing so, while demonstrating, in an entertaining and didactic way, the incredible feeling of freedom offered by the new strapping.
This is not the first time the Elvie scandal has hit the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the runway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Quietly Moved to Tent Camp on Texas Border
The number of migrant children held has increased even though monthly entries across the border have virtually remained stable, in part because harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to sponsor children.
Traditionally, most godparents were undocumented immigrants, who have been afraid of putting their chance of staying in the country at risk if they decided to take in a child.
The risk has increased in June, when federal authorities announced that prospective sponsors and other adults living in their homes will have to send digital fingerprints, which will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer in the Customs Enforcement and Immigration Service, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had requested to take in unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
“Nearly 80% of the people who have hosted or live in the home of a person who has hosted are in the country illegally, and a large majority of them are criminal aliens.
Therefore, we will continue to pursue these people," Albence said.
To process the children more quickly, officers have introduced new rules that require some to appear in court within a month of being held, rather than 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many of them will appear by videoconference, rather than in person, to defend their case for legal status before an immigration judge.
All those who are not considered fit for help, will be immediately deported.
The longer children spend in custody, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent rampages or escape attempts, according to workers and reports the system has made public in recent months.
Lawyers claim that these concerns can be intensified in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where signs indicating a child is suffering are more likely to be overlooked due to their size.
They have added that moving children to the camp without having time to prepare them emotionally or say goodbye to friends can cause them a trauma that many already suffer.
Syria urges US, French and Turkish "occupation forces" to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the eight-year war in the country.
Muallem, who also acts as deputy prime minister, has claimed that foreign forces were in Syrian territory illegally, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "the matter will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must be removed immediately and without conditions," he told the assembly.
Muallem has insisted that the “war of terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and the conflict has caused millions to be displaced.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this holy battle until we have purged all Syrian territory" from both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily to train and advise Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1000 troops on the ground of a country struck by war.
On the issue of refugees, Muallem has stated that conditions were good for their return and has blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "irrational fears" that make refugees want to stay away.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
"They are politicizing an issue that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats have claimed that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral zone in the last major rebel stronghold, Idlib, has favored the opportunity to continue political meetings.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by Syrian forces with Russia’s help in the province, where three million people live.
However, Muallem has noted that the agreement has "clear terms" and expressed the hope that military action will confront the jihadists, which include al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front fighters, who "will be eradicated."
Staffan de Mistura, a U.N. envoy, hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee made up of government and opposition members to begin shaping a post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
Muallem laid out the conditions for Syrian government participation in the committee, whose task should be restricted to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned of possible interference.
Why Trump will win for the second time
According to this logic, Trump would win the election again in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers probably expect, the scandals and the process of removal end with his presidency prematurely.
What would undoubtedly be "the end of a most dramatic presidency in history."
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the spectators.
Since 2014, the number of viewers on prime time has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers on primetime, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has led cable television audiences with up to 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
“People have been pushed into it because they don’t understand it,” Neal Baer, executive producer of the ABC series “Designated Survivor,” says of a cabinet secretary who happens to be the president when an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
He remembers a taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told him he would vote for Trump.
"Why?" he asked.
"He told me that because it made him laugh," Scovell told me.
There's a point of entertainment in the chaos.
Of course, unlike television programs, the script coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families will be able to reunite, and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, to be an informed citizen is to go further when you find yourself at the sixth hour to see a group of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of sources "for private use" for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000-structed leather jacket-ditching description of Trump's ("a piece of clothing thick as his eye"
I don’t think I’ll see Super Mario again.
"Part of what makes it seem like I'm part of a reality show is that every night it gives you something new," says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars" about the character changes and script twists of Trump's show (bashing the NFL, praising Kim Jong-Un).
You can't afford to miss any episodes because you're left behind.
When I saw Fleiss this week, there was a temperature of about 25 degrees and it was alone outside the house he has on the north coast of Kauai, but he stayed locked looking at MSNBC while recording CNN.
It couldn't be undone, not with Brett Kavanaugh about to face the judicial committee of the Senate and the future of the Supreme Court hanging by a thread.
"I remember when we did those crazy programs then and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it would be kind of a joke, but it looks like they were right."

External Money Floods Midterm Election Races in the Tightest House of Representatives
It is no surprise that there is a cash flood in Pennsylvania's 17th district, thanks to the realignment of congressional districts that has caused two current members to compete for the same spot.
This recent reassignment of Pittsburgh's suburban district involves Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won the seat in another district after a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's former 12th district, which conflicts with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decreed in January that the former districts were unconstitutionally divided in favor of Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district has triggered a financial war between the parties' main financial organizations, the Democratic Campaign Committee for Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb made a name for himself in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a closely followed special election held in March to represent Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
Republicans have held office for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points difference.
Political experts give Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States imposes sanctions on El Salvador for its support of China, but withdraws them
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Trump held a tense meeting with Panama’s president, Juan Carlos Valera, in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his associates knocked out the Trump Organization’s management team.
State Department officials decided to remove the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions to Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "recent decisions about ceasing to recognize Taiwan," Heather Nauert, a spokesman for the department, said this month.
However, only the possibility of sanctioning El Salvador was contemplated, which received in 2017 aid from the United States of 140 million dollars, according to estimates, for the control of drug trafficking, development and economic improvements.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts in financial aid and restrictions on visas issued, would be detrimental to the Central American country and high death tolls from murder and unemployment.
With the passage of the internal meetings, officials from both countries postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity to continue with a similar meeting held last year and which was seen as a step forward to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials clarified that they wanted the meeting to occur, effectively ending any likelihood of sanction for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has been chosen for the meeting, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to it, according to diplomats.
The three U.S. envoys quietly returned to their positions in Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A Bolton White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three officers, which include two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations since anonymity.
An external analyst, close to the administration and also from the anonymity, corroborated the statements.
Study History
The next event to occur could be special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstruction of justice, of which there is numerous evidence in public records.
As far as is known, Mueller is also investigating whether the Trump campaign collaborated with Russia in its attack on the election.
If Congress changes hands, Trump could find himself holding the body accountable, just as he prepares to do so in front of voters, and even before a jury of party members.
There are many circumstantial conditions, and I don’t want to suggest that the fall of Trump, or any of his European names, is inevitable.
There are decisions that must be made on both shores of the Atlantic that will affect how long the situation will last.
In 1938, German officers were willing to stage a coup against Hitler, only if the Western bloc had resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid all the years of terror that followed.
The course of history fluctuates over turning points like this and it accelerates or reverses the inexorable progress of democracy.
The United States is currently facing several turning points.
What will happen if Trump fires Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been with the water in his neck since this newspaper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated that he was unsuitable for the position.
Rosenstein claims the Times information is not accurate.
"How will we respond if the new investigation the FBI has requested on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false witness?
And, especially, will we vote in the middle term for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will begin to run a dangerous course.
But I think we will not fail, because I already learned the lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the ambassador's house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles at that table with the swastika.
With this background, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistic ahead of game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers receive the Rapid from Vienna on Thursday, aware that a win against the Austrians, after an impressive draw at Vila-real this month, would leave him in a good position to qualify to the Europa League G group.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing the first minutes of the season until the 2-2 draw against Vila-real, but he believes Rangers can use this result as a springboard to get great results.
"It was a positive point for us, because Vila-real are a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We played the game believing we could get a valuable result and we came out with a point.
Maybe we could have gotten something more out of it in the end, but, in general, probably the tie was a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but we were better than them in the second.
On Thursday, it's another big European night.
We hope we can stay with the three points, but it will be a difficult match because they got a good result in the last game, but I am sure we will give everything and get a good result with the support of the hobby.
Last year was really tough, with the injuries I suffered and the changes at the club, but now it's a good place to be.
The team is fine and the guys enjoy it, the trainings are good.
I hope we can give it our all, leave last season behind and be successful."
Women lose sleep because of fear of retirement savings
Although the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked to the family.
Approximately half of respondents nationwide say they have talked to their partner about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% of respondents said they had spoken to their children.
"People want some family member to take care of them, but they don't "dare to think about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide life insurance company.
You have to start here.
Talk to your partner and your children: you can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t communicate your wishes well in advance.
Work with your advisor and family to decide where and how to get attention, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining cost.
Include your financial advisor in the conversation: it can also help you determine how to pay these expenses.
Your financing options for your long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-value hybrid life insurance policy that helps you cover expenses, or an own insurance policy with your own resources, if you have the money to do so.
Prepare your legal documents: cut off the passage to legal battles.
Search for a representative so you can appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals fulfill your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Consider also the possibility of contracting a notarial power of attorney for your finances.
It is advisable to select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid in the event of "incapacity".
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly family member has a medical emergency and is on his way to the "hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Specify these details in a written plan to be prepared.
Finances are not the only factor that "must be determined, but also which doctors you want to deal with," Martin said.
"What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have that plan ready.”
Man shot several times with a compressed air shotgun at Ilfracombe
A man has been shot several times from "a compressed air shotgun as he returned home after leaving at night.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officials have described the shooting, which took place around 2.30am (on "British summer time"), as a "random act".
The victim did not see his attacker.
His life is not in danger from injuries and the police have made a call to find witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died due to a "strong earthquake and tsunami that rocked the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities. The death toll is expected to rise.
Since communications are cut off, the auxiliary units have been unable to obtain information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu closer to the 7.5 magnitude earthquake epicenter.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Below are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on Celebes Island:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that extends along more than 300 km of coastline northwest of the island of Celebes.
The regency, an administrative region smaller than a province, had a population of approximately 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the mainstays of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
The exploitation of nickel mines is also important in the province, but it is concentrated, mainly, in Morowali, on the coast of the other end of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have suffered several tsunamis in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996 there was also a tsunami in western Donggala that killed nine people.
Indonesia is in the Pacific Ring of Fire and earthquakes often occur there.
Listed below are the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a major earthquake off the western coast of Indonesia's Ace province, north of Sumatra, triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Thousands of people died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and triggered a tsunami that destroyed the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 shook a pop area of the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 shook one of the Mentawai Islands off the coast of Sumatra, and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake affected Pidie Jaya's regency in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, as the population recalled the devastation of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
This time, no tsunami occurred, but more than 100 people died due to the buildings that fell.
2018: A series of major earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian resort island of Lombok that killed over 500 people, mainly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Gov. and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested as a suspect in domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and resistance to arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, she stretched out her phone.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su provisional detention center, where he is being held with an unsecured obligation of 500 USD, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court Saturday, when he pleaded "not guilty, for sure" when asked how he pleaded, according to this network.
Palin faces three Class A fouls, which means he could go to jail for up to a year and have to pay a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B offense, which can be punished with a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to notify the alleged attack.
Currently, the case is in the hands of the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interference with the report of a domestic violence crime and possession of a weapon in a state of drunkenness in connection with the incident.
His partner stated that he had punched him in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups for associating her son's violent behavior with a post-traumatic stress disorder derived from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake shook Indonesia's Sulawesi Island on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake triggered a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks do not work and the death toll is expected to rise over the next few days.
The earthquake has occurred just off the coast of Central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
There are videos circulating on social media at the time of the impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a festival on the beach in Palu city when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand exceptional death penalty for suspect in New York terror attack
New York federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terror attack that killed eight people: an extraordinary penalty that has not been applied to the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike path on the West Side Highway, in Lower Manhattan and hit pedestrians and cyclists during his journey, in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must show that Saipov killed the eight victims "intentionally" and that he "intentionally" caused serious personal injuries, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in the southern district of New York.
Both crimes could carry a death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury attacked Saipov with a 22-fault indictment that included eight counts of murder for the benefit of organized crime, which federal prosecutors typically use in mob cases, in addition to a crime of violence and motor vehicle destruction.
Prosecutors claimed that the attack required "considerable planning and premeditation" and described Saipov's manner of acting as "inhumane, cruel and depraved".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," according to the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the last time the southern district of New York brought a death penalty case to trial.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to carry out espionage actions for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no regret in the days and months following the attack.
Police explained that he told investigators he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov explained to authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
According to police, he also requested that the ISIS flag be displayed in his hospital room.
He has pleaded not guilty to the 22-fault indictment.
David Patton, one of the public federal advocates who represented Saipov, claimed they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, rather than accept a plea of guilt and a life sentence without the possibility of freedom, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all the people involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the popular troops" today during a protest at the Conservative party conference.
The former UKIP leader has claimed that politicians must "feel the pressure of Eurosceptics" when one of Theresa May's own members of parliament has suggested she should lead negotiations with the EU.
Free Conservative MP Peter Bone told the Birmingham march that the UK would already be out of the EU if Mr Farage was the Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May faces in reconciling her deeply divided ranks has been highlighted when pro-union Conservatives have come forward in another anti-Brexit protest in La City.
The prime minister is fighting to preserve her Chequers engagement plan amid attacks from Brexit supporters, union supporters and the EU.
The allies insist that they will manage to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the negative responses and pressure the Eurosceptics and the conservative party to choose between their package and chaos.
Mr Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to undo Chequers' commitment.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been appointed a member of the House of Lords and that he should have been given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we'd already be out," he said.
Wellingborough added: "I will defend Brexit, but we must undo Chequers' commitment."
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he added: "We did not fight world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British population has changed their mentality and wants to stay there is totally false."
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march and told reporters: "I'm just telling you, Prime Minister, listen to the people."
“Chequers’ commitment is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular within our party and our activists, who are the people who take to the streets and get us to win an election.
Drop the Chequers pledge and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs May, he added: "Prime ministers keep their job when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said politicians at the rally must feel the pressure if they want to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"This, now, is a matter of trust between us (the people) and our political class," he said.
"They are trying to betray Brexit and today we are here to tell them that we will not allow them to do so."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make the political class, about to betray Brexit, feel the pressure."
“We are mobilizing the popular troops of this country that gave us the victory with Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, union supporters marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists waved banners about the Conservatives against Brexit after the group's launch this weekend.
Conservative member of the House of Lords Lord Adonis laughed at the Conservatives for the security problems they suffered with a party application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have the necessary IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus deal, for the frictionless border, for borderless free trade in Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There is no option for a good Brexit," he added.
Warren to consider running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will examine the possibility of running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that Saturday, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at an open meeting in the western part of Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state representative Geoff Diehl, who was deputy president of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
He has been at the center of speculation about the possibility of reviving Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with constituents with the meeting format open since Trump took office.
An assistant asked him if he planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it's time for "women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top."
One person arrested for shooting death of Sims, of LSU
Baton Rouge, La., police announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested for the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims Friday.
The Baton Rouge police department has announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at the 11:00 ET press conference.
They posted a video of the shooting Friday and asked for collaboration to identify the man from the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and died near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head that eventually killed him," police officer Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday for 247sports.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to having been at the scene, in possession of a weapon, and to having fired Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to custody at the East Baton District Police Department.
Sims, a 2 m junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 parts with 10 starts during the last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton takes world title after team orders hand him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas was ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes team orders would play an important role in the race.
From pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost exhausted Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his partner.
Vettel entered the pits earlier and let Hamilton run with the traffic on the back of the package, which should have been decisive.
Later, Mercedes had to stop at the pits and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton advanced after some wheeled action that caused the Ferrari driver to abandon the free inner part at the risk of being left out after a double move to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started in the last row of the grid and at the end of the first lap he was in seventh position on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then continued in good position much of the race, as he retained his wheels to save time, advance to Kimi Raikkonen and move into fourth position.
He eventually entered the pits on lap number 44, but was unable to increase the pace on the next eight laps and Raikkonen placed fourth.
It's a tough day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman who was told to let me go.
The team has done a fantastic job to have one-two" said Hamilton.
Her body language was terrible.
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally Saturday to insist that she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
At a rally in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people are "sick, cruel and liars."
"One thing that could happen and the most beautiful thing that's going on in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see angry, bad, cruel and lying people," he said.
"When you look at the statements and the leaks and they say, 'No, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember his answer... You leaked the document? "Hey, what?
No, no.
I didn't leak it."
Hey, wait a minute.
We leaked... No, we didn't leak it." he added while imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing statements against Ford's Kavanaugh in July and leaked in September, but Feinstein denied the leak came from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's statements, I didn't leak her story," Feinstein told the Committee, according to The Hill.
"He asked me to be confidential and I kept it confidential, just as he asked me to."
But his denial did not please the President, who commented at the Saturday night rally: "You know what? His body language was terrible.
Maybe he didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, accused of inappropriate sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats were using the statements for their own purpose.
"They are determined to regain power by the means necessary.
You see the evil, the cruelty, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over to have power and control,” the president said, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired Friday's defeat to the Elite against the Belfast Giants, as they won the return match 5 to 3 at Dundee Saturday.
The Giants immediately got a two-goal advantage thanks to the shots of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie leveled up their team, but, later, Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard matched the Dundee. Then two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured his victory.
It was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's men, who came from winning the Dundee 2 to 1 in Belfast Friday.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams and the Giants had won the previous three games.
The first goal came from Dwyer's hand in the fourth minute, at 3:35, from an assist from Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later, with the assistance of David Rutherford, Beauvillier would double his advantage.
During this hectic initial period, Sullivan placed the home team back in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt facilitated the equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer guaranteed the Giants' advantage on the first break when he scored the second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and, again, Bouchard contributed at his level with a powerful goal in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time during the game at the end of the second half and guaranteed their team's victory with the fifth goal near the end of the game.
The Giants, who have already lost four of the last five games, are at home, at Milton Keynes and have their next game Friday.
An air traffic controller has died to save hundreds of passengers from an earthquake.
An Indonesian air traffic controller has become a hero after he dies to make sure a plane with hundreds of passengers landed safely.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a major earthquake shook the island of Celebes on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Many replicas are occurring in the area and there are many people trapped between the ruins in the city of Palu.
But, despite his companions escaping to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his place in the trembling control tower of Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He stayed in place to make sure that Batik Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take the flight safely.
Then, he exited the air traffic control tower when he thought it was sinking.
He later died in the hospital.
A representative for Air Navigation, Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, as reported by Australia's ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“That broke my heart,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, while the disaster mitigation agency has reported that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The death toll is expected to increase because there are still many bodies under the rubble and there are still many that have not been accessed," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
The waves, with a height of up to six meters, have devastated Palu, which will hold a common funeral on Sunday.
Armed forces and some commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance carries corpses.
Drinking water is scarce.
All the mini-markets have been looted."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working against the clock to help survivors, but we don't know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it could still get worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the armed forces: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia suffered another earthquake this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Airplane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a man has disappeared after the accident in the lagoon
The airline operating a flight that is to crash into a Pacific lagoon in the Micronesia now says a man has disappeared, although they previously said that the 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that, since Saturday afternoon, they did not find a passenger.
The airline claimed to be working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find him.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as their age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew when the plane fell into the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Islands airport.
Authorities said Friday that seven people had been taken to a hospital.
The airline said Saturday there were still six passengers in the hospital and that they were all in good condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unknown.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy claimed that the plane moored in the lagoon because the runway fell short.
Some witnesses think the plane missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes explained that the plane was going very low.
"That was extremely positive," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers managed to walk with water around their waists to the emergency exits of the plane, which was sinking.
He said that the flight attendants panicked and started screaming, and that he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said the sailors who had been working nearby to improve a dock also assisted in the rescue with an inflatable boat to transport the affected people to the ground before the plane sank about 30 meters inside the water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicate that 111 people have died in airline accidents recorded at PNG, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these accidents.
An analyst composes a chronology of the night a woman was burned alive
Prosecutors said the case was concluded Saturday in a review of the trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the intelligence analysis field.
He described to the jury how he used mobile phone records to build the movements of the defendant, 29, Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night he died.
Rowlett said he received location data from different mobile phones showing Tellis was with Chambers the night he died, contradicting his previous statements, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford denied it and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis told the truth when he claimed he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he had lied, as his truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Phone records indicated that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that, some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He erased it from his life," Hale said.
The defense plans to begin its final arguments Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to pass into the hands of the jury throughout the same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio fills their music with positive messages to challenge the negative view of the genre.
Bristol's The High Breed says hip-hop has strayed from its origins with political messages and social problems.
They want to get back to their roots and bring conscious hip-hop back into fashion.
Some artists, such as The Fugees and Common, have experienced a recent resurgence in the United Kingdom by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
NY maid demands a couple for dismissal after a "racist" message
A New York nanny has denounced a couple for a discriminatory dismissal after receiving an ill-directed text message from the mother where she was protesting because she was "another black person."
The couple denies that they are racist and compare the demand with an "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dismay that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived at work on the first day in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOO ONE OTHER BLACK PERSON," Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But, instead of sending him to her husband, she sent him to Mrs. Maurice, twice.
After noticing her piphy, an "uncomfortable" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, all claiming that the nanny who had fired, who was African-American, had done her job badly and that she expected a Filipino person, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice received the payment corresponding to her workday and was then sent home with an Uber.
Maurice now claims compensation for his dismissal and seeks compensation of approximately USD 350 per day for work with a six-month residence for which he had been hired, although there was no contract.
"I want to show them that you can't do things like that," she told the Post on Friday, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple has responded to statements that they are racist by stating that Maurice's dismissal was the most reasonable, as they were afraid of not being able to trust her after having offended her.
“My wife sent me something I didn’t want to say.
It's not racist.
We're not racist people," husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone with whom you have been rude, even if it was by mistake?
A baby?
Come on."
Plasco, who has compared the lawsuit to an "extortion," said his wife had two months left to have a baby and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you going to pursue something like that?
It's not a very kind attitude," added the investor banker.
The legal case has not yet been resolved and the court of public opinion has rushed to denounce the couple on social networks and to condemn their behavior and their logic.
Paddington editors feared that readers would not identify with a talking bone, according to a new letter
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said in relation to the letter, "It's hard to get into the shoes of someone who first ties it up before it's published.
It's very funny, now that we know what we know about Paddington's great success."
He explained that his father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he had the inspiration to write the children's book about a small teddy bear, was optimistic about the book's rejection. He also said that the 60th anniversary of the books' publication was "aggressive", after his death last year.
He describes Paddington as a very important member of his family and asserts that his father was very proud of the success he had finally achieved.
"He was a discreet man; he was not a presumptuous one," he said.
"But, since Paddington was so real to him, it was practically like when your son gets something: you pride yourself, even if it's not your thing.
I think he considered Paddington's success that way.
Though it was his creation and his imagination, he always used to recognize Paddington’s own merit.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Upon landing, they rushed their daughter to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad frequently called to say it was very serious and they didn't expect me to get over it," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad and he told me he would die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, pretty.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll go with you.
The medicines he had been given to keep his body beating were being consumed and were coming out of his system.
He had died earlier than planned and so everything was turned off.
I just had to sit back and wait, as I knew what was going on.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by family and more people.
I had to keep the good form.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving over the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the rest of the passengers, distracted from the experience she was going through.
"No one knew," he said.
"He had his head down and the tears kept falling.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt a sense of sympathy for Nad overwhelming.
The feeling that I needed my love and my understanding.
I know I loved her a lot.”
Women of grief hang cards to prevent suicides on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide are working to prevent other people from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been hanging cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that citizens can call for assistance.
Mrs. Davis’s son, Tyler, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and, at the age of 18, was killed.
"I don't want any father or mother to feel what I have to feel every day," he said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, residing in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that their smile could light up any room."
However, he quit his job before he died because he was at a "very dark point."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after he had taken his own life.
Mrs. Davis stated, "I am continually concerned that there is a side effect."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "because people know that there are people who can be reached, who can be listened to, even if it's a friend.
Don't be silent: you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after Mark's mother's death.
"He never said he wasn't feeling well or that he was depressed or anything like that," he said.
"A couple of days before Christmas we saw a change in attitude.
He hit rock bottom on Christmas Day, when the kids opened their presents and he didn’t look them in the eye or anything.”
He said that his death would be a great trauma for them, but that they must work on it: "It opens a hole in the family.
It destroys us.
But we have to continue and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as FBI begins investigation
"I thought that if we could get something like what he was asking for (an investigation with a limited scope and time), we could get some unity," Mr. Flake said Saturday. He also added that he feared the committee would be destroyed with the supporters' related stalemate.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
His reluctance has to do with the moment.
There are only five weeks until the midterm elections on November 6. If, as expected, Republicans do not get good results, they will be weak when it comes to getting the man they want elected to come to the main court in the country.
George W. Bush has been picking up the phone to call senators and pressure them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who has worked in the White House for Mr. Bush. He also met his wife Ashley through Mr. Bush, as he was his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI creates its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where, currently, there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice President, to undo the tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of defectors "caves" with Kim
The number of North Korean defectors in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern Unification Ministry said there had been 1,127 defections last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said strict border controls between North Korea and China and rising prices charged by human traffickers had been the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Usually, the vast majority of North Korean defectors are offered South Korean nationality.
Seoul sources claim that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to create than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers migrant deserters illegal, rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on stalled negotiations on denuclearization.
This happened after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in these circumstances, we will not disarm ourselves first unilaterally," Ri said in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is a "hysterical" and unfit to work at the High Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said that High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh is a "hysterical" and that his temperament makes him unable to work in the High Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival held in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman had acted this way, they would have said she's a 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee Thursday.
Kavanaugh, excited, denied allegations of sexually abusing Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes screaming and running out of words as he talked about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the committee's Democrats and said the accusations against him amounted to a "grotesque and coordinated murder of a character" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh's testimony showed he could not work in the High Court, as it showed his prejudices against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with these statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats," he said.
Pelosi showed reluctance when asked if she would try to challenge Kavanaugh's election, if confirmed, and whether Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
"That's what I can say: If you don't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, you're not only not able to be in the High Court, but you're not able to be in the courtroom where you are now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh currently serves as a judge in the Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about decisions Kavanaugh might make against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as he considers himself a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, he dodged questions about whether he would overturn certain High Court decisions.
"It's no time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to enter the courthouse and hope it looks wonderful to us," Pelosi said.
Women must exercise their power.
It is a justified diatribe: months and years of abundant fury and you can’t take it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's uncommon. And you?"
She continued... "I was really helped by a woman who was an executive somewhere who told me that she was also crying when she was angry, but that she developed a tactic that consisted of, when she was angry and starting to cry, telling the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then it went on.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger in part because, basically, they are misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs in a male-majority office, where I once ended up crying with an indescribable rage, is that of an older woman (a cold directive that had always terrified me a little) who grabbed me by the horn and dragged me to the eye of the ladder.
"Never let them see you crying," he told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad, because they'll have you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic MP from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was discovered on an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, very frustrated, thought there was no reason not to explore the idea of running herself for the presidency.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision," he told me as he laughed 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone said "White Snow and the Seven Dwarfs"
As she arrived late to the campaign, she was lagging behind with fundraising, so she promised that she would not enter the race if she did not raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He discovered that some of his supporters, who gave $1,000 to the men were only willing to give 250 to her.
"Do they think I have a discount?" he asked.
When she delivered her speech and announced that she would not start a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by the emotions (gratitude for the people who had helped her, frustration with the system for the difficulty of raising money and for targeting voters, rather than the delegates, and anger, and sexism) that she ran out of words.
"You could have thought I had a nervous breakdown," Ms. Schroeder recalled of the press reaction.
"You might have thought my corporate sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking: What will they put in my tomb?
"Did you cry?"
How the U.S.-China trade war can benefit Beijing
The initial salvoes of the trade war between the US and China were deafening and, although the war does not appear to have to end soon, a distance between the countries may prove beneficial for Beijing in the long run, according to experts.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year, when he imposed taxes on China’s top exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week, with new tariffs affecting $200 billion worth of products. These tariffs tax half of all goods arriving in the U.S. from China.
Beijing has increasingly counterattacked in the same way and has recently raised tariffs from five to ten percent for $60 billion of American goods.
China has pledged to replicate the U.S. and the world’s second-largest economy is not likely to turn back anytime soon.
Getting Washington to backtrack involves giving in to some demands, but bowing publicly to the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
Still, experts say that, if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressures of the trade war with the US could benefit China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick policy decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that start a downturn in any of these countries is far more dangerous than witnesses had anticipated,” said Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused research associate at the Center for New American Security, a committee of experts.
Syria is "ready" for refugees to return, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country, devastated by a seven-year-old war.
In front of the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Currently, the situation on the street is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress that has been made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas that the terrorists destroyed to restore normality.
All conditions are met for the voluntary return of refugees to the country who had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and their maintenance.
The EU estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
There are also six million people living in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem claimed that the Syrian regime appreciates any help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from the countries that funded the insurgency.
The European team wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has achieved the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the US team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has already lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team again won the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who fought for most of the tournament, threw the kickoff into the water at the par 3 16 hole, which ceded the win to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shone in all his series and became one of four players to have achieved the 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was set aside with a 5&4 by the least qualified player of the European selection Thorbjorn Olesen, of Denmark.
The world's most qualified player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the biggest winner the tournament has ever had, with 25.5 career points.
"I don't cry, but I can't help it today.
It's been a tough year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so glad I got the cup back.
The team is the most important thing ... and I am happy that I could have helped," commented an excited Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the baton to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a Sunday individual competition.
"I'm incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods, I grew up following him," said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost all four games he had in France and now has a career record in the Ryder Cup of 13-21-3.
A rare statistic for one of the best players ever, with 14 major titles won and only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. national team struggled all weekend to search the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top-flight golf throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's frustrating performance: "I'm proud of these players, they've fought.
There was a time this morning when we put pressure on the European team.
We fought.
I'm taking my hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We will regroup, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and make progress.
I love these 12 players and I am proud to have been their captain.
You have to take off your hat.
They defeated us.”
