Populist right win in Austria, together make up 29%
Early elections to the Austrian parliament have brought, according to the first approximate results, an appreciable weakening of both parties of the current grand coalition and an expressive strengthening of the populist right party.
The Austrian People's Party (OVP) has suffered heavy and special losses, seriously upsetting the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer.
On the contrary, the leader of the Alliance for Austria’s Future (BZO), the head of the Carinthian state government, Joerg Haider, is preparing his triumphant return to national politics.
According to the approximate results, the Social Democracy (SP) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 percent of votes, so it loses 5.5 percent of the vote compared to the last elections of 2006.
Worse still is the OVP losing 25.6 percent, nearly nine percent of the vote.
They are the worst, literally catastrophic, results in the history of these two major Austrian parties since the postwar period and especially for the people who called these early elections.
Still in early July, when the OVP left the coalition, the popular had in terms of preference against the SPO, a considerable advantage.
It is clear, however, that voters punished them for letting the government shipwreck.
Already in the first reactions to the results were heard speculations about the resignation of the president of the party and, until today, vice chancellor, Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could be achieved by Monday in the exceptional meeting of the party presidency.
Such an evolution would evidently facilitate the path of the constant and closest starting point of the electoral results, that is, of the renewal of the grand coalition between SPO and OVP.
In view of the fact that the reinforcement of both parties of the populist right - the liberals (FPO) have won about 18 percent and the BZO, eleven percent of the votes - and that the Social Democrats at the same time expressed their fears that the same thing would be repeated of 1999 when the popular ones negotiated with the populists (at the time FPO was a unit, but in 2005 the Union was dismembered from BZO) for a coalition government that generated.
For this evolution Haider clearly bets who already announced that he is ready to collaborate with any party and that he already assumes his return to Vienna, to national politics.
The Green Party has also managed to make it to parliament although it has slightly lost and dropped from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
No other party clearly exceeded the four per cent limit and is therefore not part of parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may cool
Failure to solve the problem of Czech scientists who have been accused in India of illegally picking beetles could lead to a cooling of Czech-Indian relations, according to Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
This is what the minister said in New York, after today’s meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this is not solved then yes, then this cooling would certainly be achieved," he said after the meeting, which was organised on Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after the meeting, that the executive can hardly get involved in legal matters.
However, he said that in the case of Petr’vácha, who was exempted from prosecution and punished with a fine, the government can negotiate with the local government of Darjiling in whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
"Their problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Kusera, sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best, according to Mukherjee, to appeal to the highest levels.
He can then request an exoneration of the case and wait for the sentence to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague expressed himself in the same terms during the meeting.
"He advises appealing to the High Court and then pardon would be possible," the head of Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech side can get into the matter is by getting the convicted person “competent legal support,” the Indian minister said.
He also said that such support has already been obtained by the Indian side.
“We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians recognize it, too,” Schwarzenberg said.
On the other hand, as the TK said, before his colleague insisted that the Czech Republic considers the problem of Czech entomologists of great importance.
“We really consider it a terrible mistake to imprison and condemn these Czech scientists,” he said.
The minister shirked the answer to the question of whether he received a promise from the Indian side that he would deal with the matter.
“I’ve received a lot of promises,” he said.
A Czech referees a fight on the seabed
I approach an electronic wall map, which depicts Australia surrounded by the sea.
He is not interested, however, in the continent but in a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and next to it also the seabed that surrounds it.
The region is, at the same time, as big as a single continent,” says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the team of thirty members working in the UN Division for Ocean Law and the Sea.
His boss, the head of the Division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the exhibition and sometimes completes it.
It governs this spirit and enthusiasm of work.
The seabed still hides a little-known world, rich in natural sources.
You can find oil and other mineral raw materials, but also unknown organisms until today that themselves carry the key to the development of anti-cancer drugs.
The bottom is greater than the solid ground
The countries with coasts have begun today to vehemently dispute the new territories under the sea.
According to the UN Treaty, these take advantage of the rights they agreed to in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is fundamentally the so-called continental edge which sometimes extends a few hundred kilometers from the coast of the given country.
It has, according to the Treaty, exclusive rights to all the resources of the Continental Rim.
“Continental edge simply means the part of the seabed and its surface, which is the continent’s natural continuation underwater.
It reaches the limit of the sea coast, and often reaches the border of two hundred nautical miles, that is, pure economic zone, "explains Mikulka.
The request that the given country submits to the Commission, for the delimitation of the outer limits of the continent edge, must be submitted with scientific technical documentation based on research and measures.
It is the result of a number of years of job preparation.
"One of our tasks is to organize a technical and legal specialist help commission.
The commission has so far processed five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For now, only those of the last three countries mentioned have come forward,” Mikulka adds.
Not long ago, Australia’s success had a global impact as it was the first to essentially expand its marine dominance.
However, so did New Zealand – the seabed area awarded to it by the commission last week is 1.6 million square kilometres, almost six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of pains for their study.
The profit to be derived from the use of the seabed will be, as promised, invaluable.
Other states are also slowly filing their applications.
They can do it up to ten years from the time they ratified the "Montego Bay Treaty".
Where the continental rim ends begins the region of the ocean floor declared by Treaty as "the common heritage of mankind".
Already here, no nation has an exclusive position.
The right of exploitation in these areas is administered by the Treaties established by international institutions.
“The seafloor, however, is no gold mine,” Mikulka says emphatically, adding “that its separate zones are legally and clearly restricted and its regime defined by contract.”
Czechs in the Pacific
And today, a part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is distributed with other countries of the then Eastern Bloc within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This was achieved in 1991 with a Treaty as investors the same as a few other states, states called "the pioneer investor".
It has the ability to explode in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is somewhat larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom there is rugged, it is something like a marine replica of the Tatras.
“An area of a total area of 75,000 square kilometers can be exploited.
The area is rich in polymetallic concrete deposits containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” adds Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian employee of the Division, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of that kind of concreteness.
It reminds us of a small potato or with a little fantasy, the Shem, which according to the legend revived the Golem.
During the release of the hostages the German special forces commando was at the site of action
To solve the hostage crisis the Egyptian government had asked for Germany’s help – the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special forces command was ready, but the operation was not carried out.
More and more details about the circumstances of the release of 11 European tourists in Egypt are becoming known.
According to the data of the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, the German special forces also participated indirectly in the rescue operation.
Therefore in the place of release were specialists of the German army as well as officials of GSG 9, aircraft squadron of the federal police, of the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation and experts in the field of logistics of the technical charity.
As ministry spokesmen reported Monday night, German forces were not needed because kidnappers, realizing a violent release, let their prisoners go and escaped.
The government of Egypt accepted help from Germany to use it as support on the spot.
"Fortunately, that time did not come," a spokesman for the Federal Interior Ministry said.
On 19 September in southern Egypt the assailants had hijacked a group of travellers made up of 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian companions.
After the abduction in the desert region of southern Egypt, the hostages were deported back and forth in the border area between Egypt, Libya, the Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unknown until the end as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
In the meantime, the saved people arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were under the tutelage of the German embassy.
He didn’t say a word about the details of the release.
At first in Berlin there was no information about their return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild", 5 tourists and special forces have to return in Airbus from the German air forces and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The U.S. House of Representatives does not approve the salvation package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress failed with scant a huge $700 billion bailout package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell dramatically.
The U.S. House of Representatives voted 227 to 206 to reject the government’s package for saving financial markets.
Despite all the appeals of President George W. Bush and former politicians of both parties, it did not reach a majority for the program with which the disorder in the financial markets should be limited.
With dramatic action desperate advocates had still tried to convince critics to accept the huge $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, the leader of the Democratic negotiations, had asked deputies to take a vote, although the plan is not as popular.
“It’s hard to get political approval to avoid something that has not yet absolutely happened,” he said.
Already during the vote the Dow Jones fell to more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The cause of that was investor concerns that the state bailout package might fail.
He rested at the end of the vote and after the failure was made public, he fell again.
Experts have other serious turbulence in international financial markets.
To get the program into effect, both the House of Representatives and the Senate must approve it.
The organizers record the increase in the number of reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German travel organizers:
According to one study, the sales volume of travel bookings for the coming months increased compared to last year – even the winter season by more than 30 percent.
According to a study, despite the weakened conjuncture the desire to travel of the Germans remains as before.
As Germany’s travel association (DVR) in Berlin reported on Monday, with travel bookings for the winter season travel agencies recorded sales volume that is 31 percent higher compared to the same period last year.
According to research from the GfK markets research institute, reserves for the autumn months had already risen in number.
Thus the sales volume of travel agencies in October was almost eleven percent higher compared to 2007, the DVR reported.
The basis of the results are GfK figures which are the information analyzed about the reservations in 1200 travel agencies and computed approximately for the entire market.
The data collected are the travel reservations made until the end of August 2008.
Because of the weakened course of the dollar especially trips to the United States are in high demand, the DRV reported.
In this case the number of reservations increased to almost a third.
The preferred destination points of Germans are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece but also the regions of Germany.
Especially organized trips are highly preferred, explains Klaus Laepple, the president of the DRV.
In view of the fact that energy and food prices increase, in this case travel expenses are "better calculable for the customer than during an individual trip".
Among other things, consumers can save money with early booking discounts or All-Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Also in the summer months the trips were well booked, so that the volume of sales compared to last year again went up - although according to another study the number of Germans who made a trip, comparing last year, went down.
My first Oktoberfest
Party hits under the open sky in the endless Spa, beer in one-liter jugs and famous people dressed in traditional Bavarian designer costumes.
A debut in a tent.
Susanne Kronzucker and I really don't have much in common.
She is blonde, the moderator on TV and wears a traditional Bavarian bespoke suit.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is already worn.
But there’s one thing that unites us: we’re barely in the tent, the photographers have already rushed towards us and filled their memory cards with the photos – it’s very flattering especially because I’m first at Oktoberfest.
That's how you make friends.
The traditional Bavarian cheap suits seem to fulfill their function.
Actually as a tourist at the Oktoberfest coming from northern Germany my feeling of well-being with a traditional Bavarian costumes to this day was still limited.
But after arriving at Teresa’s Prado everything is not so much.
Almost everyone wears traditional Bavarian suits or leather pants; none seem to be paying attention or feeling unpleasant - everything is absolutely normal.
Only my apron gets weird looks next to a banana stand in the chocolate.
A muniquesa draws my attention to my apron that was dressed in the wrong way: "the left side is single, half is the virgin, on the right side is engaged, behind is a widow."
Oh, God, now I'm buckled from the back on the left.
"It's okay," he says with a laugh.
The others don’t worry about many of the subtle methods of flirting and wear caps where it’s written “To drink to get dressed!” and show, without asking them, their knotted ass.
A young boy who behaves in an exhibitionist way is named Bob, he is from England and is also for the first time at Oktoberfest.
He looks "gorgeous", which he pronounces with a very long "o".
He tells me after he's put his pint-sized glass of beer next to him.
He put it right next to the fire hydrant, most think that's a garbage can.
So Bob is one of the famous people who know how to drink a lot.
The others aren’t very lucky and can’t consume as much alcohol.
Around eight o’clock at night, groups of toilets run around the party place and have to worry about poor drunks.
The toilets appear every time in a group - suddenly there are always four people who bring the covered andas from one tent to the other.
That works just like most visitors: They come sober, they come back drunk.
It is not seen who suffers from the degrees of breathalysm and is in the walks.
“They’re the ones who ‘can’t do it anymore,’ a health worker answered my question and disappeared in a tumult.
Accident victim identified by police
The 63-year-old pedestrian who died at the hospital after being struck by a vehicle in Essex County has been identified.
Carole Paulson, of Chelmsford Road in the city of Brentwood, was involved in the accident that occurred on Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon.
The woman was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of negligent driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Turkey broadens its diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey became a member of the European Union, the European powers were eager to penetrate the interior of this country.
In the eastern part of the Bosporus, perhaps only 20 steps inland Asia, lies one of the most interesting relics of disastrous imperial ambition.
Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in neo-Renaissance style.
At least, this is what the guides say.
The building is at the end of the platforms and has two towers in front, one for each corner, resembling a typical German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The building in your complex is a bit decadent.
But once the vault box office was over, there is no doubt what the greatness of the company was that this was the westernmost door.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German Anatolian-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a "latecomer" in the imperial game, had the ambition to dominate the Middle East through this railway that was curated up to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond in what is now Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during World War I.
Its railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
Because of the relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, it fell under the control of the United States.
British rule and when the forces advanced into Egypt, they pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
The news was bad for Hyderpasha station as well.
In 1917 an ammunition train exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources said it was sabotage.
Since then the station has decayed and remained on the margins of history.
But today, this railway, the gateway to Anatolia and all the eastern centres, serves – at least symbolically – to highlight Turkey’s willingness to broaden its diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party – the AKP – has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
There is now a new partnership policy.
The Turkish government maintains excellent relations with Israel and Syria, with both the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To assess the parameters of this new foreign policy, I climbed on a bunk bed and went to the Turkish capital Ankara, in order to visit one of the leaders of the AKP, an expert on foreign policy, Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a jolting trip, which produced the cadences of the ancient world in the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - a new city, designed to rule a new secular state, far from the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its clear Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus.
This has raised some suspicions in the West, and especially in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern stone-and-steel structure – built ad hoc – in a developing suburb, surrounded by half-built shopping malls and “power pies” where middle-class managers in business suits – men and women – meet first thing in the morning to agree/do business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician of almost any party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he still has a Blackberry.
“The aim of the party’s foreign policy is to re-integrate Turkey into its immediate vicinity.
The Cold War was an anomaly,” he tells me.
Turkey has been cut off in relations with its interior.
Today you have to look both east and west at the same time.
It is not a case if it is not towards one or the other.
You have to do both.
"But surely at some point," I ask, "Turkey might be forced to choose?"
"Turkey," he replies, "doesn't want to affront that choice."
He goes on to underline a point that almost everyone I have spoken to up to that point had recited to me almost by heart: the relations that Turkey has not only with the Middle East, but with the Caucasus region, and with the entire Black Sea, represent a benefit for Europe and the United States as well as for Turkey itself.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe in its complex can metaphorically assemble those railway lines that open up the world to East Asia and the Middle East.
Once again at Hydarpasha station, after a second sleepless night, my thoughts turn to the two German gentlemen, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had attended the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How much would they have been surprised to learn that Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East would, in large part, be in Turkey’s hands today?
And waiting at the terminal for the ferry that will take me back through the Bosporus, I remember that in those days Turkey was considered "the sick man of Europe."
So, there is not much doubt in what continent this fascinating country must claim.
Lives to Remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (esquela, September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the Choir.
As part of the musical project for the city, in the following year he founded his magnificent youth choir, Proteus.
It was supposed to be for those under 21, but by the time the Proteus sang its finale in 1979, several of us were finishing 20 – we just refused to give up the chorus.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological form-changing being) represented the will of the choir and the ability to perform any music presented to it, be it madrigal or Messiaen, whether unaccompanied or with a full orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by this youth choir was often surprising, always exciting, and it was all because of that man’s inspiration and enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant throughout the years.
Tod often told us to "let the music speak for itself."
He would say, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in the music.
You just have to sing!”
His wand was always absolutely clear and precise, though never imposing, nor too flowery.
Whatever the musical score, it always ended up on an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any driver should have been a gentleman, this is Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the last 40 years, I have reviewed more than 100 of their concerts and can honestly say that I have never, by any, been disappointed – otherwise, many times I have been inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and extreme personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, in his words, simply “sold one or two warhorses very well known all over the world.”
We'll be sorely missed.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
William Woodruff (25 September) states that "in 1946 he resumed studies in economic history at Oxford and in 1950 he won a Houblon-Norman research scholarship...at the same time he was studying for a bachelor's degree, a master's degree and a doctoral degree."
This is learned in a note by Woodruff’s author on Beyond Nab End, but it’s not entirely correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which time he completed a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
He spent the years between 1950 and 51 in the United States, enjoying a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard, and New York.
In 1953, he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to overlook this part of his career remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino in Facultad de Filología
"I recommend José Vicente Resino's exhibition "Flamenco y vida" because his black and white photographs, documentary style, are fantastic.
They caught my attention for their simplicity and for the force they transmit, always treating the protagonists with a lot of respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments.”
Second round for Honda's bestseller
In November, Honda will begin commercialization of the second generation of the Jazz.
If its predecessor already had a wide habitability, this new minivan presents an even wider interior space.
Added to all this are refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and allow you to save more fuel.
Evolution in the face of revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz presents a line very similar to the model that happens, the changes introduced in this minivan are numerous.
Among others, it is worth mentioning an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before analyzing the new model, it should be noted that this new Jazz comes six years after introducing the first generation to the market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than that used by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Jazz is less known, in other markets this model is a sales phenomenon.
This is the case of Japan, a country where the Jazz has been the most marketed car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
About one million units of the Jazz have been sold in Japan since its launch.
The second market has been that of the Old Continent, with around half a million units in six years.
However, Honda intends that this new Jazz will increase sales within the segment.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese firm marketed a total of 83,000 units of the Jazz, in 2009 estimates point to 100,000 cars, which would mean a growth of 17% in the European market.
Regarding the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 units of the Jazz since 2002, which represents 6.7% of total Honda sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, those responsible for the Spanish subsidiary expect to sell 2,000 units of the Jazz in a full year.
Precisely the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to greatly alleviate the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, those responsible for the brand expect to end the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, which is 4,000 less than in 2007, a decrease of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese firm also expects to reach 2% by 2010.
To achieve this quota Honda is confident in the arrival of another new model.
This is the Insight, a compact five-door hybrid – 4.37 meters long – that the Japanese company expects to market about 200,000 units a year worldwide.
By markets and according to the Japanese manufacturer’s estimates, 50% of the Insight’s sales will be produced in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be distributed between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is planned for the first months of the year, once its presentation is made in January in Valencia.
With respect to the first generation, the new Jazz grows in all its dimensions.
Its length amounts to 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the wheelbase to 2.50 meters, which is an increase of five centimeters.
The height, however, does not vary and remains at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, the interior habitability also grows.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the inclusion of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of the fuel tank in a central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz.
Likewise, the capacity of the trunk - which has a double bottom system - amounts to 399 liters, 19 liters more capacity of the trunk of the first generation.
It should be noted that these measures are of the version with the 1.4 engine, since the capacity of the trunk of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to exterior elements such as rear LEDs or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - is an improvement in access to the rear seats.
The doors that give access to the second row have an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
The engines in this second generation of Jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model will have two gasoline engines of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both mechanics incorporate i-VTEC technology that achieves lower consumption, emits less carbon dioxide, achieves excellent mechanical refinement and at the same time achieves high torque throughout the engine regime.
The first 1.2-litre engine achieves a power output of 90 horsepower at 6,000 revs with maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 turns.
This propeller - which in previous Jazz reached 78 horsepower - has an expenditure of 5.3 liters and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
With respect to the previous engine, which in the previous generation achieved 83 horses, it now has 100.
This Jazz 1.4 of 100 horses achieves a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and 128 grams of CO2.
The 'bee car' that prevents collisions
To advance the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan has been inspired, this time, by nature, specifically, by bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, based on the flight of bees, prevents accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C which is the first step in collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technical Center have developed this tiny robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, General Manager of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Brand Management Development, the BR23C is presented as an extension of Nissan’s four-area Safety Shield.
This robot is intended to reinforce the collision-prevention capability of the brand’s vehicles.
During their flight, each bee creates its own personal oval-shaped space that closely resembles the Nissan Safety Shield.
But the most important thing is the compound eyes of the bee, able to see at an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, allowing it to fly without interruption within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, the engineers designed what they have called a laser locator (Laser Range Finder).
It detects obstacles up to two meters away within a 180-degree radius in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to an onboard microprocessor that immediately results in collision prevention.
“The moment it detects an obstacle, the tiny robot will mimic the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by turning its wheels at right or greater angles to avoid collision.
The biggest difference with any existing system is that the avoidance maneuver is entirely instinctive.
If it wasn’t, the robot wouldn’t be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Lab and lead engineer on this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot deflect up or down, or diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to turn its wheels and not in infinite directions and ways like bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot avoids collisions.
“This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and act on that data.
It doesn’t require saving information or intuitive logic from previous maneuvers, so it can run continuously with just a couple dozen KB of memory.
This may come as a surprise, but we’re not talking about gigas of memory, or even megas.”
This is the first step in developing new instant collision prevention technologies, a technology Nissan predicts will be introduced to standard cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than the variety of lithium ions.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination avoiding obstacles on the way.
Tremble before you mortgage
It must be recognized that the US Treasury Department, in addition to having a lot of liquid to make injections, is not lacking in ingenuity.
Faced with the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on junk mortgages in banks of questionable solvency, they have created an entertaining and informative game for the browser: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
I mean, the 'Bad Credits Hotel'... or the mess.
The gloomy aspect of this accommodation and especially of its receptionist is to think once, twice and up to three times if it is time to ask for a credit.
And most of all, where to do it, which is probably your goal.
True, it has useful information, but little detail.
It’s more of a page for teenagers than a site for everyone.
What happens if the game is completed?
There is a dream room inside the hotel.
It's something, because of buying a better house we don't even talk about...
Morgan Stanley sells stake to Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into its capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, which will disburse nine billion dollars to acquire 21% of its capital, a news that has been accepted with a sharp fall in its stock market.
A week after discovering an interim deal, both banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9% of the Morgan Stanley common stock at the unit price of $25.25, or $3 billion.
The agreed price is less than 19% of the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the purchase of convertible securities, ensuring a 10% return and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley specified that the global operation would be carried out on the basis of a price per unit of measure of 29 dollars, or 28% above its current exchange rate.
The Morgan Stanley stock was still down 6.79 percent at $23.07 each at 17:00 GMT.
“This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to bank holding status,” said John Mack, the group’s CEO.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which would have to allow him to diversify his activities but he passes it off under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street’s biggest names to behave much more cautiously than before.
The modalities presented last Monday also show that the agreement has been modified during the last days: last Monday, Morgan had announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japanese for almost 8.5 billion dollars.
“A week ago,” MUFG CEO Toshihide Mizuno explained in Tokyo, “we thought the stake would have been made up of ordinary shares only.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we have wanted to minimize the risks and hedge.”
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below their book value.
And the operation will result in a dilution of about 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred securities into ordinary shares within a year if they are sold at more than 50% above the conversion price, or at $47 or so, for a given period.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital provided by MUFG will allow it to take investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokeswoman for the group declined, however, to elaborate on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should show a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan said it had greatly eased its balance sheet since late August.
The past few weeks were grueling for the group, which saw its stock market price drop by half while the cost of security against a risk of defects on its debt took off.
This cost fell last Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the other sole “survivor” of the big Wall Street investment banks after the bankruptcies of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the Merrill Lynch buyout, announced it had raised $15 billion, in part for Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s group.
Rafael Correa in Quito on Monday.
Refound the republic around 21st century socialism.
This is the common project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, after the example of his colleagues and friends, he is the third to put to the vote a project for a new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since 64% of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, according to official results that referred to 80% of the votes.
According to these results, "no" obtained 28%, 7% of the votes were null votes and 0.7% were blank votes.
For the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to win half of the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two exit polls and a tally by a non-governmental organization had announced a broad “yes” victory, estimating it at between 63 percent and 70 percent.
Rafael Correa had also claimed on the night of Sunday to Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The "Constitution triumphed overwhelmingly", he had assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians who head the government of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
Thus, Rafael Correa has been congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also by his Chilean colleague Micaela Bachelet.
The elections, which will take place in complete calm, according to the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a text of 444 points that consolidated the " new socialism " defended by the president.
The draft Constitution implies the increase of the power of the State over the economy, reserving for it the " development planning " of a country that lives essentially thanks to the extraction of oil by foreign companies and thanks to foreign currencies sent by its émigrés.
Led by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants reinforced powers to the head of state, who will be able to make up to two consecutive terms of four years each and will have the possibility to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa already announced that he would use this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the president began to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It finally provides for the interdiction of the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 abducted people have been released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions kidnapped ten days ago in the desert arrived unharmed in the Egyptian capital after being released on Monday afternoon.
By morning, they had been released by Egyptian special forces in Chad.
They all looked good on arrival at 3.30pm aboard a special aircraft at the Al Maza military base, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
Helicopters immediately transported them to the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, for medical tests, so they have not been able to speak to the press.
"They are in good health" and "no ransom was paid" to the kidnappers, Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garana said at the airport.
On 19 September, these hostages fell into the hands of 35 unknown kidnappers while enjoying an off-road safari in a desert area at the foot of Mount Ouanat, in the confines of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and have since moved from one zulo to another.
The group consisted of eleven tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the travel agency Aegyptous, in charge of the organization of the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, carried aboard two helicopters, had launched the assault overnight before dawn.
"An exchange of gunfire occurred, and killed half of the kidnappers, the others have fled," said the official, who remained anonymous.
According to him, 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "lightning" unit were sent to Sudan, where they were supported by German and Italian commandos.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini mentioned in Belgrade the role played by secret agents and members of the Italian special forces.
"We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and effectiveness of our men in the secret services, the special forces," he said without going into details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted an SUV on board which the kidnappers were on, killing six, including the Chadian chief and arresting two.
He also stated that they were connected to a Darfur rebel group, the Sudan Liberation Movement-Unity (SLA-U), an assertion immediately denied by this group.
Letters - Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of the fait les manchettes culture and occupies the current electoral campaign.
Better this way.
But a section of our cultural life is always forgotten.
Who will rise up to denounce the wretched sums given to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or starving national historic sites?
Which politician will dare remind the federal government to neglect its monuments and heritage buildings?
Why don’t we have true laws that effectively preserve our heritage as in Canada and Quebec?
Did you know that the French government dedicates three and a half million euros for the restoration of only Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
In the United States, it is written in its Constitution that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage has to be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, and all of this, in concert.
In Quebec, in the Federation of the Societies of Quebec History, at least 40,000 benevolent people grouped into 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned to search history, preserve with little money piles of private archives and preserve archaeological remains.
It is these who are often the guard dogs of our heritage, who protest with energy and desperation when promoters and managers throw their bulldozers at our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
For when, a monument to history and heritage?
The governments of the Netherlands nationalize a part of the Fortis Bank.
The States of the Netherlands - being the first in Europe - will help with a nationalization of the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis that is in trouble due to the effect of the mortgage crisis of the North American market: the three countries will support in total with 11.2 billion euros to this financial and insurance institution that also has businesses in Hungary.
This weekend the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held high-level consultations with the president of the European Central Bank and the head of economic competition at the European Commission.
The Fortis Bank is the first to suffer the crisis of the euro area in the framework of the international financial crisis that has been occurring in several waves more than a year ago, therefore the decisions taken with respect to the Bank, in a sense can be considered as precedent.
According to the decision taken early Sunday, the three states will buy about half (49 percent) of the property owned by the Bank in their area.
The Bank will surely sell a part of its business, including mainly the activities -mainly insurance- bought last year from the Dutch ABN Amró.
Fortis stocks started a sharp decline last week and by the second half of the week there were already significant signs of crisis at the institution.
However, analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees this Bank is too large to allow it to fail.
Shares of the company fell 12 percent on Friday alone, the lowest point in 14 years.
Since January the value of the shares has declined by more than two-thirds.
Looking at current stock prices, the total value of the group’s capital in the market is around 14 billion euros, but according to the company’s executives this is not real.
The Bank’s management blamed the sharp decline in Fortis shares on US market insecurities in connection with the approval of the US $700 billion package plan.
On Monday, stocks showed a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the bank’s new CEO.
The Bank also looked for private investors, but so far no one has given a concrete offer.
The Belgian government had previously assured investors that they had nothing to worry about, they would not lose their money.
Among the Bank’s clients so far there was no panic, they did not invade the bank offices to withdraw their money.
El Fortis has its own branch in Hungary and has also bought leasing companies.
Fox in the chicken coop
In the United States, life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract when they see drug purchase data.
Privacy policy specialists fear that the market for personal data will become uncontrollable.
"There are personal data protection programs, which link the use of prescription data in all cases to the approval of the given person.
It must be in independent hands, because if not, "we trust the chicken coop to the fox" - quotes the Washington Post Richard Dick, designer of the program to track prescriptions.
Insurance companies make the insurance price and indemnity amount depend on the client’s health status and if they believe the risk is excessive, they simply don’t make the contract.
Before, they sent the client to medical control and signed the contract with him knowing the result of the control.
Ten years ago Dick invented a much cheaper procedure: with the customer identification number he easily gets from pharmacies the list of drugs purchased in the last year and a half and the program itself draws the conclusion about the diseases and state of health of the customer.
For example, if you consistently take large doses of cholesterol-lowering pills, it indicates that the level of fat in your blood is virtually incurably high, thus you are immediately placed in a higher risk category.
Numerous versions of the program circulate, some even establish a number of risks, so that the insurance company in addition to the administration hardly has anything to do, although there are small difficulties in this regard.
Among the disadvantages of the program is for example that some medicines are multipurpose, for example certain substances serve both to treat headache and for heat waves and even as antidepressants.
The latter is a major risk-increasing factor for insurance companies while the former do not.
Special companies were set up to consult and process these data, which, before acquiring the necessary information from pharmacies, ask for the patient’s approval.
The authorities already force them to this, although they were not fined for negligence until now.
Some companies have recently also developed laboratory test results and linked them with drug consumption data to obtain more accurate information about the patient’s health status.
More and more companies have access to this data and simultaneously it is increasingly difficult to control its use.
There is an exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but it applies only to insurance companies and those who provide health services.
The bill that gives the right to control the specialized companies for the provision of personal data is already before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is insufficient: he therefore developed his program, which will require the person’s specific approval for the provision of his own personal data.
It is another matter that such a person cannot deny his approval, because otherwise the insurance companies will not sign the contract with him.
So the hens, in spite of everything, are exposed to the good will of the fox.
Global menu of Marseille
EU doubles trade with India
As the European Union and India are reciprocal trading partners, this issue in addition to the other mostly global issues dominated the agenda of the ninth summit.
Today there will also be a Franco-Indian summit, to deal mainly with cooperation in nuclear energy.
Although the European Union recognizes that India is a great democratic developing power that should have more voice and vote in international affairs but the member countries have not yet been able to come to a common denominator on whether they should support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
This issue has not been addressed at the ninth summit that began yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, President-in-Office of the EU, José Manuel Barroso, President of the Commission and Javier Solana, the main representative of foreign policy, received Manmohan Singh, Prime Minister of India with whom they reached an agreement to double in five years, that is, increase to more than one hundred billion euros, their commercial exchange.
Considering that between 2000 and 2007 the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an excessively ambitious goal.
They thus legally harmonized the existing twenty-six bilateral civil aviation conventions with India, so that air transport will also be able to fly in the future.
India until the end of 2009 wants to sign the free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up negotiations.
The aim is balance, because while the EU is India’s first trading partner, New Delhi is only ranked ninth among the Union’s trading partners.
The summit paid attention to global affairs.
Both sides condemned the Afghan and Pakistani situation and terrorism – all forms of the latter – and urged the convening of a UN conference.
The conclusion of the Doha round of trade liberalization was also urged, although both sides bear great responsibility for its failure.
The EU confirmed that it will stick to its energy and climate program, that is, until 2020 it wants to reduce pollutant emissions by at least twenty percent.
India also agrees with this, just as at next year’s climate conference a global agreement should be reached and greenhouse gas production should be cut by 50 percent by 2050.
They also wished to hinder the rise in food prices and supported the convening of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
Today the head of government of India will travel to the French capital, where - in a bilateral meeting - he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris is confident that French companies will receive orders worth 20 billion euros to build nuclear reactors.
According to the news agency, the agreement would be for a period of 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the international exhibition of the Frankfurt book.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.

He will be the undersecretary of the Ministry of cultural goods and activities Francisco Maria Giro to represent the Italian government at the opening ceremony of the Italian pavilion: Italy will be institutionally and effectively present with a point Italy - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will follow a meeting with the print in Room Struktur in Hall 5.0 of the Buchmesse: this will be the occasion to present numbers, trends and prospects on the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of the books of foreign authors progressively decreases over the total of Italian production, and in particular that for adults and adolescents.
Found the plane of Steve Fossett the millionaire disappeared a year ago
The wreckage of the plane of Steve Fossett, the millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, has been found.
The debris has been found on a 3000-meter high plateau in the Nevada highlands area of Mammoth Lakes on the California-Nevada border.
Inside the plane, there were no human remains.
Wood County Sheriff John Anderson has dispelled the remaining doubts: "The plane has been located, we have sent a squadron, and now we have the confirmation that it is typical of what Steve Fossett was flying on the day of his disappearance," he said in a statement.
No human remains have been found either on the plane or in the vicinity.
The billionaire, 63, was presumed dead in February.
The U.S. Office of Transportation Security (NTSB) has reported that a few hours after the sighting of the remains, a squad of investigators has been sent to identify the device: it is the Bellanca 8kcab, scattered since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett’s personal remains have been found by a couple near his Mammoth Lakes home.
These are two documents bearing Fossett’s name, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a sweatshirt.
The search for Fossett had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The millionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of firsts.
In 2002, by the sixth attempt, he had become the first Man to complete the turn of the world in a hot air balloon: two solitary weeks of flight.
Three years later he had made the turn of the world by plane and nonstop.
Among his records, also that for having flown to 15,445 meters di height, over the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don’t expect
An out-of-schema suv with an original and well-established design with defined lines and determined angles.
It is this, in short, Glk the last born among the "compact" off-road vans of the house of the star with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a window of novelty in this sector.
Own by the content outside the traditional, it will be unexpected and unconventional, the communication that will accompany the launch of the suv Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from next October 17.
The advertising campaign that will accompany the debut of the new car will launch an unprecedented mode of communication through a 3D advertising campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project with maxi-posters, articulated in three different phases, which will dominate the central street of Milanese shopping, Avenida Como, until November 15th.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic version and thanks to special glasses distributed on Avenida Como it will be possible to see the new suv in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, looking at the images will give you the impression that the car is coming out of the poster.
Successively, through the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, to be recomposed in a single image.
Without a doubt Mercedes with this advertising is trying to introduce something new in the stereotype of automotive communication.
Will this formula be able to capture the interest of future buyers?
Who are the Italian Hooligans?
In the Triveneto, the ban on access to sports events is played.
But who are those 150-200 girls and boys of whom Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has followed the Italian National for years and that until now, to tell the truth, had never created too many problems.
And they had never met the rival’s fans either.
The extraction of the group is from the right.
The promoters come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
To these from Sofia have been added a small group (few units, actually) from the Campaign and from Apulia.
They have three-colored flags where the city of origin of the militants appears: Saturday night they have been taken out so that they are not identified.
They are inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria they have found a group of true Nazi fanatics, those of the Levski.
The Figc had made available to the Italian fans 144 tickets for the match: all already with the names, so easily controllable.
And the minister of the interior had already controlled them all: among those who had left for Sofia there was none with a Daspo (prohibition of access to sports events) at that time, none who had been forbidden to frequent a stadium.
Four Italian fans, who had a history of stadium crime, have been refused the ticket and also the trip.
Now the interior ministry hopes to read the coming acts of the Bulgarian police to take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) for at least five years to fans who have been arrested or who have been identified in the disorders.
An international Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) that prevents frequenting not only the Italian stadiums but also those throughout Europe.
Our hooligans, they won't set foot in a stadium anymore.
Thankfully!
But now there is the fear of imitation: that to those few fifty, others may be added.
"We have to put out this fire immediately and not legitimize who behaves in this way," say the interior ministry.
Therefore, "eyes wide open" especially in view of Wednesday's National match in Lecce.
In Apulia there is also a small core of Ultras Italia holders.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, on Tuesday the Cams that can also count on a section of the Aise (external information and security agency, that is the secret service, which deals with the problems in the stadiums.
"Does Duce-Duce's choirs and arm raised during Mameli's anthem? In Bulgaria it is not a dare ...".
This is the thought (expressed in an unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, since a few weeks ago the director of the Observatory of the Ministry of the Interior (has taken the post that was formerly of Francesco Tagliente and after Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had been Trieste's head of public safety where there is a core of supporters of the group Ultras Italia, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a challenge to celebrate the Duce but yes, the behavior of those 150-200 fans has been shameful.
"I do not do the sociologist - adds the n.1 of the Observatory - the challenges are attributed in the countries in which the fact happens.
Until now this group had behaved well now we will see what has happened and we will take it into account for the future.
But let’s also talk about the whistles to the hymn of Mameli: also these are not a challenge, but if they allow neither are they of education.
