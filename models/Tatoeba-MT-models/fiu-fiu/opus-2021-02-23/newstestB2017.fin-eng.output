The 28-year-old cook was found dead in the Sanfranciscola shopping center.
The 28-year-old cook just recently moved to San Francisco was found dead at the local shopping centre's stairs this week.
The victim's brother says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his brother.
The body found at Westfield's shopping centre on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old Frank Galician Sanfranciscola, reports of San Francisco's law school.
According to the San Francisco Police Department, death is being investigated as a homicide.
The victim's brother Louis Galicia told the TV company ABC's KGO radio station in San Francisco that Frank, who used to work as a cook in Boston, had found his dream job as a cook in the San Francisco Sons & Daughters restaurant cooker six months ago.
The representative of the Sons & Daughters restaurant said that death was a shock for all of them.
"We're a small and close team like a family. We're sorry is big," says the representative.
Our ideas are at Frank's family and his friends' house.
Louis Galicia says Frank was living in hostels first, but he had finally settled his case.
"He found the apartment, and he had a girlfriend," he told Louis Galicia to the KGO Station.
Louis Galicia says she didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt her little brother.
"He was kind and bighearted.
His way of being with the family was to put food for all of us," says Louis Galic.
"He never wanted to argue with anyone.
He was a brother who went along with the power.
Despite all the misunderstandings in the world, he was an unsweet diamond that shined every day," he says.
All the people who know about the case are asked to call the San Francisco police clue number 415-575-4444.
Abductive junior doctors require new work struggles
The representatives of British junior doctors (there are the most specialist doctors in Finland) have invited their trade union and have requested permission for new work struggles in the dispute on the new employment contract.
The Committee on Junior Medicines (JDC), which represents British doctors (BMA), is asking for support from the beginning of September to its entire government for further efforts.
According to the JDC, ministers have not solved the problem of the agreement.
Junior doctors and medical students rejected the agreement with BMA at the vote in July.
58% of the voters rejected the agreement.
On Thursday night, the president of the junior medical committee Ellen McCourt published a letter to the members of the JDC on Twitter, in which he said that the government 'sobjectively' had a response to the issues which McCourt said led to the refusal of the agreement.
The letter reads: "In this light, the JDC Government has voted completely against the new draft treaty and calls for new formal negotiations on all of our concerns.
In response to the government's failure, the JDC Government has today submitted a formal request to the Government of the BMA in order to request authorisation for progressive expanding work operations from the beginning of September."
As a result of the controversy, junior doctors have already been at strike six times this year, including the first complete job stops ever seen in the history of the British public health system.
Johann Malawana, director of BMA’s junior doctors, resigned after the vote, because he did not accept the negotiated contractual terms recommended by BMA.
At the pre-voting meetings of BMA members, Malawana said that the agreement was good and that it should be accepted. 54 000 junior and medical students attended the vote.
After the vote, Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the agreement will enter into force and apply to English doctors.
Russia and Turkey: a foreign alliance?
It was a gesture that decided the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to reconciliate and finalise the eight-month word war and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin met his Turkish brother in his palace in the golden hall of Peter’s palace, I had a clear impression that Ankara had a greater desire for reconciliation.
The parties, yes, handed them,
But Putin's smile seemed thin, and he didn't drown much heat even with his own restraint.
On the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan repeatedly spoke of his "good friend" Mr. Putin, according to one report, five times.
I didn't keep my bills.
He also promised that relations with Russia would be even better than before the crisis.
The next day, a newspaper in our country wrote Erdogan that he was acting like nothing bad would ever happen.
I personally understood his zeal just the opposite.
But the continuous viley of Putin showed that the Russian head has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down the Russian battle plane at the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction to the time of the event was mad.
Putin strongly attacked Ankara and accused him of stabbing in his back.
The insult was even bigger because it came from a supposed friend.
Recovery of real trust will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
The general opinion of the Russian people has also changed since November.
For months, the media controlled by the state were subject to a thorough and aggressive campaign against Ankara.
But suddenly it seemed that the Turkishs were the cause of everything.
The most serious was the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan’s own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in areas under the control of Isis in Syria.
Erdogan has banned the charges strongly.
However, the official message received from Peter was that it was time to move forward.
After all, this meeting was organised only to allow Putin to receive an apology from President Erdogan.
So Russia could gain some kind of victory.
The benefits of proclaiming a harsh armor are clear.
Above all, Erdogan needs all potential friends after he was almost excluded from power in a failing coupon last month.
He has been clearly shaken by repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey.
There is also an economic impact on the agreement.
Russia's sanctions have hit Turkey strongly, particularly the ban on charter flights, as several million Russian tourists normally travel to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has collapsed by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, travel organisers and charter companies are surely going to care for relief when air transport can eventually be continued.
They're putting their faith in the late-song attack on the Mediterranean.
And even this week, the state television has predicted the price of fruit and vegetables to fall when the imports of Turkish agricultural products are allowed again.
"You traveled there, tomatoes back here," was a business magazine in Vedemost's article.
But the visit also had a greater political value for Moscow.
Ankara is mad at the west because it feels that the West reacted instinctly to the attempt to take over.
Without forgetting the old grudge of the progressive EU membership negotiations in Turkey and the involvement of Putin in matters. Putin, an enthusiastic one to take advantage of cool spaces and to worry about Turkey's ties to the west.
The Russian leader undoubtedly won the bonus points from Ankara when it expressed its support to the elected authorities after the coupling company.
This was self-evident to Moscow, who has had his own concern about the exchange of power.
Consequently, Russia and Turkey were able to give up the picture that one analyst described as a "External Alliance": two countries who experience being abandoned and disobediently targeted by the West are uniting their forces.
Despite public reconciliation, these two still have major disagreements.
The most important is Syria, where Moscow has created a picture of itself as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It is much to say that, after the initial negotiations of almost three hours, both presidents said at the press conference that they had not dealt with the subject at all.
The President of Turkey was discretionfully refusing to answer the question of national disagreements, while Putin emphasised them.
There is no clear consensus between countries on where they could seek consensus in Syria.
In view of the possibility of a full disaster caused by the NATO Member State Turkey when shooting down the Russian fighter, it is undoubtedly better that after months of open hostility, these two Heads of State are again even speaking.
Royal Bank of Scotland banks disappear from their customers outside Scotland
According to the Director-General of the RBS, the Bank’s activities outside Scotland will be reduced in such a way that it will provide only business services, i.e. back office services.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from its customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand initially joined the bank's global objectives.
The Bank had to reverse its objectives when it almost collapsed eight years ago and had to save it.
During that period, the Brandendistrategists have used RBS to protect other consumer finances.
It sponsored millions of pounds of international sports, e.g. Six Nations rugby and Wimbledon Master Andy Murray.
But now the priority has been seen to be the right way to release more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will remain available to Scotland’s customers, but it will not be used as a shorter RBS.
In England and Wales, all RBS names are changed to NatWeste, with the exception of the head office and the stock exchange list.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
In addition, there are smaller private banking brands that will gain greater weight, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during the presentation to customers and staff in Inverness.
He said to BBC Scotland: "RBS turns into a investment band and because we are now becoming a much more bank for different brands.
Since the bank itself became a global brand, RBS also became a global brand.
Now our efforts are no longer global, but local.
Each of these brands represents something very different in its own community, and our staff work with customers under these brands."
The RBS has already announced that it will stop sponsoring the Six Nations Rugby and has raised the profile of different brands in sport sponsoring.
"It is now the right time to turn into a bank containing different brands, because basically the question is how we can make the bank better for customers," says the Bank's Director General.
"Three years ago, it would have been very exciting if we'd said we'd be an excellent bank for our customers and put brands in place.
But the work we do and focus on the needs of our customers, instead of our own needs, has changed much.
We can bring those brands back, so I think it's time."
Frankie Dettori was riding the Prediletion to win at Newmarket and won 3,000.
The detour sprays the champagne after winning twice in Newmarket, which meant 3,000 wins for him.
Jockey Frankie Dettor secured his 3,000 wins in the British Championship series in Newmarket on Friday.
This milestone he reached by riding on his horse Prediletion twice the same night on the track of his own place. Prediletion is a horse trained by John Gosden.
The Italian Dettori, 45, is the sixth jockey that reaches this milestone on a steady track.
Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson have been able to do the same.
The three-fold masterjockey Dettor, who previously won at Ghayyar, says, "This is special.
My feelings are up because my family is here too.
I'm very glad this happened in Newmarket because I just got here 30 years ago.
The competition is not a major event, not a Royal Ascot, but a completely ordinary Friday night and a 20 000-person audience.
I'm relieved and I feel great humiliation."
Dettor accepts cheers with Prediletion after his victory
Two jockeys have reached a milestone at the front-end contest, and they are the champion of Richard Johnson and the 20-fold retired master Sir Anthony McCoy, who won a record career more than 4,300 times.
Lester Piggott, nine-fold Derby winner, 4 493 wins
"Frankie is one of the best jockeys of this time, and it is not a surprise that he was the one who reached this milestone, which only few have reached.
He's stylish and strong, but his tactical prosperity is what separates him from others.
He is a fantastic representative of the race, his enthusiasm, and his carnival have brought supporters to the species for years."
"I told Frankie in Epsom a few weeks ago that he would've won 6,000 races, unless he only competed on weekends and just in big races!
To be serious, Frankie's riding career in British races has been winning for almost 30 years, which has been great to follow.
He's a vivid person, which is good for British race, but, above all, he's an incredible jockey."
Frankie Dettor ventilated his accomplishment in a symbolic way by jumping down a drone from his horse's back.
"Frankie Dettori has been a model for the British race for two decades.
There's been a lot of uppers and lowers on the way.
He has won many big races, including his famous victory in Ascot in 1996 "Magnificent Seven", but he has survived an accident in flight and has been in the competition ban because of drug abuse.
When the competition ban ended three years ago, he had trouble starting, but he showed the glorious strength of the nature, showed his suspects and returned to his best.
And for a while, he is not going to end his career – Dettor has recently said that he wants to continue his career until at least 50 years of age."
Putin fired Sergei Ivanov
The Russian President, Vladimir Putin, suddenly resigned to Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin’s trusted insider for many years.
Ivanov, 63, has now been appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport Affairs.
According to the Kremlin Communication, President Putin decided to release Ivanov's duties as Head of the Russian Presidency, but no argument for resignation was provided.
Anton Vaino has been appointed as Deputy Head of Ivanov since 2012.
The persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
The persecution born in Tallinn in 1972 graduated from a respected Moscow National Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and has previously worked in the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he led the President's protocol department and the Government's office, reports the Russian-speaking website of Kreml.
The persecution thanked Putin for his appointment, saying: "I am grateful for your trust.
I believe that the most important task of the administration is to support your actions as Head of State, which means that you have drafts of law and to monitor how your instructions are implemented."
Putin said to the Russian television company on Friday that Ivanov himself had asked for a divorce and recommended persecution as his successor.
Are smiles real?
This transfer has caused Moscow a confusion.
Sergei Ivanov has long been part of Vladimir Putin's surroundings, and, like Putin, he also has the KGB past.
As Head of Administration, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
In the meeting with President Putin, the Russian State TV, both said Ivanov was withdrawing from his own request.
Despite the smiles shown to the cameras, the explanations convinc only few, particularly under the parliamentary elections.
Are you fired from some sort of power fight?
No one knows that yet.
Russia has been highly suspicious of the official argument that a man who is praised to be a president suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy.
On the Kremlin website, Ivanov's words to Putin, where he says: "It is true that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to give me the responsibility of this very complex and somewhat difficult work for four years.
Now I've been the head of the president for four years and eight months."
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Before that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, former member of the State Security Service of KGB.
When Putin was head of the FSB’s replacement federal security service (FSB) at the end of the 1990s, Ivanov was appointed his Deputy Chief.
When Putin came into power, he named Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
In time, it was thought that Ivanov might come after the second period of Russian President Putin, as the Constitution would have prevented Putin from being elected for a third period.
However, the mission went to another one of Putin’s neighborhood, Dmitri Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister, after which he returned to the President only three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds, a series of FBI investigators, star Thomas Gibson, got fired after he beat the producer.
Gibson was involved in a violent dispute at the scene last month in Los Angeles.
The series were produced by ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios reported fires in their joint communication.
Gibson, known as Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, had filed an apology on Thursday before he was informed of his resignation.
"We had creative differences.
I'm sorry this happened," he says in his communication.
Information on how Gibson's character is written out of the next series of FBI agents, will be published later, reports ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
Previously in the comedy series Dharma & Greg played 54-year-old Gibson has been involved in the series of its first production period, i.e. since 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds, and I have put on it my heart and soul for the last twelve years," says Gibson on Friday's release.
"I was hoping I'd see the show until the end, but it's not possible anymore.
I would like to thank all the manuscripts, producers, actors, our great group of production and the most important: the best fans of what a series could ever have hoped."
The 12th production period starts in the United States on September 28th.
The mysterious beaching of fish in the Banffian garden
Kevin Bain, who lives in Banff, has asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Bain suspects these 75 fish are windfish that have been immersed by the earth as a storm of roundstorm.
Bain, who lives 500 metres from the seashore, published a vision of the photo material in Periscope and hoped to receive a response to the appearance of these five-century fish.
The Queensferry bridge has now been connected to Fife
The project of GBP 1,35 billion is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the Queensferry overroad bridge to the northern deck and land bridge, which means that the bridge has now been connected to Fife.
It is the first of the four parts between the "citizens' threats", which are now almost ready around the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge share of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30 000 tonnes.
It contains 10 000 tonnes of steel and 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 pins.
The project of GBP 1,35 billion is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Office for Economic Affairs Keith Brown visited the country today and was one of the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
Brown says, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in building the Queensferry overroad bridge.
We are all witnessing a very significant step forward in building the bridge, with more than 30 000 concrete and steel used to build this bridge.
Despite massive size and weight, the construction of the bridge between the bridge and the bridge deck is a subtle operation that requires extremely precise installation tolerances.
The entire bridge cover is now around 79%, and the end of the cover is getting its concrete cylinder in Rosyth today, which means that the cover is ready to be put in place."
Michael Martin, head of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructions project, says: "The completion of the first bridge section is always a major urinary weapon in all bridge projects.
In this fantastic project, this proportion represents the top of the road and water building industry.
After the last part of the road deck was installed and attached to the North Tower Path, then we had to close the remaining north side (i.e. the countryside) gap.
This was done by pulling from the north to the land bridge 700 millimetres south.
This was a massive and, at the same time, a major accuracy operation.
Massive because the landscape has a length of 222 meters and a weight of approximately 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled up in about 3 per cent slope.
And accuracy demanding because the tolerances that the team had to follow were very small — only a few millimetres.
"I'm glad everything went well."
The Moelfre Bay Rescue Department tells us about the miracle of the three men.
In front of Anglesey, three men who were caught in the water of their fishing boat were saved as a miracle.
The Moelfre RNLI Maritime Rescue Station alarmed Friday at 13.20 local times the crew discovered an accident at the Moelfre Bay Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim in security while their boat continued to unhappyly travel without a pilot.
"We saw the boat wandering right next to them and imagined the worst," says Vince Jones, who was driving the Moelfre rescue boat.
"But by the time we got to the water, the strong winds had transported the boat away from them."
The local fishing boat rescued two of the men, while the third, 60 years old, was found exhausted in a seizure and without a lifeboat.
They were all taken to the coastal rescue boat and transported to the rescue station.
Vince Jones says, "It's a miracle that these three men who have been in charge of water are still alive and perfectly well.
There was an emergency fire alarm on the boat's engine, but for some reason, it had been removed from the man in time when he fell.
They really had luck on their way."
Pokémon Go hunting brings health and happiness
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
During the last decade, many have complained why teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but they prefer to stay inside and stare at their diamonds.
Pokémon Go makes people get out of the couch and move.
Originally, the time of the screen took only a TV view, then also came video games and the latest smartphones.
So it's great to notice that the technology and the foreign force do not exclude each other.
This, of course, refers to Pokémon Go. Pokémon Go is a game application with characters from the video game created in the 1990s (which later also made the drawing series, gaming cards and other accompanying products).
Like many popular cultural phenomena, it also slipped a little before the new game became available at the beginning of July in the United States, Australia and New Zealand.
In other countries, Lansera was delayed because of a huge interest that overloaded the servers.
Only in a few days, the number of users of the Pokémon Go game passed Tinder and was almost equal to Twitter.
So how's the game working?
Shortly reported players go out to search for pokémones on their smartphones, followed by GPS. Once you find the pokémo, it can be "valographed" (by phone screening) or "closed".
The viciousness has stalled a video game in his life a generation younger than that, and lifted the butts out of the couch.
In the United States, the game has significantly increased the number of steps that the "central person" takes a day.
Washington Post recently reported an app for the Apple Watch Cardiogram, which found in two days of the game's launch, that the number of people moving 30 minutes a day suddenly rose from 45% to 53%. Cardiogram follows 35,000 users.
The company does not know which users are playing Pokémon Go, it sees only the raw data of exercises.
Many public health campaigns in which people are encouraged to get out of the couch and to move for at least 30 minutes a day have evolved into deaf ears because the campaigns have been boring and their advertisers have seemed accidental.
However, the importance of exercise should not be reduced.
The probability of regularly mobile patients to suffer from cancer or depression is lower.
Sport helps to control weight, lowers blood pressure, prevents diabetes and brings a large amount of other benefits.
The finest thing about the Pokémo Go game is that it's gonna get people out to do something they enjoy.
In this way, it achieves three basic health supports — exercise, rainy air and sun and joy.
During the hunt, it is even possible to have new friends.
As usual, this phenomenon is the depleting cheerleaders.
And yes, someone can walk the door when playing.
What about it?
There's a breakthrough done.
For even though smartphone applications such as Fitbit had already been able to monitor your activity earlier, they did not allow any reason to move, as Pokémon Go does.
The novelty disappears, and the use decreases in time.
But with the success of the Pokémons, more games are needed to link applications and virtual reality to activity in the real world, which increases the exercise and improves their fitness and health.

Simone Biles grabbed gold in a multiplayer of women's craftsmanship.
Forget the pressure.
Forget jumping.
Simone Biles is immune to all of them.
Dynamic jumps.
It's annoying.
The jaws are shaking in the permano.
Excellent in everything.
And now, finally, the Olympic Winner.
On Thursday, the 19 - year - old multiplayer won the championship of the multiplayer and grew a difference between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympics lights bowl.
His total point 62.198 was clearly better than the "Final Five" team with Aly Raisman and the Russian bronchimital Aliya Blackfina.
On Thursday 2016, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, the US Simone Biles is present at the end of the individual competition for female telecommunications.
The party became the fourth consecutive and the fifth American woman of all time, who won the multiplication championship, thus strengthening his reputation as the best or even the best of all times.
Biles squeezed into tears when his total final score came to sight and his long way to this moment ended.
Achieving the species will lead to completely new dimensions and raise him to the same class of other superstars of sport, such as Michael Phelps:
The party has been completely overwhelming in its species for the last three years. He has won 15 World Championship Medals, of which 10 gold, and he has earned them with so ambitious and accurate programs that in 1984 the Olympic Winner Mary Lou Retton called him "the most powerful factory in all time."
There was one last competition left in Brazil, first and foremost between Biles and his own burden and the burden of overwhelming expectations, not even between Biles and the rest of the world.
To return home to Texas Spring, less than tough gold medals would be disappointed.
The United States Simone Biles (in the left) and Aly Raisma hug after winning gold and silver in the final Thursday of the individual competition of women in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 11.8.2016
The party won the first gold medal on Tuesday as a point on i of the country team coordinated and now retired to Martha Karoly's homework.
Although Biles claimed that he has never thought of anything before when he was long at the top, it is not entirely true.
A part of his permanto program, which contains the voltage series known as his master card, is adapted to Latin music, which may well be heard on the streets outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
When his grandparents were already adopted, and coach Aimee Boorman's mother found it has become a force character. Boorman found a girl when he was on a daycare tour at the gym where Boorman trained.
He has not lost any competing competition since summer 2013, and the winning pipe is likely to continue as long as Biles wants it to continue.
Despite the fact that Blackfina got into a small lead in two rounds, it was like cloth.
There was a boom and a permanto where Biles was a defending world champion.
He got back to the lead after he got 15.433 points from the boom and crowned the final result from the permano at 15.933 points.
Raisman gracefully huged him when they waited for the final points — which was just formality — and tears began to appear around Biles’ red, white and blue glittering color, when the dream written in his playbook came true.
Raisman's performance was a small revamp for a four-year-old competition when he first split the third place but then lost the bronze to Blackfina in the reverse.
This time, 22-year-old team leader, which the Americans call the team "Mom" was clearly above Blackfina.
He sent air kisses to the public after his permanto program, and he thus became a winner from the defeat position, which sometimes seemed uncertain.
As far as Biles is concerned, this 19-year-old tweet has now a whole new meaning:
The police say three music in the car, listening to the victim of a serial killer.
Two women and one 12-year-old girl were killed in Phoenix's most destructive massacre for ten years, and the victims were sitting in the car and listening to music when they were shot, says the police report published on Thursday.
According to the authorities on June 12th, a car parked in the street was shot in Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah.
The shooter stood on the side of the car, where he shot eight shots with a handgun and then escaped with another car, says the press.
The police suspect that the third-death was not a robbery because the assailant didn't take his purses and the 2,900 dollars found in the hall of another adult victim.
Officer of Phoenix, Sergeant Jonathan Howard says the police are now investigating whether the death is connected to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have been killed and two wounded in nine attacks, mostly in the areas of the Latin American population within four months.
"It is common to the events that they have occurred in residential areas in front of their homes," Howard told the CBS subsidiary KPHO of the television and radio company earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have several vehicles, including the late 1990s, brown Nissan, the late 1990s, black BMW and white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Scientists do not want to reveal what led them to concluding that the attacks relate to each other and that they do the same.
Ellis, 33, was taken to the hospital for his injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died immediately at the scene.
The eyewitness told the police that the triangle had often sat in the car listening to music.
In addition, the police published a press release on the unloaded shooting of an open truck only half an hour before the triple death, and the shooter is believed to be the same in both cases.
Scientists found shells and captured bullet fragments from the car seat and engine space.
The mother of a 6-year-old boy with microchephalia, "Things become better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto likes singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
However, unlike most of the other aged friends, Edmund has microchephal, i.e. the birth of a child, due to his mother Elizabeth Picciuto's genetic disorder, which he was not aware of when he was pregnant.
"When I first brought Edmund home, my first thought was that I couldn't make it.
I can't make it.
I didn't commit to this.
What is not true at all – of course you are committed to it," he says.
Elizabeth and his husband, Vincent, were told that maybe Edmund would never recognize them or possibly survive at all.
Some of the doctors went so far that he suggested that a child be placed in the institution’s care.
"My first reaction was that I didn't think there was any more of this practice," says Picciuto.
Edmund walks with the roller.
Edmund sat down and began a contamination only when he was three years old, and he still doesn't talk.
But he's slow in his own pace.
He walks with help and he drives a bike.
He's happy to play with his two brothers and he loves singing.
Elizabeth presents the signet Edmund's invented, which means "laul to me."
"We teach him a sign language," Picciuto told the CBS News.
However, it does not only mean a normal sign language, but it also includes the fifty figures made by Edmund itself.
Microchephalia may have a variety of diseases: hereditary, as in the case of Edmund, or during pregnancy virus infections such as tuberculosis or zikavirus.
There's a great variation in the symptoms and forecasts.
It is still too early to assess how it affects the lives of zicavir.
Picciuto recalls the emotional storm caused by the uncertain future.
"I kept working, "what happens to us,
"what happens to us?"
He still doesn't know.
"I haven't asked for a prophecy in a long time, 'cause I don't think anyone can give it."
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for mothers whose children have birth defects caused by zicavir.
"Things get better.
There's a lot of things to be done.
You love your child, and your child loves you."
Rare rains and floods caused massive rescue operations in Louisiana and Mississippi states
On Friday, the governor of Louisiana declared the emergency situation because of the harsh roads and the widespread floods, and more rains in the state are still expected on Saturday.
According to the national weather service, several rivers in south-eastern southern southern southern southern southern southern Mississippi flooded over their umbrellas and spread to a wide area as a result of strong harder waterings.
Governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, tells us that the state authorities are constantly in contact with local authorities and that the assistance is already on their way to flood areas.
The informant of the National Security and Emergency Governor's Office Mike Steele reports that the Agency receives requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandshoes.
According to Steele, only the county of Tangipahoa has asked for dozens of thousands of sand bags.
The flood warning will remain valid until Saturday in most parts of South Lousia.
According to the communication given by the weather service, water may be reached between 76 and 27 mm more.
The flood warning was given in South Alabama on Friday when the rains continued in the Mobile region.
During the weekend near the Comite River, near the Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both of which in Louisiana, are predicted to rise up to the record heights.
According to the weather forecaster Alek Krautmann, many houses on the rivers may be flooded under the Baton Rouge suburbs.
In addition, he says that floods in the Ascension County are a threat, for the rivers flooding slowly to Lake Maurepas.
In Liverpool Louisiana, the Tickfaw River flowing south of the Mississippi State was on Friday at 9 a.m. already higher than ever.
Rescue work continued in the Amite and Wilkinson counties in the southern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and grandson, were past Friday near Gloster, among those who were saved.
Hansford, 62, says that the Beaver Creek River, which is usually over 120 meters from his house, rose rapidly during the night.
The other stepfather who lived near had warned him.
"We got up, and the water came with a constant bait," says Hansford.
"It touched my belt."
The wife had told Hansford that she had never seen the river rise so high during the 48 years she has lived in the region.
Hansford tells me that he himself and his family members have injuries, and he himself is the only swimming skill of them.
The rescue workers had saved all three large military trucks and taken them to the fire station in Gloster, where they kept protection on Friday.
Weather forecaster Krautmann says that floods are rapidly spreading widely as the hard drives continue, and the authorities are already considering evacuation orders.
He tells about the information from Livingston’s close observer that between midnight and Friday morning there had been almost 350 mm raining.
Krautmann says the soil washed strongly after the rains that began on Wednesday.
The authorities tell us that due to the flooding of harsh roads and streets, the inhabitants of the county of Tangipahoa had to be saved from their homes and school hours had to be canceled in five school circles.
A member of the city council of Tangipahoa had told CBS's subsidiary WWL that there were 200 homes under the flood.
The inhabitants had been evacuated into two churches, but now the flood has evaded them both.
The head of the county, Robby Miller, tells us that the authorities saved 72 people and seven pets who had been imprisoned by the flood.
Evacuated people have opened shelters in Amite and Hammond's cities.
"They can return to their homes when the water starts to retreat," he says.
In the town of Hammond, in the district of Tangipahoa, almost twenty streets had to be shut down because of the flood, and the inhabitants were offered sandbags to try to prevent water from getting into their homes and their businesses.
"The last time we had a great flood in March," says Lacy Landrum, a member of the city government.
"This flood seems like a similar thing to me."
In Mississippi, the rains continued on the Gulf coast of Mexico, says Rupert Lacy, the rescue director of Harrison County.
Lacy tells us that on Thursday, a house undergoing a coural flood was reported, but no one had come to the attention on Friday so far.
The Shopper Value Foods store manager, Keith Townson, says he's been living in the Amite area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before, and more rains all the time."
Multiple bullets of 6-year-old Mahaj Brown survives the shooting incident in Philadelphia.
According to the police, a six-year-old boy in Philadelphia has been shot, who's already another six-year-old, who's been shot in the city this week.
The grandparents of the child said on the CBS Philadelphia channel that the boy was Mahaj Brown.
According to the grandparents, the boy had several shooting wounds in the nipples, legs, arms and stomach, but he was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He got many hits, his little body was full of bullets," said his son's grandmother Delores Melendez to the television company.
"I can't believe this is true."
The boy is in critical condition at the hospital, and he has been subjected to several surgery.
The family tells the TV company that they think the boy's gonna make it.
He was starting his first class at local secondary school.
Brown was one of the four people who were shot in the town of Germantown.
Two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man were also targeted for the shooting.
The second 29-year-old status was reported to be critical and the rest of the two were stable, reports CBS Philadelphia.
According to the telecom company, the child was found at the front seat of the car at a critical position next to the 29-year-old.
Two other victims weren't in the car, and the police are now investigating whether one of the wounded men could be a shooter.
The police investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it was a crossfire between many armed men.
The site was filled with assault-type shells, which originated from various assault weapons.
"It is absolutely clear that this was a ongoing battle.
There were shells on both sides of the walkway.
There have been several armed fighters in place and they have been actively involved in the shooting," said Chief Officer Anthony Ginaldi of Philadelphia.
The bullets also hit many houses and vehicles in the area.
No arrests have been made, and the police are going through surveillance videos.
The second victim of the shooting in the city this week was a 6-year-old girl whose hand was hit by a mistrust when he played on Tuesday in front of his home in West Oak Lane.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
This is what I call the Olympic Team for Women's Military Forces, and there are more than one reasons.
Firstly, I have been in every summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been as overwhelming as it is now.
Secondly, three of these teams, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, have been inspiring many colorful girls.
The composition of the team, complemented by Jewish Aly Raisma and Catholic Madison Kocia, will make everything proud.
The team's finally representing America.
It has also strengthened the visibility of black and Latin women at the top of the species.
For the last four years, the best female winner has been African-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were in positions 1 and 2.
This is awesome.
In the previous Olympics, Gabby Douglas became the surprise winner of the races, and all America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of the three-fold world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, and the surprising and mastery craftsmen.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth consecutive American who won gold in the multiplying of women’s individual competition.
Teammate Aly Raisman won silver.
These views are at the top of the species, but they do not seem the same throughout the country in the working hours.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same tracks as Aly and Madison to form the Olympic Team.
They are the last five (Final Five), because the next Olympic team will have only four strongmen, and this is Marta Karoly's last year as coach.
The fact is, however, that telecommunications is a valuable sport and the gymnasts are mostly practising in private mobile sports, which are maintained by their parents. Elders pay for training costs, spaces, travels, performance suits, competition fees, hotel fees (coachers, gymnasts and family members) etc.
Most of the volumes of net sales are located in prosperous residential areas that can support the operation.
Telecommunications forces are taught in these clubs, and this means a costly and long-term commitment for the families of the gymnastics.
Simone Biles Coach Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez Coach Maggie Haney have both trained species enthusiasms since they started the ferry.
We need to arrange a cheaper and better available workforce teaching for those countless young girls whose enthusiasm has been raised by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I set up my own power force fund 20 years ago.
My organizations in Harlem have offered a free or affordable opportunity for the workforce sports for more than 15 000 urban young people (mostly black and Latin Americans), and some of these young people have attracted national and international championships.
In September, we will expand our activities to my home town of Detroit so that we can offer high-quality telecommunications for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this awesome Olympic race.
The power, diligentness and coordination of the body will be developed by the work, discipline and determination of the work.
This combination brings sustainable benefits throughout life and supports good health and success in school and working life.
This team has attracted enthusiasm to thousands of young girls, who now want to start the craftsmanship, and that is absolutely awesome.
Participation in a sport is very important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thank you for Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madiso's real "girl power" that you showed in winning the Olympic gold, and for motivating so many different backgrounds of young girls to start their way to prosperous, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal and prepared for new strikes.
Ministers wished to decide to contest the changes to wages and working conditions by accepting the renewed trade union with the BMA (British Medical Association), but 58% of the junior doctors who voted in the vote rejected the proposal.
In July, Minister of Health Hunt told me about the plans to obtain an agreement by force and said that the British Public Health System (NHS) is "no one country" and that all further delays are harmful to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors are moving to a new agreement that contains changes to night and weekend work practices in order to improve health care insocial times.
Mr Ellen McCourt, president of the Committee on Junior Medicines, said last night, "Junior doctors are still very prepared for the proposed agreement, which is a particular fear that it will accelerate the current labour crisis and that it will not treat all doctors fairly.
It is only eight weeks before the first doctors are transferred to the new contract, so now we have to move forward, because the time is running out.
BMA has been trying to solve the dispute by speaking, but the government has unwillingly and sometimes not responding to any kind of discussions.
Even though Jeremy Hunt made a promise last month that his door was always open.
Jeremy Hunt must now act, revoke the implementation of the agreement and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If this is not the case, junior doctors will be ready for new work fighting measures."
At the end of April the previous strike postponed almost 13,000 routine measures and 100,000 reception periods when nurses and consulting doctors were asked to support strike doctors.
Ministers wished to conclude the dispute on the changes by a renewed agreement with the members of the UK trade union representing doctors.
The trade union BMA wants a better weekend salary for 54,000 junior doctors to be involved in the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, the CEO of NHS employees, insisted on junior doctors that they wouldn't take up new strikes.
Mortimer says: "Acts of work are very little or nothing, but they create pressure on teams and services already operating at the extreme borders and cause concerns, anxiety and disruptions to patients, care staff and their families.
For the past two months, we have had negotiations with the Committee on Juniors, and, together with the Ministry of Health and the other parties, we have welcomed their concerns about the role of the supervisor and the uncovering of the misconducts.
Workers were hoping that the continued positive commitment to other important subjects – such as development, flexibility in education, post-training training, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, educational leaves and gender pay gap in the care sector – was a sign of how serious workers, health education in England and the Ministry of Health want to comply with the agreements concluded with BMA in November, February and May."
A medicinal product costing about 2.40 € per day may reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are receiving an approx. 2.40 € per day when the authorities recommended that it be given to more people and for longer-term use.
The anticoagulant ticagrelor reduces the risk of new heart attacks in patients with cardiac disease.
This medicine is given already 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of stroke or new heart attack.
The NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence), which is part of the British Public Health System (NHS), has instructed that ticagrelor should be given for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
However, the NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence), which is now included in the British Public Health System (NHS), has instructed that ticagrelor should be given for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people are heart attacked annually, with a quarter of which a heart attack recurs or a stroke.
The cause of heart attacks and strokes is a fat substance that accumulates the walls of the blood vessels, which produces plaques.
If the plaque breaks, it can generate a blood clot that prevents the blood from getting into the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the blood clot is dissolved, it can penetrate with the circulation and prevent the flow of blood into the brain, resulting in stroke.
The risk of a new seizure is greater in people who have received a heart attack at once.
The tikagrelor produced by British AstraZenecan, sold by the name Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of capsules.
The NICE guideline today recommends that ticagrelor be administered for the next 90 mg for 12 months, after which the dose should be reduced to 60 milligrams and also given aspirin twice daily for a further three years.
Professor Carole Longson, who evaluates the introduction of treatment methods (NICE), says: "Although effective treatment methods to prevent disease progression and the emergence of symptoms are available, up to a quarter of those who have had a heart attack receive a new seizure or stroke – often fatal consequences.
Fear of regeneration can very negatively affect the quality of human life.
We have received evidence that ticagrelor combined with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
The recommendation on temporary use of tigrelor increases the treatment options for thousands of people who benefit from it."
Since the information on the effectiveness and safety of tigrelor, especially with regard to the risk of bleeding, is limited if it is used for more than three years, the use of the treatment method is not recommended in the draft guideline.
In view of the climate of political correctness, the electoral victories in Muslim regions were prosperous
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was dismissed last year because of corruption, resulting in a report by the Government.
The climate of political correctness led to the closure of the eyes from a widely spreading election in Muslim communities, reveals the report of the Government published today.
Former Minister of Government Sir Eric Pickles strongly criticised the police, electoral observers and the city councils for obstructing their eyes from the electoral vineyards 'cause of the hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion'.
According to the former Minister of Regional Administration and the current anti-corruption force character of Pickles, the fear of voters for religious reasons was so bad that the police should have had the permission to set up guard chains outside of voting areas so that feared voters could have been protected.
He suggests that voters should present a certificate of identity in order to prove their identity when they come to the vote.
At the moment, the voter must only state his name and address.
In addition, the report proposes that fingers be affixed to an unsettled music after voting so that no one can vote twice.
Sir Eric says, we should protect more reporters.
He calls for better access of suppliers to the documents of the Government and to the decisions of informal boards and working groups.
"The aim is not only to prevent electoral vineyards, but also to combat fraud and fraud against economic interests, but to combat them more widely in local governments," he says.
The British Prime Minister asked for a report on the East London Tower Hamlet vote scandal.
Last year, the special electoral court ordered that the mayor, Lutfur Rahman, then, should be separated from his duties because of corruption and a number of illegal practices.
The Court considered that Rahman "invasively abused the religious emotion of his Muslim community and reduced his critics by accusing them of racism and Islamic opposition.
Rahman was said to use his campaign as the basis for the religious responsibility of every believer in Muslim to vote on him.
Even 300 of the voices were questioned or sincerely given in such a way that the person voted by pretending to be another person.
Sir Eric said that evidence of the facts of the facts was obtained from the whole country.
He expressed particular concern about the postal vineyard, where the high-level members of the Muslim community were told to pressure people to vote on the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric (in the picture) made a number of proposals for the cleaning of the voting system, including the request for a identity certificate at the place of vote.
The report states: "There has been evidence that some members of ethnic minority groups in vulnerable positions, particularly women and young people, have been pressured to vote in accordance with the will of parents, particularly in Pakistan and Bangladesh.
"We were concerned that... the government institutions had obstructed their eyes from such an act because of the hypersensitivity to the ethnicity and religion of "politically correct"."
Sir Eric has tabled 50 proposals for a clean system, including banning postal voting flags from political activists, to prevent the 'sound harvest'.
The report at issue of Theresa May also calls for more stringent inspections with regard to registration in order to prevent the use of the voting rights register for immigration and preference fraud.
Consideration of options where voters would be required to submit an identity certificate prior to the vote.
Putting your fingers in unsettled music after voting so that no one can vote twice.
Systemic audits to ensure the nationality of voters and the right to vote.
Setting a three-year limit to requests for automatic postal vote.
Prohibition of posted votes and postal letter envelopes from political activists.
The right of the police to establish security chains around the voting stations.
The amendment of the law so as to make it easier to raise the scare charges under the Representation of the People Act of 1983 on the extension of voting rights.
Prohibition of photography at voting stations.
Only allowing English to be allowed at voting stations (except Wales).
Enhanced training in order to ensure that staff monitors the rule that only one person can go to the castle at a time.
Sir Eric judges the London police hard and considers it "astonishing" that after the Tower Hamlet case, no criminal charges were filed.
"The Electoral Court dismissed Lutfur Rahman and his representative for the purpose of corruption and numerous illegal practices," he says.
"He was found guilty without any doubt, and the criminal evidence threshold was exceeded on many grounds."
He also criticises the ineffective "raising checks" of the departments responsible for the electoral lists of the City Council.
"The decision adopted by the court last year in the Tower Hamlet case was a wake-up," says Sir Eric.
"Our country is proud of its heritage as the mother of all parliaments, but this good reputation is threatened by the worrying and hidden election vineyards of some people and its denial."
The similarity of the Olympic bicycler with Duchess Catherine and other double creatures are devastating in the Olympics of Rion
The Rio 2016 Olympic fans this week were devastated by a French bikeman, Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, whose similarity to the Duchess of Cambridge is amazing.
But according to the discussions in the social media, this 24-year-old Olympics representative is not the only champion of the championship athletes with similar visibility to a well-known person.
For the honor of Rio's races and all the known faces in our screens, FEMAIL gathered a list of all the Olympic representatives whose visibility with Hollywood publicity is obvious.
Hunter and wolf: Brady Ellison (vas) is compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood.
In addition to the dual being of Duchess Catherine on the bicycle tracks, many people have quoted in social media how one of the bowlers could be the actor favourite Leonardo DiCaprion twin brother.
The U.S. Men's Fire Shooting Team, Brady Ellison, caused a storm after the pictures of him published in Twitter, where he resembled the star of the Wolf of Wall Street.
Ellison was aware of the slightness of social media and admitted that he had heard since he was a child that he was similar to DiCaprio.
"I don't see the equivalence so big, maybe except for beards and mustache," said Brady Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I'll take this as a compliment."
At the London races in 2012, the British long-term jumper was targeted by Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris, which is undoubtedly even more in these races.
A great Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina has been called a Cuban-American singer, Gloria Estefan, a double creature.
On the other hand, a South African swimmer named Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Matthew Morrison, known from the Glee TV series for years.
This user says Nathan Adrian's a "atletic version" of the Inception actress.
Similarly, there has been a long note of the similarity between tennis star Rafael Nadal and an actor Josh Hartnett, highlighted by both powerful corner hairs and lips.
Swimming silver medalist, Russian Yulia Efimova reminds actress Annalynne McCord, not just because of his beautifully brown skin and his blonde hair, whereas according to his fans, the US team Nathan Adrian is "athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levittt".
These two iron women, football star Hope Solo (vas.) and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter (oik.), remind each other of their faces and eyes.
Not the only one: this Twitter user was delighted when others saw the equivalence.
This user wonders if there's a good reason for a couple's identities.
One twinist recently expressed his satisfaction when "other people on the Internet agree with the similarity of Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter".
The U.S. football star and Dexter actress are really boldly like each other from their faces and eyes.
Many have also seen a similarity in the smiles of Kerri Walsh-Jennings and an actor Laura Linney and the winner of gold Gabby Douglasi and Anna will return!
The CBC Olympic Commander apologizes after saying the Chinese swimmer "dead like a pig"
Byron MacDonalds' analysis of the fourth of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan, in the women's 4 x 200 metre free-switching message, shocked the CBC's eyewitnesses on Wednesday.
The Canadian broadcaster CBC has been forced to apologize after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "dead smells" and "dead as a pig" during the race.
The reporter Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to launch his own opinions at the end of the final of the 4 x 200 metres of women's free swim.
MacDonald, who was involved in the CBC report to bring a color, was heard to say, "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
He was too excited, he went fast and died like a pig.
"Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swim the second part of the message at 1:57.79, and left 1,61 seconds from the Canadian Taylor Ruck, which allowed the Canadians to swim into China.
Viewers around Canada respond quickly after shocking the commentator's voice and language.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did the CBC reporter just say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer died like a pig? ?
The idiot didn't realize he was on the shipment yet."
The Chinese Ai Yanhan in the final of the 4 x 200 metre free swim was described by the following words: "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
Twitter was quickly filled with angry comments by Byron MacDonald, and many demanded his resignation.
The Twisters didn't arrest their words when they heard how indifferent Byron Macdonald was.
Twitcher Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and you make us all sound like a racist crowd.
Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC's mission, quickly regretted MacDonald's speeches: "We apologize for the comment on the swimming performance.
It was a unfortunate choice of words, and we are sorry that this happened."
Finally, the CBC had to regret more than 90 times for people who had tweeted as a reply.
Scott Russell, the commentary colleague, had to apologize for MacDonald.
After that, the CBC copied and glued his apologies to over 90 other tweeters' comments complaining about MacDonald's speeches.
The TV company also quickly submitted a public apology.
"We are sincerely sorry for these statements and for their access to the shipment.
During last night's broadcast we quickly apologized to our viewers, and we also apologised to our followers of social media.
For the sake of clarity, Byron's comments were related to the swimmer performance, not to him personally.
However, they were inappropriate and the choice of words was regrettable, and Byron is very sorry about his words."
On Thursday night, MacDonald expressed his apologies in the transmission and tried to defend his speech by saying that he did not mean it personally.
"I want to apologize for my comment that I made last night after women's communication," said MacDonald at the CBC's Olympic broadcast.
"I referred to the swimmer performance, not the person.
Not to say, it is clear that I did not mean anything despair, and I am very sorry."
In Primark without preventing underwear in the middle of trade, a woman shocked customers
Customers didn't know where to watch a woman take off in the middle of Primark to reconcile underwear.
He further deteriorated the situation by assessing how he looked in underwear, took them off his leg and put them back in the shelf.
He continued to twist and eventually tried four underwear at the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone.
The Primark chain store at the Folkestone Bouverie Place shopping centre, where a woman tried underwear in front of everyone and put them back in the shelf
At the same time, the mother of two children at the store, Jenny Davidson, tells us that after testing underwear, a woman who didn't know who dressed and walked out of the store without buying anything.
He tells us about what happened: "I don't think people believe in their eyes.
She stood in the middle of the store, took underwear from the shelf, took off her own stripes, and her underwear, and put them on.
He did not try to do it unconsciously, but did it completely without shame.
Everyone stared at him taking off his underwear, and apparently he didn't like them because he put them back in the shelf.
He did it three more times before he finally decided that he didn't like anything, dressed and walked out.
He didn't seem to care about the eyes — and he didn't think about the person who would eventually buy the underwear that he had come to."
The 33-year-old Davidson in Kent town continues: "How disgusting to think that someone takes home the underwear that someone else has used and hasn't been washed."
The case happened on Tuesday afternoon.
"I have understood that the trade staff tried to remove these clothing from the sale after the woman had left – what is right.
It would be terrible to take the new underwear home and notice that someone else has come to them without being washed afterwards," adds Davidson.
Primark's reporter commented on this point by saying: "Primark is aware of the situation in the Folkestone movement on Tuesday 9 August.
All the products in question have been removed from sales."
This is how you defend the armed attack with Krav Maga.
The world is full of dangers, but this video found at Dailymail.com can help make it a little safer.
We interviewed the Grand Master of the Krav Maga League in New York, Rhon Mizrach, and asked us for advice on how to cope with a gun in the near range of swinging robbers or assassins.
The video shows how you can defend the assailant according to whether the attacker approaches you or not.
If the attacker approaches backwards, the first thing we need to do is turn around to see the attacker and get out of the shooting line, says Mizrach.
Then grab the weapon so that it will be missed by your elbow and shoulder, and strike the assailant in your face with your free elbow.
Then kick the assailant with the knees, and when he goes into the pain by a double factor, smash him with a gun on his face and hold the gun on him.
Technically, if an armed assailant approaches, you need to move away from the fire line, grab the gun and turn it so that the assailant can't fire.
At the same time, put your weight on the gun and hit the assailant with a fist in the chest. Turn the gun away from the assailant's shot, pull back and hold the gun against the assailant.
Does that sound difficult?
Watch the video how Mizrachi does it.
Remember, however, that the safest way to get rid of the robber by giving up your cash — unless you are the Krav Maga master.
World Traveler Ian Wright Licks Europe's dirtyest places
The British world traveler put his resistance and his cocomic reflex on a hard trial by licking Europe's most filthy and disgusting places.
Suffolk leader and travel guide writer Ian Wright, 51, wanted to prove its resistance by licking euro banknotes, handbags in Piccadilly Circus, the toilet in the toilet label and the Russian public phone.
Before arrowing, Wright measured the targets on a luminaire to see himself and show the viewers where their tongue was pushing.
The test was made a documentary film on Ian Wright — the Inner Power, and its results were surprising.
The idea of licking the toilet in the train can be disgusting, but in fact, more bacteria are in the kitchen leaf.
On his way to Europe, Wright interviews doctors and other medical professionals about the strengthening of intestinal good bacteria and its own health.
Fortunately, nothing that he licked was nothing but a malignant mouth.
Ian Wright became well - known from his travel program, where he tested his intestinal endurance by traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
Wright’s ability to resist was undoubtedly challenged by licking the handbags of railway stations and toilet swabs.
Wright says in the documentary: "I've been pretty careless about my health since I was a child and placed in my mouth all kinds of stuff like soil, worms and curves."
In the movie, he really showed himself to be the tax of his reputation.
The border came up only in a brutal general toilet in Russia.
The luminometer measured more than 4000 units from the sample.
For the purpose of comparison, it should be noted that in the newlywed hands the number is generally below 60.
The border came up in the Russian general bathroom, where Wright refused to arrow when the snowometric measured the result of 4000 units – in the newlywed hands the same figure is less than 60.
Wright adventures in the documentary film produced with Valio on the Ian Wright – Inner strength, where the number of bacteria is made visible in different places, such as the bathroom.
Wright says in the documentary: "This is almost the worst smell I've ever smelled in any bathroom.
4000 units, nothing dirtyer than that!
It's so disgusting that I really don't lick anything here."
Wright produced a documentary film in cooperation with the Valio, Ian Wright.
Wright received a Valio Gefilus containing lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which helps to strengthen the intestinal good bacteria and resistance.
Niko Vuorenmaa, head of the category of snack, juice and extraction products, says: "We wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to look at, and at the same time explains the benefits of the probiotics.
We spent a lot of time thinking about something crazy, and finally, we came to the idea of asking Ia to join us."
The health of the salt has become a global trend.
Instead of talking about products, we wanted to bring them to a broader relationship and tell us about the good and bad bacteria of our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it relates to resistance.
Gender health has become a global trend, and the document allows us to provide consumers with more information on it in an interesting way.
The movie also tells us about our sense of humor!"
Tom Hakala, who led the film, adds to this: "I would say that I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had kissed some of the items we asked, such as the disgusting Russian toilet, which is also shown in the movie.
Of course, it was easier for Ian to lick some objects, while some were pretty bad.
I'm glad we got some of the dirty arrows on the tape."
In the survey carried out by the Commission in 2015, 84% of respondents joined milk acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of the stomach and the intestines and 58% reported that they used at least occasionally products added to milk acid bacteria.
The disruptive family destroyed a town-owned rental house in Saltash, Cornwall.
The disruptive family left behind the damage of £50,000 to the town's tenant house after they had been thrown out of the neighborhood because of terror.
Tanya Skeldon and his husband, Shaun Trebilcock, have been dismissed from his apartment in Cornwall Saltash, following complaints against a number of couples.
When the couple was forced to be removed from the apartment, the representatives of the rental company said that the apartment was shocked to be renovated.
There were shooting holes in the walls, the floors were torn off, the garbage was spread on the floors and the walls were stretched with graffits.
The couple has now changed, and they are believed to live in a private dwelling.
Mr Donna McEvoy, Head of Cornwall Housing, fears that the apartment may not be saved anymore.
He says: "This has been a full nightmare for people living here, no one should have to endure this.
There is a great deal of consideration in this regard, as the property is likely to be known not as a pleasant part of Cornwall.
"The family is badly famous, as is its name."
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment periodically. According to the police, the family’s horror was involved in street fights with baseball batteries, scaring neighbors, using drugs and communicating, as well as loud-speaking, arguing and cursement.
In June, the 47-year-old Skeldon, who signed the lease agreement, received a non-social behaviour order.
Old waste was found in several rooms of the house underneath the landscape.
Drugs had been sold from the house before, and the floorboards had been torn off.
According to the neighbors, the family fought on the streets and the police were forced to call regularly.
Cornwall’s Housing Agency was forced by the couple this week after giving them 11 weeks of time to move away voluntarily.
The easier neighbours were grateful for the extinction — they said their lives were earthly hell.
One of the neighbors says, "They didn't care about anyone.
We've lived in their neighborhood for 20 years, and the whole time has been difficult.
The police have been here incredibly many times."
"This morning, we couldn't sleep.
We woke up because it was so quiet and we're not used to it!
It'll be lovely now that they're finally eliminated."
Adam Fitzpatrick, director of the Cornwall housing agency, tells us that the family was unable to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, during which the police were regularly called.
Was thrown garbage and old toys on the wild walls of the rental house.
Fitzpatrick adds: "It is a coincidence that the tenant did not take any responsibility for the conduct of his own family and his family, because the decision is always the last measure the Cornwall housing agency is considering.
This case was very difficult because the behaviour was extreme and their actions must have been shocking to look at the neighbourhood.
I am grateful to my working group, Devon and Cornwall police and members of the Community who took part in the work and boldly offered us information.
I hope that this progress will improve the well-being of the neighbours and will send a message that unsocial behaviour is not acceptable."
Fitzpatrick tells us that three sons of the family had all lived in the apartment in different times, but they were already in twenty.
A dirty mattress found in one of the bedrooms in the house after the ejection
Now housing workers need to clean off the waste shells surrounding the house.
The police made the apartment in 2014 a raid and found more than 70 grams of cannabis and in addition to scales and other supplies and 1 700 quid cash.
Skeldon was fined when he was found guilty of the possession of class B drugs to sell it.
He claimed that the money was in his car accident in 2013 for the gravestone of his son Lee Skeldon.
After becoming homeless, Skeldon and his husband have been heard of moving into a private dwelling in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms were smuggled with graffites.
The police say they're calling for a decision on the tenants who violate the rules of the lease contracts.
Angela Crow Devon and Cornwall's police say this executive is a clear warning to the tenants who are continually against the rules.
"This is a clear message for those who think they can behave how they want without charges, as is for those who suffer from such behavior," says Crow.
Devon and Cornwall's police will never accept criminal and dissocial behaviour, and will continue to cooperate with their partners to protect our communities.
Lowly flew, sneaked by an army of showers frightened tourists in Portugal
Solar worshipers experienced a shock in Aveiro, Portugal.
The Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion plane crashed to a very low plane.
According to the Air Force, it was a training flight that did not endanger safety.
There is a moment in the picture when tourists got out of control when the lowly-flyed shower crashed across the full beach.
The dramatic images show how the military plane is almost touched in the sandshore of the sun-taking tourists in the North Portugal Aveiro.
The holidayrs got up on their feet when they were concerned about the grain of the engines of the shower machine, which began to belong before they saw what was coming through the clouds.
The case happened last afternoon in Costa Nova near Aveiro.
One of the images and videos of the dramatic passport in the social media was Daniel Fernandes, who says, "It passed the beach twice really low, and there was a moment when it looked like it would fall into the ground."
Nuno Arroi adds, "I was surfing and I was sure the plane would fall on me."
The tourists on the Aveiro beach were shocked when the plane suddenly appeared and flew in a twisting low.
The Portuguese Air Force informed today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion machine was on a training flight to identify coastal fishing vessels and therefore had to fly so low.
According to the pilot, they had to fly a little lower than normal because the smoke caused by close forest fires impaired visibility, but according to the Air Force, this did not threaten anyone’s safety.
Forest fires have caused destruction in parts of Continental-Portugal and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
Portugal's air forces today informed that, due to the fog and the poor visibility of smoke, the pilot had to fly so low.
The plane was on a training flight with a pilot being asked to identify the fishing vessels.
Exoten the result of the first half of a year better than expected
In January - June, the South Karelia Social and Health Circle (Eksote) made a better planned result of EUR 3.4 million.
The exoten result was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services where the development of preventive services has been able to dismantle plant care.
The custody was implemented in all the actions.
This year, the exote aims to shorten the line of action.
The exotic covers the surplus of the previous deficit.
The surplus may be used to shorten the lines and to buy measures for patients.
The result of the entire year is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The exoten government will deal with the six-year review at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 special ice creams were sworn in the military light in Immola
The 70 guardians at the Border and Maritime School swore a military response on Friday.
The Military Council of Army at the Border and Maritime Guard School was held in Immola on Friday.
The 10th Primary Bargaining Course was held on the sports field of the garage.
A soldier's whale swore 70 guardians.
Special frontiers will be trained for demanding cross-border security, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people picked up to be a special iceline.
The choice tests were called 250.
Special icelines have been trained in Immola since 2007.
Five veterans of the border forces were involved in a veteran meeting during the occasion of the voluntarily event.
The average age of those with him is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who participated in the event have been born in 1918.
A circle of robbers above - criminal intelligence helps to investigate crimes and reveals serious crime - ESS.fi
From the beginning of 2014, each of the 11 police departments in Finland has operated by RTA, i.e. a criminal intelligence and analysis unit.
The operation of the unit is invisible outwards.
In the Hämeen Police Department, the unit includes four officers in Lahd and Hämeenlinna.
It's pulled by the Sergeant in the Gulf.
He's an executive officer in Inspector Lahti.
In addition, the strength of the unit is a civilian dedicated to IT in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in civilian suits.
The unit has demonstrated its viability and necessity, see the deputy chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces a variety of investigations for the other police.
In a distraction, it has acquired information on asylum seekers.
The most recent reform of working practices
Establishment of analytical units is the latest reform of police practices.
The aim has been to prevent crimes, that is, the fact that the police would be more and less likely to go to the scene until they get the alarm.
With the information collected and analysed by the unit, daily police activities are targeted where it is most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, there was one crime intelligence centre, less than three national units and their own criminal intelligence unit in each police department.
The PTR Centre in the Central Crime Police in Vantaa will manage operations nationally.
PTR units work people from the Police, Customs and Border Guards, according to their name.
The RTA units, on their own, work in areas distributed according to the police departments and are responsible for providing information to both local police forces and national units.
Inquiry extends beyond its own territory
Where the individual police are aware of what has happened during their 12-hour shift, the task of the RTA unit is to know what happens in the entire area of the police department.
The intelligence also extends beyond the limits of its own facility, as crime does.
Those working in the RTA unit have better computer skills than basic police.
By means of registers, alarm databases and observations, the unit aims to draw the attention of the police to new phenomena, productive criminals or similar crimes.
This is called serialisation, and it is one of the most important tools for criminal intelligence.
All people have their own ways of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether honest or criminal.
On the basis of an activation, the factor is made up of a certain image.
The series may be carried out either on the basis of an act or on the basis of a person, depending on which police have more information.
Criminals Learn From their Errors
The employees of the RTA unit don't travel in the city with their necks standing up, but their work is not entirely public.
There are no reports of the methods used by both their own and criminals because this could lead to the development of professional criminals and thus attempting to prevent police crime prevention companies.
The procedures of the police will be publicly informed if they are expected to threaten them.
This case was, for example, news from early summer, the way in which empty dwellings were used in housing breaks.
That's where the authors put the apartment in the outside door with a stick, a button needle or a piece of tape that they tried to see if the residents were really on their way.
The pre-examining material shall be public to the parties at least.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from the mistakes they have made.
The smartest are ordering a court protocol, for example, showing that fingerprints have been found on the site.
Next time, the gloves go to the thieves.
For the purpose of the case, an interrogation has been carried out by Tero Seppä from Hämee Police Officer, Inspector Tuomo Lepola from the Eastern Finland Police Office, Inspector Sami Joutjärve from Joensuu Police Station and inspector Arto Judgment from Central Crime Police.
The police are collecting and analysing information to plan practical activities.
In the background, the decrease in labour force and funding.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The last change was the three-step PORA reform, which ended by the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects information from the outside of its own institution and Finland's borders.
A school girl who joined fathers was killed in Syria in London.
The news tells us that one of the three British schoolers that joined Iss last year, Kadiza Sulta, has been killed in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee tells the girl's family that Sultana died in Syrian Raqqa a few weeks ago.
He was believed to have been killed in the Russian air strike in Raqqa, the Isis Base in Syria, reported ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old, and according to his family, he was planning to escape from the land of war and return to Britain.
"You can only hope that this works as a warning example and a will so that people can understand this is a real risk when you go to the war zone - and that makes people quit the decision", says Akunjee.
Sultana rose in February 2015 together with two other Eastern school girls to a plane flying to Turkey and continued on the bus to the Syrian border.
The family had heard that Sultana had married the Syrian fighter Isis and remained widow only a few months after the wedding.
Reid says Clinton will support Garland's name to the Supreme Court if he's chosen.
The Senate’s Democratic Director, Harry Reid, says he is convinced that Hillary Clinton, the candidate of the Democratic President, will appoint Merrick Garland as the judge of the Supreme Court if he is elected President.
The Republican representatives of the Senate have not agreed to confirm the name of Garland since Barack Obama appointed him in March.
According to the Senate's majority director Mitch McConnell, the next president will choose a person to meet the position of the Supreme Court judge Antonin Scali.
Reid said at the Thursday phone talk that he would predict that Clinton would choose Garland with great certainty.
The Reid reporter later explained that this was just speculation, and that Reid had not spoken directly to Clinton, whether he was going to name Garland.
Reid praised Garland and said Clinton's team wouldn't want to "boat the boat" by choosing someone else.
Garland is the Supreme Judge of the Court of Appeal of the United States of America in the district of Columbia.
Reid says that the Republicans that prevent Garland's name are presidential candidate Donald Trump's commanders and promoters.
He says Trump doesn't fit in.
According to the Treats magazine, naked calendars belong to women as well as men.
The Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere and brings on the market the 1970s style of the calendar inspired by Pirell for 2017.
Instead of public secret models, they want to find the top models of their 2017 NU Muses calendar for the next generation.
The CEO of Treats told earlier this year that his naked magazine differs from the old school Playboy magazine, because he said, "Playboy is for men.
I'm doing this to women."
Apparently, he thinks the same way about the calendar.
"We must bring back the timeless and classical nakedness where women, even wherever men, can uncomfortably enjoy these pictures of women's body and inspiring them," says Shaw in the press release about the calendar.
"Women will surely want to participate in this project because it will be a beautiful work of art."
They can send their images to the calendar through the network or participate in open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl charm: Who buys discs?
Lonely, middle-aged men like vinyl.
Before you have time to write a comment on your angry objection with the name of NoväKindallEveryYesCentreMiehet, this claim is based on real research data.
According to the YouGov research company, the new arrival of much spoken vinyl plates is not a millennial generation boom, while the millennials want to know a physical object in their hands, but instead there is nostalgic nostalgic background.
The age of the person who recently bought the vinyl album is most likely between 45 and 54.
In fact, 18 to 24 age groups are the least likely buyers.
Moreover, it is not only the enthusiasm of squeezing discs, but the importance of emotionally based: older vinyl plate purchasers are a little more likely to hide their feelings (56% v. 53%) and enjoy alone (69% v. 66%).
But is YouGov's results correct?
If this blog had been televisionized news broadcast, the camera would follow me when I was walking through the flashing of Soho Street, wearing a grey jacket dress. I'd first be quick, bend my hands into cups, and say something about traditions, like, "Let's find out."
So let's find out.
Although Soho has slowly lost its charming power and rose, while the hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchase chains have taken over before private entrepreneurs owned, there are still a lot of special record stores left.
I would probably ask the photographer to stop the camera for a moment when I look very close to men who visit these stores and try to evaluate their age and nature.
Studart of Glasgowlainen, 55, followed by the Sister Ray movement (at that moment, two young women, three middle-aged men) at the Reckless Records (at that moment, eight middle-aged men, one probably 20-year-old woman) is on a meeting trip in London for the afternoon and spends extra time with the offer of shops.
I'm asking if he's a collector.
"I think I am," he says.
"I have about 3000 to 4,000 records."
These records fill in his living room walls, as shown in the picture. (Stuart sent the picture to me by e-mail, I didn't follow him home.)
The reason why he has acquired such a large amount of albums and singles is partly in his available income. He now has the ability to buy discs that he couldn't afford when they first appeared, and to buy again things he had to sell when he was young and unfinished.
"I've got a lot of 60's end and 70's early stuff that appeared when I was 11 or 12 and probably too young to get them," he says.
He agrees that those buying vinyl plates are more likely to be introvertes that enjoy themselves, and adds: "I don't smoke, and I don't drink much.
It's my bad."
Wez, 25 in the Sister Ray, also believes that many of their customers fit the YouGov profile.
However, he has detected a new kind of human flow that has been affected by the media hypothesis. These people have heard about the coming of vinyl plates and now feel obsessive to buy back their old records.
"On the basis of my discussions, people had generally abandoned their collections in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their vinyl back," he says.
This can explain a certain-aged vinyl-resistant boom.
Then what about the alleged emotional significance of the records?
In just a few seconds, Phonica’s kind of movement realizes that they offer comfort to the similar types of community.
According to Wez, some of the older customers have become injured, in particular, to the payment system that is not in contact.
The digital world may disturb some of the vinyl fans whose return to familiar record boxes means lastingness and reminding you of the happy days of youth.
"I think that it sometimes fills a hole or material property for some kind of comfort," says Wez.
"I saw it myself as a collector, and I believe that so many others.
It's an easy way to get the thoughts out of here."
"We're like social workers!" hugs Wez's coworker behind the disc surface.
The ICM opinion survey in April revealed that almost 50% of the purchasers of the vinyl album in the previous month had not yet listened to their records.
The opinion study also showed that 41% of the record player they never use and 7% of the purchasers of the vinyl plate have no own recording.
At this point, I'd probably look a serious face while I was sitting on a pink bossa nova collections.
The new arrival of the vinyl plates also involves the "pocal phenomenon", which has been detected by Jonny, who sells the Sounds of the Universe (as clients at that time three middle-aged men).
"A client recently came into circulation and said he didn't have a recording player, but he wants to buy a Radiohead disc so he can put it in his shelf," Jonny says.
"The share of such customers is not large, but there are.
For them materialism is more important than music.
Some of our clients tell us they still don't have a recording player.
They're younger, not older, long-aged, who're just starting a hobby."
The customer is much more varied in Fop, where I come to next. The movement has owned a whole layer of vinyl plates.
Customers include seventy couples, photography of tourists, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
The differences between customers will be delighted, even though the atmosphere is not as relaxed as in previous movements: the sound of the hanging beats instead of the swinging jazz, the newest sex of Wild Beasts, the synthetic poop.
None of the clients look very lonely, but it's hard to find a crawling psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Foppi for a few minutes and watching various discount plates.
He's more like watching than he's doing shopping.
He says his income is small, so it's not possible for him to collect the records.
"They're gonna pay a lot.
Music is easy to listen to from a computer or otherwise, but the fineness of the vine is...", he lets a crushed whisper and continues:
"I can't explain, they're so unique."
My last stop is a trade that is said to have inspired the new vinyl fan generation: Urban Outfitters.
I see a bunch of teenage girls who think they're jumping jeans, but they're gathering around the Polaroid cameras for a while, and I see a father and a daughter who's thinking about buying a Crosley recorder.
On the left, there is a staircase filled with Adele's, Jeff Buckley's, Amy Winehouse's and Fleetwood Mac's records: a mix of modern music and classics, key records to any medium collection.
No one looks at the wall, perhaps because they're just a decoration element and a part so high that they don't even reach them.
They're pure "art vinyl."
However, given that all the means to get attention to these records may include more money in the sector and send a few customers to hakuret Sohoo, there is little reason to complain.
There is no surprise that the population group, which is most likely to have more time and money than most, also has the group that spends the most money on luxury, such as vinyl plates.
Although the results of my research are correct, at least in Soho's record stores, they do not exclude a large number of female collectors and vinyl fans that are actually available in both disc stores and online forums.
These people are likely to be closely tied to school or working life.
I'm sure they don't spend their Thursday mornings mapping in Berwick Street's record shops, watching records and avoiding a 30-year-old television broadcaster staring scaryly and flashing unprecedented middle-aged men.
Holker or ice shark is the longest living spinal – video report
According to researchers, the longest living spinal cord of the earth is an ice shark.
According to Hai researcher Julius Nielsen, the oldest ice shark was taken forever in the study of 272 to 512 years, a female of five metres.
The French Court rejected the application for the decommissioning of jungle camp stores
The French Court has rejected the application of the Calais authorities in order to request the decommissioning of dozens of temporary stores and restaurants in the jungle camps of thousands of refugees.
Calais’s authorities during the trial this week argued that the State should be allowed to break down 72 temporary trades in refugee camps, and that trades sell different goods from tobacco to energy drinks and offer hair cuts.
According to the Calais practitioners, these trades and restaurants must be dismantled because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent the grey economy and because they are associated with fire and hygiene risks.
Humanitarian aid groups told the Court that trades and restaurants are necessary for the camp, because free meals offered by the government and other parties are not enough for the growing population of the camp.
They say that temporary stores and restaurants often provide protection and free food for those who need them.
The Court of Justice of Lille decided that there was no legal basis for executing 72 temporary traders, but considered the concerns of the Prefect of Calais to be fully understandable.
According to Judge Jean-François Molla, camp’s dining shops, cafes and restaurants have a much greater significance than to offer food to people who live in extremely unstable conditions.
He says they offer peaceful places where refugees and volunteers can meet each other.
One of the places under the landing threat was the camp's Jungle Book Kids coffee shop, which is unprofitable and offers 200 meals a day, English and French hours and asylum advice for hundreds of unaccompanied minors who are most vulnerable.
More than 170,000 people have signed a address in which children's café is required to be kept.
According to the letter sent to Guardian, its closure would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old.
Two charity organizations, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the population of the jungle camp has risen to a record of over 9 000 lives after the sharp increase in the summer.
Food prices fall clearly faster in Finland than the average in the EU
Food will be cheaper in Finland for the joy of consumers and for the problems of producers.
In Finland, food prices have fallen by almost 5 per cent in three years, while on average in EU countries their price fell by 0.9 per cent.
At the same time, food has become one percent more expensive in Germany and Sweden.
During the last three years, the price of food has fallen for the second in Finland from the EU countries with the same level of wages as in Finland.
Compared in Britain only, food prices have fallen faster than in Finland.
The data are published by the Director of Statistics Finland's Development, Ilkka Lehtinen, an article published in the Information & Trendit blog.
The media compared real prices, i.e. prices, which are proportionate to the overall development of consumer prices.
The latest information is from June this year.
At the beginning of the 2010s, the price of food rose strongly.
In 2013, prices fell close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came after EU membership," says Lehtinen.
Then the turn followed, after which the food has become cheaper for a year.
Now the bans on imports of food imposed by Russia, which have blocked the food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and producer prices have fallen.
"Putin's policy has helped the Finnish consumer in short terms," says Lehtinen.
The rising price competition in industry and trade has also affected the fall in prices.
Large trading chains S-group and Kesko have both fallen prices.
The price competition for the consumer has been shown as a major advertising campaign.
However, Finland is still not a low-cost diet, even though the price of food has fallen abundantly.
In 2015, food was the fourth of the most expensive EU countries with similar wage levels in Finland.
According to the newspaper, the price of food sold in Finland has a significant impact on VAT.
He found that if the comparator countries had the same VAT rate, the third of the cheapest food would be sold in Finland from the same level of wages.
The journalist compared Finland with Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven in the comparative countries, only the Germans and the Dutch would sell cheaper food than the Finnishs.
"If we want to get to the level of food at the prices of the old EU countries, VAT must be pooled to the average level of the EU countries and continue to compete for prices," Lehtinen writes.
The journalist points out that the calculations made by him at the rate of VAT are indicative.
The school isn't exactly the same.
A returning to the school seat may notice that a change in school has taken place during the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all sub-schools.
It is an instruction that all schools in Finland operate.
The schools decide the details themselves, but the plan sets out the official objectives.
New instructions have been prepared for several years and differ in many ways from the old guidelines.
Among other things, the teaching of a beauty article is abandoned, and instead, schools start to practice coding.
Sweden's education starts at the latest in the sixth grade, and the social guide is already started in four.
However, the main change concerns the role of students.
It was thought that the teacher would teach students, but now everyone should be active and learn from one another.
This is how people try to make school visits more interesting.
The longest spinal cord found in the world - ice shark can live for up to 400 years
Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) known in the refrigerators reaches a genital maturity only at the age of 150.
It can still live for 250 years afterwards, report a new research.
The figures make the species the longest spinal cord of the modern world.
In the animal, only an Islamic womb, the oldest known individual has been scheduled to be 507 years old.
Greenland sharks swim along the North Atlantic.
They also have another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic region.
The females are stretching dogs longer, and they can grow up to more than five feet.
Since the growth rate is slow, according to the follow-up, only about a centimetre a year, adult individuals have lived for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues from the University of Copenhagen found out.
He determined the ice sharks of adults for every 28 nails that had been caught by fishermen.
The age of the fish was revealed by radio-coal drove of eye lenses.
The average age of studied sharks proved to be at least 272 years.
Two of the largest fish in the sample, 493 and 502 cents of amazone population, were discovered by about 335 and 392 years of age.
Since previous studies have shown that ice-creaming stems are only more than four metres of genital maturity, researchers decreased that they were about 150 years old at the time.
The research was published by Science.
We're fired from Stockmann to nearly 300 - salesmen will not be deducted
Approximately 300 workers are dismissed from Stockmann.
At the beginning of August, the cooperative companies in the company which had become troubled ended.
"The outcome of the negotiations will reduce about 300 jobs, of which the main part will be redundancies," Stockmann reports.
It states that the number of sellers in the goods sector is not reduced so that the customer service does not suffer.
In addition, some 80 employees of support activities will be offered a new job as a vendor.
Stockmann’s yt-negotiations concerned about 3,000 employees.
At the beginning, the need for reduction was estimated to be about 380 employees.
The reduction aims at annual cost savings of around EUR 20 million, which are to be realised over the next year.
Stockmann has already launched an efficiency programme to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
Stockmann's difficulties in profitability are the background.
Although the adjusted operating result of the group improved in the second quarter to EUR 11.1 million, the trade in goods is still losing.
According to Stockmann, according to CEO Lauri Veijalainen, the sale in the commodities has not attracted the aims set by the company.
"The reductions in human beings are unfortunately necessary to ensure the positive performance of Stockmann Retail in 2018," says Veijalainen in the paper.
The result improvement of the second quarter was especially the good success of the Lindex.
Ketju achieved the best second quarter of all time's turnover and results.
The operating profit of Lindex increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
During the corresponding period last year, the whole Stockmann Group’s operating result was 4.1 million losses.
Stockmann estimates that this year's net sales of the group will decrease last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the most rainy in the north... temperature below 20 degrees in the whole country.
The low pressure center on the north of Finland will keep the weather on a rainy Friday, reports the meteorologist of HS Ilona Láng.
Also in the middle of the earth there will be raincows, but the southern is the fountain.
The temperature is no longer very summer, for the whole country's mercury is below 20 degrees.
In the rainy regions of the north, 10 to 15 degrees.
Kenya’s general sports team is shaking the dopingscandal - a strange explanation for the temperament of the coach
Kenya’s general sports coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Olympic Olympics of Rio after it turned out that Anzrah was a country group athlete in the doping test.
The news office AP reported that an athlete at which Anzrah tried to act was a star of Ferguson Rotich of 800 metres.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of Kenya's country team, told me that Anzrah's identity was revealed after he had given a sample of Rotichina in the surprise test.
Doping officials came to report to Anzrah's authorities.
Soin said Anzrah was sent home because he "make his crimes against Kenya's country team".
He appeared as an athlete, gave a urine sample and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such use," Chairman of the Olympic Committee of Kenya Kip Keino, the news office of Reuters, in turn.
The Olympic general sport begins on Friday, and Rotich is about to run immediately at the time.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the case.
Rotich last year was placed in the MM races on his way to the fourth and has preceded Rio's winner favourites.
According to Reuters, the source inside Kenya's general sports team claimed that Anzrah went to the accreditation card only to get free meals at the contest.
When the antidoping officials met him, they assumed he was an athlete, and he was taken to the test.
The coach didn't explain the situation to officials because he was afraid to reveal himself," the source told me.
Where's everybody?
Rio's general sports stadium gums its emptyness
Where is everybody?
At least not at the Rio Olympic Stadium to watch general sports.
On Friday, Rio began a struggle for the medals of general sports, but the world’s top individuals were able to present their skills to a distracting empty viewer.
The organisers of Rion reported on Friday that only 58% of the first-day morning race tickets and 65% of the evening race tickets have been sold.
Another was four years ago in London, where the stadium was bolted of the cheerful people.
Final tickets have already been sold in Rio.
The Olympics of Rio have already attracted attention before general sports.
For example, thousands of empty benches have been seen in the sights of rugby, noise and riding.
When the Brazilian medal drives Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach balloon in legendary Copacabana, only 70 percent of the view was filled.
After the Brazilian twin, Holland played against Russia, and about 30 percent of the 12 000 people were filled.
At least the bad pattern is explained by the fact that Brazil is far away from European and Asian race tourists in economic difficulties, and many of the Olympics are strange to Brazilians who are used to football.
Of course, even the first match of the Brazil football team did not get full of football stadium.
Mario Andrada, the informant of the competitors, said this weekend that 82 per cent of the tickets had been sold at the time, which was clearly less than four years ago.
"There's still 1.1 million ends left for sale," said Reuters.
8.5 million of the Olympics in London sold 8.2 million, even though the tickets cost almost half more than in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from about nine euros to more than a thousand euros.
More than half of the tickets pay less than EUR 16.
In the Olympics of London, volunteers and military staff were allowed to sit in empty places, but this is not yet allowed in Rio because the organisers need money and try to get tickets sold until the last moment.
However, in Rio the organisers have given schoolers 240 000 tickets to less well-known species, such as golf and rugby.
Rion's stadium had enough empty places this morning.
Even a beach balloon in Copacaba's sand hasn't been interested in the audience.
Jukka Kesksalo competed in London 2012.
There's enough people on the papers.
A new way of protecting nature - to obtain the right to the land
Helsinki Foundation participates in the conservation of nature by new means.
The Foundation established last year acquires ecologically significant areas of nature.
Thereafter, private, companies and entities can redeem the rights of holders to the land.
The Foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The area has been virtually distributed into blocks that are willing to acquire the right of holders against payment.
The holder shall receive a veto right in its 187 square block, meaning in practice that no approval is required for each holder if the use of the land is intended to be altered.
Fairy rights can also be acquired for more sections.
Acquiring the right to administration is something concrete that can be left as a heritage or a gift.
There is no need to go to carry banderolles or chain themselves somewhere to protect nature," explains Juha Leviakangas, who has acquired control over its company.
The acquirer of the administrative right receives precise location information from his section, which enables, for example, a visit to the block.
On the website of the Foundation, the names of the holders' rights acquirers are compiled in the same map, where the land block information is available.
The spread fabric is considered to be the risk of its natural protection procurement only to change the original idea of the Foundation.
The Helsinki Foundation has been set up as a foundation of general interest aimed at promoting the protection of the environment and of the nature.
The risk is that the Foundation would act in some way unethically or commercially, but it should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation's Fairy project is to protect the natural areas so that they can be intact and in peace.
The Foundation acquires land areas either by buying or donating.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of holder rights, but the Foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the Foundation is to acquire more protected countries.
It also aims beyond Finland's borders and plans to purchase land from Australia.
Helsinki Foundation presents its activities at the pop up forest on 13-19 August at the Helsinki Trade Museum.
Bike thieves tortured the great cities most of Turku - see the situation in your municipality
Bicycle thieves torture Turku for the largest cities in Finland.
This year, more wheels have been stolen relative to the population than in nine other major cities.
On the basis of the bicycles reported to the police, Helsinki sanomamat explained the amount of bicycles and parts of them stolen in ten largest cities this year's January-August, calculated per thousand inhabitants.
In addition to the market, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti rose to the top.
According to the police, there were four to five wheelbugs per thousand people.
On the other hand, only about two bicycles per thousand people were notified to the police in Espoo and Kouvola.
It's a big difference.
"In other cities, there is a double number of thieves relative to the population," characterises the police inspector Tommi Ree.
The Turku police wonder why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more wheels have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I have no answer to that.
"The frequency of security can be influenced by the amount of movements in the city on wheels and the amount of wheels on top of it", thinks Sergeant Teemu Ääs.
Tommi Reen of the Police Government considers that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu are looking forward to getting to the top in comparison.
Bicycle thieves are largely based on study and cycling cities.
There is a close center in the market, short distances and a lot of wheels available for thieves.
"In the first place, Espoo is a very different kind of town where city centres are distant and bicycle is not necessarily a priority tool," Reen says.
In January-August, the whole of Finland, the police have been informed of somewhat less bicycle stealing than during the corresponding period of last year.
There's still no reason for great joy.
Despite the decline in recent years, the police will be informed about a little more than 20,000 bike-lifts per year.
It means 50-60 ounces every day and only in Helsinki about 4,000 wheels per year.
"They're big," Reen says.
In fact, the thieves take more wheels, because only some of the victims report theft to the police.
Reen urges people to make a criminal report on bicycle stealing, even though less than every tens of the police report will be clear.
Typical bicycle robbery is the one where the police get information about theft immediately, and the thief gets caught in blood.
"The other investigations will also find out when, for example, a drug case in the apartment can find stolen wheels," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bicycle thieves will be caught on a weekly basis or in connection with police investigations, reports older officer Timo Leppämäki.
He said that wheels are stolen, for example, from bicycles, interioryards, stocks and bike cellars, i.e. practically everywhere where they are usually stored.
The most private bike models are stolen in the same way as in the past years.
The U-lock gives the wheel a better protection than many other types of locks.
Some of the thieves take the bike, for example, for short-term own use, but most of the stolen wheels end up selling, for example, via the net.
They stay on the domestic market.
"At least the police have never found out that stolen wheels would go abroad," Reen says.
According to the police, the buyers of stolen wheels are normal Finns.
I'm sure some people buy a stolen bike without knowing.
Some may have doubts about that.
The buyer of the wheel used must be careful because he may be guilty of concealing crime or violation.
"The alarm bells should be ringing if they sell good-minded bikes on their bottom," Reen says.
Special Library Officer Severi Hirvi will carry his colorful Nops for his working day to cover the Kallio library in Helsinki.
He's had five pieces of wheels, but none of them's been stolen, the monster says. "It's never been taken, there's been a good monk."
"Even if this isn't so attracting thieves, there may not be any hipster value here," the Helcinian Monster wonders.
In the Kiosk in Helsinki Kallio, the rapidly interveneed by Siiri Valve locked his bicycle with a small U-lock.
Now the bike stuck the kiosk against the wall, but Valve usually locks his bike in a solid, like a bike.
"It comes to think about it quite a lot, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I own," says the Greek student about his white bike, whose body alone cost about 500 euros.
"All the time, you hear from your friends that wheels have been taken."
"Essentially bad wheels, such junkies."
A bike was stolen from the Valve itself from the inside of the house company a year ago.
Although the bike had been unlocked, Valve was expecting it to be trapped.
Under 15 years of age in charge of their crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with the U.S. peers' teams
In Helsinki, the so-called peer panel is being tried to prevent young people from getting into a criminal round.
At first, the experiment is applied to people under the age of 15 who are now missing criminal responsibility.
The jury is missing the first young person to commit a crime.
The idea is that the peer panel will discuss what happened with the offender and impose sanctions.
A week later, the offender himself can join the peer panel to make up for his actions.
For example, there may be other consequences of a letter written to the family explaining what has become and what has been learned from it.
The youth director, Tommi Laitio, tells us that the model is not strict.
We have other conciliation models that are used in parallel.
"All are guided by a young person in a more responsible direction so that everything will not be ruined by the first mistake," says Laitio.
A model has been taken to the comparative panels from the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after the first crime, a young person does not go ahead with the adult panel, but reflects the events with about the same ages.
The model has been tested once.
Palmu’s service designer Iikka Lovio, following the experiment, tells us that this was an assault that was successfully solved.
In particular, the first crimes of under 15 years of age may not have been dealt with before.
"It has been a message that continues on the path you choose," says Lovio.
Comparative Board is part of the Helsinki project for Immigrants' Young People, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio stresses that new ways of action are offered for all, not just for young immigrants who need it.
More than 70 Republican influencers want the party to stop financing Trump campaign
It is said that more than 70 powerful Republicans have signed a letter asking the party to stop financing the Donald Trump presidential campaign.
From the letter, the American newspaper Politico, who had received a draft of it.
According to the newspaper, the open letter is addressed to Reince Priebus, President of the National Committee of the Republics.
The signatories want the party's money to be channelled to the Congress Halls instead of Trump's campaign.
"We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump, as well as his negligence, incompetence and record indifference, threaten to bring democrats to the elections," says Politicon.
Only the direct direction of all possible funds to Congress Halls can prevent the Republicans from drowning a Trump-decorating anchor in their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, because Trumpi's chances of winning the presidential elections will decrease every day.
Politico writes that the letter is to be sent in the next week.
The signatories include politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the organizational persons of the letter is apparently a Republican Andrew Weinstein against Trumpia.
According to Politicon, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "the people who want the party to protect their majority in the Congress" and that it is not the support of anyone.
The letter lists a number of Donald Trump's actions, which are believed to be offended by millions of voters.
He was also said to show dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials working on national security reported in an open letter that they did not support Donald Trumpia as President.
Clinto's permission to facilitate the family of children in the United States
In the United States, President-in-Office of Democrats Hillary Clinton reported the details of his economic policy on Thursday night.
I am trying to be President so that the United States economy can go well for everyone.
"Donald Trump seeks to be president so that the economy can go well for him and his friends," said Clinton in his speech.
At the center of Clinton's plan, there is a massive five-year programme of $275 billion to improve the U.S. infrastructure - roads, bridges and airports.
This would be financed in part through rich tax increases, partly through private money.
The construction program is a hand-adjustment for American duunaries who suffer from the transfer of factories to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the programme the largest investment in good-paid jobs after World War II.
We're a builder, we need to get back to building!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to facilitate the position of the family of children working.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders when he stressed that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if the company leaves the United States to become a taxpayer, it has to pay the starting tax, Clinton said.
Today, he is opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he has previously supported.
"I am opposed to all trade agreements against workers or wages," said Clinton.
According to the speculations published by the Washington Post before the Clinton speech, Clinton was planning to criticise the economic programme published by Donald Trump on Monday by the Republic of the Republic that it "is only favouring millionaires like this".
Trump's suggested reduction in corporate taxes has previously been named "Trumpin's porkhole".
On Thursday, Clinton stressed that he was the daughter of a small entrepreneur himself.
He reminded the listeners of small entrepreneurs whose bills Trump has failed to pay, and the clothes Trump himself produces in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America big again, he should start by making products in America itself," Clinton sneaked.
Such are Rio's viewers: Kisat has not glued Finnish to the grids, but mobile application is interesting
Usually, sports races can be seen in television viewer statistics as sharp mountain tips.
To date, the Olympic Olympics in Rio have not reached the sums of viewers.
At the same time, the races have been glued to the top of the screens by 12 per cent of the population: Tuesday night swim followed by 615 000 viewers from Yle's Olympic Channel TV2 at the same time.
For the purpose of comparison, almost 800 000 audiences were given at the end of TV2, and the EMs in football were fairly another million.
So far, most of the Olympics have been interested in cycling on Sunday nights and opening the fifth race day, both reaching almost half a million audiences at the time of the Olympic Channel.
The top sport leader Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the audience figures, and reminds us that the viewers are first divided into the Olympics of Rio in several different instruments.
In addition to television, Finns follow the Olympics from Rio Areena.
We're pleased to see how much of the TV watches are going to pick the Olympics.
TV2 and Yle Fem channels will also be distributed by viewers on the side of the television.
The Olympic Olympics of Rio are the first sports races for which Yle owned a whole channel.
When the shipment comes 24 hours a day, and the audience is from 20,000 to 500 000, it is a good basis.
The number of viewers is lower than in the 2012 London races or in the 2008 Beijing races, but the difference explains the difference in time - a large part of Rio's races will come to Finland during the nighttime.
Another reason for lame interest - if someone now thinks it's dirty - is definitely a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken some surprise medal from the first races, the interest would have bounced up along with it.
In addition, public sports are just starting, as are other Finnish-interesting species: sailing and riding.
At first, the number of viewers have been close to the expected Pokkisen said.
When general sports begins, the spectators' figures explode.
Yle lanseered a Yle Rio 2016 mobile application for the races, which rose in the first days of the races in the Apple App Store for the most downloaded free application in Finland.
By Monday, the application was downloaded 150 000 times.
I'd bet we'd already go on the way to the charging of 200 000.
"We'll only get the blood's viewers later." Pokkinen says
Rio Areena has not operated in all users as hoped for.
Pokkinen says the feedback has come and the errors have been corrected.
There has been a delay in the use of Rio Areena and other minor technical problems in the early stage.
Applications have received updated versions that should correct errors.
The Olympic Games of Rio are visible on Yle's channels and in the arena wider than any other sports event ever before.
The Yle Fem Canal can be followed by some species, and on the radio Yle Puhe conveys races daily.
The Olympics are not only perhaps working animals for Yle ever, but also the last ones that can only be followed from Yle's channels.
Since 2018, the Olympic Sports will be seen in the top and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is your Sun, whose depth is 95.3 metres in the Crossbow.
It might be even deeper.
Matti Kannela, a technical suburbs trainer, found some 20 square feet of print on the Cross Sel, the bottom of which was 104 metres in the dive computer.
During the summer 2014, the Finnish Environment Centre attempted to reaffirm the observation by shouting.
The method may not be found in a little deepened 100 metres, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes include Inari Lake (92 metres) and Suvasvesi (90 metres).
More than 80 metres extend to Saimaa, secondary water and Head Lake.
They have not been investigated as closely as Päijänne.
Especially the bottom of Inari Lake has not been carefully evaluated.
"They could well find unknown depths," Kannnela wonders.
If the deepest lake is defined by medium depth, it is the Great Jukajärvi, 23 meters.
In view of this, your Sun will not enter the ten deepest crowd, and Suvasvesi will be farther from the top.
Correction on August 12, at 14.29: Corrected last piece where the deepest lakes of the middle were wrong.
Individual tax: Retired persons' tax tighter
Retirement tax is still tighter than employees.
The gentleman says that there was an inconsistency under the parliamentary elections and that the tax on pensioners was promised to be equaled to the employees.
This is not the case in the Government's presentation.
We think it should definitely be there.
The promises given should be followed after the elections, he says to the West Media.
At the beginning of this year, employees received reduced income, which reduced their taxation.
In the Parliament, the issue hesitated representatives of the opposition, who shined the electoral promises of Alexander Stubb, the Minister of Finance.
Purchasing power is secured, it does not grow
The policy presented by Mr Petteri Orpo (kok.) on tax reductions, according to the Ihal, is mainly about safeguarding and increasing purchasing power, as next year no wages will be increased.
He says that tax reduction will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other issues do not increase the uncertainty of people.
Ihalainen welcomes Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Orpo’s messages for the desire to respect the Competitiveness Agreement that has been reached with trouble.
He says that adhering to the agreement is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action of the government.
It has been done with the power of labour market organisations, so it should not be questioned.
It will be needed because the economy is so much for domestic demand and the people's own faith.
Independence on long-term unemployment
The gentleman urges the government to tackle the long-term unemployment of the budget, at least to stop its growth.
In June, there were about 17,000 more long-term unemployed than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government's goal of increasing employment rates is to be run off to 72%.
He warns that, if the challenge of long-term unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: There are no known Finnish victims in the attacks in Thailand
In Thailand last night and last night, at least four people died in bombing attacks in Finland.
The Embassy calls on Finns in the country to be alert and to avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the guidance of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finnish civilians going to Thailand to cancel their journey because of explosions, but the instructions of the embassy should be followed with caution, Westphale says.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to assess.
The Finnish travel period in Thailand is due to the year-on-year.
The majority of Thai tourists become South Europe and China at this time of the year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from the Finns in Thailand through Facebook after bombing.
The embassy has tried to seek, in particular, the Finnishs in Hua Hin to get information on the situation of the city.
However, several of our contacts in Hua Hin are currently missing from the city.
In general, everything seems to be fine, Westphale says.
No information about the author
Westphalen says there's no evidence of the attack.
The Ambassador believes that events may relate to the political disruption of the shared society in Thailand and to the last week's referendum of the constitution drawn up by the military jun.
The law was adopted in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people were arrested in the country who announced their opposition to the law.
In the southern provinces of Thailand, the ethnic-national conflict with the Muslim population, Westphale says.
Muslims want to increase their right of self-determination.
However, in the past, no attacks have been extended to tourist destinations.
It's a big, local holiday in Bangkok today, Westphale says.
He said that in the city, the queen's birthday and the mother's day will be celebrated.
Traffic in the city is very small.
The attacks affect the day so that the authorities are very specific to safety.
Thai police: There are no attacks on international terrorism
According to the police, the attacks are "local sabotage" and differ from the usual terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism is also closed, reports the Thai police news office according to AP.
In Thailand, at least four people have died during the day after 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as the popular tourists in Phuket and Hua Hin.
Even in the popular tourist destination of Finnish citizens, the holiday island in Phuket exploded four bombs at night, reports the Thai magazine Bangkok Post.
According to the current data, they did not require death sacrifices.
Two bombs exploded in Patong Beach, according to the paper.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga where one person was wounded according to the newspaper.
According to local authorities, the popular tourist destination Hua Hin has exploded four bombs yesterday and today.
At least one of them died in both double bombs.
In addition, in South Thailand, at least one bomb exploded in both towns of Surat Than and Trang.
At least one person died in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar with many tourists, as it is carried by Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao to the holiday islands.
Factor of attacks unknown
According to Prayut Chan-O-Cha, the leader of the military junta in Thailand, the perpetrators of the attacks are not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We shouldn't panic people more, he said to journalists.
According to Mr Prawit Wongsuwan, at least Hua Hin and Trang attacks are connected.
He told Thai BSB that the factors had been meant to destroy land tourism because all attacks had taken place in tourist destinations.
The Embassy of Finland calls on Finns in the country to be alert and avoid the most urgent tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for the Finns going to Thailand to cancel their journey because of explosions, but it is worth observing the instructions for caution, Westphale says.
Injured Europeans
The attacks and victims of Finland during the night are known very little for the moment.
Last night's attack in Hua Hin has a little bit more information.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, among whom at least nine foreign tourists.
There are at least Germans, Italians, Dutchs, and Austrians.
In Hua Hin's last attack, at least three people were wounded.
Two bombs exploded on a clock tower known as sightseeable.
Thai PBS tells us that the police have isolated Hua Hin from where they believe they have found another bomb.
Surat Than's bomb was hidden in a flower seat, according to the county governor.
In the attack, the municipal employee died.
There's at least one wounded.
The chief of police interviewed by the CNN tells us that Surat Than's attack also used two bombs exploding around half an hour.
Bangkok Post said the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
The United States Party won the women's four-game
The United States Alexandra Raisman was second at 60.098 and Russia Alija Mustafina the third at 58.665 points.
Biles, 18, are still in Rio's races for a rolling championship with a perman, jump and boom.
The party has managed women's strength in mind for the last few years.
She has eight personal world championships since the last three years.
He has won the four matches and the last and second years three times in succession.
In the United States team, Biles has achieved the World Championship of two team contests.
The Biles's got a lot of softer MM medals and jumps and booms.
Thai Finnish entrepreneur: "Isku has no effect on tourism"
Esa Huovila is not concerned about the impact of Thai bomb attacks on tourism by the Thai Real Estate and the play club for children in the same real estate.
If there are no more attacks, then I don't think this will be any more wonderful, considering Huovila, who worked in Asia for about 20 years as a Finnish entrepreneur.
The experienced entrepreneur has seen close to many of Thailand trials of tragedies.
There's always something here.
First was tsunami, then a bird influenza and last year a bomb attack in Bangkok.
If these former tourists have not been expelled, this is hardly even.
The Huovala company office is located in a few hundred meters from the explosion site.
Huovila heard about the attack from his own employee.
The employee called about nine local times and said not to come to the office.
Huovila says both the beach street and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work in the morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks were set for the Queen's birthday, Huovila says and refers to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
At Patong, the atmosphere was calm and the main street movements were allowed to open at about 10 o’clock local times.
A lot of people on the beach hadn't even heard about attacks.
Half three o'clock in Thailand’s time in Patong, the traffic was normalized and most of the stores had opened their doors.
According to the attack site, the explosion has been pretty small, Huovila says.
Later, this car was seen in the Crownshop in Jouxholmint.
When the police arrived, the car was fired.
The patrol spotted two men suitable for the sensors, hiding in a close six.
The other man was immediately captured.
The other one ran away, but the man was found in the woods later by means of a police dog.
Men are suspected of stealing, stealing and brutal damage to the motor vehicle.
The police thank you for the clues.
Director of Research on Russia's Changes in Directorate-General: Clear displacement
On Friday, a high-value change was made in Russia for years when President Vladimir Putin dismissed Sergei Ivanov, Head of Administration.
Ivanov's successor is a 44-year-old Anton Vaino.
He's a former diplomat and he's been the second man of Ivanov.
The Kangaspuro says that the reason for Ivanov’s separation may be Putin’s desire to prevent strong people from collecting too much power around him.
He adds that the recycling of management tasks is one way of power.
This is a way of preventing people from gaining an independent authority from the president.
It is also possible that Ivanov has been struggling with or screwed up with other leaders.
Armor dropping Ivanoville
Ivanov, a member of Putin's interior, moves to specific environmental and transport tasks.
On the tape presented by the public media, Putin called the transformation into a common decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other missions and proposed persecution to be replaced, said Russia Today.
The Kangaspuro says that from the Ivanov point of view it is a clear drop in position.
Environmental and transport matters are not very high in Russia's priority order.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of the Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the President's Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in KGB during the Soviet Union.
He was considered as a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became President.
Kangaspuro points out that the old card, such as governors, has recently been replaced in Russia.
The older researcher of Katri Pynnniemi from the Foreign Policy Institute says that more interesting than the heir to Ivanov's place is that Putin is changing his neighborhood to a younger one.
The Isis fighters used civilians as a human shield when they retired in Syria
They used civilians as a human shield when they fled to Jarabulus to avoid targeting them, said Sherfan Darwish, who is a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
The Arab and Kurdish fighters took over about 90 percent of the city of Manbij, which is important to Iss, last week.
However, it is estimated that there were dozens of jihadists left in the city.
Corrected earlier news at 7:30 p.m., we were mistakenly telling that civilians were fleeing the city, actually the Isis fighters kidnapped the civilians when they fled the city.
Professor: Publicity line of the Ministry of Interior is illegal
The policy of the Ministry of Interior is illegal, says Professor Tomi Voutilainen of the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutian tells the STT that the publicity of documents cannot be based on the authority's own lines, but it is based on the law.
The Ministry of Interior has previously refused to release the list of participants in the event of the Minister of Interior to Ilta-Sanom.
The Minister justified the decision by the guidance of the Government's Office and the fact that the information was recorded in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Ministerial Communication Director tells the STT that the Ministry has noticed the need to reform practices.
The final Olympics show at Usain Bolt starts in Rio
Like the last few years, Bolt has been running against time under the value races.
He insulted his backwards from the early season and had to skip the Olympics of Jamaica.
This hasn't been a perfect preparation, but I'm much better.
I've been practicing well, and that's the key thing, Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
The press conference included small-shaped samba dancers and fans.
Porina Bolt around it underlines the fact that the Jamaican star has risen in the time when general sports have been fighting with the dopingscandals and the spooky interest.
The previous defeat of Bolt at the Olympic Games came in Athens in 2004, when he retarded at 200 metres in the beginning of time 21.05.
At that time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise that slowed down the injuries and loosened your rehearsal position.
Four years later, in Beijing, his kingdom began with a hundred metres in which he crushed the world record and the final celebration of the competitors’ confidence.
It's harder.
A year later, at the Berlin MM race, Bolt reached his career at the clock.
World records born in Berlin at 9.58 hundred metres and 19.19 two hundreds are still in force.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is seeking a 200 metre world record and a 19-second subcontraction, but no one believes in its birth.
At 100, Bolt's most challenging is Justin Gatlin of the 100th Olympic Winner of Athens 2004.
Last year at the Beijing MM-final, Bolt defeated the American with only one hundred seconds.
Bolt has not lost once in the final of the values races in Beijing during his reign.
In January 2011, the MM-final of 100 left Bolt without running because of a blunt start.
Bolt fills in a lot of weeks after 30.
He's an old man in the young men's species, and Rio's races are his last Olympics.
Bolt has set the next year's MM contests in London as the last goal of the career.
These are the Olympics that fire me from others.
I'm older and this is harder.
But every time I'm underground, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in the Sports Illustrated interview.
Explosions of Rio: Two Athletes suspected of a doping crime
According to Xinhua, the Chinese Swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has provided a positive doping sample in the Olympics of Rio.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyin's doping sample found traces of prohibited substances.
A Bulgarian drinker named Silvia Danekova was also suspected of a doping crime.
In addition, a Kenya general sports coach was sent home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epo hormone.
He was located in Rio for the fourth time in the woman's 100 yards of butterfly.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estano, the Chinese bather has taken its doping case to refer to CAS at the International Tribunal for Sports.
Xinhua tells me that a sample given by Xiny on Sunday would have been shown in a diuretic hydrochlorothiazide.
There are also other doping doubts in Rio.
BBC news that Bulgarian female drinker Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epo hormone.
Kenia, on the other hand, has sent Rio a general sports coach home because of a doping stick.
On Thursday, the International Olympic Committee KOK reported that the Kenya coach had become an athlete in the test and had given a doping sample for this.
According to the media, it's a Kenya quick-run coach, John Anzrah.
According to Daily Mail, he had used Ferguson Rotich’s racepass for 800 metres in the situation.
There's nothing to stop Phelps... Historical gold came into the show style.
The most successful athlete in the Olympic history, the United States Michael Phelps swim in a 200-foot confusion of his 22th Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic Golds.
At the same time, Phelps first swim the Olympic Gold of the same species in the fourth successive races.
The time of Phelps' victory was 1.54.66.
Kosuke Hagino, Japan, was in a confusion, second before China Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have a little fun, and BBC's Olympics Commander Helen Skelton is laughing at the nightmare's quick interview.
The case about Helen Skelton (oik.) on Monday is the most reader of this week on the website of the evening magazine.
I'm next to the commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn't have much stress if there's a small spot in some of his exposing and special outfits in the British press.
You know, television is a visual media. He's stressing.
Skelton has dressed up in high-rate shoes and shorts, with at least enough explosiveness, for at least a number of conservative British views.
But there are no rear steps.
It's important that you look good, and small courts are just a funny thing.
I'm sure Skelton wants to shout and maybe he's scaring me, but he's stressing that he doesn't want to be in the main role.
This isn't about me, he says.
We're here to watch sports, and the focus must be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter how much I dress.
Can you imagine that the womb has risen until Finland?
I can't, but everything that focuses on how hard these swimmers do work and how big sacrifices they make is okay for me, Skelton's swinging.
You know what?
It's a foul out of nowhere, if it comes from (brainer) dressing.
I'm a little funny if this one's hit someone's radar.
Rio's police made two arrests for a terrorist suspect.
On Thursday, Rio's police told me that it's arrested two people because of a terrorist suspicion.
The police made arrests in connection with the security of the races.
In the same connection, the police made five other arrests and interviewed two people before they were released.
All suspects have been Brazilians.
According to the G1 news site, the persons arrested for terrorism are part of the same group, whose members were arrested by the police in July.
They think they have connections to the Isis Extreme Organisation.
The arrested were known to have caused violence in social media.
Vägivald messages were distributed, among other things, in the popular WhatsApp service.
The safety of Rio's races is responsible for 85,000 police.

Argentine's lady was decorated by the Deather-Siren, the Finnish spoke about protest.
Windfall Siren had a colorful competition day in Rio.
Windfall-Siren went through a lot on Thursday.
The Argentine lady hanged the Wind Fake Siren on Thursday in Rio at the opening of the women's surf day.
The wind was clearly broken.
The opponent admitted a breach.
He got stuck because of the accident, and the others ran away, said Finland's chief coach Joakim Wilenius.
The athlete considered protest for a long time.
Then it was not worth doing it, because it would have been worthless under the rules of the Olympics.
I should've dropped in the water so I could have gotten a credit, Mr. Siren said.
The Finnish man hanged on his desk until the last time he didn't want to get into Rio's dirty water.
The Finnishman, along with the crash, stayed in place of 27th.
In the overall situation, London’s Olympic Olympiahopeamist 2012 is eighth.
The accident had little effect in terms of suffering.
Friday is an important day for the race 10-12.
Modified 0.39: By way of derogation from the first information, detainee-Siren did not protest.
7 special things that science says to extend the age
Science has studied everything possible between earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to bring extra years to a person's life.
Some of these are ways that directly or indirectly affect the health of a person so that his life lasts.
Sometimes things that cannot be influenced by a person itself can bring him more years.
These include a tendency to middle body obesity or social status.
Regular shopping can extend the age.
There's always no need to smash up... just to get a milk can.
The secret of a long age has been sought by many different studies.
Medical Daily presented seven of the most strange research results.
According to science, all these things may bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee drink has been shown to be protected from cancer, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.
The study at Harvard University found that moderate coffee consumption is linked to a "small risk of death", especially with regard to neurologic or heart-based diseases.
Again, on behalf of the alcohol, the investigations that suggest reasonable use of one to three daily doses may increase life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular dental wire use may extend the life of a person for more than six years, one research reports.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents the inflammation of the genitals.
They can, however, contribute to the outbreak of other diseases in another human body.
A study in Norway found out how laughing had an impact on human life.
The seven-year project observed over 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were more nerves than 35 per cent more likely to be alive after the end of the experiment.
Sex, when sexual protection is taken into account, according to many studies, is good for health.
Besides everything, it can also extend the age.
Unfortunately, just having sex as a person is not enough.
To give a person more years of life, he must also receive an orgasm.
Of course, mobility brings extra years, and it is not controversial.
However, long-term attainment does not require absolute solacticity.
In fact, a study at Oxford University found that women with a large buttock had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their body.
The same study combined these factors with lower mortality.
It was then an Olympic athlete or Oscar's winning actor who was more likely to live farther than an ordinary bull.
A lot of research has been trying to find a reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitionful person is likely to live in a way that brings his life for years.
Some of the researchers suspect that the long-term is the result of a person's social status, which, for example, contributes to the pursuit of confessions such as the Nobel Prize.
The study on the purchase behaviour of over 65 years of age found that a person who shops daily, which is likely to become a lesser parent.
This is due to a reduction in loneliness in concrete shops.
It has been found again to trigger biological mechanisms that may cause death to occur.
So you count your credit card on your hand, the net slot doesn't have the same effect.
The Umpihuman Drinking Drinks fell in the direction of the truck.
On Friday night, there was a serious truck and passenger car stove at the Koske in Finland.
The accident occurred at Koskente, Koskente and Sorvastonte in the middle of Friday at 2 p.m.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when the passenger car received had drove on the same strip, hitting the right corner of the truck.
After the crash, the truck fell up, but it burned.
The driver managed to shut down the fire himself.
The passenger car slipped across the roof.
A woman who was born in 1972 who carried a passenger car stayed in his car.
The Rescue Institute removed the injured driver's car and was transported to Turku University Centre Hospital.
The result of a woman's blowing test was 2.02 proms.
He's suspected of a brutal ride.
The mail sent some stamps to the wrong city.
There were deficiencies in the range of Salon K-Citymarket’s bulk candy because the mail had accidentally delivered some of the load to the Seinäjoki.
On Thursday, Teija Halti, who lives in the potato, was buying salon K-Citymarket, when a fun sign was hit.
Unfortunately, there are product deficiencies in the bulk because the Posti delivered our load to the Wall River!
We'll get more when the Post gets the load delivered!
So if you don't rush in a lawn cut, it was written on the sign.
The sign of the trader is linked to the fact that the Posti expanded its services last spring to the grass cut.
The grass cut is available at the Post until the end of August.
Haltia thought the sign was mostly amusing and decided to share it in social media.
The popularity of the update hit me with a disgust.
Even the media representatives have been calling all the time, and the attention raised in this matter is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday night, the update of Haltia had over 700 divisions on Facebook.
Her own favourites were caught in a sachet, even though a few bars were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, responsible for the business of business transport services of companies, regretted the damage to Ilta-Sanom.
The background is that three of the five stages were distracted yesterday to the wrong place (Seinajoki) and we no longer left to perform a part-time (Salao) by three, but we only took five stages today, and Kaidesoja told the evening to Sanom.
It's the first news about the evening word.
The show Halt was not upset by the sign because he found all his own bulk candy favourites in the selection.

You're amazing.
At the same time, we're on our way, the motivation is hard!
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in making it now.
I'm going to get a lot of power and passion from your images, while the skies themselves are on the same road, the other one tells me.
In the spring Lotta dropped the last pounds, let's do it now.
At that time, he told the evening magazine that he wanted to finally get to the normal weight, which was 10 pounds.
During three months of gymnastics, five pounds eventually fell.
Wishing of a woman who was murdered in a wise manner: the memories of the victim for police dogs
A week ago, the family of a 42-year-old woman who was murdered in Loviis hopes that the victim would be remembered instead of flowers and recipients by donation for police work.
Sipoon Veterinary Station has published a Facebook update in which it will provide the victim’s family’s wish for donations for police dogs.
The publication states that the victim had worked as a substitute for the Sipoon Veterinary Station and also carried out his nurse’s training there.
The veterinarian's station reminds me of the words that touch the woman.
Happy, smart, sense of humor, and work is scary.
Good friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number to which donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that donation funds are all going to police dogs, primarily for the purchase of security flags.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old lobby woman was murdered in her own homeyard in Loviisa Koskenkyla.
The woman's neighbors have told her that the victim was very loved by animals.
He owned several animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and flower.
A 27-year-old man suspected the murder didn't know a woman, and he didn't have anything to do with each other.
The murderer was tracked by a police dog Börje, who was injured in a life-threatening state of arrest.
Börje, however, survived and is recovering.
The right to governor was sentenced to Post for infringement of the Equality Act
The post had no right to arrest the salary of a refusaled worker for the training of the tenant, assessing the Court of Justice of Kanta-Häme in his judgment.
Post ordered him to pay the majority of his salary and EUR 2 000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have arrested only a part of the salary of the inquiry that corresponded to the share of the study throughout the day.
According to the law of the hierarchy, the employee was placed less favourable on the basis of his trade union activities, contrary to the Act of Equality.
The worker had complied with the Union for Postal and Logistics in the PAU’s organisational decision on the prohibition of inquiry.
During the last year's November postal strike, PAU decided that postal workers are not familiar with temporary workers who have breached the strike.
The people's news told me about it first.
Returning Turkey to the path that respects human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights development, write by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Minister of Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (ps.) in response to the Journalist Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (kesk) and Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (ps) agree on the situation in Turkey's human rights.
In his letter, the Journalists Association asked Sipila and Soin to express their concerns about Turkish freedom of expression and press.
Sipi and Soini repeatedly pointed out to Turkey the importance of freedom of expression and press.
Putin fired the head of his regime to replace the Estonian persecution.
The Russian President, Vladimir Putin, has dismissed Sergei Ivanov, Head of Presidential Administration, says Kremlin.
The Soviet-Viro Communist Director, Karl Vaino's grandson, Anton Vaino, will be replaced.
The persecution is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
The persecution will also be a member of the Russian Security Council, the news office Interfax tells us.
Vladimir Putin fired his regime chief.
According to the Kreml Communication, Ivanov, which is part of Putin's close interior, will move to specific environmental and transport tasks.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had requested a transfer to other missions and proposed persecution to be replaced, Russia Today says.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union in spying KGB.
Many viewed Ivanov as a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became President.
Ivanov was appointed President in 2011 before Putin's re-election in 2012.
BBC: ManU's giggling for a ban on the game, you can't see at the opening of Valioliiga
The world recorder of football transfers will not be seen on the field when the English Valioliiga is kicked off this weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban was followed by England.
Due to the ban on the game, the Manchester United is on the page of Manufacturing his league against Bournemouth on Sunday, BBC reported on Friday.
According to the British media, the Italian Society Juventus paid EUR 105 million to Pogba.
However, the UK Football Association FA keeps him out of the game because Pogba had a ban on Juvenus as a burden.
He received two warnings in the last season of the Italian cup, and it becomes a single ban.
That ban on the game has been transferred to England. The FA told BBC.
Pogba's next seam is in the second round of the league, 19 August, when ManU meets Southampton.
In Flow, the madness of size is good.
The precise criteria and ambitious visions of entertainment have established the role of Flow Festival as an internationally respected event, which the world's top arts are targeting.
Flow Festival starts in Helsinki on Friday.
Festars have typically expressed themselves by their own dress.
One of the top artists is this year, punk-legenda Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival event area is stylished with artificial grass and art instillations, among other things.
We have never had enough to have only beer and strawberry, says the artistic director of the event, Tuomas Kallio.
The Flow Festival in Helsinki Suvilahde this weekend has grown from a small block festival to tens of thousands of visitors.
In the background of success, there is a simple question: What kind of event would the authors themselves want to go?
It's kind of unusual to think this way.
Often, the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and act in accordance with the provisions of the authorities, says the artistic director of the event, Tuomas Kallio.
He knew a week before the event that Flow was coming to sell this year to the end.
The goal has been to increase the number of visitors over the last year by 5 000 people.
Festars are also seen this year by a number of interesting domestic and foreign artists.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because it is somewhat necessary to finance the activities.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point, the mass would be like a flock of cattle that is guided in the vast routes.
That's what we don't want.
The ideals of the successful event have been evolved over 13 years so that there are 130 performers, art instillations, and numerous restaurant points and drinks.
In addition to the main ferry and the smaller stages, this year the tent of 15 000 people will be the destination.
Kallio admits that the event could be implemented more easily.
Maybe I'm a little mad at size, but at the same time, we've been able to keep Flow's life.
If it disappears, this isn't about us anymore.
The greatest joy and reward for the work done to the Rock is that today there are also great visions that are practically possible.
During the early years of the event in the mid-2000s, the activities were very dependent on the aid of about EUR 20 000 in the City of Helsinki.
Last year, the turnover of the Flow shareholder company amounted to approximately EUR 6 million.
It can lead to "creepy things" like the construction of that 73 metre wide tent.
Flow's visitors have typically expressed themselves by their own dress.
In addition to the music event, we can talk about the community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not been known to be a particularly fashionable profile.
We want to be separated, above all, with the contents.
Yet the fashion phenomena also match the value world of Flow: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the top artists is a penk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
A man has a huge crowd of fans in his own genre, but he's not the most typical performer indierock, pop music, rape and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was busted, because it is probably the last time we see this job in Finland.
We're all interested in history and future.
Not just what's being played on commercial radio.
Iggy's last record is damn good, and he's been doing some damn good work in the last few years.
The bombs of the Thai tourist paradise were hidden in the flower bags, and tourists fled in their horrors.
In Hua Hin, two bombs exploded on the local time of Thursday night.
At least one local woman died in the attack and over 20 were injured.
The bombs were probably hidden in a flower bag and blown up by cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of which are foreigners.
They were exploded at the same time as tourists started leaving bars and returned to their hotels, told the police representative Samoer Yoosumra, according to CNN.
From 1989 in Asia, Edwin Wiek, the protector of wild animals, clinged a great picture of the attacks.
If you don't see the TV properly, you can watch it from here.
Hua Hin was at least 11 foreign tourists.
The people ran against me and said that the bomb has exploded at the bars.
It was one of the biggest bar streets, told the Swedish secretary Emelie Olsson Aftonbladet.
The next morning, the local time exploded two bombs in Surat Than.
At least one of them died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon after this, the Finns also favored Phuket's island exploded two bombs.
No one is known to be dead.
At the same time, there was another double bombing in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three wounded.
In addition, one bomb exploded in Trang City.
The police told me that they found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that hadn't been able to explode yet.
According to the Thai authorities, there are probably rebel forces behind the bombings that are not satisfied with the action of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, there may also be criminal organisations.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently been harshly involved in the activities of criminal organisations engaged in trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new standby forces begins to fight first in the wartime.
In the acute war situation, guardians will only be ordered for battle assignments after several months of the conspiracy of the military light, says the Central Finnish.
According to the head of Defence Force Training, Brigadier General Jukka Sonnis, for example, 5,5 months of military attendance are only those who are at the end of their education.
According to the Head of Education, the reserves belonging to the emergency force are first assigned to the service.
No guardian or reserver is ordered for a mission that has not been trained, says Sonninen.
Earlier in summer, the Defense Forces started to train armed men for immediate capabilities from next year.
Units may, if necessary, be used in military activities during military training.
Pamela Tola got the giant allowance from the home house.
Actor Pamela Tola and his ex-husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a hard fight at the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The trade price of a two-step separate house had been EUR 330 000.
However, after trade, there was a serious moisture problem in the house, which caused health-threatening microbial growth.
The couple had to sell the dwelling in purchasing condition in 2014.
The sales price had fallen to EUR 132 000, so the financial losses for Tola and Waroma amounted to EUR 198 000.
The couple took the case to court and demanded a discount from the seller.
The salesman refused the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in court and court.
The court delivered a judgment on Wednesday.
It held the judgment of the Court of Justice, which ordered the seller to pay Tola and Waroma for a discount of EUR 150 000.
In addition, the seller will have to reimburse the costs of the couple’s proceedings and investigations totalling EUR 47 344.
The right to a reasonable price reduction slightly, since some of the need to repair the dwelling had already been known by buyers in the course of the sale of the dwellings.
However, according to court law, the missing construction errors were essentially more serious than had been reported.
Tola was looking for homes for good homes.
Tola told me in court that the couple had specifically searched for homes for decent homes because they did not want to take up repairs.
He had been born with the idea that the building was fixed and in good condition and that the points mentioned in the fitness check report are no harm.
The fitness audit report mentioned the risk and inadequacy of ventilation and the lack of adequate control of rain and melting waters flowing along the rocks.
However, the discussions did not indicate that this would have been a matter of urgency.
Tola and Waroma agreed that rainwater from the rock might need some control over a few years.
Commerce was made in October 2009.
In a few years, it appeared that the moisture problems of the apartment were much more serious than thought.
In 2012 and 2013, microbial growth was found in the building, according to witnesses, due to both rock rainwater and capillary rainfalls.
On the west side of the house, the air that microbes polluted could also be reached indoors by the inspector’s assessment.
A healthy risky, cross-border bucket or ski was found in wing samples in the housekeeping room, in the basement staircase, in the living room window evaporator and in the basement washing room.
The terraces were built without permission.
The court also challenged whether the housing was extended against the construction permit.
The Court held that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision of the City of Espoo that there had been any anti-authorisation changes in the housing.
Among other things, the terraces were built, even though there were no appropriate permits.
However, home problems were a key issue in the court.
According to court law, the purchasers could assume from the seller, on the basis of the information they received before the trade, that the building was fit to live as such and that there was no need for measurable repairs in the near future.
In the opinion of the Court of Justice, there was no particular reason to carry out more extensive inspections.
Buyers have not neglected their accountability, the court has stated in their judgment.
A creepy archive discovery: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to have children for the Nazis - in the register also Finns
In his recent Dagens Nyheter article, journalist Christopher Andersson writes about the records recorded for microfilms in the National Archives of the United States of America in Maryland, with a total of 218 500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
Most women are Germans, but they also include Americans, French, Dutch and Russian.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian, 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted to be Nazi Morsiame.
Documents and registration cards are from the Nazi-German Race Agency.
The Race Agency was under the authority of the SS Director Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he was studied by the SS doctor.
The same was even more likely for women who had to be able to bear up to 10 children.
According to Andersson, women were undergone gynecological studies to investigate the matter.
The Racial Office investigated the backgrounds of women, among other things, by studying church books.
The purpose was to ensure that there were no Jews in the family tree.
Women also had to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and to give the Racial Agency handwritten life stories and good recommendations to the closest.
The Racial Office wanted guarantees that women were "children", "suppressed" and "good national socialists" who knew very German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as the bride of SS men.
The case does not tell us what happened to 14 Finnish women found in the archives.
The SS leaders created a programme supported by the State, known as Lebensborn, in 1936.
The programme, among other things, stipulated that each SS man should have four children, either in marriage or outside it.
The homes of Lebensborn take care of the children born outside the marriage and their mothers.
However, the programme was not very actively promoted; the U.S. Holocaust Museum sites are reported.
Instead, the population policy of the Nazis focused on family and marriage.
The State encouraged marriage by offering loans and support for children.
The German mother’s honor cross was awarded to women who had received at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, the marriages between the "Arians" and the "non-Arians" were legally prohibited, the museum’s pages were recorded.
On the sixth of Siren, the Nigger rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko was the third sailing Finnjolls the first departure of the day at the Rio Olympics, but the whole crowd remained the tail top of the second day leaving.
In the overall situation, the nigger rose eighth after five departures, but the failure of the second exit dropped him in place of 14.
Windfall-Siren fought positions 17 and three at the departures of the RS:X class day.
In the overall situation, Faithful-Siren is the sixth.
Jonas and Niklas Lindgren in 470 were left in the opening of the day.
In the overall situation, the Lindgrens are in position of 19.
Jari Sillan Head Satulinna was recorded for a couple of hours at night, "I was so in a canvass"
Jari Sillanpää has been part of Finnish favorite arts for more than 20 years.
From a cruise ship to a tango king of 1995, a solo artist best sold by Finland, and as the stars of the dance stages and festivals, the Sillan head continues to porsque and he is currently in a vicious lift.
The book about the life of the favorite singer, written by Mari Koppisen, Jari Bridgehead, was published today on Thursday.
In the book, Sillanpää tells about her life and career in both good and bad.
As he won the Tang king's crown in the Tango market in 1995, the career of the bridge began to rise to a total increase.
In the race, Sillanhead sang tangos, but he had already designed a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuopamäki had composed a tango piece on the bridge at the request of a man, which Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different form.
The Satulinna piece became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book says, however, that the recording of the song didn't go exactly according to the plan: the bridge head sang it on a tape in a terrible hangover and only after a few hours of nights.
We had a party tonight.
I was so in the pot!
It's like a bridge head in the book.
You wouldn't think it'd have been singing in a hangover.
Even though I wasn't physically the best I ever had, it was still good.
I learned that all the time, it is not necessary to demand perfect and excellence.
The second incident related to the most popular songs of a man, reported in the book, occurred almost twenty years later.
In 2013, the Sillanpää separated from its partner and the case ended in the end, too, you deserve gold texts that were published in the single year 2014.
The book tells us that the songs ordered from Saara’s Collect were not the same as the Sillan Head would have wanted.
The bridge head had imagined being making a record that tells the true story of his own life, but the words of the copy of the difference were not true, but it was written on the basis of the news of the magazine for 7 days.
The news of Jar and the ex-loving difference was explained by the excessive celebration and alcohol consumption of Jar, but according to Jar, it was a full bunny and was not true.
The book says Jari was mad at the record company and refused to sing the song, but eventually it ended up singing it, and that's good.
In June, the British also surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
Finally, 52% of the voters were in favour of the difference and 48% would have remained in the Union, even if the opinion measurements of the vote week anticipated the opposite result.
The British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of keeping in the EU.
No appreciated research institute or university flagged the difference, although a couple of individual scientists had to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The thesis "It's the economy, stupid" in the British Brexit vote of the United States' former President Bill Clinton's recent election campaign.
The economists were shocked when their voice wasn't heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not appear to be the most important issue of politics.
Economic collar language
Centre for Macroeconomics tivaa in its latest monthly survey from the professionals to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that the economists were not listened, because this time the electorates made a decision on non-economic grounds.
One of the economists' explanations for the loss of economic status is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the idea that the number of jobs is independent of the number of workflowers, so it is almost standard.
If the immigrant gets a job, it's out of the right British.
Many also believe that the depreciation of the currency would be a good thing because it promotes the export industry.
In the view of the Economy, the voters did not believe economic arguments because the consensus of the economists was not sufficiently expressed.
In particular, the equitability of the BBC, which gave only a few per cent of the economy, to economic scientists who benefit from the EU's difference, as to the overwhelming majority.
The EU-inspired press was not interested in telling what the IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other economic specimens on the consequences of the difference are.
Those distant combinations spoke facelessly about economic growth, trade relations, government debt and currency.
And if economists were both listened and understood, they were not communicated because economists represent an elite with which voters do not feel that they have common interests.
The academics of major cities such as economists would have remained in the EU, but the message in small cities and rural areas did not work.
Immigration is also an economy
The overwhelming profit argument of the Brexit vote was about immigration.
The immigrant will take your job, the immigrant will rush your hospital, the immigrant will use you.
These arguments worked.
Every café has foreign workers.
How much more jobs would the British have if they left?
Every health centre's waiting room sees immigrants.
How much easier would the British get medical times if they weren't there?
There are children of immigrants in every school.
How much easier would the real British kids get a school place if they got rid of them?
Every community lives foreigners.
How much more space would the indigenous people have if they left?
I believe that these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, the economists failed to respond to them, and if they succeeded, their answers did not receive visibility.
Economists failed to explain that, thanks to immigrants, the British have more jobs, less health centre lines and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and, in particular, EU immigrants - are net British public finances and their consumption generate jobs.
The Aberdeen Real Estate Fund was reserved for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was the Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are responsible for Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
He said that Aberdeen was prepared in time for Brexit by drawing up plans A and B.
Plan B, i.e. the profit of the EU-providing camp, started to be more prepared a few weeks before the vote in case of leave.
The concern was that investors would start withdrawing their funds from the market.
Real estate funds do not normally have large liquid assets, but now they might be necessary.
We went to raise cash.
When Brexit took place on 23rd day, we had 25% of the investment in cash or liquid funds in the Fund, the old man says the only open daily notebook of the real estate fund that was covered by the news.
According to the old man, the normal level would be 15-20 per cent.
The value of the fund was 3.5 billion GBP at the time.
The total value of the company's funds is about GBP 20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, the old man says about all the Open Real Estate Funds in Britain.
He estimates that the lowest cash in these funds was 10% or even below it.
Thus, the building funds reserved very different strategies for Brexit.
Financing closed trade
When the camp wins the difference between the EU, Europe went nuts.
However, the few two weeks following the vote on the real estate market were quite calm, the Old One says.
Then there were two things that changed the situation.
The first was Mark Carney, the President of the Central Bank of England, who estimates that Brexit could be a major risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, frozen its trade.
These together robbed the situation and brought it to the headlines of Financial Times and BBC.
The situation was immediately compared with the years 2007 and 2008, says the old man.
This made the investors nervous.
The institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
Snowball started spinning, and the fund afterwards had to close its doors.
The situation in Aberdeen was good because of the cash collected, but it also eventually had to freeze its trade for six days.
According to the old man, they did not actually close the trade, but changed the pricing downwards.
In practice, the investors were given time to consider whether the money is now worth pulling out in the panic.
The message from Aberdeen was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it's not worth it, because it would result in losses.
It calmed down the situation, and most of them canceled the report.
After that, it was quite smooth, and now the market has been very calm for a couple of weeks, old man tells me.
He pointed out that, for example, the Manner European Funds in Aberdeen have not had any similar repercussions.
However, a lot of questions came.
Unreasonable attention to real estate funds
The old man believes that the closure of real estate trading was unreasonable.
The most open funds covered by the closures govern approximately four per cent of the British real estate.
The closure of Aberdeen lasted six days and the company sold less than ten properties from 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it might hold its funds on half of 2017.
At the moment, there is uncertainty in the air and economic growth forecasts have been cut down, but the situation does not appear to be "stronger" for Aberdeen.
The main issues are now about the future development of the British economy.
Despite uncertainty, the situation has even brought some new opportunities from real estate investors, the Older points out.
The rate of GBP and dollar is at the lowest in 30 years, and the market has a 15% discount sales compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
The dollar buyer can now buy the same property up to 30 per cent cheaper.
There's a lot of people to buy, old man says.
Brexit brought mines to the London real estate market
It didn't look so good at two o'clock in the morning.
But at 4:00, when Pertti Vanhanen, who was responsible for Aberdeen Asset Management's real estate investment in the British Real Estate Fund, came back to see the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
The word of power was in it.
I realized that this is going to the plan B now, the Old Man says in his second home in Helsinki.
He just went to work.
London City was already fully alive despite the morning's sleep.
At the office, the TV screens normally set out to be silent supported the news, and usually the loud people slowed down to listen fully when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera in the morning to tell his divorce.
When the market opened, the screen ends flashed just red.
It was one of those mornings that you would never have thought you'd live, the Old One says.
Not because, despite the sale, Aberdee, one of the largest British real estate funds, finalised two real estate trades on the day after the Brexit vote.
The tunnel was confusing.
However, the company had well prepared the option, and therefore the situation was kind of calm, the Old One says.
The Brexit vote started the correction movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, the British leader went to change.
The market started to predict severe falls in the UK and, in particular, the London real estate market.
There were up to 20% of mines in London’s office facilities in the coming years.
Soon, a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trade once and for all.
Even Aberdee did that for six days.
Now the storm is slowed down, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
However, it does not show its last summer holidays on the faces of the Old People who spent in Helsinki this week.
He still thinks it is too early to say much about what comes from Brexit.
So much is still open: how the difference occurs and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
First information has already been received on the development of the London real estate market.
The CBRE data on price developments in the real estate service company cover approximately a third of the market.
According to them, the prices of all London buildings fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City's office buildings, the minus accumulated by 6.1 per cent, the old man listed.
The figures are not so bad, but they are months' changes.
The monthly index was launched in 1987, and only five months have had worse figures, says the old man.
All equal falls hit the 2007 and 2008 crisis years.
It is interesting, therefore, that Brexit was relatively quickly compared with the fall of Lehman and the global economic crisis from the US real estate markets.
The old man thinks that the parable is not quite a match, as this is a domestic crisis in Britain.
The tunnel is another.
The building market has now not seen such a panic sale as that time, but the willingness to sell to improve liquidity, the old man says.
There's a financial guarantee, too.
The repair movement could have been ahead in any case.
In fact, it's not a miracle for him to redeem prices... that could've been before without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen’s estimate, property prices in London and other world-wide cities have been too high for years.
We've been saying for two years that City and especially the offices are overpriced, old man says.
So the fall started really high.
London's prices have risen up for four reasons, the Old One's list.
The British economy has grown strongly, the population of London as well.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last category of ownership that is globalised, old man says.
New players have become marketed in the Middle East and Asia, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investment sites abroad.
London is an easy target as a well-known city.
In addition, prices have been fed by a low level of interest, which, for example, has led pension companies to seek profits from new destinations.
The loan has been readily available on this point - although, according to the Old People, the debt line has now been used clearly less than during the boom preceding the 2008 crisis.
Disperse. Disperse.
In London, the price increase was settled last summer, the old man tells me.
Even Aberdeen began to reduce its ownership in London, and last year he was a net salesman.
There was some kind of turning that could be expected, and now it came.
What's going on now?
It depends on how the British economy develops, the Old One says.
He's not afraid to estimate much for the future, but he says that there's hardly any rising moment.
The tunnel suggests that there is a downward or a steady way ahead of us.
The old man has already seen more movements up and down since 1988 in the real estate sector.
And still, he's an optimist who thinks they're gonna get out of the hole with work.
If you're well prepared for risks, you're in a better position.
He believes in global decentralisation.
If you've invested in one market, there's too much of a victim.
If you've been decentralised, the risks are also decentralised, the old man says.
The S Group will start registering more about the purchase information before
Soon the S Group will know what you're eating, because today the Trade Group told me that it would start collecting more accurate information about buying their customers.
Up to now, when information has been collected on the final amount of receipt, the group begins to fish it from the purchased products at the beginning of May.
The S group is coming here after Kesko, because the data of goods purchased with a plus card has been collected in Kesko's customer register for a few years.
According to K-Plus Oy's CEO Ismo Riitalan, the feedback from the programme has been mainly positive.
The product-specific data shall be collected with the agreement of the customer and shall be authorised to be used for marketing.
The most effective channel is e-mail.
Pretty few customers have banned the use of product information, Riitala says to Economic addresses.
He says Kesko is not going to react to the change in the registration of the S group.
Kesko already ranks his client in ten groups, according to the only dining shops.
The classification shall be updated on a monthly basis.
Stock clients are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount used therein.
The data are used for the targeted marketing of the customer.
Product-specific purchasing data are collected only from the K-group's own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, are not giving up their information.
Lidl Finland has no customer programme and is not planned at this time.
Finland's close trade has its own one-bonus customer programme, which can be associated with Selection Houses, Siwai and Euromarkets.
We are currently not collecting information on product or product group levels, we are staying at the final amount of receipt.
So we know where the purchases were made and what day, and the final amount of the client's receipt.
We haven't gone to the level like the K-group or the S-group, says commercial leader Anu Ora.
According to him, the stock customer programme is to be reformed in the future, but the Middle Trade will tell us later.
However, Ora does not promise that the product information should be registered.
Initial experiment
Even so, the SOK customer owner and customer register has been relatively wide.
In addition to personal and address information, the basic information included profession, education, the form of residence, and the births of children and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same economy and their role are also registered.
The purchase date and time, place, the total amount of purchases and the method of payment has been recorded.
In addition, information on S-bonus partners has been obtained from their cash systems.
From the beginning of May, the purchase data at the product level will begin to be deposited in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, the S-markets, Prisms, Kodin Terros and ABC chains are currently recorded at product group level.
For a long time, customers have been hoping that marketing could be further targeted, says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of Customer owners and Partners of the SOK.
The S group says they're informing their customers about the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing purposes.
However, the information is stored in the bags anyway, wanted it or not.
You can check your information on the S-group website.
For example, the cashes can't access the information, emphasises the Saarikosk.
Video: Heila-doll is Tulli's latest dog confirmation - the pen becomes the first explosive dog
The black labrador utility kid shovels vigorously five similar boxes in the row at Helsinki Airport.
It won't take long when it sits firmly next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards her dog Heila to play it with her favorite toy.
From the box next to which Heila sat, a bottle of shells were exposed to the carpet gas.
The gas is the first smell that has been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, the owner of the Heila dog.
Security and access to online trade
Heila is the first dog specialized in the search for weapons and explosives in Tulli and is placed to work at the Helsinki Airport next year.
Working tasks may also take Heila and Suntio to other border crossing points and ports.
However, the airport will be the main job in Heila because the international security situation has changed due to serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels caused measures in Tull and after the attacks have been confirmed, says Mikko Grönberg, the superinspector of Customs.
Another access to training for weapons and explosives is posts through Helsinki Airport.
With an increased internet trade, up to 40 million postal shipments are available annually through the airport, including foreign weapons and explosives.
In recent years, the customs duty has made online trades in purchases, passenger cargo baggage and air cargo in Helsinki Airport about 300 weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives, as well as their source.
Heila will work across Helsinki Airport.
It's gonna look into registered baggage and mail.
In the ports it will be a great benefit in the future when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more accurate research, says Grönberg.
On the basis of Heila's performance, Customs evaluated whether more weapons and explosives will be trained in the future.
Grönberg hopes to respond to the idea.
School in Kirkkonumme
The training of Heila puppy is coordinated by the School of Dogs in Kirkkonumme.
Suntio is also taking training with Heila at the police and defence force experts.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and the defense forces with expertise in explosives.
Customs decide together with other authorities what smells Heila is taught to identify.
You will always be trained further if necessary, says Grönberg.
Heila's colleagues at Helsinki Airport have six drug dogs in Tulli and a cash and drug dog Massi.
The Labrador Dr. Heila has been chosen from the ten puppy puppies.
The selection criteria for the dog to be selected at the airport include a raft and a hunting ticket, as well as peace, because the dog is dealing with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntion's home, is a close colleague to the customs inspector, but also a family member.
Without Heila, there's nothing going on at home, Suntio is laughing.
The subtle orders will come to Heila from the batch.
The cameraman of the night-sanomas loses a camera cover for a quick dog, but Heila restores a toy-looking protection immediately from the hand of the "irti" command.
Hard competition for dogs at work
Heila's initial training will be completed next year.
There are still Level Tests ahead, next October, which will assess whether training is sufficient for the required workplace.
Heilan can see in work tasks at Helsinki Airport on the next half of the year, if everything goes according to the plan.
Sadly, passengers cannot come to silence the working vests on the dog, reminding Suntio.
The cost of one working dog is approximately EUR 60000-70000 per year.
Their working age is about seven or eight years, even ten, after which they retire to their owners.
Working days can be long, between eight and ten hours, but the active working shares can only last from 10 minutes to a few hours.
The owner of the dogs is a tough competition in Tull.
Well, Heila owned about 20-30 Customs employees.
Happiness hit the Suntion site that has never had a dog before, but he has years of experience with dogs and surveillance tasks in Tull.
The Mini state received its first Olympic Medal... the people will have a day off.
The Rugby Olympic Gold in Fiji of less than a million inhabitants is so highly appreciated that the government has ordered the 22th August national holiday.

Drama in Rio - the Finnish artist fainted after the brutal performance
Milko Tokola, the weight donor, succeeded in his last attempt of 175 pounds after a hard fight.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature as a lifter.
In the course of severe lifts, or immediately after them, he has passed out several times.
No one really knew why.
Tokola was pushed in Rio by 175 pounds and a stunt of 145 pounds.
His overall result was 320 pounds.
Tokola tried to get his job at the last time, 175 pounds, just like the other one.
With the third company, the weights rose as a giant shouting.
The body trembled under weight until the judge accepted the lift.
The joy of the Finnish advocate was the fact that he had suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquired the Estonian Eagle Prosan - Betting Liga - Ilta-Sanoma
The Rovaniemi Palloseura, playing in men's football league, has concluded a lasting agreement with Albert Prosa, the Estonian assassin.
We are looking for the top player in our team with power and the threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi is small.
We went through more than ten players agents across the world.
A small number of people began to be separated as a good option, Prosa, Coach of RoPS, Juha Malinen, told me in the release.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from a winter Flora where he made a total of 51 goals in 109 matches.
He has also played in the Estonian country team.
Prosan is supposed to be with RoPS on Saturday at the Seinäjoki where the Rovaniemeans meet the dominant Finnish master SJK.
RoPS needed a new attacker when the last season's goal king Aleksandr Kokko moved to Australia.
The threaten Modern Family Star meets again: Tennis Star Shorts reveal almost everything
As the modern Family Comedy series nicely known as Alex Dunphyna, Ariel Winter will regain his brilliant body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in minihorses that don't leave much for imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's legs but also the back of this.
18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by making his style and behaviour much more bold.
The star has pose in pictures of the social media that he has published very few clothes and has taken a number of tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen to wear very weak clothes.
Winter has recently also published several pictures of himself celebrating.
If you don't see the picture, you can look at it from here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter changed his publicity image so radically.
In this case, the founder of PowerwomenTV and CEO Amy Palmer suspected that Winter had a "typical Hollywood transformation" from a child star to an adult.
He's been on TV almost all his life and has grown during the period of Kardashian.
He's learned that the more explosions show, the more publicity and attention in Hollywood, Palmer tells Fox News and adds that the exact same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started in the Modern Family series only 11 years old.
The actor has upset some of his long-term fans with his image change.
It's not hard to know where he's in ten years, when he's already so tough, a woman in Winter's Instagram says.
Instead, some of the women's fans defend the actor and asks not to care about criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what the others say.
You're an inspiration for many women, a young woman.
The Japanese prefer the Nordics to Finland - tourists are attracted to the desert: in the autumn, it is possible to see a fairy mirror aurora
The aim of the campaign is to attract the Japanese to commence their trips from the beginning of the fall, Visit Finland will tell you in the brochure.
Inari and Levi are the main destinations of the Japanese Tournament.
Revonfire is the articulated cards of our winter travel, and they are strongly combined with the heart winter and snowy landscapes.
In the winter of Lapland, there is a great demand, but we are now trying to increase the sale of autumn trips.
Hardly people know that the fountain begins from autumn and goes on to the spring.
In the autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the revontules from the vision of making two-layered, explains Visit Finland, see marketing manager Anne Lind.
Visit Finland’s main target group is wealthy 25-35 years old, Japanese women living in the city who are dreaming of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland, including online advertising.
According to the survey conducted by researchers from Aalto University, Turku and Tokyo University, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive image of the Japanese in comparison with other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would need clearer unique attractions from Finland, and Lind said that this revonut has enormous potential.
The nights spent by Japanese tourists in Finland have grown clearly more than other Nordic countries.
Last year, they spent more than twice in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interested in Finnish tourism as a target group, as they spent over EUR 80 million in Finland.
The average Japanese spent EUR 183 a day in Finland, says Lind.
Great Britain had to be satisfied with silver in the rugby-7 contest when the Fidz champion team won gold
The impressive success of the United Kingdom in the seven players' rugby contest was crushed when Fidzi won it on Thursday in the final of Rion Deodoro Stadium, 43-7.
Fidzi gave masters a lesson in ball treatment, transfers, side depositions, support games, running lines and brutal power, and won gold — if it was the first Olympic medal in all of its history.
Death meant silver, which was a slightly thin comfort to Britain, for it was the third silver of the country on the same day. They may be proud of their success as the Olympic race for the first time in the rugby-7 tournament, where the team won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The strong profit from the South African Boks was calculated by 7 to 5 semifinals earlier on the same day, which could have been negatively influenced by the team in the finals.
Nevertheless, Fidz's team in this form would have won the British, even if the 15-year-old team had been in full power.
Great Britain may be comforted by the fact that at least one British will have a gold medal in his neck tomorrow: Fidz's chief coach Ben Ryan, the former coach of the Rugby-7 team from Wimbledon.
Well, the experience has been pretty good for Britain.
Eight years ago, they lost all the games in Ryan's training at the Adelaide Sevens tournament.
They lost only one game in Rio.
It hurts, but progress is scary.
Fidzi started excellently and presented his tackling skills to Great Britain as a reason for fun.
It seemed like Captain Tom Mitchell and his team had run into a crowd of mobile buses, and the world champions rose from 5 to 0 when Osea Kolinisau hit the corner.
When there were four minutes in the watch, Jerry Tuwai made a second goal in the right place for the goal shot.
Situation between 12 and 0, and Britain had hardly touched the ball.
Mitchell's amazing bucket prevented the sensible Leone Nakarawa from making the third goal, but it didn't slow down the Fidz.
After seven minutes of the game, Jasa Veremalua made the goal at the right angle, followed by 17 to 0 losses in Britain.
Nakarawa made the second goal of the further initiative, where there was more than a minute left for the first half time.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvou fell through the most invincible fights of the UK team and fell across the goal line.
After the paint kick, the opening period ended with 29-0.
It seemed like the Fidzians were born to play seven players with rugby, while the British are still in the role of a pupil.
Which is much true.
During the mid-term, the United Kingdom made extensive changes and managed to refrain from the Fidzians for four minutes, which was good in comparison with the first half-time, until Josua Tuisova made the goal thanks to the excellent team of the Fidzians.
Dan Norton managed to narrow the situation from 36 to 7 by making Britain the goal to the left corner, but long ago, the game had been lost to the islanders of the South Sea, whose fans were singing in the view, swinging tickets and dancing.
Fidz's joyous attitude was difficult not to admire.
Mata Viliame made the final sink for the Fidzians' cake by making the goal at the last few moments.
Pilli rings, the Fidzians embraced each other, and the British fell on the field, completely crushed.
During the earlier day, Fidzi had won the Japanese semifinal in the figures of 20 to 5 and the United Kingdom had passed southern Africa in a tight semifinal where the balance was resolved by the UK goal shot.
Kyle Brown took the South African Boksis to the lead during the first half of the time, but Dan Norton crossed the goal line with his blunt footwork and fell under the paint pipes in the second half.
Marcus Watson, who is the brother of Anthony Watson, who is the 15 players of the rugby team in England, sealed the victory and eventually the silver medal.
The coach's battle against cancer encouraged Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to warn gold
This is more emotional than gold in these races.
From the first bet to the last Helen Glover and Heather Stanning had 220 winning bets in history and found additional purpose for the gold moment in Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were two in the air, the third voice of coach Robin Williams was the one that encouraged them in the second consecutive Olympic gold of women, which makes them the first women in the history of British sports, which are inclined to a similar achievement.
Their supreme power was uncontroversial, the victory for them was the 39th consecutive and once again a record.
What we see is that two brilliant athletes joining on the water level as they go on the age, do not fully match the nature of success.
There are a large number of helpful hands behind each corner, each of which has contributed to two achievements. However, the most important of the donors is the coach who diagnosed cancer 30 months ago and who then did not know if he would see this day.
Williams said the situation was tight at the time.
"I had bladder cancer, and the tumor could be cut off.
Without surgery, it would have spread everywhere.
and the situation would have been pretty bad.
It's changing a bit of thought."
Williams received a diagnosis in December 2013.
The third was lucky for Williams to be able to start her treatment outside the season at the beginning of 2014, where the interruption caused the lowest possible harm if you can even say this in such circumstances.
"I needed money, so I had to improve quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was at the hospital, walking around the sections 6, 9 and 15 meters at a time when they said that a few steps were enough.
That's where it starts.
The war itself is already a journey, but this made it a little bigger."
Shortly after the victory, the two thoughts were in Williams, who had spent a nervous morning and spoken a little more normal in trying to overcome his own restlessness.
Captain Stanning of the British Royal Army Group, who was behind the Afghanistan tour, says, "I've been at a familiar level this week in ruins, which may be a little extreme, but it means so much."
"It just tells me how much this means to me and how much we have worked together with Helen and Robin.
The last three years Helen and Robin's cash has been fantastic.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anything, so thank him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have wished a better person with whom to train, or a better coach."
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost any competition for the last five years.
The twins have found an overwhelming rhythm to which their competitors have failed to compete.
Even at the last 500 metres when New Zealand and Denmark twins began to approach, Stanning and Glover still had additional resources.
"We were very caught in the moment.
Helen said, "Stay with me, stay with me."
It's very important that you don't get away from the route."
"We managed to leave well, and at the same time we did not try to do anything amazing.
We didn't seek the heavens today, we just wanted to make a good row and win the race we did."
The twins will think about a year before they decide about their future.
The Glover will celebrate next month with Steve Backshall, who is familiar with television nature programs
Now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't mean to say this was my last competition.
It would have brought too much pressure."
"After London, it lasted about six months before I realized I was the Olympic winner.
Everything was so new, and I was very stressed.
This time, it took about four minutes to realize.
This feels so much better," he says.
Iceland is changing the Panama leak government
In October, Iceland will organise premature parliamentary elections, which have already been requested by demonstrators who were mad by Panama's data leaks in the spring.
The so-called Panama papers revealed that several Islamic politicians have circumvented taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson was divorced because of the scandal, but it was not enough for the demonstrators.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election day has now been decided on 29 October.
According to analysts, it is difficult to predict how much the last-term rage of the nation affects the autumn electoral outcome.
In June the presidential elections, the criticism of the empires was clearly evident, and Gudni Johannesson, who was elected from outside of the policy, was elected.
Trump said he was sarcastic when he claimed to be the founder of Obama Isis
Donald Trump, President of the United States Republicans, revoked his last speech.
He said he was sarcasm in claiming that the sitting President Barack Obama would be the founder of the terrorist organization Isis and the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was involved in the establishment of the organization.
The Democrat Party was mad at the speeches and called for an apology from Trump.
You should never let anyone who can fall down like that, Clinton's tweet.
In southern France, the Mayor of Cannes has prohibited the use of Muslims' popular covert burkini swimming pools, reports British newspaper Guardian.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that it is forbidden to go to the beaches and to go to swimming for all who do not have a good way and have a bathing suit that respects the scularism.
The decision also states that bathing suits, which express greatly religious links, can increase the risk of order failures in France, which have been subject to terrorist attacks.
In the middle of July, 85 people died and hundreds of people were injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove to a crowd celebrating the French national day.
At the end of July, two extremists who joined the fathers attacked the church in Northern France and killed a priest over 80 years of age.
The quality of bathing waters in the Oulu region passed through the sebula - in the bathing lake with a blue sauce
Water samples taken from official bathing areas in the Oulu region meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Blue-blue sequelae has been observed only on the bathing coast of Pyle Lake.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the environmental action in the Oulu region took water samples from nine EU coasts in the Oulu region and 30 other general bathing areas.
Apart from the coast of Merinieme, the concentrations of E.coli and intestinal enterococcal bacteria in all bathing areas were below the operational limits laid down in the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The concentrations of E.coli and enterococcine in seanieme bathing water were confirmed on Wednesday, when bacterial concentrations were lower than the operating limits.
The blue sand on the beach of the lake does not yet make water unswitable, but in favourable circumstances, the situation may rapidly change to the blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue.
The environmental action will follow the situation through more frequent inspections.

MTK Hakkarainen on forest donation reduction: More than 80% of forest owners outside
The reduction in forest gifts is one tax change in the next year's draft budget of the Ministry of Finance.
Income tax laws are proposed a tax reduction which would be granted on the basis of a gift tax on the exchange of forest generations.
In the presentation of the Ministry of Finance, the reduction in forest gifts has four objectives: to promote the generation of forestry farms, to youngen the age structure of forest owners, to increase forest size and to increase the supply of wood.
The Ministry aims to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
Forest owners would reduce the pure return on capital for forestry.
Overall, the idea of making such a tool that promotes the generation of forestry farms is good, commenting on the forest management director Juha Hakkarainen of the Central Association of Agriculture and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, he finds a critical tax change.
Forest gift reductions are presented to the task of the clean capital gains of the forest owner.
It is a capital income that has been deducted from all other deductions.
The MTK and Hakkarainen consider that the tax reduction would be more effective if the reduction could be made directly from the sales result of the wood.
The draft of the VM is based on reducing the pure capital income of the forestry economy by preventing the loss of capital in the forestry economy, which should be reduced in other taxation.
Such a person would benefit from tax benefits even if it did not sell the tree.
The calculation model is too complicated.
The average forest owner can't figure it out, Hakkarainen says.
In addition, he says that only a small part of the forest owners is involved.
The tax reduction limit linked to forest return value is EUR 40 000 in the presentation.
It's been pulled too high in Hakkarainen's mind.
In that way, he says that it will cut 82 per cent of the Finnish forest owners out of the deduction circle.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of the forest owners, he says.
The VM considers that the limit guarantees the objective of farming.
Forest policy has led to a reduction in forest gifts by Hakkarainen for decades.
It is behind the ageing of the forest owner.
According to the MTK, the average age of forest owners is now over 60 years and around half of forest owners are pensioners.
The powerful scoundrel surprised the car drivers in Himanga, two cars fell down and ran into each other.
There was a special retreat in Himanga on the Fish River on Friday morning.
According to the Rescue Department, two consecutive-timed cars were squeezed into their divide, after which the fire came to run after the driver.
According to the head-friend's firemaker, Harri is suspected to have been caused by a strong rage.
In the back of the car there were two persons transported to the hospital.
There's no more detail about their injuries.
The driver who drove before didn't get hurt.
The accident occurred on the highway of 8 Himanga, a few kilometers toward the Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results from researchers at the University of Turku can help to develop cancer treatments more efficiently.
The findings made by Professor Johanna Ivaska’s study group show that cancer’s hardness increases cancer’s malignancy.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow normally in such a environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth was prevented in laboratory conditions by returning the cancer surrounding tissue to normal soft tissue.
In the future, the efficacy of cancer medicinal products may be improved by focusing on the interaction between the cells and the surrounding tissue in the treatment of cancer cells.
The results of the studies have been published on 4 August in the appreciated Nature Communications magazine in the field of cellbiology.
The stack of a family home death continues in court, the prosecutor demands a murder sentence to another perpetrator.
Both convicted persons continue to cloak their family home death in court.
Two young men were sentenced to imprisonment in June for family home death in Muhko.
One received eight years for 4 months, including the murder and gross robbery of a young person.
The second sentence is 12 years of imprisonment for murder and gross robbery as a young person.
The convicted person was also sentenced to the brutal risk of road safety as a young person and to the transport of the vehicle as a young person without rights.
The prosecutor, the prosecutor, the lawyers, and the man who had received a more severe sentence, complained about the judgment of the court.
The prosecutor demands a less punished man to be convicted of the murder of a young person for 12 years of imprisonment.
They were in full understanding at the time of the act
According to the law of the visitor, 17-year-old young people killed a school home as the head of the childcare unit, working for a man in July last year.
The 17-year-old indicted the murderer attacked the director in the living room's couch.
The director had been able to get rid of the line, and he was holding a young man to his room, and one of the young people hit him with a steam pipe.
The director was also strangled, beaten and kicked in the head, among other things.
According to the mental study, both convicted were fully understood at the time of the act.
According to the law, young people had planned to escape their homes at least from the previous day.
Icehai is the longest spine in the world, grows only at the age of 156
The longest living backbone in the world has been confirmed by the ice shark, reports the research published in Science magazine.
In the north of the Atlantic, such as the ice shark swim around Greenland, i.e. the holker can live for up to 400 years.
The female is only growing at the age of 156.
I'll give you more ice-cream life that it only grows in a centimetre a year.
Only one species of chimps are known to live longer than ice sharks.
The researchers found out the age by radio-carbon drive.
Due to nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
Based on these, researchers were able to assess the age of sharks.
For the oldest age, 392 years were estimated, although throwing in a direction or another could be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump's economic wisdom - the people's news
Donald Trump America doesn't need to change the world.
Even a third of all tax revenues from the State would be unacceptable if Donald Trump made a change in corporate tax.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, in particular with the most wealthy tax incentives.
Trump described it as a revolutionary presentation of its tax programme on Monday in Detroit.
The company tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
There would be a huge amount not to collect, $1,000 billion a year.
The excess income tax rate is now 39,6, after the reduction made by Trump 33.
They'd give up a whole tax on heritage.
Trump accused the State of excessive regulation of business and of bankruptcy of small businesses.
The environmental standards decided by emergency workers must be reintroduced and the energy regulation should be dismantled.
Barack Obama's health reform needs to be reprocessed.
The administration must be appointed "executives instead of bureaucrats".
According to Trump, the "destructive" trade policy is the major causes of the United States' problems.
The free trade agreements would be canceled.
For imports from the PRC, 45 % and 35 % would be imposed on Mexico.
We offer you a new future.
Americanity, not globality, is our credibility, Trump declared.
Donald Trump America doesn't change the world needs:
American cars are coming to drive on the streets, American planes uniting cities, American ships overseeing sea, American steel to raise new clouds all over the country.
By way of contrast, Trump read faithfully the speech written by assistants, even though well organized protests interrupted it 14 times.
The economists, including those near the Republicans, see Trump's program to bring the United States to a deep economic downturn.
Hillary Clinton published his own program early on Friday in Finnish time.
Attack from the past, the People's News
The sea is fateful, but the real wave of assault strikes in the middle of Madrid's street hallways... can start a record with the past.
It tightened the core of the Pedro Almodóvar's news story.
The previous guidance work of Almodovar Matkalovers (2013) was a little fun and ronskin-side satiir comedy, the skin before it, where I live (2011) the tops of the Spanish career.
Julieta (2016) is located in the middle of some of those two works.
It's an in-depth love, human relationship and family drama in the middle of a relationship between a mother and a daughter.
It's a simple story, and we'll see a lot of them as a long backbone.
Life seems to be in a model for the middle-aged nominal person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
A new male friend (Dario Grandinetti) in the aftermath of the incident must be wondered until the final meters of the film.
In the form of a guarantee and a long letter, Julieta repeated stages of her life to her grown-up daughter.
He begins from time before the daughter was born, from the moments when he met this future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, the time between Ommelte, Adraina Ugarte, who plays Julieta as a young teacher in the second female main part (2013-2014).
Juliet's age has been dealt with in a way that can be regarded as a stone, but I would say that it's kind of complimentary and literally a distraction.
For the Almodóvar movies, there is always a fair distance in Julieta.
It is a flatly played, controlled, place in place with good music, and quite sadly a movie that has the elements of the gesture.
On the other hand, the Spanish director has a typical visual colourfulness in store and is starting to put a little quietly in the eye more pure form than a working dramatic tool.
Diseases, deaths or other sudden loss of the film, but the surface remains the same as Korean.
This applies in particular to the costume: in the case of a nominal person, the dwellings change from a scene to another, and the same applies to visible ears.
Mr Almodóvar is precise in these matters, but the main issue is that there is no greater improvement in this.
When mechanically repeated, the impression is external and a little spiritless.
Almodóvar has written a manuscript on the basis of three novels of the Canadian Alice Munro prized in Nobel 2013.
The novels have been published in the book Fruit: Reports.
Almodóvar has contributed to the dialogue, resulting in a bit of written literature filming.
The material would have been emotionally versatile to a drama, so much big things - especially the crab guilt - deals with the thematics of the movie.
Guidance and manuscript: Pedro Almodóvar.
It's based on Alice Munro's three novels.
Mainly: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
It's the first night of the movie. It's 12.8.
The government's trying to vote on the people's news.
No new cuts are being made, ministers shouting so that the Finns do not fall completely.
In the spring, however, cuts are made by junk stores.
There won't be any new surgery.
The four billion savings already decided are sufficient.
In this way, Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (Cok) are convincing under budgetary misconduct.
It is true in the light of the fact that there are no new cuts in the VM's proposal, since social security cuts were already decided in the spring framework line.
Children's allowances, national pensions, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension index are cut by 0.85 per cent.
The duration of unemployment security for women undergoing a shorter period will be reduced from 500 to 400.
Educational surgery continues.
The Municipalities Haunt
Why are ministers so grievingly stressing that no new cuts are being made on them?
Because next year is the election year.
The municipalities will be held in April, and they will be the most important heating meter in the parliamentary term, not the gallups.
It has been seen before that the result of municipality taking the different directions of the Government's parties has been ruining the government's mood for a long time.
The Gallups, however, tells us that the basic Finns of the Government are expected to be lost, although the outcome of the previous elections was modest compared to the parliamentary elections by 12.3 per cent.
Four years ago, the Basic Finns received 752 new mandates, most of which will be realised in the first spring of the right-wing government.
The government’s life wire of about as great as the three parties is in charge of maintaining the foundation of the Finnish people.
Now it has not endured, but more than half of the party voters have had enough government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group have also come to the surface.
First of all, new cuts will not come with rhetoric, the fact that next year they will be done dramatically and secondly, they will try to soften the expecting attack on the Finnishs.
Big surgery in 2018?
After a year, everything will probably be different... if the Sipillan government is still standing.
The government has set a target for the loss of debt during this parliamentary term, but the Petteri Orpo budget proposal will take EUR 5.9 billion next year, which is more than this year.
After the municipalities, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hands up in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is unable to comply with its own programme: debts are not folded or even slowed down.
The other one's holding on to the program.
This means new, even more severe cuts on the former people in the 2017 budget gap.
The budget would be at least close to the balance in 2018 and then in the spring of the parliamentary elections will be taken against what will happen.
These activities do not match debt
It is absolutely clear that the current activities do not seem to be in debt, even though Juha Sipilä how to try to lie a positive atmosphere.
The curves presented by Martti Hetemäe's Secretary-General in the awareness-raising committee will prove it unconsciously:
World growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be overoptimistic, i.e. not a petty aid from the international economy.
Finland's economy has not just risen since the collapse in 2008, except during the recovery policy at the beginning of the 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35 per cent in this decade and has been prolonged from 34 to 54 weeks on average.
Unemployment now costs three billion euros a year more than in 2008.
In the course of the current curves, government debt, which exceeded the 60% threshold in 2014, will rise to 70% in the middle of the next decade.
What's responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the debt eligibility of the Left Association was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment costs about EUR 6 billion, which is virtually fully covered by new debts.
This is the concept of a central, meeting and basic Finns about what is responsible.
Question: The municipality wants to leave a lot of tasks
Three of the four consider that the organisation of day care for children, youth work and exercises is the responsibility of the municipality, as shown in the study of the KAS - Municipal Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the people will also take responsibility for a single municipality for libraries, culture, civil studies, construction supervision, high school education and waste care.
The province's responsibilities are more clearly called for rural development, specialised medical care, vocational training, higher education institutions and the institutional care of developing disabilities.
None of the responsibilities of the municipalities in order to be transferred to the State.
A sub-aged driver ran after a ride to the police to run away.
Joensuu's 16-year-old motorcycler drove a police patrol in Joensuu in Ilomantsinti on Friday night at half one time.
The police patrol tried to stop a motorcycle without lights, but the young man left to drive the police away with a fair speed.
The rear drive continued on the Sonkaja coast, from which still to the Sorronahonti and the smaller forest road, where the motorcycle drove out of the way.
After this, the young man left running away, but a quicker-footed policeman ran into a fugitive.
The blowing test for the driver showed 0.75 proms.
Nor did he have a driver's license that would justify driving a motorcycle.
The case will be investigated, among other things, as a serious risk to road safety.
The truck in the rock car crashed into the river.
The truck in the stone car fell on the knee lake at Thursday night at 21.15 p.m.
The truck had drove out of the way in the left curve and fallen on its side of the river.
The rescue plant lifted the injured driver out of the crashed truck through the door left, together with the rescue helicopter staff and first-care officers.
The vehicle was lifted by the owner of the car.
From the fallen truck to the road, a hydraulic oil that was absorbed by the rescue body.

The old woman disappeared in the afternoon on the Air River
87-year-old woman has been missing since the afternoon in the Lahdenkylä of the Air River in the South Ostrobothnia.
The police are looking for a long, glow and good-grown woman with white jaw hair.
Observations and clues of lost movements are requested to call the North Season Center clue number 0295440513.
The ingredients of a major accident in the air, look at the photo gallery of Parafest's destruction.
The fall flow of the parafest festival tents caused massive damage.
The President of the Joensuu Paraphestys Arto Pippuri estimates that the festival is economically able to reach its feet, and the event can also be organized next year.
The last performer of the Parafest was Kalle Salonen at the end of Friday night on the market.
On Saturday, the program will continue at the premises of the city theatre at 13:00 a.m.
The art center in the Monkey is a Parafest exhibition from 13 to 15.
The programme will be organised as planned.
The flow rate is generated in the thunder cloud when the rainwater and its weight starts the lowering air flow.
The changes in the water state of the umbrella bind the heat and therefore the lower air mass cools and accelerates towards the ground.
It is reported from the Air Science Institute that in Finland there are several flows in Finland during the summer.
It's hard to predict the route of the crash flows.
The eruption flow hit the Parafest event in the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum on Friday afternoon before five.
Three tents fell to the reverse, and there were about 200 people in the tents.
In the event of an accident, four persons were mildly offended.
There was one child in the group who was transported mildly injured to further treatment.
Air Pollution Agens London
According to the study, the lontoan skin ages faster than usual.
The reason for ageing skin is air pollution.
The British investigation is about the Evening Standard.
The British skin care company Caci analysed London without the most toxic small particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many pension-aged lontoians is two and a half years older than an age friend living in the countryside.
Small particles that age the skin are very good dust pollution, which comes from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which according to Evening Standard, almost 9,500 lontoes die every year.
The studies have shown that the particles are small enough to pass the outer layer of the skin.
The study of Cac found that early ageing is a risk, especially for lontoans walking in close proximity to congested streets.
People in London may try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example, with different masks, but a more practical solution is recommended for regular skin cleaning.
The brakes of the tractor failed to push the man standing in front of him.
The man had moved stones on a tractor in his yard.
After he got out of the tractor and went to visit it, the brakes of the tractor were deceived and the tractor was floating on the man.
The man was not under it, but the tractor was able to push the man to the extent that he was transported to the central hospital for further investigations seriously injured.
The tractor couldn't go any further, because it ran into the rocks in front of us.
The Rivalry of the Newest Period
A river-suu League-Riento playing in the balloon Championship will go to a series starting in October from a better starting point than men's memory.
The team's been packed for three weeks.
The common sound is found better than in the previous periods, when the beginnings of the series have been dark for Rienno.
As the head coach of Rienno, Jani Säisä continues to praise the new team to try and unite.
From the foreign triangle, the middle fighters of Fred Musoni start in Rieno for another period.
The new faces are the 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson in Ruanda's country team is a 20-inch hacker.
Garchet is accordingly a passer, a Brazilian has a measure of 198 cents.
Josban, Kajaja and River Boys, to the U.S. country team
Anne Jumppanen has played in almost all the MMs of the salibandy since 2003.
Now the sixth races in Tampere are on their way, only 2013 after Canada was better in North America's cartoons.
I was working in Turku and playing with women in the country when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. was setting up a Salibandy country team.
I was interested, and here we are, Jumppanen, 48, says.
Jumppanen was born in 1967, near New York in Elizabeth City.
The family moved to Helsinki when she was one year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen was able to study data processing at the University of Joensuu.
When I came to Joensuu, the species weren't played at SM level like salibandy.
It's a fake play at the university.
I was playing basketball in Kataja and later playing hockey in the riverboys in the SM series, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played a salibandy SM series with the university from 1991 to 1992, the following three went through Josba.
In addition to playing, he trained the company's A-girls to the championship.
Women's SM serial career went up on silver in 1995.
Overall, Jumppanen played in the women's SM series through 10, accumulated 169 in the 51+34=85.
The last SM season is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänen were named in the country team
Joensuu salibandyseuran Josban raised Perttu Puska and the enolais-oriented Tatu Väänen was elected to the Finnish country team who plays in the Czech Brnon EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
In a 25-year-old Perfect Puska in Helsinki, he has played this before six male paintings in which he has accumulated total power points 9+4=13.
The 32-year-old defender of the Swiss Wiler-Ersigen, Tatu Väänänen, has recovered from thickness and belongs to the standard armour of the country team with 117 painting experience.
Mika Kohonen, a concar player of the Seinäjoki Game Brothers, was also named in the country team, who was seen last time in the Finnish shirt at the MM contest last December.
As the head coach of the Salibandmaa team, Petri Kettunen, the Cont.
Beach volley artist Essi Hasu's circle closes to Kouvola - SM gold missing from the prize cabinet
Essi Hasu is ending as a beach volley player, at least after a period of temporary duration.
Beach volley Finnish championships will be settled on the weekend in Kouvolan Sports Park.
In three days, medals are played both in adults and young people.
In cooperation with Kouvolan Airballers and the SM-final tournament organised by the Finnish Airball Association, the six best pairs of the rankings of each series will be validated.
The local color in the tournament represents Elimäen NMKY's grown by Essi Hasu, who has been part of the Finnish beach volley peas for several years.
Hasu now residing in Helsinki is looking forward to games in front of a well-known audience.
I hope as many as you can get to the courthouse this weekend.
I'm sure there's going to be a great arena for Pesisstadion.
I haven't played in adult series very often in Kouvola, so it's great to play in the finals at home, Hasu feels.
The region of Kouvola set the Hasu spark on sport and gave good food for a fine hobby.
There are very memories in mind about childhood.
When I was nine, I started the balloon at Elimäe's NMKY's E-girls.
The top of the mind is too big a sweater, knee shields rotating in the ankles and super ace lips and choreographs after the point, Hasu remembers.
In a small place, a sports club was a strong community where everyone knew each other.
The group's common spirit created an environment where it was nice to play.
All the families were strongly involved, the father of the team club trained us, and our mother was the chairman of the company for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volley was already in junior time a natural choice of species to counterweight the inner air balloon.
There's been songs on the beach of the curve lamp since the 1990s.
During the visits, the activity has always been active.
I also went to the junior SM tours, thinking that someday I'd be there to play.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays this weekend together with a SM-finals with a twisted Anniina Parkkis.
Riikka Lehtosen and Taru Lahde after the tournament the second punished double is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
SM-Dear, we're still missing the prize cabinet, Hasu throws mysterious.
The weekend in Kouvola may be the last of Hasulle's audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges await civil work.
Yes, the international career is over after the Kisakallio tournament.
Otherwise, the toes are placed on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu is planning.

Solomon Koli went boldly to become a farmer
Agriculture as an entrepreneurship means risk-bearing, sweating and energy efficiency.
The young farmer, Solomon Koli, 25, became a farmer, because he believes in a positive future in the countryside.
About two years ago, Koli, along with her little brother, started acting as a continuation of their homeland.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and counsels the brothers with their own experience.
Initiation as a rural entrepreneur meant debt and an increase in order to bring bread into hand from agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I've always been happy at the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur, I've put everything in the game.
If something starts, I think it needs to be done seriously and properly.
In 2013, we went to build a stove, and at first the bank had not been enthusiastic.
However, I myself really boldly joined the project, and I have been fully involved in it, Solomon Koli says and adds that he would not have taken action if he had no faith in the production of pure Finnish food and that everything would still be good.
Salomo Kol’s goal is to invest even more in the bigger slab.
The work has resulted, since Solomon Koli has been chosen for the ten best among the future of the Landscape in the young food producer's competition.
At the moment, he's competing for a potential victory.
He will be able to vote on the website of the magazine until 21.8.
Bulgaria declares inflation for the first eight months

The average annual inflation measured by CPI over the last 12 months (from August 2015 to July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (from August 2014 to July 2015) was –0.8 %.
In July 2016, the Consumer Price Index was 101.0 % compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 %.
Inflation rate from the beginning of the year (July 2016 % compared to December 2015 %) has been –0.2 % and annual inflation in July 2016 was –0.2 % compared to July 2015.

Prices decreased in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household appliances and seasonal care (0.5%) and health (0.1%).
Prices of the following product groups remained at the same level with the previous month: alcohol drinks and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education.
Snapchat anime efficiency is criticised as Asian Caricature
Snapchat says that the filter was an anime, but some observers think it's racist.
With the Snapchat lens tool, about 150 million daily users can change reality and play in identities that converge absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a pine, a dog or a character in Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
The lenses are unprecedented, features distorting tools to create more than 30 million enhanced self-wires a day.
All delusions will quickly come to general knowledge.
Snapchat lenses have received a review where it has been accused of favouring blackface makeup or whitened skin tones as a beauty.
So when it offered to some of its users this week a filter that turned their eyes into twists, distorted their teeth and made cheeky, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people ("yellowface").
The critics also wondered whether these repeated contradictions pointed to a greater problem that the company has with a different nature.
News and rage spread wide on Wednesday and wrote e.g. web releases The Verge and Motherboard day after Snapchat told me that he removed the filter.
The company gave the following explanation: the lens was intended to honor the anime characters, not the caricature of Asian people.
But to observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes.
Some had a hard argument about the anime comparison.
A Korean-American artist, Grace Sparapani, whose tweets were widely distributed, said in his e-mail that the lens was "at least offending and embarrassing".
He adds: "It is difficult to deny that a very flavorless Asian caricature is compared to filters.
It shows that the filter is not just a "yellowface", but one taken to degrading extremes."
Snapchat is not the only company to avoid these cultural traps.
The American culture seems to have an endless struggle on divergence and social inclusion from corporate governments to Hollywood and the equipment we carry with us.
The large audience of Snapchat consists of young people who are ethnically different from their parents’ responses, which may mean that they are likely to expect even more fine-tuning.
"When one of Snapchat's lenses creates a picture that infringes the user, this kind of thing will no longer be very easily missed, as before," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu at the interview on Thursday.
Zhu, as a product manager and designer in the Medium Publication Platform, decided to remove his Snapchat account on Thursday and encouraged others to do the same.
In the Medium article and in the phone interview, he said that he believed that the conflicts of ethnicity reflected the lack of diversity in the recruitment practices of Snapchat.
Zhu criticizes most of the company's white and merely men's leadership and decided its writing with hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It is either that in their unilateral staff there are no colourful people, where they can make such decisions, or they also have colorful workers, but their position is not such as to dare to express their views directly and easily," says Zhu, Chinese-American.
Other observers agree with him, but Snapchat has largely failed to respond to the argument.
The company does not publish figures on the ethnic background of its staff, appealing to its position as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic backgrounds of his staff, but according to its informant, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on sub-represented groups and the promotion of inclusion within the company.
For its part, Zhu says that he keeps his Snapchat account closed and adds: "I wonder if they really need more users like us to say that this is not OK."
According to the Congress Specialist Group, military officials distorted the intelligence data on Iss
On Thursday, the Congress Expert Group published a report that officials of the United States Armed Forces, Central Command, changed the intelligence reports so that they could give a more optimistic picture of war against Isies in Iraq and Syria than the events in the field provided for.
The Republican presidents of the sub-committee responsible for the intelligence and defence appropriations of the United States Representatives Committee (House Armed Services Committee) set up a group of interim reports on the "common discomfort of military intelligence analysts". According to the analysts, the senior military authorities were decorated against the action of the Americans against Isis.
The Central Command, shortly Centcom, is the headquarters of the United States Armed Forces in Tampa, Florida, which is responsible for military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The findings of intelligence accepted by Centcom's superior leaders generally gave a more positive picture of US anti-terrorism activities than the facts in the field showed, and were, without exception, more positive than the analyses of other entities in the intelligence community," says the press release on the report.
"The events of Centcom cannot be accepted – our soldiers suffer when the high-level political decision-makers are presented with false analyses," says the Republican representative of California, Ken Calvert.
"The errors in the Centcom leadership staircase go to the highest level of the organisation."
The 10-page report describes in detail the ongoing problems in 2014 and 2015 which the Central Command descriptions and analyses of the American activities to train the Iraqi troops.
Although the report does not contain decisive evidence that the reports ordered by the Obama administrations had been falsified, it will provide a picture of analyticals, which will make it clear that Centcom's leaders would have pressured them to express a more optimistic view of the threat caused by Isis.
"In the first half of 2015, many of the press releases, statements and witness statements given to the Congress were far more positive than the events actually were," says the report.
"In the first place, the Centcom official made a public statement that the great military assault for the reintroduction of Mosul could already take place in April or May 2015."
Mosul, which is the second largest city in Iraq, is still under the control of Isis.
After months of research, this is very clear," says the Republican representative of Kansas, Mike Pompeo.
"from mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest intelligence leaders of the United States Armed Forces manipulate the intelligence results received to minimise the threat of Isis in Iraq."
The Republicans set up a working group after being aware of the doubts expressed by analytical analysts that the data on the Iss had been manipulated.
The report published on Thursday follows more precise results as the studies continue.
In addition, the Ministry of Defence has initiated a survey of Centcom's intelligence data.
On Thursday, the members of the Democratic Committee responsible for enquiry published their results, which were partly consistent with the conclusions of the Republican Working Group.
"In the years 2014 to 2015, Centcom created an excessively limited process for assessing the intelligence data on the security forces of the Fathers and Iraq," says Adam B. Schiff, the High Democratic Representative of the Committee.
Schiff said that this process delayed the publication of intelligence results, "infringed the morality of analyticals" and "inconcerned inadequately diverging views".
According to Schiff and the Democrats, however, there was no evidence that the White House would have tried to force the Centcom analysts to adapt their conclusions to the "predetermined or political official line".
The news site Daily Beast reported on Tuesday the preliminary results of the study by the Congress.
Last August, New York Times reported the investigation of the Pentagon Superintendent, which was initiated as a result of the complaints made by Centcom's analysts.
The reporter of Pentagon, Lieutenant Patrick Evans, says when he announces that the Ministry of Defence will not comment on the report of the Congress until the investigation of the superinspector is underway.
However, he says: "The experts sometimes disagree with the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcomes a healthy dialogue on these key issues of national security."
In addition to its efforts to determine whether the bombings led by the United States have been successful in Iraq and Syria (more claims made by the Defence Authority).
The arguments made last year, however, questioned how much President Obama could trust the Central Command and that it would give a fair assessment of the military operation of Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The criticism of the information on fathers corresponds to the differences that have occurred over a decade ago, when Centcom's intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study that the government of President George W. Bush, despite the objections of many analysts, supported only small troops in Iraq and spent just a little time in considering what would result from the 2003 attack.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebelling of Iss intelligence.
According to the authorities last year, the Hoker Working Group concluded that despite the opposing public statements, the air strikes in the processing plants managed by Isis had not significantly weakened the economy of the terrorist group because it had built temporary refiners and thus managed to sell oil on the dark market.
However, the outcome of the investigation was not transferred outside the Central Command, reports The Times in September.
The then commander of Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised last year after several legislatures had estimated that the Senate’s statements were too positive for the war.
General Austin retired in April, and he replaced General Joseph L. Votel as Commander of Central Command.
The United States wins the fourth triumphant in women's countryhockey and establishes its position in the field of mediation with Britain
After three maalis in the winning box, the painting 6-1 in the game against Japan Katie Bam made the first two goals for the United States Women's Landhockey team on Thursday, when the United States won India.
Five goals in two games could be regarded as a great achievement, but 27-year-old Bam was not sure if he had succeeded in the same way before.
"I have no idea," he says.
"I'm not one of the people who keep reading about the paintings they've made."
However, he knows this: the Americans have won four games in their Olympic tournament and have lost a zero game and share the first place in their group with Britain, who continued to win their winning pipes on Thursday, in Japan's chapters 2 to 0.
The UK and the United States will play in the last game of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams survived the final match, which determines which one of them will be the first and second of the six team blocks.
Firstly, avoiding the long encounter with the hard - held Dutch team, which won the second block.
Despite what happens on Saturday, the Americans have already raised their surprising success in these races, four years after the last 12 teams in London's Olympics.
Bam was on the team in London, too.
He grew up in Blue Bell in the Pennsylvania state and grabbed the soil mat for the first time when he was only three years old (the older twin sisters played a species in Drexel).
She missed the Olympics in 2008 when she failed to survive the final playlist.
After this, the 2012 races came, where he and his team were not very successful.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an English coach, began to change.
"The change was cultural, spiritual and physical," says Bam.
"Our job in London wasn't the same as it is now.
We've done a full translation."
On Thursday night, Bam opened the paint account on the first half of time by hitting the ball close by a creep.
India had come into the game without any tournament victory, but it proved to be a surprising opponent and maintained the situation of 1 to 0 until the third period when Bam entered the field.
Bam moved the ball long along the left side of the field, squeezed to the middle field, hit the ball and took the Americans 2 to 0 to lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the fourth episode.
The game was the first tournament where the U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs managed to keep the goal empty. In the first three games the Americans' goal had hit each one.
Briggs is now living for his success.
Just like Bam.
"Our location is good now," says Parnham, but how good, it depends on the outcome of the Saturday game.
In the middle of the Olympic hulina, trampoline brings zen.
Depending on the location and time, the Olympics will inevitably meet.
Rio de Janeiro’s events, competitions and struggles seem to be the following intensive message constantly and everywhere.
It's like the Olympic Fire itself is a flammable message cap, moving from a swimmer to a swimmer, a swimmer to a strongener, and a strongener to a triathlonist.
You can't open television, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the cafet line without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or Michael Phelps and Chad Le Clos.
And then there's a man named Logan Dooley.
The Olympian first-time Dooley charms with his smile and might well be the name of everyone on the lips that would appear and belong to the best time of viewing and listening, would be favored by sponsors and would appear in good mind TV advertising if he were just a swimmer, a cheerleader or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28 from Lake Forest of California, competing on the Olympic Gold with a trampoline.
The Olympic light does not equally illuminate all competitions.
Farther from the center, partly in the shadow are the less known sports, such as air pistol fire, firearms, feather balloon and taekwondo.
We will always have a chest swim, and let the championship stay with us for a long time.
But if I have permission to write a modest story about my own special favourite, I would like to draw attention to the charm of trampoline controlled.
Although trampoline has been the Olympic race since the year 2000 Sydney races, its visibility for the last 16 years has been so limited that many people who interviewed me didn’t even know it was the Olympic species.
Knowlessness can be regionally specific.
Of course, the United States has participated in the Olympic Trampoline, but the country has never reached the medals or progressed in the finals until 2012.
In men's trampoline, the medals seem to go to the Chinese and Russians, and on the side of women's medals are toothing Canadians.
The Chinese Dong Dong and the Canadian Rosie MacLennan defend the gold medals they won in London this year.
However, Trampoliin has the charming power of the subjugator, partially because of the uncivilized replacement it sounds more suitable for the circus school than for the Olympics.
(In this context, I recognize that I am not an expert, only an ordinary fan.)
In the species, there is a comic potential used in drawing films in the endless continuous booming scenes of characters, but it also has the same dignity as in the gymnastics and swimsuits, i.e. species that are essentially connected to the trampoline.
The word of trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means "treatment board".
Reverend craftsmen jump with a huge trampoline that squeezes them up to almost 10 metres. Before landing, the jumpers have to make a series of acrobatic movements, such as circulars, skills and volts.
According to the official Olympic programme, jumps are criticised on the basis of performance, degree of difficulty and flight time.
In Rio, 32 athletes coming from 17 different countries are competing with 16 men and 16 women.
The most common direction for the Olympics is straight ahead.
When targeting gold, the medal cords must go further, faster, up and over, sometimes over the goal line, sometimes backwards around the field.
In addition to the painting line or the wall of departure, they also have another objective to pursue in television-based reports, namely the world or the Olympic event.
This determined pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatic — and even enough to get a watcher into tears.
But I also think this is a little exhausting only when I see the races.
This trampoline offers you a breathing break.
Trampoline is headed up.
The aim is not to move forward.
The forcer squeezes up weightlessly like an astronaut, falls down and squeezes back up without trouble.
Of course, there is also a competitive aspect of the species, and it is not easy either, but it does not have a rigid collision with the goal or jumping far, only a sleepy and melting combination of time and gravity.
It's as close to the zen as the only Olympic race can get.
Women's quarrels and finals are held on Friday afternoon and start at 13.00 local times and men's corresponding races on Saturday at the same time.
The NBC will send the finals as part of his afternoon shipment, which begins on either day at 14.00 local time.
In the middle of the Olympic Mania, they bring a peaceful and wonderful moment that may be missed in the middle of the general hulina.
And if awareness can only be increased by providing the attractive men's athletes and performing them — as the US Male Forces Wall Street Journal recently suggested — in that case Logan Dooley only expects his new fan forces.
A whole generation protests in Ethiopia, a long-term United States alliance
Violence demonstrations in Ethiopia
The government troops have violently dismantled protests that require political change across Ethiopia.
According to the eyewitnesses, several demonstrators have been shot to death in confrontation with the police.
Is Ethiopia breaking up?
For the last decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries and a trustworthy Western alliance, whose economy has grown rapidly.
In recent months, however, the country has been shaken by anti-government demonstrations that are spreading to wider regions.
Only last week, thousands of people rode on the streets, demanding a thorough political change.
According to human rights organisations, the government's reaction was unpleasant.
According to eyewitnesses, the police shot and killed several unarmed demonstrators.
The videos described in the last year's end or early this year are expected to show how security forces are hitting young people who have been forced to stand on the wall.
The leading UN Human Rights Officer now calls for a thorough investigation.
"Continuing the country has always been difficult, and moving forward even more difficult," says Rashid Abdi, Director of the International Crisis Group of the African Sarvi project.
In the population population, Ethiopia, after Nigeria, is the second largest country in Africa, whose stability has been promoted by the western countries.
The United States Army and the intelligence services strongly support the Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats throughout the region, especially in Somalia. Only a few African countries, if anything, receive so much help from the West.
The economy of Ethiopia has grown to a rapid pace.
Its infrastructure has improved radically; the capital of Addis Abeba is even a new frequencies.
The streets of cities are usually peaceful, safe and clean.
However, ethiopia is still far from the country of democracy, and human rights organisations have kept reporting about government repression policy, the opposition in the country is very limited and the dissidents are rapidly reduced.
Many people have been expelled from the country, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the wilderness.
But the situation may change.
"If the people are suppressed and there is no choice but to point out, it will be dissolved," says Seyoum Teshome, who works as the University of Central Ethiopia.
"The whole youth shows its mind.
A whole generation protests."
There are many topics of displeasure, always from land use to the strangulation of the government coalition.
After last year's widely criticised elections, the ruling party and its allies received the last position of the opposition, which will result in their control over the whole Parliament.
At the same time, tensions are growing at the Eritrea border, where the deepened situation required hundreds of death victims in the June battle.
Analysts fear that the separatist groups that have fallen more or less over recent years, such as the Oromo liberation front or the Ogaden’s liberation front, may strive to exploit confusion and rearm.
There are many reasons for the loss of the bitter mood that has come under the surface for years.
The first is obviously innocent: smartphones.
For the last few years, ethiopians have been able to communicate in social media when cheaper smartphones became common and access to the Internet improved.
Even when the government repeatedly prevents access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during demonstrations, many will be able to access the Internet via intermediary servers that hide their location.
Many ethiopian youths told us that they called people for demonstrations.
The second reason is the increase in solidarity between the two largest population groups in Ethiopia, oroms and amharas.
The Oromos and the Amhara are not natural allies.
In Ethiopia, mostly from Christendom’s highland, amharas have long ruled the country’s policy and business and have taken over oroes, a large part of which are Muslims and live in the Netherlands.
But also this is changing.
"Cooperation is deepening and we're getting under the same umbrella," says oromo director Mulatu Gemechu.
The main demonstrations have been in oromo and amhara regions.
Many amharas and oromos experience that Ethiopia is unjustly dominated by the Tigre tribe, representing only about six per cent of the population and, however, dominating the army, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason behind the trouble is the death of Meles Zenaw.
Former rebel leader Meles was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of an unnamed disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius who could see behind the corner.
According to analysts, he was particularly skilled to detect the first signs of displeasure and to use ambassadors that agreed on the sides of the counterparts.
"The current government lacks this essential instinct," says conflict scientist Abdi.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia Hailemariam Desalegn stepped into Meles' boots from almost unknown.
Unlike Meles, from the Tigre region of North Ethiopia, Hailemariam is from the south.
According to analysts, he has no confidence in the security forces managed by the Tigre tribe.
Many fear this will mean more bloodshed.
For the past time, in 2005, there were similar riots in Ethiopia, when thousands of people showed their minds against the elections that, according to analyticals, the government first twisted and then stole.
In post-election troubles, many protesters were killed, although the deaths were fewer than in the previous months, and the restlessness ceased relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised the leaders of Ethiopia for long-term infrastructure planning, such as the new frequencies, and for significant progress in combating poverty.
But the internal anger against the Ethiopia Government has clearly not prevented the intensification.
And the grudge is taking a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, demonstrators in Gondar attacked the companies owned by the tigres, and the hate speech against the tigres is becoming widespread in social media.
According to analysts, the protests put the United States and other Western allies into a bad situation.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned, neighbouring countries of Somalia on observers of aircraft, but according to the United States, the base has recently been closed.
At the same time that the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its allies in the unstable region to fall.
"This requires strict balancing," says Abdi.
Donald Trump says he was sarcastic in claiming that Obama Isis was the founder of Isis.
Donald J. Trump tried to draw his words back on Friday in the recent campaign, claiming that he was not serious in claiming that several times this week, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, the terrorist group of Isis 's founders'.
The clarification raised new questions to the Republican side of the ability of the President-in-Office to communicate clearly to the citizens of their country.
His supporters who must try to defend their candidate at these stormy moments and explain the comments he may not have meant.
Trump made the argument at the electoral meeting on Wednesday night and repeated in various interviews on Thursday that he really meant what he said when he claimed that the President and Hillary Clinton created Isis.
But early Friday morning, Trump said he was a sarcasm.
Trump bounced in the tweet all his speech from the last day, when he told me he was in several interviews for serious reasons.
When the radio broadcaster and the conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his claim by saying that Obamahan was trying to destroy Isis, the Republican president's candidate refused to withdraw his claim.
The last criticism storm rose when Trump tried to concentrate his campaign back to the economy when the support figures fell.
Trump and Clinton held their economic policy line in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the subject.
He warned on Twitter that Clinton's proposals would raise taxes and thought Clinton's speech was boring.
Trump's been defending himself in the sarcasm before.
At the end of July, he received a broad criticism when he seemed to urge the Russians to hack the e-mail of Hillary Clinton. Later he explained his comments by saying, "Of course, I was sarcastic."
In this way, Trump stretchs the boundaries of political speech and draws his words back if necessary.
"I believe that it is his way of testing certain messages that will respond to his supporters. He sees how the supporters react to the messages, and "select" in one way or another depending on the reactions", says communications expert Ruth Sherman, who has observed the language used by both presidential candidates.
"But I also believe that he understands his claim and knows that they are circulating enough to pass different seams."
Instead of softening his statements to the electoral audience, Trump has changed his style even more profoundly in recent days when his support figures have continued to fall.
The new opinion study published on Friday by the NBC, the Wall Street Journal and Marist showed that Trump's support is significantly lower than Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, while the situation in Florida is strictly stable.
While Trump is usually trying to avoid asking for forgiveness to provoke his speeches, he often accuses his critics that they misinterpret his words or do not understand his sense of humor.
But in the last few months of their presidential campaigns, after becoming more closely eyewitness, Trump's jokes have put his loyal supporters in an embarrassing position, where they are publicly forced to defend Trump's comments, no matter how provocational they are.
One of Trump's most important supporters, former Mayor of New York, Rudolph W. Giuliani, strongly defended the presidential candidate in the CNN interview on Thursday.
"I consider his words to be justified, politically speaking," said Giuliani when they asked him whether Trump was truthful in claiming that Obama and Hillary Clinton set up Isis.
"It is true in the sense that before Obama Isis was almost unknown, a small organization named Obama as "the lower series team", and that is why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq."
Most of the Republicans representing the mainstream try to argue that the Obama administration, where Hillary Clinton was Minister of Foreign Affairs, allowed Isis to continue its activities when it did not deal with the situation determined in the Middle East.
Before Friday's elections in Pennsylvania, Trump continued his attack on the media on Twitter, where he accused them of wandering and discriminating attitudes against him.
He mocked "uncredible and pathetic" TV competitors trying to find out about him, but he said he couldn't do it.
Some democrats mocked Trump's explanation and said it was only more clearly shown that he was not suitable for President.
Due to an unreasonable increase in rent, the coffee shop has stopped opening in Greenpoint.
Verb Cafe was a bit of a bleak coffee shop in Williamsburg, where only cash was made and there was no Wi-Fi, but it offered a good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the cafe was priced out of his streetside site at Bedford Avenue when the rent went unreasonable.
Verb Cafe replaced in the summer of 2014 Soap Cherie sells cupcakes of shaped soap.
The locals consider this to be avoided from the middle classification to the loss of the cafeteria.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York changes, I know, but I still can't believe that there is no CBGB Club anymore, Chelsea Hotel is destroyed and Verb is now a soap shop."
But even though New York is no longer the same, there will be a new one.
Last November, Verb Cafe opened a new coffee shop in Greenpoint, only a fair kilometer north of its original location.
The new Verb coffee shop has Wi-Fi and can pay with credit cards, but some of the workers are the same and the atmosphere is still unpleasant.
Coffee is still good.
The owner and manager of the new Verb coffee shop is Cisco Rodriguez, the long-term employee of the old cafe.
He started in Verb in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When a customer offered to finance the opening of a new cafe, he said he was very interested in doing it.
Rodriguez, 36, kept many things unchanged.
Verb order bagels from the same supplier as before and using the same espressokone model.
In addition, it reintroduced even the old Verb lamps.
But Rodriguez says that he wanted to try something new, and
added new products to the list.
There are bacon-cannamon cheese-sandwiches available, filling capriks and brown onions.
There's also darkberries on the list.
There is no more beer on coffee, but on the other hand, fresh fruit juices.
After nine months of staying in the cafeteria, Rodriguez says he noticed that the old standard customers began to go to Verb as a steady flow.
"But many of our old clients were priced out of Williamsburg," he says.
One of these is Rebecca Oliveira, who recently visited the cafeteria on Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, lived earlier in Williamsburg and visited Verb on a regular basis.
Even after he moved to Greenpoint, he was doing walking trips to Verb in Williamsburg.
When Verb was closed, he tells me he stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I knew I liked Verb's coffee and culture," he says.
Now he drinks coffee again, even though on that Sunday, he took a chai cake instead of his usual ice coffee, which is also a listing.
The second long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, went faithfully to Verb since 2003.
He always went to the cafeteria before work and ordered the same.
"I sat in the cafeteria every day more than seven, like a machine, and there they already prepared my butterbogles with all the fillings," he says.
Photo: Rodriguez also wanted to try something new and brought new products on his menu.
Nowadays, Rosanthal continues to order its standard product, but sometimes he varies the bachelor bacon, chicken egg and cheese samples.
Rodriguez says he doesn't have any anger for taking the old place in the soap store.
The owners of Soap Cherie even offered to prepare a special sapphire using Verb’s own cold-creamed coffee.
"We may still have the offer," says Rodriguez.
The Polish residents who lived in Greenpoint also welcomed the café.
One of the new customers turned the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez now tells us that he is looking for a suitable place to welcome his new neighbours.
The new place has brought other benefits.
The local juice company wants to bottle and sell a cold-shaved coffee in the cafeteria.
Café may also extend to the next building.
However, many customers are sufficient to receive their own old favourites from the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a standard client in Williamsburg, and he says his heart was broken when the cafe was closed.
When the new place was opened and I ordered a coffee there, it felt like she came home, says Whitt.
"I missed the smell of the cafeteria."
Dirty food for the great depressed season in the new book: A Square Meal
In March 1933, soon after he became president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat for lunch in his office in the White House.
President Roosevelt, known as the Golden Rist, was pleased with the luxurious foods of the Fifth Avenue restaurants, such as the goose liver snack and Maryland turtle soup.
That day his menu was more modest: the deviled eggs in the tomato sauce, potatoes, and dessert from the plum pussy.
"It was a demonstration of culinary solidarity for people who suffer," says Jane Ziegelman.
His husband Andrew Coe adds: "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
The couple in Brooklyn Heights works as both food history.
Coe's latest book called Chop Suey tells about the Chinese kitchen in America, while Ziegelman's last book, called 97 Orchard, relates the story of the floorhouse in the town of Lower East Siden, through the food.
Their new joint work is published by Harper and published on Tuesday by A Square Meal, which describes the history of American food as a major devastation in the 1930s.
The couple showed its own culinary solidarity when agreed to a meeting with the journalist Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, which is a small and common lunch bar near the Flatiron cloudmakers, and was opened in the same year as the large stock market crash, 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered cream cheese and olive-full sandwich, and 57-year-old Coe had turkey, potatoes and mixed vegetables.
When the journalist ordered meat mushrooms, the couple said it was suitable for the debate on eating a very large period of depression.
"The wrecks were very popular," says Jane Ziegelman.
"Mans ate peanuts, butterfly, and bamboo.
They were manufactured from substances that were cheap and rigid.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they will be enough for the whole meal."
Andrew Coe's out of control.
"It must have been pressed in the stomach like a lead," he says.
Before the major years of lama, the American table, especially in the countryside, worked with the buffet principle "eat as much as you want".
Women made food for agricultural workers, and breakfast, lunch and dinner was served with newly packed pies.
Just the Americans had sent food to hungry Europeans during the first world war. A Square Meal is a chronic of ways where the people survived when suddenly the survivor had to be abandoned.
"This was the time when food became the central and annoying subject of the Americans", says Coe and explains why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
A new low-cost diet was one of the horrifying things: according to Ziegelman, mysterious foods such as batteries and batteries became the main food, and batteries were said to be a "great way to use the food stars" because the cooks could cover not so attractive manufacturing materials with cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
From the flesh that had been the most important part of the American meal for years, it became sustainablely used luxury.
It was experimented with strange mixtures, the most important of which was the filling of calories and nutrients and not the taste or even a healthy kitchen lake.
In carrying out a study for a book containing also recipes, Jane Ziegelman prepared baking-time petals filled with peanut butters.
"It didn't get popular at the dinner table," says Coe, where
Ziegelman adds: "It was unrealistic.
Peanut butter and oven leaves are not compatible at all.
This was characteristic of many household resepts."
Home Economy experts, such as Louise Stanley, head of the federal household agency between 1923 and 1943, guided the food habits of citizens in an unprecedented and unique way.
In newspapers and magazines, they published recipes and articles and encouraged women to become precise budgetists and respond to the challenge of making pork-kermaspagett-like tasty foods.
The A Square Meal book is the celebration of historic flavors.
Specially delicious are the explanations of the reaction of the Head of State to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "show me to eat cake" position.
While he publicly praised his child’s simple food on the iow farm, he himself ate, such as a millionaire and a finest master who had become him.
"He liked Continental Europe's kitchen, like fish and cucumber sauce," says Coe.
"He ate almost in a golden dining room, on his head with a smoker.
He was completely alienated from reality."
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to set an example in his stomach.
As the book says, when Mrs Roosevelt hired a nurse who was not interested in the flavour, the foods offered in the White House were not only the boring ones of Washington, but also the worst produced."
Many of the lame-time foods were abandoned as soon as the land got back on its feet.
According to Jane Ziegelman, the continuation of tradition continues to be seen in the way we pay attention to calories and food and how science has been applied to cooking.
When writing the book, the couple tells us that she began to understand the eating habits of Ziegelman’s mother, for example, why she could not throw food away.
"He really feared that the food had to be thrown away," say Coe.
"The people even began to be sick of his food," recalls Ziegelman.
"For the first time, it's been bleached."
After the main dishes were emptyed at the Eisenberg lunch bar, Ziegelman and Coe brought out the nuts that they prepared at home, the same thing that President Roosevelt ate at lunch.
"It's called plum vacuum," says Ziegelman, and adds that giving a seeming name to modest recipes was a general trick.
There was no cream foam, only plums, little flour, sugar, water and rabbit.
We swept our spoons in a thick, brown, brown-ass garbage.
Suddenly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe sniffed twice and third.
"The German nuts would do better than this," says Coe to his wife, sounding like a positive budget manager.
Full remuneration to Gilead for the subsidy for the anti-hepatitis C patent tire with Merck
The judge of the US Regional Court decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to receive a full compensation for the subsidy due to the legal dispute with the manufacturer Merck & Co Inc of the anti-hepatitis medicine patent.
In June, Gilead was exempted from the damages of $200 million, which had been imposed on Merck’s two patents in connection with the prosperous medicines called Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead.
In the action registered on Thursday, Judge Beth Labson Freeman of the United States Regional Court says that Gilead was entitled to be exempted from the subsidy for the defence of the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which controls the market with a new generation of anti-hepatitis C medicines that can treat over 90 percent of hepatitis C patients.
The case runs until 2013, when Gilead and Merck challenged each other’s courts and demanded the private ownership of sofosbuvir under labor. Sofosbuvir is the active substance of Gilead’s medicines.
The troops supported by the United States have taken over by the city of Manbij from Isis
The troops supported by the United States have taken over the town of Manjib, near the border of Turkey, in northern Syria, when the last extremist organization of Isis' fighters left the city, reports the messenger of the troops.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) group is now depleting the city to find the last Isis fighters hidden in the city.
The representative of the Manbij Military Council of the SDF, Sharifan Darwish, told Reuters that 2,000 hostages of Isis' fighters have been released.
"The city is now fully in custody, but we are still carrying out search operations," said Darwish.
Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 per cent of federal tax
On Friday 2015, candidate Hillary Clinton of the Democrats published his tax declaration, which shows that his and his husband’s income was at that time $10.75 million and their actual federal tax rate 34.2.
In 2015, the Clintons donated a million dollars to charity organizations, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton made almost 5.3 million dollars in speech fees, and Hillary Clinton, who had previously worked as a foreign minister, announced that he earned 3 million dollars at Simon & Schuster's booklet, which dealt with his term of office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's Vice-President, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia and his wife, Anne Holton, published 10 years' tax statements.
The actual federal tax rate paid by them in 2015 was 20.3.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine are still showing models for economic transparency," says Clinton’s campaign supporter Jennifer Palmier in his communication.
The perfect opposite is Donald Trump, who hides behind excuses and cancels his promises to publish his tax information.
As a rule, the Presidential candidates in the United States have always published their tax information, even though the law does not require them to do so.
The New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have begun the audit of the tax administration and say that's why Trump hasn't disclosed his income data.
"Sirto is your" twiitta Clinton's campaign supporter, Ian Sams, referring to the tax information of the Democratic Society.
On Thursday, Trump Special Rights Assistant Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not let Trump publish his tax information before the inspections were completed.
The critics of Trump, including Presidential candidate Mitt Romney of the Republic of 2012, and other Members of the Republic, have said that his refusal to publish information raises questions about Trump's own capital, his contributions to charity, business relations and many other links, including relations with Russia.
Clinton has taken this question and published a video online on Friday, where he highlights the visible Republicans, which pamper Trumpia to publish his tax information.
On Thursday, Clinton raised the matter in his economic speech in Michigan.
"Trump refuses to do what every candidate of President has done for decades, and not its public tax declarations," said Clinto to the crowd.
According to the Politico Journal, Trump did not pay taxes at all or only paid for two years in the 1990s, and New York Times' business cosneskolumns quoted several tax agents and auditors that the situation could still be similar.
The federal tax rates have risen to the key issue of the presidential elections.
Clinton has supported a billionaire investor according to Warren Buffett's name, which would ensure that more than a million dollars a year deserve at least 30% of the tax.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week at the Clinton election event in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, the headquarters of the Berkshire Hathaway multinational company, challenged Trump's meeting, where both of them would reveal their tax information.
Buffet says that he has also been subject to the control of the tax administration and that Trump is not afraid of the tax authorities, but of the voters.
Clinton's campaign has published tax declarations until 2007.
The Clintons, now living in the city of Chappaqua in New York, paid real federal tax by an average of 32% between 2007 and 2014 and the actual combined tax rate they paid was around 40.5%.
The Clinton tax declaration for 2015 shows that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was paid.
Their main investment was a low cost index investment fund and the Clintons reported the amount of dividends and interest income of $100,000.

Chili powder-filled chili condoms for the protection of elephants in Tanzania
Natural conservationists in Tanzania have found an unusual way to keep elephants away from the vicinity of human housing — the elephants are being rushed to throw condoms filled with chili powder.
The art has proved to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the United States Nature Conservancy, has launched a campaign to teach the volunteers of the villages of North Denmark how residents can protect their homes and farms without harming elephants.
A while ago, the elephants were used for spears.
Friday is the world's elephant day, dedicated to the protection of animals.
"We have seen the method of changing attitudes in these villages, because now the villagers can trust that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming them," says Damian Bell, director of the Honeyguide Foundation.
First, the intruder elephant is distracted by showing the flashlight and playing the storm.
If this doesn't work, we'll throw the so-called chili cloud.
The chili powder mixed with the soil is placed in the condom together with the twisted one, and then the head of the condom is twisted in such a way that only the wire is left out.
When the ignition wire is ignitioned, the condom will explode and spread a fine chili powder cloud in the air.
Usually one spice cloud is enough to drive the elephant away.
The last way is to shoot a fireworks known as a Roman candle in the air and create a loud and clear explosion.
The Jewish film director criticizes the Berlin hotel about removing the Israeli direction number from the "building" of the Arabs – RT News
A French, root Jewish film director gave birth to a media trail, having revealed that the Berlin Kempinski Bristol hotel does not mention Israel's direction number in its country list.
Claude Lanzmann, the author of the Shoah document on holocaust, was disappointed by writing an open letter to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ).
In his recent visit, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the list of direction numbers offered by the hotel.
However, it was not mentioned among the countries to which you can call directly from the room.
"How is it possible that in 2016, in Berlin, the new capital of Germany, Israel has been completely destroyed – as if it had not existed?"
Lanzmann writes.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to call Israel through a separate call center.
The film director asked for an explanation about the hotel reception.
Lanzmann writes the response of the receiver shocked him.
The reception officer said that the removal of Israel from the list was "the decision carefully considered by the leader of the Kempinski Hotels".
The reason behind the operation was even more shocked by the film director.
According to Lanzmann, the official said, "Some of our guests are Arabs, and they demand that Israel be removed."
Suddeutsche Zeitung interviewed by the German ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman of Israel said the case was "great shame".
"We're all shocked and shocked by the killing.
It's a great shame.
And the more shameful it is when we consider that we are in Germany, and this is the hotel chain.
That doesn't require any more explanations.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions," says the Ambassador.
The case caused quite a counter-reaction on the Internet, where it was called scandal.
Some accused the Kempinski Hotel simply gave up the claims of the alleged Arab customers.
"Free" was said in a series of publications where the location of the hotel was highlighted near the synagogue on Kurfurstendamm street.
Der Spiegel writes the charges against the hotel quickly, called it a mistake and apologized to Lanzmann.
"The order to leave Israel out of the list was never given," says Suddeutsche Zeitung Kempinski, a representative of the hotel.
It adds that the direction number has subsequently been added to the list.
The police used tears and rubbers for demonstration of Brazilian students
Students joined the police on Thursday, Sao Paulo, when they gathered together to show their minds against the reforms of the government’s public education system.
The police used tears and rubberodes against protesters.
The mellacation began when law enforcement attempted to dismantle the student population, resulting in the use of rubber bodies and tears.
Hundreds of students who wanted to show their atrocity to the government’s plans were involved in the motion.
The Governor of Sao Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, has proposed a saving measure involving nearly 100 public schools closed and 300 000 students invested in new schools.
Some of the demonstrators made graffitis on the walls where the president's office was temporarily opposed to Michel Temer.
The demonstration of students only took place a few days after the streets were filled with the executive protesters of President Dilma Roussef, who voted for the Senate of the country on this matter.
Trade between Russia and Iran has increased 71% – RT business
The annual trade exchange between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 per cent since the removal of the compulsion, reports the Russian Ambassador Levan Dzhagary.
He said that the interest of Russian companies in business in Iran has increased since international sanctions against Iran were abolished.
"Russian companies continue to have existing relations with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
The further increase in trade is of course one of the priorities in cooperation between countries," says Dzhagarya.
He notes that during the first five months of 2016 trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% compared to the same period in 2015 and increased by USD 856 million.
"In particular, Russia's exports to Iran rose rapidly by 91.5 per cent, to USD 697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16% to 158 million dollars.
The sales of machinery, land vehicles and weapons were accelerated by the store," says the ambassador.
Dzhagary also expects a record of Iranian chaos to travel to Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian Foreign Delegation in Iran granted about 35 000 visas to Iran’s citizens, most of which were travel visas.
In addition, for the first time, Iran was among the first 20 countries that travelled to Russia.
And it is not too dare to say that the record of Iranian tourists travelling to Russia will be broken this year," he says.
The number of Russian tourists in Iran is relatively small, which the ambassador hopes to change.
"I can personally recommend travelling to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he says.
Scoot Callum Skinner would make the goal of winning British bike gold
Callum Skinner, Scotland, was renowned at the Men's Team Prince, Rio's velodrom last night, when the British triangle defended the 2012 championship in London.
Skinner, a 23-year-old, Glasgow, was in an anchor he inherited from his countryman, Sir Chris Hoy, who made the legend proud to thank the goal and capture the victory from the New Zealand team.
The British took the surprise victory four years ago when Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympics.
And they repeated the trick after they were only placed in the sixth in the MM races of the track bike in London in March, despite the fact that Hoy had left his competition.
The problem between Beijing and London was replacing Jamie Staff, who specialized in the role of the first driver.
Hindes just came up at the right time.
Hoy's decision to terminate a career left a hole that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner, Scotland, was a man to whom the British coachs believed and saw the potential he now redeemed.
Hindes, Hoy and the championship four years ago won Kenny and Skinner made an Olympic record in time, but in the first round New Zealand was faster.
And the British triangle won gold in a double fight.
Hindes was steadfastly behind after his round, but Kenny was working on the team's lead, which Skinner kept.
A large part of the change was to change the strategy in such a way that Hindes ran to slow down the speed at a higher rate, making Kenny and especially Skinner able to keep the speed.
Hoy followed BBC as a commentator and reached Skinner's, Kenny's and Hindes' eyes when they entered the prize height.
The 23-year-old Skinner of Glasgow says, "I'm flattered with breast-feeding.
I was just trying to do my best and succeed.
We made an Olympic record at the final and won the world champions.
That was incredible.
There's no better way to win it."
After winning in London 2012, Hindes, together with Kenny and Hoy, admitted that he had deliberately fallen on the track because of a bad departure.
Later, he canceled his word and the British competitors did not have an appeal.
This time, there was no such problem with the victory of the sovereignty.
Hindes says: "The feeling was like in London, all the UK flags were floating in the view.
Our team was united over the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships that victory in the Olympics feels great."
In other words, one competition, one gold medal for a country that won seven of the ten ratamestars in both Beijing and London.
If this is a measure to the progress made over the last five months, five days of debtodrom will be successful.
As Kenny has demonstrated, it is not impossible to imagine that he repeats Hoy's achievements and wins three Olympic golds in one of the Olympics.
This would mean a record of six gold medals and one silver medals for Kenny, which is exactly 12 years younger than Hoyta and was born on 23 March (the magical date of British sport, also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farahi and Roger Bannister).
Medal aids would be the same as Hoy.
Kenny's next competing in a sprint that starts today and solves in three days.
A Bolton 28-year-old Kenny says, "This is the moment I can only enjoy this.
The team race is always the best.
You can enjoy winning together with your friends.
Winning alone is a little lonely."
Hindes says, "If he wins two more gold medals, he must have the value of the knight."
This was the only medal race of the day, but Britain received more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest four men in the team.
Their time was 3:51.943.
The world record made in London in 2012 and winning gold is 3:51.659.
The first round and the final (clock 22.42) are competing today on the second day of competition, and the focus of the attention is certainly Wiggins.
Last night, he had a contest with the competitors before the time, when the journalists invited him to measure his length.
In the same competition of women, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Milngavie reached the world recording period 4:13.260.
The British team can now rely on its powerful track bike team to take responsibility for the middle stage of the Olympics and bring a series of medals to the country.
After the truly extraordinary evidence received from the full leadership position in Beijing and London, the expectations before Rio have been underestimated.
The background has had drama, the least of which is the dismissal of the Technical Director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of the claims of sexual and temptation, and the end of the major athletes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, the first night of the Velodrom competition shows that the United Kingdom's legendary reputation is already coming to the top at the perfect moment once again.
The future of Portland's melting plant at stake due to the termination of the electricity contract
The future of the aluminium sewerage plant in Portland in Victoria and therefore the jobs of thousands of workers are at stake when the power plant power plant for the melting plant told that one of the owners of the factory is dismantling the supply contract and that all delivery contracts are expected to be terminated.
This is the result of the earlier decision made by the Victorian Government this year not to continue the aid in which the factory will be operated.
Fixed 20 years of aid ceases in November.
Alcoa Portland factory is in danger of losing up to 2,000 jobs.
As a result of recruitment, up to 2,000 direct or indirect jobs may be at risk.
The snowball effect can continue to grow, as the melting plant consumes about 10% of the total electricity production of Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry's melting plant, which led to the closure of the Anglesean power plant last year.
Alcoa Portland's melting plant loses money and is in danger of closing its doors.
Measures correspond to the speculators used in the factory's future for years, which were first caused by the price of the Australian strong dollar and recently the factory's production.
AGL, which supplies electricity to a large aluminium sewerage from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, expects that three other holders of the melting plant will also cease their contract.
The majority owner of the factory is a joint venture formed by Alcoa and Alumina. Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp owns minority shares.
According to AGL, it expects Portland's production plant to remain operational, which means that the physical demand for electricity from the melting plant will continue.
AGL states that the contracts are so-called safeguard agreements that were to enter into force in November 2016.
The termination period of contracts shall be 12 months and shall end in 2017.
"So AGL expects contracts to generate revenues in the financial year 2017," says the power plant.
The potential impact on AGL from 2018 onwards is currently limited by the strong future market prospects for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL already said that it had lowered the value of the contracts in its accounts for $187 million as an "preliminary to terminate the contracts".
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ability to keep the melting plant operational or to secure the supply of electricity to the melting plant".
The American company reported that he concluded a 20-year agreement with Loy Yang in 2010, which was to enter into force since November of this year, even though it still needs to find out why it has now withdrawn from the agreement.
Due to the weak economic situation in Alan, analysts have been careful about their assessments of both the melting plant in the State of Victoria in Portland and the Tomago factory near Newcastle.
The AGL Operational Director, Stephen Mikkelsen, mentioned earlier this week to the analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity at the annual level and Tomago uses about 900 megawatts.
"If these factories leave the market, it means a significant decrease in demand (electric) in the market.
As a producer to us, it would not be good news," says Mikkelsen.
Kardashians TV star Kendall as a cover girl in September Voguen
The model of Kardashian-Jenner clan and the fourth daughter of Kris and his mother and manager, Kendall Jenner, 20, poseera in the famous United States Vogue September.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder's commercial face and has been performing in Milan, Paris and New York fashion tiles, announced the news in his Instagram account on Thursday.
"Looking in a room full of my beloved got me tears," Kendall wrote.
The file was published by a strange (or perhaps only following the style of the Kardashians series?), a handwritten video where all members of the Kardashian-Jenner family (Bar Hägers Rob and Caitly and everyone's favorite uncle, Cardashians producer Ryan Seacrest) appeared, forgetting the cover picture of their sister.
The pattern is clichic, and it is used for almost all the birthday periods of the sten program (Seacrest says, "Do you think we forgot about you?" as sincerely as the imagination of children's morning TV), but Krisin had to get the other daughters in some way involved in this publicity.
For the presence of Vogue in September is undoubtedly a new period of Kardashians.
Kendall’s sister, Kim, had a chance to get to Vogue’s cover before (when Vogue was in the deck with his husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue is quite in his own class.
The number of September is the most sold publication of Vogue in the year.
A lot of advertisers are attracted by a large number of pictures that reminds me of the fashion magazine (the fashion site of Fashion decreased that last year's 832 guide had 615 pages of advertisements).
The publication of the September letter is expected so intense that in the past two years the pictures of the magazine have leaked into the public even before the official announcement.
Previously on September, the cover models have been such as Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangel and Kate Moss.
In recent years there have been more celebrities in the model work than models that are celebrities.
Oscar winner and Dior commercial face Jennifer Lawrence was in the cover in 2013, and a year later, Lady Gaga was honored.
The newspaper describes Jenner as a model of success of his generation, and even though he would rather be reading among the celebrities that work the model, he is with quite a good company.
These celebrations are not relatives of well-known people, true TV stars or modern children who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of them).
They can rightly be called gifted women who succeed in the entertainment sector over others.
Last year, Beyonce in the cover is behind one of the strongest years of her career, when she published her Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy for Jenner's success.
Because of his true TV background, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be a bull.
In June, the original model of Victoria's Secret, Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and his colleague, Gigi Hadidi, by calling them "nacks".
These emotions have reappeared to the surface when the news of Jenner's appearance on the Vogue deck came out.
However, continuous displeasure seems insignificant.
Kendall Jenner is a cover model for Vogue September.
He's a super model, in the purest sense of the word.
He's walking in Marc Jacobs' fashion show.
He's an Estee Lauder makeup face.
He and all his sisters sell pictures of themselves through paid applications.
He's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, which he photographed on the LOVE magazine.
And at his leisure time, he's playing on the real TV, perhaps just as a way to meet his sister and her children.
Legal assistance centres turn away 160 000 people a year
Every year, over 160 000 most vulnerable people in the country will be withdrawn from legal aid centres, and the sector will prepare for the impact that additional cuts will already have on the centres operating at the extreme borders.
In the state of Queensland, legal aid and legal service seekers are reversed from three of the five — most of them are older people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and unjustified decisions and similar injustices, without resources.
Public legal assistance services, which have already been overloaded, are preparing for additional cuts of appropriations.
As of June next year, legal assistance centres are at risk of losing 30% more of federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Public Legal Assistance Centre, states that the latest calculation report prepared by the Legal Assistance Centres by the National Organisation of Legal Assistance, already thousands of people will be revoked annually.
If the federal government doesn't make its decision, Farrell says it's just going to get worse.
"The Public Legal Assistance Centres in Queensland are constantly under-financed, meaning that thousands of people will be turned away when they seek the necessary services they need," says Farrell.
"People, uncontrolled and resentful debt burdens, divorced families, unjustly dismissed workers, all of them have problems with legal matters, and this report shows that they are unable to obtain the help they need.
The federal government intends to cut funding by 30% from June 2017, which means that thousands of Queensland's most vulnerable people will have to deal with complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Chancellor of Justice and the Senator of Queensland to George Brandis to give up these financial cuts immediately so that people can get the legal assistance they need.
Last year, the state administration fulfilled its promise to bring legal assistance to the national central level.
It is now time to take into account the needs of public legal assistance centres and their customers and the government of Palaszczuk must invest in this important work."
A complaint against Donald Trump's campaign was filed on the threat of an employee with a gun.
New York: A complaint against Donald Trump's campaign was filed when no action was assumed to be taken after it was reported to its leadership that the leader of North Carolina had threatened the employee with a gun in their driving in Jeep in February.
The event is described in the action brought by the former software instructor Vincent Bordini of the state campaign on Wednesday at the State Court of Charlotte.
Bordini says that she waited for months to handle the situation within the campaign before she realized that this would not happen.
Bordini, in his application, says that Champagne Director Earl Phillip took out a pistol, put his right front finger on the trigger and pressed the pipe into Vincent's knee slope.
Bordini heard that at least four other persons had experienced the same experience with Phillip, following a complaint to the local and regional leader of the campaign.
"Although the gun doesn't fire, it causes damage," says Bordini in his claim.
The application will only be two days after the Presidential candidate of the Republicans caused general rage when he said to the crowd in North Carolina that "the supporters of the second additional paragraph" – which are considered to be armed owners and armed persons – can take action if his constituent candidate Hillary Clinton wins the election and has the right to choose judges.
According to Trump's campaign staff, the media separated his word from the context and Trump said that he did not encourage violence.
Bordini demands reimbursement from the campaign for uninterested and Phillip for assault, assault, and mental suffering caused by them.
Hope Hicks, Trump's informant, did not immediately respond to a message that asked him to comment.
Phillip was not targeted despite the companies.
Charlotte's local news office, WCCB, told me Phillip recently left a campaign.
No immediate answer was received on the call request submitted by Phillip’s consultancy company, the Innovative Consulting Services.
Donald Trump, President-in-Office of the Republic, has been running a contested campaign.
Case: Bordini v Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
British must use the Olympic Spirit to expand Heathrow
Heathrow also revives the economy and creates well-being – not only in local communities and in London, but in the whole country.
It was for myself that most interested in Heathrow. As in the Olympics in London, 2012, we made a huge contribution to the benefit of our whole nation and all our regions.
The Olympics brought huge benefits to Stratford and the East End.
We're doing this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we create 10,000 new apprenticeships and 40 000 new jobs, which eliminates youth unemployment in the neighbourhoods of the airport.
As in London's Olympics 2012, there are always people who think Heathrow's enlargement is too great a challenge.
As far as the Olympics are concerned, I heard that Britain will never be ready for them and that we are in the eyes of the rest of the world in an embarrassing situation.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they're gonna be wrong about Heathrow as well.
But Heathrow will answer every question asked about it.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that benefits many rather than many.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and increase the economy by GBP 211 billion, bringing knowledge and employment to the airport environment and to the United Kingdom as a whole.
We have a great team on Heathrow that has implemented in time and remained in the budget an infrastructure investment programme of GBP 11 billion, which included the T5 terminal, which has been voted for the best air terminal in two consecutive years of the year, and the T2 terminal, which was built in the middle of the two world's fastest runways.
Now they are ready to produce a third runway with a private investment of GBP 16 billion.
The Olympic Olympics in London in 2012 were a great success for our country, and I am convinced that it will also be an extension of Heathrow.
It is time for us to use the same Olympic spirit for the expansion of Heathrow so that we can guarantee the future of our trade and create knowledge and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of Heathrow's Government and former Commercial Secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook Advertisement in a cat mouse game
The attempts of companies who deserve their money from online advertising to distract advertising software have become a cat-hiir game, says one of the inhibition programs produced by the company.
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook had announced on its website to prevent advertising programs, Adblock Plus published a blog, where it told that users can update their inhibition software filters and thus prevent community service advertising again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that he would change the registration codes for its desktop site, so that it would be harder to identify the parts of the advertisement.
But now Adblock tells me he's figured out the new codes.
In his blog, Adblock reporter Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of balling between the open-source advertising community and distractors has been running since the adventure prevention was invented" and that it is possible that Facebook will soon make his own repair movement again.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has participated in the fight is a strong indication of the concern that advertisingists have formed into the sector.
Overall, it is estimated that 200 million people are using advertising prevention programs, explains the study conducted last year by Pagefair and Adobe. The figure has almost fourfolded since 2013.
Facebook uses 1,03 million active users daily on mobile devices, and the share of mobile advertising is already 84 per cent of Facebook advertising revenues.
However, the company intends to contribute to the distraction of advertising programs in its desktop application, as the informant suggests that mobile display prevention programs do not work on Facebook's mobile applications and Instagram.
The revenue from Desktop advertising remains sufficiently large and therefore Facebook considered the contribution to be profitable.
On Tuesday, Facebook also told us that he was updating the user settings advertising tool so that users could be more able to control how to target advertisements.
On Thursday, Facebook criticizes Adblock's new filters because they also prevent the appearance of some normal Facebook writings.
"This is not a good experience for users, and we are going to solve the problem" said Facebook informant when e-mailing.
"The prevention programmes are clueless and ineffective, and we have instead invested in the development of user settings such as advertising tools in order to enable people to control the distribution of advertisements themselves."
A woman committed suicide by leaving under the cars on a Swiss motorway
The victim was lying on the motorway in the middle of the night.
The police are asking for witnesses' help on the motorway of a crash in the first hours of Thursday, where the woman deliberately left under several cars.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway in Vaud's canton near Morges shortly after midnight.
She did her despair by laying down on the dark road, and she was hit by more cars, tells Vaud's police when she told her.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman, and his attempt was clearly suicide, and there was also a truck among overdriven cars.
She died at the scene.
According to the police, many car drivers involved in the accident have already been interviewed, but some are still unidentified, asking them or other witnesses of the accident to report.
At the Le Tribune de Geneve, Lawyer Gilles Hofstetter tells us that criminal investigation has been initiated, which is a logical step forward in such a situation.
However, it remains to be seen whether there are charges against car riders involved in the accident.
"Is it impossible to avoid a collision?
It stays to the prosecutor," says Hofstetter.
During the last five years, two similar cases have occurred that do not lead to the fact that car riders are considered responsible.
According to the newspaper, in both cases, the person walked in the dark road, and the court decided that the drivers cannot expect to run into a pedestrian on the motorway in the middle of the night.
Last year, the police authority was released from the prosecution that had been brought against him after he encountered a man lying on the A1 motorway near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The Court heard that the 22-year-old victim had had plenty of alcohol and had passed out on the road.
The Court considered that the driving pattern of the police, which was responding to the emergency call, was justified and that the man lying on the road was "full exceptional and unforeseen".
On Thursday, some aware of the accidents near Morges are asked to call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus has been viable
According to the NASA's new climate model estimates, Venus may have been viable.
The NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) developed a model to explore the past of Venus using the same tools and algorithms as the climate scientists use.
The model was designed to determine whether the conditions in Venus were sometimes similar to those in the earth, even though Venus is hot and waterless and its gas area is almost completely carbonated.
According to previous presentations by researchers, the slow rotation rate of Venus is explained by its thick gas circle.
However, on the basis of the latest simulation, it can be assumed that Venus has had a thin atmosphere equivalent to the earth and has still slowly rotated.
The model was also used to determine the early Venus surface formation.
The planet was likely to have more dry areas than in the earth, but there may have been enough water and geographical variations to maintain life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent more thin.
"In the GISS model, Venus is slowly spinning, and its day-to-day is almost two months at a time of day," says GISS researcher, Anthony Del Genio, in the press release.
This warms the surface and generates a rain that creates a thick cloud layer. The cloud layer works like an umbrella and protects the surface from a large amount of sun heat.
As a result, the average temperatures of the climate are even a few degrees lower than the current temperatures of the country.
The model used to create Venus' story, which corresponds to the previous assumptions of planetary researchers about its development costs.
Although Venus may have been viable, it has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light for several billion years.
Its oceans vanished, and the ultraviolet light burned steamed water.
Only a thick carbon dioxide-containing gas area and a lethal greenhouse effect — i.e. Venus, as it is today.
Researchers reported the results of the new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy quits his place as coach of Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned his duties on Thursday as coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and as Vice-President of the Society’s Hockey activities, calling on the lack of potential for the team in decision-making.
Vice-President of Colorado/President Joe Sakic confirmed the news and announced that the company would immediately start applying for a new coach.
"For the last three years, I have carried out my mission as the head coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and as Vice-President of the Society hockey activities, intensively, passionately and determined," says Roy, a 50-year-old.
"I've been thinking long and harshly about how I could improve the team, give it the necessary depth and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the Vice-President of Coach and Society’s Hockey activities must be fully in the same line with the organisation.
He must also have a say in decisions that affect the team's performance.
These conditions are currently not fulfilled."
Sakic, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," says Sakic.
"We are grateful for everything he has done for our organization, and we wish him all good for the future."
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the best coach for the year of the League for his first period as Head of Avalanche 2013-2014.
He led the company to 112 points and won the central division, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the drop party and hasn't been able to continue in the last two years.
Avalanche reached 39-39-4 power points during the period 2015-2016 and remained five points away from Minnesota Wild when playing from another Wild Card site at the Western Conference.
Roy, the Hall of Fame paintman, won four Stanley Cupia – two in Montreal Canadiens and two in Avalanche.
Negotiation and suspension of strike by oil workers in the North Sea
The main negotiators tell the North Sea Oil Workers' Salaries strikes to be interrupted when all the parties involved in the dispute are taking part in the new round of negotiations.
The Wood Group, which provides oil field services, has been subject to strikes on drilling trucks under the management of Royal Dutch Shell in the North Sea.
According to the joint statement of the parties, "Wood Group and trade unions Unite and RMT confirm that they agreed to reinitiate the process in order to resolve the dispute".
From the beginning of the next week, we will be holding a number of lasting meetings throughout the next few weeks, which address the problems of recent aspects.
The unions just justified their recent activities, which they said was the first for more than 25 years, as a protest to potential 30% pay cuts.
Due to negative market pressures, Wood Group cuts the tariffs of its contractors operating in the North Sea this year by about 9%.
The company's tariff reduction follows a 10% reduction in the prices of contractors working in the countries in 20114.
According to the company, additional operations will provide it with the space needed to cope with the downturn of the market.
Shell, on the other hand, has cut off thousands of employees and has announced their plans to leave oil and gas drilling in up to 10 countries, thus seeking to enhance its functions after its megafusion with the British Energy Company BG Group.
Lower oil prices and the economic situation, which is the result of the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union in June, creates pressure on energy companies.
The Scottish Member, Dave Anderson, met the workforce leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest working conflicts that the North Sea has experienced in the whole generation.
He believes the North Sea is vital to the economy of the region.
"In the North Sea and the whole country, we need a economy that has an advantage for many, not just a few," says Anderson.
The new North Sea projects are expected to spend less than EUR 1.4 billion in 2016 when they have spent around $7 billion over the last five years.
Kepler measures the speed of the stars in the Plejad Star Force
The latest task of the Kepler multiplying scoop has been the measurement of the speed of the stars, which has helped the astronomers to gather the most comprehensive list of the speeds of rotation of the stars belonging to the Plejad Stars.
On the basis of new information, astronomers will be able to determine why stars belonging to the same group rotate at different speeds and how the circulars relate to the formation of the planet.
"We hope that by comparing the results with other stars we learn more about the relationship between the star weight and age and even the history of the solar system," says the researcher at the University of Caltech infrared processing and analysis in the press release of Luisa Rebull.
The Plejad Star Force is 445 light years away from the earth.
Many stars of the Stars have been born about 125 million years ago, which means that they are just reaching their adult age.
They're rotating faster than ever.
When the speed of rotation at the top of the stars grow up, a large number of stars will be dismantled from the stars.
These winds have a braking effect on the stars when they go through the stars' magnetic fields.
When the star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by monitoring the time between identifiable spots (conforming to sunlights).
The latest rolling speed data listed indicate that larger stars are slower than smaller.
Rebull compares stars to dancers – larger twists slower than smaller.
"We see from Plejad' dancing that slowly rotating are typically larger, while the fastest rounders are typically very light stars," says Rebull.
Since the Plejad Star Force is so close, it works as an ideal space laboratory that enables the characteristics of the stars to be compared to the speed of rotation.
"The Plejad Star Force offers a pillar of support for the theoretical models dealing with the rotation of young and older stars," says Rebull.
We want more information on how, when and why the stars slow down their spin speed and stop their dance.
Rebull and his colleagues will present their latest analysis of the speed of rotation of Plejad in three new articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal magazine.
