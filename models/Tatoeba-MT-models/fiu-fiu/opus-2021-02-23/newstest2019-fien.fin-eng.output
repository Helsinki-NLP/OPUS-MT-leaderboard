Emel Kouki led to Hurrikaan's home victory at the opening of Savo Volley another victory.
The Hurricane-Loimaa of the Mestaruusliiga Medals of the Flying Ball of Men started the season 2018-19 at home, when Raision Loimu fell on Saturday 3-0.
The general player returned from Romania to Finland Eemeli Kouki was 22 points of Hurrican’s most effective play.
There were some incisions for foreign countries, but they did not come true, and then they came to call from Loma.
It was pretty fast, Kouki said.
Like Kouk, Loimussak played Tomi Rumpune's support for Kouk at 18 points.
The most effective of the visitors was the country team factory in Samuli Kaislasalo at 17 points.
The winning of the opening game is always important.
Many players had experience on the other side, and it brought an additional screen to the game.
Our game is not yet ready, but the continuation of the medal pipe is of course the goal, Kouki said.
The most powerful of Savo Volley
Miro Määttanen was 18 points the most effective Savo Volley when the team dropped the Vantaa Ducks 3-0 by the side.
Our game was incredible, especially at the end of the attack, but, fortunately, we got a squeeze of victory.
At least I had no knowledge of a different kind of download when I played against my former team, Määttanen said.
Antti Siltala, who started his career in the next Airball in the 3rd series in the period 2000-01, made 12 points.
Chief Coach Jukka Tuovinen was pleased with many things.
The Hall was a small, or atmosphere in the roof all the time.
Well, that's a good one left for home.
Miro was the king, the Helsh played a good game too, Tuovinen said.
The last season of the Silta was in the league between 2006 and 2007, and then he won silver in the Pielave in Sammo, while he was still the main coach at the time.
Thiago Maciel was Ducks's most effective at 14 points.
Mikkone again the star of Akaa-Volley
During the 2012-13 League score exchange, Joni Mikkonen has started this season strongly.
The hacker made 25 points when Akaa-Volley took the season's opening victory after he dropped Kokkola Tigers 3-2.
The season has begun on its own.
Today, of course, there was a loss close to us because we had the fourth round on the 17-21.
There was some sort of a triumph, and the fifth round came there at the same time, Mikkonen said.
A few years ago the Tigers were the most effective was 28 points made by the hacker Edvarts Buivids.
Landman Aleksandrs Kudrjashovs supported 17 points.
There's not much to get into the guy's hacker, Mikkonen said.
Finland in comparison with human capital, the world's number one
Finland is at the world's top in comparison with human capital, says the science magazine Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years Finland was the first of statistics.
In 2016, the top five was almost the same as in 1990.
In the past, Iceland, Denmark, Canada and Holland followed Finland.
Later, Holland was located one higher and instead of Canada found Taiwan on the list.
In 2016, the worst in comparison was Niger and South Sudan.
The measure of human capital will examine the level of education, access to education, skills and health of the population.
The World Bank has lined human capital in relation to economic growth.
Real Madrid Thibaut Courtois held Atleticon in control, local game ended in paintless
Real Madrid's goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois went to the glorious fights, and the local game of the Madrid teams ended in a paintless match late Saturday in Spain's football league.
Atletico from Madrid, Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were the closest to the goal, but the Belgian guard Courtois got to fight.
Courtois played at Atletico three times when he was a Chelsea player.
During the first week, Fifa, the International Football Association, chose him as a year's goalkeeper.
In real, the best goal was Gareth Bale, but his shot was headed past the goal at the end of the opening side.
After a break, Bale switched over because of a comb injury.
According to the ESPN, the disappointed Realists shouted in the fight by the painthead Cristiano Ronaldo.
In the United States, we are now attacking the right to abortion, a powerful documentary tells us why
The US Senate is currently trying to determine whether one of the nine members of the Supreme Court could be chosen by President Donald Trump, Brett Kavanaugh.
In the Republican Party, many hope that Kavanaugh's decisive voice could be abolished by a decision known as Roe Wade, which made an abortion legal in the United States in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's documentary film Reversing Roe - the United States and abortion rights tells us how the current situation has been achieved over the years.
As incredible as it feels, the topic is also topical in Finland.
Timo Soini (sin), Minister of Foreign Affairs, has worked publicly against safe abortion and has received special support from most of our country's representatives.
At the beginning of the powerful document, the gynecologist Colleen McNicholas, who has remained the only abortion doctor in the state of Missour.
The armed guard of the clinic says he's defending the freedom of religion in the United States.
The news videos remind us of the murderous terrorist attacks on the clinics.
Let's move on at a time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At that time, the Lutheran Confederation guided women to reliable abortion doctors.
The reasonings of the interviewed pastor are good, but in fact, they are not even needed, the photograph of the woman who died himself for an abortion is enough.
Deaths in the United States were about 5,000 years.
The legalisation of abortions was defended in particular by the Republican Party.
Even in 1967, in California, Governor Ronald Reagan signed an abortion law.
Later, in his 1980 presidential campaign, Reagan began to confusing religion into politics with the electorates to grind.
His abortion position also swirled his successor, George Bush, older.
And Donald Trump did the same thing.
The deepest dossier of the matter will lead to a reason for the politicalisation of abortion.
When tax freedom was denied from religious organisations that profited race separation, they became politically active.
An abortion was chosen as a stick horse.
Religion has brought exceptional knots into politics.
When writing this, in the United States, there is a situation where the president, who caught the voices of the religious right in his abortion position, has chosen Kavanaugh as a candidate for the highest court, which many women are now accusing of sexual harassment.
Kavanaugh can have the power to choose the rights of 164 million American women and girls based on the vase language position.
The Israeli army fired seven Palestinians, including two children, at the border of great demonstrations
Approximately 200 Palestinians have been killed in six months after Israel has fired demonstrators in the border zone.
The Israeli soldiers fired seven Palestinians in the Gaza Border Zone on Friday, the Ministry of Health of Palestinians reports.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, there are two children, 12 and 14-year-old boys.
According to the Ministry, 505 people have been wounded.
89 of these bullets were wounded.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened fire and made an air strike on the border zone when demonstrators throw Israeli troops with stones and explosives.
The army says that they have started using power to prevent demonstrators from breaking down the frontier fence or reaching the other side of it.
At least 191 Palestinians have died in the Gaza demonstrations since March, when the Palestinians started their weekly demonstrations at the border.
According to the UN Human Rights Council, 12 000 people have been wounded.
Reasoners demand access to Palestinian families, from which the Palestinians had to leave when the Israeli State was established in 1948.
Palestinian sniper has killed one Israeli soldier.
The explosives dropped by slots and helium balls from Palestinian side have lit forest areas and farming lands in Israel.
The Temu Santa got a punishment kick. He couldn't shoot himself.
Wigan's top pair of Chey Dunkley seemed to have knocked him down with a buckle in the punishment area.
Judge Gavin Ward let the game go on.
According to his interpretation, the bucket was clean.
The Teemu Santa couldn't believe his eyes.
I think the situation was going to be troubled by Judge Ward, who sentenced Norwich for the 85th minute when Santa was defeated.
Ward showed me a bang of punishment, and Mario Vrancic shattered a 1-0 winning painting.
Santa has made five goals for Norwich in the Championship series.
The previous was born last Saturday against QPR with a stylish breast muscle.
The job tasted like Santa again.
After she lost the ball, she continued until the end of the situation.
He created paint situations and defended without being tired.
Norwich had a five-week fight.
The team's going on in the liigacup.
There's five wins in the back.
Assistance services for pedofils were completed immediately - in Finland about 40 000 experience interest in children
It is estimated that 2% of men and a small proportion of women experience at least some sexual interest in brochure ages.
In Finland, this means about 40 000 people.
Sexual interest in children or young people has so far been difficult to get help.
The joint SeriE project of the Criminal Support Foundation and Sexpo trains professionals to meet pedophiles as clients and help people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was told in the spring, in Sexpo’s e-mail and meeting hours began very quickly, Yle tells us.
However, these are promised for the time of the release of the autumn.
Sexual preference for children causes many to be ashamed.
Most of the people who notice pedophilic feelings themselves have not performed their fantasies and thus did not commit any criminals.
However, preference is usually a permanent feature.
Most of them hope to get rid of the thoughts that harass them and discourage them.
They also complicate normal life, says Yle, a sexual therapist, Patricia Thesleff, who acts as a specialist expert in the project.
I think the work is valuable if one child is spared from sexual violence, Thesleff says.
The Corean leaders or the congo gynecologist?
As a winner of the United States President Donald Trump Nobel Peace Prize, the idea may suddenly sound strange, but Trump is one of the biggest favorites to win the prize.
The background plays the role of Trump in obtaining North Korea at least at the level of speeches to commit to nuclear warfare.
The greatest favourites of peace for Nobel are the figures of South Korea's President Moon Jae and Head of North Korea, Kim Jong, who have already met three times this year and pledged to seek a peace agreement between their countries.
The warming between the jewelry is significant, as between last year and between them was sparky.
Yet, the reward of Kim leading to a rainbow and landing in nuclear weapons would undoubtedly also raise criticism.
The Nobel Prize recipients will be made public from Monday, and on Friday the most important, the Peace Prize.
If the award is not given to those who participate in the Korean Peninsula diplomacy, there is one of the top candidates of the Congo doctor Denis Mukwege.
In his hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a highly respected gynecologist has treated thousands of women who were victims of mass rage and became a leading expert in the world.
Mukwege has given attention to sexual violence, which is a creepy by-product of many conflicts.
A strong candidate has also been regarded as the UN Refugee Organisation, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981.
The Nobel Committee has told me that this year there are 331 candidates for the prize.
The names of the candidates are not disclosed to the public.
Trump himself wouldn't mind if Nobel had.
In May, the journalist asked him in the White House if he thought he deserved a Peace Prize.
Everyone thinks so, but I would never say that, Trump said he smiled.
I want to finish this.
The prize I want is a victory for the whole world, and the President continued to refer to the North Korea negotiations.
However, there are things that make Trump's Nobel unlikely.
The Nobel Nobel Committee, which decides on the prize, has often recognised the persons and organisations representing Liberal Democracy and the multinational order - just the international cooperation that Trump has seen as its opponent.
In the 21st century, three US politicians have received the prize, all of which have been democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007 and Barack Obama in 2009.
So the reward of Trump would require the Nobel Committee to have an ideal full translation.
Fire notice in the tunnel: Drivers acted like compliments and drove in the wrong direction
The transport chaos on Loh's first time took place on September 8.
Transport of the tunnel area was interrupted in the direction of both Turku and Helsinki.
When it found out that it was systemic, the fire department tried to make traffic normal.
However, it did not succeed very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Traffic Centre said it cannot be opened because there are car riders on the road in a pig's blind and they drive how it happens, the day-old firemaster Pasi Kääräinen told the recently STT.
At that time, the motorway was launched to drive even in the wrong direction only after a moment of waiting.
When the first starts to act against traffic rules, a few others often follow, Transport Safety Contact Manager Tapio Heiskanen is astounding.
According to transport rules, motorways and tunnels must not stop for forced reasons.
Transport security reminds us that in exceptional circumstances, transport cannot be compromised by urgent solutions.
Alert vehicles shall always be allowed as far as possible.
In particular, driving in the opposite direction on the motorway is prohibited, as well as making the u translation and withdrawing.
The same bans are also valid in tunnels where, in addition, headlights must always be switched on.
It is also forbidden to stop without compelling reasons, as is, of course, parking.
There have even been cases in which the driver has stopped in the tunnel to brush snow from his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for this activity, says in the Transport Safety Notice.
Ilves fans would have wanted to continue their celebration, even though the ship was caught on the lake bottom.
The Ilves fans transported to Tampere by M/S inland waterways would have wanted to stay on board to continue their victory party, even though the ship had caught its swing on the bottom of the lake, Juho Syrjä, who acted as the head of the ship at the time of the event, said.
M/S Tampere, who was on his way from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, went off the route late Saturday night and was caught on the bottom of his bow in Aka.
19 passengers on board the ship and five crew members were evacuated at the mainland during the night.
No one was injured in a buddy.
Ilves fans would have wanted to continue their celebration until morning, but, of course, it was more sensible to send them to the firehouse on a port and on a bus home, Syrjä said to STT.
The Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna following the Ilves and HPK fight, which ended with the Ilves 4-3 victory.
According to the cylinder, Saturday's hammer was due to the surface of the water in Vanajavede about half a metre lower than normal.
According to Syrja, navigation was also undermined by the fact that the nearest trail mark was covered by the logs, and therefore its reflectors were not normally visible in the dark casket.
Not a more significant impact
Haver took place on the west side of the narrow Jumusensalme shortly after the shipping route was below the bridge of the road between Tampere and Helsinki.
The case was not associated with a major dramatic situation according to Syrjä, as the ship’s speed was very low at the time of the event and the impact of the bottom caused a more remarkable impact.
According to the cylinder, the catching on the bottom has not caused any leaks or pressures on the ship, and, with these visions, the cruises of the ship continue normally.
On Saturday morning, the diver came to check the ship properly before the ship was towed off the malt.
We're still going to the shipyard to check that there was no damage, Syrja tells us.
The sky believes that the next cruise in M/S Tampere, the next weekend, can be handled in an agreed manner.
The cruise season of the ship continues with him until the day of independence.
No use for ambulance
The Rescue Department received an alert from the case on Saturday night, just half after 12:00.
The violin port was alerted to ambulances to receive evacuated passengers, but there was no use for ambulance.
Matti Willman, the chief fireman, told me late in the evening that the evacuation conditions in the lake were difficult because of darkness and rather tough wind.
The rescue in Pirkanmaa announced half three of the nights against Sunday, that all those on board had been evacuated and that the passengers were transferred by bus to Tampere.
In 1957 the cruise has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
The judge who accused of harassment and drunkenness of Trump may not be in the highest position.
Brett Kavanaugh, presented as judge of the Supreme Court of the United States, may well fail to seek the post, assessing Mika Aaltola's programme director at the Foreign Policy Institute.
So far, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour during their studies.
According to Aaltola, the suspicions have brought so much political pressure on the Republic Party that President Donald Trump may end up presenting another person.
In the United States, there has been some time before, that the President's candidate for the Supreme Court has raised a great deal of contradictions.
In this case, the judge has usually withdrawn, says Aaltola.
This is how the President has been able to keep his face.
The title would be a hundred to the bar of the Democrats
The Supreme Court of the United States is seeking to be above politics, but at least in Kavanaugh's case the choice of a new judge has become a very politically sensitive process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, the decision is likely to rain in the forthcoming interim elections of the Congress of the Democratic Party, according to Aaltola.
It would raise the vote among young people and women who would more likely vote on democrats.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge to the Supreme Court would be a long-term profit for the Republicans.
There is no chance of appointment for every term of office, as in the United States the judges of the Supreme Court are appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have retired at their own request at the age of some 70-80 years.
Even a part of the Republicans hesitate to call
The US Supreme Court’s Judges are normally subject to a background report, Aaltola says.
Although Trump has only ordered a week's extension to the FBI, it can still bring up something relevant according to Aaltola.
Yeah, it might bring you.
It's rarely smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
According to Aaltola, at least it is certain that Kavanaugh's suitability or inappropriateness to the post is still being discussed vigorously before the Senate decides.
The Republicans have a majority of 51-49 votes in Senate, but at least two female Republicans suspect Kavanaugh's name.
The most embarrassing thing would be that the name would be put to the vote and the Republicans would lose.
Woman identified Salisbury suspect as a military intelligence agent
The Russian woman has told BBC to identify a suspected Russian man from Salisbury's poisonings as an agent for Russian military intelligence.
On the basis of the photographs, the woman told me that this was a military intelligence with Anatoli Tshepiga working in the GRU.
Net community Bellingcat and Russian community Insider Russia told us earlier that they revealed one of the suspected men who were poisoned to the Czech Republic.
In the past, they said that they found evidence that men's current identity was undercover personalities.
The BBC group traveled to a village near the border of Russia and China, where Tshepiga grew up.
A woman in the village recognized the images published by the young Tshepigan Bellingcat.
He recognized the same man from the British police photos of the man who now called himself Ruslan Boshirov.
Russian men are suspected of poisoning the former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter in March with the Novitshok nerve poison.
Scrippals survived.
Colonel Tshepiga has been rewarded, among other things, with the honor of the Russian hero in 2014.
Russia still denies the suspected GRU connection.
Men suspected of poisoning previously told the Russian television interview in September that he was tourists in Salisbury.
Older Pussies in War Reform
There is now a living example of what the change of war reform, as defined by the Sipilian Government, means in practice.
My birth, the Vaala War services are produced by the Oulunkaari municipality, the former Regional Director of Attendo, who was elected head of health service in 2016.
The Heads of the Municipal Association shall warn the delegation from the change limiter.
If war expenditure is now rising, the municipal state aid will be cut in the future.
The central decision-makers of the municipality frightened, and most of them are prepared to have a major structural change in the care of the elderly, which would stop the department of the health centre from organising the institution and small memorial diseases.
Domestic care would be added, which means long distances in Vaala, that older people in the outskirts will be ripped to the nearest health centre to be treated as "home".
Attendo trusted that the municipality would pay him customers.
The left of the whale did not undermine the ill-preparation, but organised a good public meeting, with many loved ones, neighbours, as well as other parties.
I presented the preparation of the war in the diodes on how old people are already being treated in the Vaala municipality at the present time in the home of the whole of North Ostrobothnia.
Carina West was also in charge of the neighbourhood.
The local magazine made a big case about the opportunity, and then it lifted Oulunkari's manufacturers to their backyards.
War manufacturers do not write on any paper that Attendo has built a new care home in Vaalaa, which is now waiting empty residents.
There are no other service providers.
Preparers talk only about a service cell, but they do not tell the level of treatment that Attendo receives or in which staff structures until the elderly are being treated.
Without a nurse?
In particular, the establishments of the health centre will be terminated because there is no doctor’s nightcare.
Attendo will also take advantage of the doctors of the Vaala Health Centre.
An example of the whale shows how central officials rotate the mandated with inadequate knowledge and the authorised ones are placed on the back against the wall with a change limit.
Thus, the Central Party will emptie from the inhabitants of Vaala, for who will remain unsafe to live voluntarily if there is a chance to move away.
Was it one of the electoral statements in the centre of Central that the whole country would be held in housing?
Turk President Erdogan opened a major mosque in Köln
In the town of Cologne in Germany, thousands of people expressed their minds when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan opened the largest mosque in Europe.
Several hundreds of people had gathered on the beach of Rein River since the morning.
Erdogan, you are not welcome, read on the signs of demonstrators, and the slogans condemned fascist.
During the visit to Erdogan on Thursday, a number of demonstrations have been held, and security measures have been tight.
In Cologne, about 10,000 people were expected to protest, among other things, the human rights situation in Turkey.
Erdogan’s supporters were also gathered near the great mosque.
However, the police had isolated the large region from the mosque for safety reasons.
In his opening speech, Erdogan praised the success of his German visit and assessed its strengthening of relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdogan met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
On Friday, Erdogan and Merkel swore to rebuild relations with countries which have been significantly worsening since the Turk Revolutionary Company for 2016.
However, Mr Merkel stressed that there are deep differences between countries, including with regard to human rights issues.
Reviews are surrounded by visits
Both Cologne’s mayor, Henriette Reker and Prime Minister Armin Laschet of the State of Nordrhein-Westfalen revoked their participation in the openings when the assessment of Erdogan’s visit accelerated.
A 30 - year - old student, Cansu, from Turkey, told me that he had received a demonstration against Erdogan from Switzerland.
I want to be a voice for those who cannot go on the streets in Turkey.
They've been arrested, killed and armed.
For Erdogan, everything that differs from his own thinking is terrorism.
In the last phase of the trip to Erdogan, a significant proportion of the population in Nordrhein-Westfalen is of Turkish origin.
In Slovakia, three accusations of the journalist's murder
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
The prosecutor told me on Friday that three people are accused of the gymnical murder of Kucia and this engaged man and other crimes.
Earlier this week, the police arrested eight people in the murder investigation, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak was found in February with his fiancée in his home in Bratislava.
He had studied the links between the politicians and the Italian mafia.
The police have suspected the murders of Kucia's investigations.
The case and the article published by Kucia have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
There may be problems with the distribution of the cattle in dispersal areas on Sunday
Due to the misuse of the printing, the Sunday Karelian must also be mailed unaddressed.
This may appear in the distribution of the magazine in areas of dispersal, where the distribution of joint boxes is required to be carried out from the outer memory.
The situation was the same with regard to the Saturday magazine, and the problem may continue on Monday.
The posting puts extra magazine tricks in the province.
The other Finnish subscribers’ leaves will be sent separately only on Monday tarbed.
The distribution of these magazines will be markedly delayed.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut.
Today, journalist Arto Nyberg interviews directly in his forthcoming debate program, including Vesa Heilala.
Vesa is at the studio telling about the coming space trip he booked from Virgi Galactical in 2010.
The price amounted to EUR 151 000, which was needed for the payment of a bank loan.
If the original plans were correct, Vesa would have gone into space a long time ago.
However, the day of departure has been postponed for one year.
Now it seems that, after an unlucky test flight in 2014 and even a death victim, things are in order.
If all goes well, commercial flights will start again this year or at the latest during the next year.
The number of the toilet flight is 300, i.e. his trip is about a year away from the first departure.
The flight will take 2.5 hours and the pressure condition will be 5 minutes at a height of 100 kilometres, the Finnish astronaut will tell us about the future website.
At the same address, he also backgrounds the need for space.
When I was a kid, I read a comic paper called Space Travel, and I saw a Star Trek series on TV.
The stars' wars have been seen, and that's what the idea stayed...
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a harsh host.
Manchester City continued his lossless journey to Valioliga, when it poured Brighton's painting 2-0 on Saturday.
Final injections for the sixth victory of the Governing Master Team Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero.
Sterling was able to direct the fourth of the season from the nearest distance to the empty goal when Leroy Sané found him at 30 minutes from the back of the Brighton paint.
Agüero raised his goal balance to five when he saw the Brighton defense with Sterling in pieces with the 65th game minute.
The Argentine was able to invest the 2-0 end-ended punishment at the point easily.
With six wins and one semester of the season, the City will lead Valioliiga 19 points on catches.
However, Liverpool, who played one less than a fight, is only one point away.
Liverpool meets Chelsea Serial Three on Saturday night in her seventh round.
The young societies chose new endors in Joensuu
At its Sunday meeting, the Finnish Youth Society elected new endors for the next three-year period 2019-2021.
Anu Sivonen Ylä-Savosta was elected Chairman and Vice-President Petra Mäkeläinen Hämee.
The Board was elected 40 members and 40 alternate members, Finland’s Youth Society will be informed on Sunday.

The Young Society meeting in Joensuu gives three promises in its three-year goals: We keep the doors open for all, and we organise equal recreation activities regardless of the place of residence and background, and we support volunteering activities and people on their own paths of growth, the Finnish Youth Society will tell us about it.
Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Räikkö and amazed Ferraria: "To lose a very important driver"
The Swiss newspaper in Blick's interview with Mersu's British Church asked, does he believe that the release of Kimi Räikköe from Ferrari's services would help Hamilton in the final period.
Hamilton leads Ferrari's other driver at MM points with Sebastian Vetel at 40 points.
A little less than three weeks ago, Ferrari told me that Räikkönen would not continue in the stable for the next period, while Räikkönen announced that he was moving to Sauber.
Hamilton, of course, does not believe that Räikkönen would punch gloves in the dishes.
I don't think Kimi's gonna change in the remaining races.
He's an extraordinary professional... fantastic driver.
He stays one of my favorites, and I'm convinced that Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
It doesn't make any sense to me.
Hamilton's told me before that Räikkönen was one of his premieres.
I don't know if Kim knows this, but when I was young and dreamed of a formula from one, I played F1 on PlayStation all day.
I was always Kimi, which is pretty crazy, and Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season will continue on Sunday at the Russian sub-competition.
The Mercedes Valter Bottas will go to the commencement race at 14 p.m.
Evening is following the race for a moment.
The football A-young SM series championship became a full farce: the opponent arrived only with 7 players
The highest serial level of football boys ends on Saturday, when the last round of the season is played.
The starting points before 13:00 were clear: FC Lahti Akadeemia has been able to do a point against Vasa IFK in practice.
In order to turn to the last round, Ilves, the second in the championship fight, must win PK-35 and hope the Gulfs to lose.
However, the Lahtian championship was practically confirmed before the beginning of the violation, since Vasa IFK had arrived at the Lahti with only seven players.
If there were one less vasians, the fight could not have been initiated.
The FC Lahti Academy won the 16-0 match.
At the break, the Gulf led 7-0.
One of the reasons for the vassal player's loss is the fact that the team has played in part with the same players the A-youth SM series, i.e. the P20 series and the Second C block of men.
Vasa IFK has played in the Second, in practice, against the fall of the entire season.
In the second round of decisions, on Saturday, Vasa IFK must win in JBK's visit, while at the same time hope that Tampere United will lose his own visit to KuFua against the Silk Lake Tovala.
The car ended up on the roof of Eno, according to the rescue department, there was happiness involved.
The passenger car drove out of the way and ended up on the roof in Eno on the Juttuvaarant on Sunday at 9:00.
There were four people involved in the accident.
Two of them were mildly injured. The rescue department will inform you.
Good luck was involved. The press says.
According to the Rescue Department, the road was wet from the rain.
The police patrol went to the accident site.
Supo is waiting for new ways of enquiry: installations and recruitments already made, planning for abroad is not delayed
According to Supo's Chief, Antti Peltar, the intelligence law has been prepared by making equipment purchases and training staff.
As intelligence laws enter into force, a permanent increase of about EUR 10 million should be made in the solar budget.
At the centres of the protection police (supon) located in the Ratakadu of Helsinki, full decisions are already being prepared for the entry into force of the intelligence laws.
Antti Pelttari, the director of the Supo meeting, tells the West Media that equipment has already been purchased for future intelligence.
Serena Williams is confusing with a video where he sings in the topless, campaigning for the knowledge of breast cancer.
Tennis's superstar Serena Williams meets again.
Now he campaigned to raise awareness of the breast cancer by publishing instagram's account a video where he sings only his hands in front of his breasts, reports AFP.
The title is Australian The Divinyls 1991 hit I Touch Myself.
The video Williams supports the operation of the Australian breast cancer unit.
"The Divinyls voices the global hit to remind women to carry out regular self-activity checks", Williams writes in his Instagram message.
And yes, this put me in the discomfort area, but I wanted to do it because the subject touches all women regardless of the skin colors in the world.
Early detection is everything a and o - it plays a lot of lives.
The second author of the Divinyls is Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project made to honor Chrissy Amphlett.
"He passed away with breast cancer, but he gave us a hit song to remind us of women to put their health first," says Williams.
The video has now been watched 1.5 million times.
It was released early on Sunday morning.
In the video comments, Williams is praised for courage.
Williams left the tennis tournament in Beijing this week.
There's a problem with the US's open tennis tournament three weeks ago.
Williams came to the main judge of the fight and claimed, among other things, that men were accepted to be much more vigorous than female players.
Chinese restaurant with a mountain base is not suitable for heights
In addition to traditional Chinese delicious landscapes, the restaurant serves magnificent landscapes.
The Chinese province of Zhejiang has opened an exceptional restaurant.
It is literally located on the rock’s tongue.
You can look at the woods underneath, if you want to.
High landscapes in the high places allow restaurant visitors to haunt their lives in the Longquan Mountains.
Getting to the restaurant requires walking in the middle of peach trees.
The restaurant opened to travellers on 19 September8.
The Youtube commands wonder where the restaurant toilet is located.
Walking to the restaurant requires good ground condition, reports of the place.
The colony runs out today: This is how it all ends
Everything good ends in time.
Today, that's what happens to a domestic country drama in Corpela, which has been quite held.
The third production season has gone to hot stones: last week, 722,000 Finns were first on television.
The peak figures are no longer of any practical significance, since the Heikki Luoma and Jukka Mäkise series have no success.
In the final period, the relationship between Jaska and Mirku is taken again with the aim of stretching forward, and I think the mother of Jaska is the first to guess what to come.
Even between Anss and Miisa are warm, in the light of recent events, directly romantic, but then again, the Milk appears.
The police have a suspicious position on the man of the bone.
But none of you know the fate of Laiho in advance.
Anita, on the other hand, will hear amazing news.
The last will of the distance will come out that brings a woman to the edge of tears.
A week later, at Sunday afternoons, Sorjone continues to take over.
I'm going to have a sculpture run today on TV1 at 21.05.
Do you want to go to work tomorrow with a little flu?
Here the facts for and against
The flu season is hot.
A lot of scars are gonna stay home or not.
However, it is worth considering whether others should go to the infection because the disease may be contagious even if their own symptoms are small.
Sometimes flu symptoms strike suddenly, sometimes they occur in skies.
In the latter option, you may already infect others, even if your symptoms seem small, says Prevention publication.
So you think you should stay home?
Prevention indicates that flu is contagious even when a person has no symptoms.
The virus is already infected one day before the symptoms begin and forward from five days to a week.
Children may infect the disease longer.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you shouldn't be at school or at work.
You can go back to work when the cough persists and there is no fever anymore, says professor Gregory Poland.
It's also worth avoiding training.
Too fast to return to the gym slows the recovery.
Also, remember to wash your hands, put your handkerchief in your handkerchief and throw your junk papers in the trash.
Still sick on the move?
If you have to leave the home sick, consider using the protective mask.
Maski does not control viruses, but keeps the user aware of the area of the head.
Then no fingers will be put in the nose or mouth, Poland says.
The evaporations are also restricted to the mask.
Well, then, how can it be avoided?
The best way to wash your hands still is to avoid touching your face.
However, it is difficult to avoid the latter.
In the United States, for example, the average person touches his eyes, nose or mouth every 15 to 30 seconds, Poland warns.
The new Miss Finland reiterates the missile tradition: "My man is a hockey player"
The hockey player and Misses are often connected.
This also happened at Alina Voronkova, 23rd.
In 2018, the crown of Miss Finland to their couriers has been received by Alina Voronkova from Pertunmaa.
Beauty now lives in the Gulf, where he moved when he was 15.
Alina's mother is an inkerinian and his father is a Russian.
The Russianity of the father, Voronkova, was bullyed at school.
My mother and Father have moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was being bullyed because of my Russianity.
I had no friends in Pertunmaa, Alina tells me about the semifinals of Miss Finland.
After high school, Alina decided to start off a clean table and move into the Lahti to go to high school.
Soon the missile neighbour found new friends, and the ark left to roll hopefully.
When he was 15, he thinks he's an adult, but afterwards, I really wasn't.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner, Jonas Hurr, who is familiar with Pelicans.
After the SM-liiga career, the hockey player has played abroad, such as Sweden and China.
In 2009 he was in the Finnish team at the MM races of the 18-year-olds.
In the early days of the date, a couple or almost a year of distance, but later Alina was able to travel with her husband to the world.
If I could get to the winner's triangle and by that, I'd be brave about the career, I don't want to believe that it would affect our relationship in any way.
Even if we had to live separately, we have good confidence and the good thing in the remote relationship is that it is the initial stone that stays above the full time, Alina was swept in May.
Joyfully of continued growth, death on our sides
Nearly everyone is concerned about the lasting capacity of the earth.
Still, there's nothing they want to give up.
Sustainable options are being sought for continued growth, but the theory of reasonable economy also runs into major problems.
During a few generations, the continued growth of the economy has brought ordinary people, especially in the northern side of the ball, the level of living that could only be dreamed before.
However, the long-term overrun of the world's capacity and climate change cause this market economy to scarcely deteriorate.
Two men were stabbed on Sunday night in Kannelmä at Sitrator at 4:00 a.m.
The man born in 1986 was seriously injured in the knife and the second was born in 1968.
The older men have already gotten out of the hospital.
The police have captured one person whose possible contribution to the stabbing will be investigated.
The police are also looking for another suspect involved in the events.
These events are being investigated as a attempt to kill and assault.

Important paint and valuable point, tightened Maarianhamina's chief coach Peter Lundberg.

We made a lot of mistakes during the opening season, but fortunately, the Turks' goal brought us stronger by the game.
Home team Inter's chief coach John Allen said the game was under control, but the goal was again painting.
One of the defensive mistakes took us a full score, Allen troubled us.
We were the best again!

The leaf showed its sub-power skills, the playground is not sure yet
The strong underpower game of Jori Lehtera emerged when his NHL sergeant Philadelphia Flyers played his last exercise before the beginning of the season.
Philadelphia won Boston 4-1, and Lehtera fed Michael Raffl twice to paint.
Last few days, the Lehter has been present because of drug suspicions.
On Wednesday, MTV told me that Lehtera is one of 23 suspects in a drug mix that is suspected of drug use and is part of sales, for example.
The leaf has denyed that he committed a crime.
The Society and the player have discussed the subject, and NHL is investigating the case.
The reporter of the Philadelphia Inquirer, close to the Flyers, Sam Carchidi, assessed after the fight that Lehter was part of the six attackers, five of whom are in the NHL team.
Carchid said Lehterä was excellent at the gym.
In the second round, Lehteri fought the hose with subpower, pulled the defendant against him and fed him to the opening of Raffl waiting before the goal.
For the second time, co-operation with the twin brought the goal right at the end of the fight.
Flyers will start the NHL 4th October with a visitor fight against Las Vegas.

The restaurant ship M/S Tampere crawled to the cattle in the Saint Lake - "Streetly tied up with a rock coke"
Inland waterway M/S Tampere drove to the beach late on Friday night at the Akaa Saint Lake.
The Rescue Department was alerted for a water traffic accident on Friday night after mid-12.
A 30-foot ship M/S Tampere has swept away and is firmly attached to its swing with a rock, described by the day-old firemaster Matti Willman.
There were 19 passengers and five crew members on board.
According to the Rescue Department, people were avoided.
Passengers and almost all crew members have been evacuated on the continent from the ship.
Now they're being transferred by bus call to Tampere, told the head of policeman Jari Nieminen STT at 1:00 a.m.
The violin port was alerted to ambulances to receive evacuated passengers.
A ship from Hämeenlinna to Tampere had for some reason drove out of its route on the west side of the narrow Jumusensalme.
The police will find out why this happened.
Matti Willman, the chief fireman, told me earlier last night that the conditions in the lake are difficult because of darkness and rather tough wind.
According to the Rescue Department, the ship's fate is unclear.
Obviously the ship's not leaking.
After the evacuation operation, the divers will start to check the situation on the ground.
M/S Tampere, built in 1957, is now an inland waterway vessel operating as a restaurant ship with the maximum passenger number of 180 persons.
A meeting space must also be rented on board for private use.
According to the ship’s website, the cruiser has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.

Ex-managers demand unpaid bonuses from Robert Helenius
The boxer Robert Helenius' fight tonight against Erkan Teper is obstructing a bankruptcy.
Evening-Sanoma news today the boxing manager Jaakko Helminen and Vice-President Jussi Kokkila's application for a challenge in which Helenius will be charged in total unpaid manager fees of over EUR 80 000.
According to the application for a challenge, Helmine and Kokkila worked for Helenius on 15.4.2014-30.1.2015.
We've been trying to reconciliate, but there's no other choice.
There has been a clear mandate here, and the work has been done very much, Kokkila says to the evening-Sanom.
The current manager of Helenius, Markus Sundman, sent a reply to the evening magazine, which describes the events of the boxer’s view.
Helenius denies being obligated to pay the required amount.
According to the opposition, Kokkila and Helmine had provided their services in a financially bad situation to Helenius and promised that they would be able to organize her matches and sponsor income.
Often it was agreed that Helenius was obliged to pay fees only percentages of his fights.
It was assured repeatedly that Helenius does not have to pay for anything, only receives the revenues they provided.
This is also a normal and only practice in the management of professional athletes.
The work on wages has never been agreed and would have been insane in the Helenius situation, and Sundman will find out in his message.
A written agreement was never concluded on cooperation.
According to the opposition, Helenius would have wanted to make a written agreement on the distribution of income, but Kokkila and Sundman had received the draft until the end of 2014.
He found the proposal to be poor on his own behalf and broke out cooperation with Kokkila and Helmi.
Helenius never fought once in dealing with Kokkila and Helmine.
A year after the end of the co-operation, Helenus had been assigned a "indefinite but immense" bill from the manager's work.
This year, the claim has been raised with the same arguments.
Helenius considers the aftermath of Helmine and Kokkila to be poor, the answer states.
Helenius meets today the boxing union in Stuttgart of Erkan Teper, the seventh list of the IBF's heavy series of challengers.
Heartful man and good journalist
The entertainment artist and music producer Ilkka "Ile" persecution felt the late radio broadcaster and journalist Erkki Päll for decades.
A long-line radio trafficker and journalist Erkki Pälli died at the age of 83 into unhealed liver cancer.
The report of the runner's death was published on Sunday Helsinki sanomam.
The announcement says Päll died on September 3.
Päll told me about a serious illness on his Facebook page in March 2018.
At that time, the publication also saw Ile Vainio, who was saddened by the knowledge of the familiar fate.
He left on Facebook before, as goodbye, Ile Vainio says.
The persecution thinks Erkki Päll is a multi-sponsor, who became a brilliant journalist.
He remembers the person he had been keeping the Päll with a quick hoksoes and fun stuff.
I already learned to know Erk as a little boy when I first went to the Finn Disc at the age of 12 and started in there as a warehouse.
Erk and I met.
At the time, he was a informant of the Finn Disc and in various tasks, Ile Vainio remembers.
When I went to make records as a music producer, there were hundreds of occasions where Erkki Pälli was a standard editor in all the festivals of artists.
He was always expert, and I saw how big a fire he had for entertainment, music, and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got straight to the skin of his interviews.
He was a hearty man and a good reporter.
For many, he was known as a highly respected Yle's radio dealer, but he also wrote great magazine stories.
Erkki interviewed me several times, too.
He was good at talking, Vainio praises.
Over the decades, Pälli worked in addition to the journalist work in Fazer with Hope Kärje.
He was a music producer on Vesa-Matti Loir's records.
However, the greatest passion of the skull was the radio work in which he had a unique style.
Since the 1960s, he did radio work, and he became familiar with numerous listeners in Yle's ether.
He retired in 1998.
On Saturday, the Skiing Association of Finland informed that the annual period ended in May showed some 450 000 euros of profits.
The Union describes the "comprehensive translation" of its economic situation, although the economy is, of course, burdening the "significant debt in the balance".
The Managing Director, Mika Kulmala, praises rapid response and severe economic discipline.
We responded to the situation as soon as possible in the last autumn, taking adaptation measures.
The activities of careful planning and economic management have swollen throughout our organization, Kulmala will tell you in the release.
We have also succeeded in procuring partners and the profits of the world cubes were maximal in the past competition period.
However, cost management must continue to be accurate, while at the same time we need to continue looking for new financial models.
I heard my wife yelling at help, but then there was a silence.
Tens of bodies lie in the backyard of the hospital Please in the city of Sulawes in Indonesia.
Only one building is separated from the area that has been collected to assess the need for injured injuries and treatment.
Patients are also being treated outside for extinction.
One of those who moved in the hospital area was a 52-year-old returner of Baharudd, who was looking for his son.

I probably got squeezed under a crashed wall.
I heard my wife yelling at help, but then there was a silence.
I don't know what happened to him and my child.
I hope they're safe, and Haris's news office told AP according to the British Times.
Small shops are robbed
Please, at the evacuation center, a 35-year-old baby's mother, Risa Kusuma, tried to calm down his hot baby.
He described the moods in the city as tense.
There's little clean water.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere, Kusuma told me.
Many Please have slept in outdoor or temporary bamboo areas.
Even if the house is somehow upright, any afterquake could destroy it permanently and bury the inhabitants.
According to AP, more than half of the prisoners in prison were escaped after the prison walls collapsed.
The prisoners were known to be about 560, so there may be around 300 fugitives.
Some of the prisoners in Donggalan prison have also escaped, says The Jakarta Post.

Please, the airport has been reopened mainly for auxiliary flights.
Among the first ones, an army C-130 transporter landed on the field, bringing backup supplies.
Commercial flights Please allow the field only limited.
The pilots will have to land on the field without the help of air traffic control, as the air traffic control tower was damaged in a severe earthquake.
The rain sweeps over Finland at night
A long rain zone spreads across the country on a Sunday night from the west direction, says the Air Science Institute.
The rain comes mostly as a water, but in Central and North Lap there are expected to be storm or snow.
The baggage of the previous night is not repeated because the temperatures below the cloud cover remain higher.
The cloudier night keeps the lowest temperatures pretty efficiently in control.
Just in the west, you can visit the package for a moment, said the day friend of the meteorologist Ville Ilkka.
On Sunday, the rain zone will evade the east of the morning.
In the south and western, there are clouds or half clouds.
In the afternoon, temperatures move to Oulu's height at 10-13 degrees.
The starting week looks similar to the southern and middle parts of the country for the heat stations, but the weather becomes more instability.
Sea regions have wind and wave warnings.
There are no real storms of sympathy for the next few days, but otherwise there is a typical autumn variable weather.
Well, it's autumn, it's really starting to get on, Ilkka said.
Miss Finland is not seen on television

We were hoping he'd get to college before he went to the missile contests.
The Russian father of Dimitri and the Inkeri Svetlana mother believed their daughter's success at the Miss Finland Final.
Recent Miss Alina Voronkova’s parents Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkova followed proudly the first moment of their daughter’s crown in the head.
They sank into the audience from Pertunmaa and were going to drive back home after the final.
It's a lovely atmosphere!
We believed Erika all the time, but half an hour before the result began to get tense, Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana is an Inkerian and a Russian Dimitri.
Alina speaks a smooth Russian, even though he has lived throughout his childhood in Finland.
Svetlana says that Alina was more interested in acting and in many other things than the career of Miss.
Alina was often told that when she's so pretty, she should be a miss.
But he said he wanted to be a radio broadcaster.
Only later did Alina get excited about the beauty contests.
The parents hoped that Alina would be able to go to college before taking part in the Miss Finland competition.
That is what happened, and ultimately Alina wanted to do a degree before the missile contests.
We asked last year why he didn't attend, but he wanted to finish it.
Parents believe that Alina won the competition because it is a healthy example for young people and adults.
He's got a lot of sports and he's eating healthy.
And Alina likes to be out there, it's visible.
Alina's boyfriend Joonas Hurri hockeys in Japan and couldn't encourage Finland to love at the final.
Alina's parents believe that the relationship of young people lasts a missile year.
Yes, that's what it's meant to be!
The parents were hoping that the daughter would be able to visit soon.
It's been such a long break in visits because of the missile speeds.
I'm already sorry, even though there's been messages.
The young man died in the overtime in the Bay, the police arrested three people.
According to the police, three people have been captured as a result of the incident.

More information about this case is available at the beginning of the next week.
Sari Piippo left its career in Brussels and became a home mother in Finland - remembered the idea of comics: lack of drawing skills did not slow down
In the meantime, my husband left from a stunt where he suggested it as a person to the story I developed, reports the espoolic comic blogger, the home mother and the former EU translator Sari Piippo.
Sari Piippo says that he was a EU translator for economic and legal matters in Brussels until the family became a returnor ten years ago after the fourth child.
I've been enjoying myself as a home mother.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point, I remembered what the big one would do when the smallest child started to be big.
Then there was a comic picture in 2014.
Pippo tells me she never dreamed of making a comic book, even though she had read Aku Anchor, Tint and Asterix when she was little.
I had drawn it when I was a child, but when these organic manuscripts began to come up then, the situation changed.
At first, I made some dozens of scripts in the table box.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (p. 2000) is a skilled drawer, but I couldn't get him involved until summer 2016, when I donated the Line with a drawing disc.
His enthusiasm lasted a dozen stripes, and then he had to start trying, laughing at Piippo, who says the drawing plate was a great stimulant for him.
The drawing plate is an easy and convenient tool trying to get something into place.
I didn't even try to draw the paper, tells Pippo about his relationship with drawing what he usually does at night.
Handwriters are constantly reminded of, but I usually do not do it at a time.
One of the three square stripes takes even more hours.
I may make a screen at a time, and I'll be happy to play with colors.
Starting drawing is always the hardest, because drawing is not my strongest species.
Sari Piippo says he appreciates the modern series of newspapers, including Scott Adams Dilbert.
The people of the organic cow are the mother of a carrot with a salad leash.
The other people are Man, Pissis and the twins.
In the world of organic cow, man is what he eats.
The ideas of a series come from their own life and social media.
Sari Piippo doesn't want to preach or offer a forced bubble, even though it's a matter of nature.
Piippo tells me that she reads her show with her husband and children.
It's such a great feeling when you look at the cartoon you're drawing and tells me that this is what I've done today.
And there's plenty of challenges for the home mother!

The Indonesian earthquake: The Flying Director sacrificed himself... did not leave a breaking tower until hundreds of passengers were secured.
Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21-year-old airline director, has become a hero of the Indonesian earthquake.
Agung stayed alone in the air traffic tower until hundreds of people were safely transported by a passenger machine from the island that was shaken by the earthquake.
The young man was on the turn of the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport in the city when the earthquake hit on Friday.
When others escaped from the air traffic tower, Agung refused to leave the place before it could be deployed from the Batik Air passenger train to the air.
Thus, he could save hundreds of lives, the Indonesian aviation administration told the AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport on Saturday after the earthquake.
The air traffic tower was vacuuming and cracking.
Finally, Agung tried to save himself by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
His leg broke, and he got serious internal injuries.
Agung was sent to a close hospital.
He was supposed to be transported by a helicopter to a better equipped facility, but he passed away 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, a representative of the aviation administration told the Jakarta Post.
The intensification continued to increase the flight to get into the air, and its strength was eventually measured by 7.5 magnitudes.
At least 832 people lost their lives.
The Indonesian aviation administration has respected the heroism of Agung in social media.
Mr Rehn was thinking of the end of Europe to trade war: "We need to look at the next tweet"
The US-China trade war reflects the whole world economy.
Growth forecasts have been calculated throughout Europe, and the Bank of Finland has also slightly reduced its own economic growth assessment.
In Yle's first position, the Director General Rehn said that, although the extremist tension has no direct impact on the European trade flows, it weakens confidence, which reflects the investment decisions of companies.
The situation also concerns exports from Finnish companies.
Rehn believes that Europe is a very good one for now.
It has been able to build a peace of peace with the United States and has contributed to calming the situation with China and Japan.
In the view of Rehn, Europe does not appear to be going on the foot of a trade war.
We'll have to check the next tweet and then check it out.
We have a pretty unpredictable partner in Washington, but he said in Yle's interview.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of them is the third largest national economy in the euro area Italy, which is also one of the most indebted countries in the euro area and the whole Western world.
Last night, the market reacted dramatically to the deficit budget clearly presented by the Italian Government on Thursday night.
The next year's deficit is more than 2.4 per cent of the national product.
Rehn is concerned about the situation in Italy.
5% of the country's loan stock is problem credits and more than 10% of unplanned credits are available.
In addition, its public economy is in weak positions, and the country seems to be reaffirming its commitment in relation to its European partners.
There may be no need to paint new crises yet, Mr Rehn answered when he was asked whether Italy would take Europe to a new economic crisis.
The second issue that challenges Europe is the difference between Britain and the EU.
Rehn hoped it would be okay.
A disputed difference would have much more negative effects.
Rehn started as director of the Finnish Bank in July.
Mario Draghi, Director-General of the European Central Bank (ECB), will be retired in a fair year.
The debate on his successor has begun.
The name of both Rehn and his predecessor Erkki Liiasen has flashed in speeches.
I'm sure it wouldn't mind if Finnish names were involved, Rehn said and added that he was not going to comment further than this.

During this evening, journalists and photographers will tell the fact story they have prepared for a long time, which has not been published in any of the HS instruments.
There's something else that no one's ever heard.
"There is a strange spy in the night of Helsinki, an impressive report on the other side of the world and a very topical health issue," reports Esa Lilja, one of the producers of the Black Box.
After the presentation, the public will have the opportunity to meet HS suppliers and photographers and to continue the debate.

A missing mushroomer was found by "preliminary experiment"
Drone skills from the Finnish police are the world's top: "We are asking about training"
According to the Head of Police University of Applied Sciences, the police may use the drone in addition to searching for missing persons, for example in criminal investigations and intelligence tasks.
On Tuesday, Oulu's police succeeded in finding the drone of a missing mushroom in Raah only in a few minutes.
Director Kimmo Himberg at the University of Police University referred to the case and mentioned, among other things, that "with the help of unprecedented experimentation and effective training, we are the world's top here too".
Drone is quite new and more recent in police duties.
There are no statistics that the Finnish police would be the master of the use of drone.
According to Himberg, there is a strong idea that this is the case.
This has survived, for example, when Finnish police experience has been reported in international events.
There's so much interest in that, Himberg says.
It would be hard to squeeze visitors to watch the Finnish police drones.
We're being asked for training.
More and more common
Himberg reminds me that finding missing in winter conditions in Finland is of great importance as soon as possible.
As stated, in the case of Raahe, the lost person was found with the drone only in a few minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
Himberg says they're supposed to be more trained.
Even now, the drone is used in police tasks, and the use of them will increase and increase in the future.
That's how I dare to say, Himberg tells me.
In addition to searching for missing persons, the police may use drones in the investigation of accidents or crime scenes and specific intelligence tasks, according to Himberg.
For example, we already need to go over a little longer to check some area where there is possible fear that there will be violence.
Drone can be used for pre-conscious purposes.
Karjalan Rugby rose to number one diver
Karjalan Rugby celebrates the victory of the 2nd Division on Saturday in Kuopio.
The Joensuuers were still in the middle of the game at 7-12 losses to the Helsinki Rugby Club, but they found a plot in the second episode and whispered the southers to 26-12.
At the same time, the 2nd division championship knew Karelia Rugby had historic rise to the 1st division.
Previously, the company has played in the first place, but at that time the Finnish rugby serial activities were divided into two levels, the SM series and the multi-division 1 divisions.
The Society's going to accept a serial site, but it's gonna know quite a job next winter.
The current less than twenty players must be raised to 25.
One division also knows the growth of the number of games and longer gaming trips, so the money purchase must also be consistent with it.
Kotkaniemi begins the season in Montreal, strengthens the chief coach
The main coach of Montreal Canadiens in the ice hockey NHL confirmed the company on Twitter that the Finnish winner Jesper Kotkaniemi would start the season in Montreal.
Montreal booked a super vow in Kotkaniemen, 18, with the first round number for three summer reservations.
The attacker joined Montreal's rehearsal strength from the end of the summer and has presented strong extracts in September's practice games.
The Kotkaniemi succeeded in making a goal in his first internship.
Chief Coach Julien said he said he'd taken a big move to the Finnish camp after he arrived.
The NHL frame series begins next week on Thursday night against Finland's time.
Montreal meets at the opening round at Toronto Maple Leafs.
What's a good leader?
This week, much has been talked about driving in Finland.
Risto Siilasmaa, chairman of the Nokia Government, reported the interview in the HS, in the booklet of Paranoid, in which he illuminates the leadership of his philosophy.
At the same time, he criticizes his predecessor Jorma Ollila's leadership.
Ollila strongly challenged the accusations, but the previous Nokia surveys have mentioned the inability of leaders to act as a team; fear and speechlessness, in which respect of the collapse of mobile business.
The risk-taking and sensitivity of the company's rising phase have disappeared.
In Helsinki, there was also a business giant event in Helsinki, Nordic Business Forum, which attracted the cream of Finnish business life to the Fair Center.
In addition to Barack Obama, 12 stars of business rose on the stage.
I've had enough talk about good conduct.
The legend of leadership, Gary Hamel, said that a good leader must dare to bring the company to the future even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that decisions are taken by those who are most emotionally linked to the decisions of the past.
John Mackey, the founder of the well-known Whole Foods trading chain from the wide range of organics, said that the director must be able to communicate to the entire staff the purpose of the company.
And that does not mean simply making profits to owners.
Susan Cain, who wrote about the introverties of the success book, told us that the most successful leaders have been found to be humble.
They're acting calmly, quietly and determined.
They're often introvertents.
Aswath Damodara, Professor of Finance, recalled that the good leader's characteristics must be hit in one with the company's life cycle stage.
At the beginning of the company, the director must know how to tell the story on which the future of the company is based.
A mature company needs a leader who knows the numbers.
These teachings in Nordic Business Forum listened to 7 500 visitors - mainly Finnish leaders.
As a threat, they had an information threat.
A good leader requires a lot.
That is why leadership is so often wrong, even at the highest level.
There were also Siilasmaa and Ollila.
They were talking to each other in the scenes.
However, they hardly wondered whether they were the right leaders for Noah at the right time.
And their humility was not easy for an outsider to assess.
Sara Chafak arrived in a fantastic red carpet directly from Los Angeles to spend most of his years abroad.
The model Sara Chafak arrived at the Mission Final in a beautiful black dress.
The 2012 Miss Finland dress was also lazy.
A little pod jet stick.
I'm back from L.A. again.
I spend most of my time there long enough, and Chafak tells me about his rumors.
Chafak tells me he's going to L.A. on experiments.
He's made a commercial recording, among other things.
In the United States, he describes his work as interesting and similar to that of Finland.
Although he says that work needs to be done more harder, it is easy to find a substitute for the work of the model.
I've got to go harder and be aggressive, Chafak says.

The Danish police found a big Volvo in the operation: "We can't tell you what"
The Danish police's extensive search has produced results.
At the beginning of the operation, the traffic was closed on the bridges of the Jewish ram and the Great Belt.
All land and ferry transport from the island of Själlan was closed to Sweden, Germany and elsewhere in Denmark.
The police were looking for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
IS reached the head of the Copenhagen Police Media Centre.
We've found the car we're looking for.
We can't tell you where the car was found yet, Henrik Storm from Copenhagen police informs us about the night-sanom.
According to Storm, the black Volvo that was looking for doesn't have any direct contact with the police.
He says the greatest danger is over.
The Danish extra Bladet told me about the police's Saturday briefing.
Jørgen Bergen Skov was the investigator of the silent operation.
He didn't want to tell me what criminal code they're investigating.
But Skov told me it was a serious crime.
It was a threat to the spirit of men.
We've been looking for three people in the operation.
The police won't tell me if they've been captured.
According to the newspaper, the restrictions on ferry transport have been withdrawn.
Copenhagen police also followed the events with their Twitter account.
According to the police, however, the STT states that the public is no longer concerned, as the threat was a threat to certain people.
The name of Macedonia has caused decades of divergence - now the people will vote on the issue in dispute elections
In the Balkans, Macedonia is currently voting on the proposal for a new name of the country.
According to the agreement between Macedonia and the Greek Governments, the Republic of North Macedonia will be designated.
To date, Greece has prevented its veto rights from Macedonia's efforts to become a member of NATO and the EU.
According to Greece, the name of Macedonia belongs to its northern province.
The issue of the referendum does not mention a new name, but it is asked whether the voter supports the EU and NATO membership of Macedonia by approving the agreement.
The vote began at least with a school in the centre of the capital of Skopje.
The retired nurse Olivera Argirosvka, who voted in school, was hoping for support.
The referendum is a change if it opens the doors to Europe and NATO.
It means a change, especially for young people, he said.
In 1991 the name of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has been used in official contacts.
The Government of Prime Minister Zoran Zaev has been campaigned for the adoption of the Agreement.
The National Rights Opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has called for a referendum to boikoto.
In addition to the result, it is sufficient to stress whether the vote will increase by more than 50%.
The referendum is not binding, but the victory of yes votes would allow the mandate to change the Constitution.
The amendment of the Constitution requires a two-thirds majority of Parliament.
The Greek Parliament must also accept the agreement.
Voting sites will be closed from eight o’clock in Finland.
A handsome victory!
Robert Helenius killed Erkan Teper.
Robert Helenius met Erkan Teper on Saturday night at a heavy series of professional boxing in Germany.
A 34-year-old Finnishman took a measure of his 36-year-old German opponent in Waldenbuch, Stuttgart.
The night's main match was the IBF's heavy series of Intercontinental.
Its winners may be able to fight on Saturdays in a harder task that is of considerable economic importance.
Helenius solved the fight on the eighth round, when he knocked Teper on his hard left hand.
Teper couldn't get out of the floor anymore.
"Nordic Nightmare" hurt his opponent in the third round, when the German nose began to bleed.
Helenius and Teper met in the ring for the first time.
They had to fight in December 2015.
Then Teper insisted on injuries and retired from the fight.
Then it turned out that the German had failed twice in the doping test.
Helenius has taken 28 fights from his professional career and suffered two losses.
Teper has won 19 professional games and lost three times in his career as a clear favourite to the match.
With Hamilton's stable order to win the difference I've already pulled 50 points.
The Formula One masterpiece approached again to its assurance, since Mercedes Lewis Hamilton won Russia's gp and pulled its MM point line to Ferrar Sebastian Vetel from 50 points (306-256).
There's only five more races left.
The second time, the Valtteri Bottas left the race site.
Last year in Sotsh, Bottas, who took his career at the opening victory, held the top position for the middle of the race, but Mercedes told Botta to pass Hamilton.

Canada fights time to achieve harmony with the United States of Nafta
The time threatens the end of the negotiations between the United States and Canada on the free trade agreement on Nafta.
The United States has set a back limit on Sunday, and the negotiators of the countries have been discussing closely throughout the weekend.
Canada's main negotiator, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, postponed his speech at the UN General Assembly in order to concentrate fully on trade negotiations.
President Donald Trump's demand from the United States, Canada and Mexico started negotiations about a year ago to reform the free trade agreement in North America.
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States agreed, but there has been no agreement with Canada.
The United States and Mexico want to bring the agreement into force before Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who won the Mexican presidential elections, enters into office at the beginning of December.
Trump has said that Canada's involvement in the contract is not necessary.
He has previously informed the Congress that there are plans to sign a contract at the end of November, whether or not Canada was involved.
As a result of these schedules, the United States-Canada Agreement text should be ready on Sunday to give the United States Congress sufficient time to assess it.
The neighbour thought the candles were blended into a fire in the Cooker had been alerted to the fire.
The candles burned in the flat house in Oulu’s Cataker caused a fire alarm on the night against Sunday.

It was based on protecting against crime and interference.
They were released after the situation was settled, Mr Värtinen said.
It's been the last time I heard about the stakeouts.
The game ended 0-0.
After the end, a large number of viewers rode into the field from the viewer reserved for HJK's supporters.
The situation led to pushing and fisting between team supporters.
We needed riding officers, among other things, to stop the situation.
In addition to the field, there was raiding in the area of the nearby metro station, where some of the catches also occurred.
I wasn't there, but what I saw from the pictures, the situation was unpleasant, Colorinen referred to the explosion on the field.
According to Värtise, no criminal statements have been made as a result of these events.
Tablestone blew a butterfly in its SE time in the world cup, Laukkanen also swim to the final
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Tablestone have moved to the finals on the final day of the 3/7 tsunami World Cup competitions in Holland.
Kits are swiming in Eindhoven on a short track.

Students act rarely: ancient tragedy - simplified Orestheia affects their visuality
The ancient tragedies are rarely delicious in Finnish scenes.
For example, the National Theatre has recently seen the ancient tragedy, Sofokleen Filoctetes, in 1988.
Now the Theatre High School brought the only whole of ancient play matrix, Aiskhylos Oresteia, to a tour from the National Theatre.
In the Lavat open in 2015, actors at the Theatre University work internationally with the professional teacher.
Mikko Roiha, based in Berlin, is the director of this fourth project, as the first one.
At the international first night, Orestei was held in Berlin in April.
Roiha’s reconciliation from Oresthesia summarises the report on the end of the Athreus family’s blood collection and the birth of the rule of law for hours to twenty minutes, in particular by tightening the choir shares.
The work will succeed in being very loyal to the spirit of Kirsti Simonsuure’s fine Finnish (2003).
The dramatic lights and theater space pages revealing presentation highlight the mere and bright stage thinking.
Its centres have interchangeable dynamics between the choir and the choir.
The presentation uses both double and triangles of title roles.
For example, the actors are not leaving the stage, so the murders of Agamemnon returning from the Trojan war and this battle hall of Kassandra will be shown on the scene, unlike the ancient presentation tradition.
Of course, the presentation does not underline being loyal to the ancient presentation tradition.
Rather, a modern, loyal interpretation of the text is created in the eyes of the viewer, which is constantly aware of its ritual roots.
It has succeeded in bringing out a strong group of actors from the Master stage, directly as one body, of the rhythms that appear.
Especially in the choir sections of very expressive, sculptured group formations, the actors tending to gain their rights on the bare, only by decorated the white curtain on the scene.
That's impressive.
Orestheia's presentation tour continues to Kouvola and Oulu's Theatre.
The Korean manufacturer prepares its first hydrogen loader
The new one begins to appear in Europe, especially thanks to the cooperation agreement with Hyindai and the Swiss H2 Energy.
According to the cooperation agreement published in the IAA of Hannover, Hyundai will submit a thousand-car batch extraction model for the use of the Swiss company and its partners.
By placing on the market the Hyundai fuel-driven truck continues to Nexon and ix35/Tucson Fuel Cell models on the road as a manufacturer of hydrogen cars.
With this quality of the world's first project, we are moving the fuel cell technology further.
We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market for these vehicles, for example by monitoring the development of the tank network, in Cheol Lee, the Vice-President of Hyundai Motor, said in the field of publication of the contract.
The fists used to squeeze in Kajaan several times.
A less than 30 - year - old man assaulted three men at a restaurant in the centre of Kajaan on Saturday night.
The man first hit a man inside the restaurant, and he was removed from the place.
Outside, he pushed another man on the ground, and in the absence of a third man the assault hit him too.
The police caught the assassin.
At the police station, the man still acted aggressively and kicked another policeman.
The man also threatened the police by being assaulted and murdered.
The man was taken to the jail to calm down.
The issue is being examined as three assaults and the violence against the official.
In the centre of Kajaan, there was another incident of assault on Saturday morning.
Two men assaulted the victim.
At first, a cajanian man about 20 years old hit the victim.
A little later, the other man knocked him down, and the man who hit him before still kicked the victim.
The outsiders pulled the assassins away from the victim and called the police.
However, the authors had time to leave before the police arrived.
The police are asking witnesses of the event to contact the Kajaan police by phone at 0295 416 520 or by e-mail to investigate.kainuu@poliisi.fi.
Long line radio transmitter Erkki Pälli is dead.
Erkki Pälli, known as a long-term journalist, died of cancer at the age of 83.
Radio broadcaster Erkki Pälli, 83, is dead.
He died of uncontrolled liver cancer on his Facebook page in March 2018.
It's gonna be all right.
Even the doctor said, I live a day at a time, he commented on his situation in the evening a month ago.
The security of astronauts and astronauts must be guaranteed.
The first time I got paid in 1984 on the paper case.
When a matter of conversation is surprising in these year-to-year rings, it is usually a big news.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27.9.) about the safety of retail workers, I was amazed and even a little angry at a moment.
I also talked to the case by Erika Kähärää, a work environment expert of the Association of Services (PAM).
He says the crime statistics don't tell us the real situation.
The problem is growing, although, of course, employers argue otherwise.
The police will only be informed of cases that are clearly serious and many of the real violent situations will not be reported.
Of course, companies have a duty to report their situation close to the workplace safety law, but these statistics remain available and their data are not collected anywhere," he said.
Mental injuries don't end up in statistics.
In violent situations, there has always been a problem that they do not always produce physical injuries.
Psychic traumas may still be much more serious than bruising and wounds.
A distinction between the violent situation and the threatened violent situation is difficult to draw, even a certain level of aggressive threat must be counted as violence, even if it is not available.
Too many people are afraid of their jobs, even though they do not do what they do.
Some areas of residence are restless.
The store's got guards.
Even in the media, the liberalisation of the opening hours of trade had a rather high impact on the safety of the sellers.
"At that time, many employers arranged guard services for at least night hours and to prevent working alone," Kähärä commented.
When nothing happens, the wrong conclusion is made.
This seems to have had an effective effect now, but this produces a new negative trend.
As a result of the security, when the disturbances were well held, there was an impression that security would be unnecessarily necessary.
Now, in many places, we are trying to find solutions to remove expensive security services.
A mild assault is a criminal offence, and it is quite understandable that the seller who has been assaulted does not want to ask for an investigation of a criminal who usually lives in the vicinity of trade.
However, according to the same point of the 2011 law, a mild assault becomes subject to the prosecutor if it takes place at the workplace.
I think we need some preliminary cases now.
Next time the aunt or uncle is being assaulted, the police should investigate and accuse the prosecutor.
If justice put a few assassins in jail and sentences from there to the hard end of the punishment scale, the manners would be cleaned.
A society where the food trade must be open to small municipalities for about the day, must ensure the safety of workers.
Heidi Sohlberg signed up for Miss before the start of the direct delivery, "Sara, Iiro is then married"
The crowning of Miss this year is not seen in a traditional way on TV, but the broadcast shows the Viafree site.
The shipment is run by the former Miss Finland Heidi Sohlberg and the host of the Viasat and Viaplay NHL and KHL studios in Iiro Harjula.
Backstage and the red carpet runs Janni Hussi.
Before the direct shipment, the host three told the visitors and media representatives about the cost of the shipment.
At first, Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harjula a fresh applause.
Now all women scream!
Now look at this male driver, Sohlberg shouted his colleagues at the hurrage of the audience.
First-time races are followed by Miss Finland in many previous years.
Among other things, Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi sat next to us and Sohlberg threw a little joke in either direction.
Sara, Iiro is married!
Sohlberg was intruding looking towards the Saroks.
More likely, Sohlberg pointed to the just apart from the Siep, who laughed at the comment, even though it initially seemed confused.
A sieppi spoke of his divorce for the first time in the evening-sanoma weekend.
Missikaunotar said that he did not want to open up the reasons for the distinction in the public, because it is between him and Roope Salmis.
He said he wasn't busy with a new relationship, but he was going to focus on himself.
I'm focusing on my own things, and in particular, I'm living my own life alone, Sara Sieppi told me.
Sohlberg accidentally mistaked to call Janni Huss and Iiro Harjula as a couple.
The three of us were laughing.
I mean, I mean, I don't know. I mean, I don't know. I mean, I mean, I mean, you know, I was married, or how did it go?
Janni Pussi's got a bad call.
The Northman tortured the tied-up by cutting, burning and feeding a mighty sauce
A 34-year-old man who lived in Kokkola has been sentenced to three years of prison by the court of the Supreme Court for a large number of offences committed by his open spouses.
The crime device was, among other things, a belt, cable and cable rods.
The court condemned these objects to the State being lost.
Rank's accusation was a suspect's brutal rape.
However, the Court of Justice of the Court of Justice of this accusation rejected.
The reason for the cocala was four assaults, gross assaults, compulsion, unlawful threats, liberty violations, brutal liberty violations, and two acts of damage.
Crimes took place between 26 March and 24 May.
By the end of the last deeds, the man was captured and arrested a few days later.
On Thursday of the last week, the Supreme Court of the North Pole sentenced and ordered a 34-year-old to remain in Vaasa prison.
No evidence of rape
The 34-year-old was also accused of two brutal liberty violations and of the gross rapes that occurred on 22 May.
However, these accusations were rejected as unseen.
The case was discussed in court behind closed doors.
However, the judge of the court gave a public statement on the judgment.
According to the judge, the accused had targeted violence, threats, and forcedness in situations in which this had been tied up.
The accused cut his victim with a knife, burned a cigarette, fed a strong sauce and poured water and coffee on it.
In his judgment, the court ordered the State to lose criminal means: belt and cable, stickyness, bathrobe belt, knife and toilet.
Four Witnesses
According to the law of a visitor, the parties continued to live together between the actions.
It is possible to read that a large part of the most brutal acts took place at the end of the criminal period.
Four witnesses, two women, and two men were consulted in the court.
A 34-year-old person must pay compensation for pain, pain, suffering, and temporary harm to him in total EUR 5800.
It is hardly the money he has, because the convicted has already had debts in heritage.
The imprisonment is not the first man.
The evening magazine does not give a convicted name to protect the victim's privacy.
The recent judgement is not legal when it's written.
Europe in the Head of Four Points to Ryder Cup
On Saturday, European golf professionals held their lead in a traditional game of holes against the United States.
Europe leads the playable Ryder Cup in Paris at 10-6, when there are still 12 double games in front of us on Sunday.
Europe won three of the four four four-ball games started on Saturday, and in the afternoon's quadruple, the winnings were equalized to 2-2.
The European leaders were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four couples in Friday and Saturday.
A European couple had not been attracted to that before.
On Sunday, the two of us are looking for more history.
No European player has won five points in one Ryder Cup, and the Americans have not been able to play like three players: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
The HJK condemns its supporters' harsh distraction in the Honka fight: "The violence isn't part of football"
On Sunday, the football betting team HJK published a release condemning the disruption of its supporters in the Saturday FC Honka game in Tapiola.
"We call on the events following the Honka-HJK fight on behalf of our supporters," says the paper.
After the end of the fight, about 50 HJK supporters rode into the field, and some appeared to attempt to challenge the fight with Honga supporters.
There was also a fight between the supporters.
The orderers didn't get the situation calmed down, they needed police and riding officers.
HJK tells me when he tells us that the team's players and employees are shocked about what happened.
The events after the match are not consistent with the values of our traditional 111-year-old company.
"We express our steeply away from all activities that jeopardise the security of the fight events," says the Communication.
The HJK promises to help authorities and organisers to identify safety-threatening factors and remove mild effects.
Supporting culture is part of football and important for HJK.
We are all in favour of positive, joyful and encouraging activities in football views.
"The violence does not belong to it," says the press.
Philippines inventor flies with a drone car, so we can avoid traffic congestion.
Mendiola is a filippine inventor, a hip-hop dancer, and some kind of Pelle Peloton.
He now belongs to a growing crowd in the world who swears he's invented a flying car or at least his own version of it.
As competitors, he has factors such as Audi and Airbus.
Mendiola, however, does not believe in mass production of its equipment.
According to reports from the world, a man has used a large part of his property to build his dreams.
He started developing his flying car six years ago.
Now he calls the development version the drone car.
Recently, he says he's done the first successful test flight... he's flying his machine at a height of more than seven metres.
One of his objectives was to avoid traffic congestion.
I hope the device will trigger positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago, Mendiola said the British Daily Mail.
JHL projection: Work fights will begin tomorrow in children's day care and social and health services
In the public and well-being sectors, the bans of overwork and exchange begin tomorrow, particularly in social and health services and in child day care, evaluated by the President of the JHL Day Niemi-Laine.
The effects will be broad, and they will certainly appear in a way that there is not enough staff on the ground.
Everyone has to think about the way he's going to pick up his child.
The employer's task is now to ensure that services play and no one's life is threatened, Niemi-Laine says to the STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the number of workers was also seen at the beginning of the year when JHL members were in the over-work and exchange ban due to contractual negotiations.
Employers have made it possible through flexibility to not employ staff, but to have overtime or exchange shifts.
This is not yet a work struggle.
It is a standard standard for working safety, that, for each worker, regular working hours will be cared for and done only.
JHL is opposed by actions of the government's intentions to reduce the protection of redundancies of small companies.
Municipal employers' labour market manager Markku Jalonen will not pre-evaluate the impact of over-employment and exchange bans.
However, he does not believe that they are very volatile, even though services can deteriorate.
Employers around Finland are aware of this and made the preparations for what is to be done.
The area is so broad, social and health activities and the technical sector that it is difficult to say.
The impacts can vary very widely by industry, by region and employers, Jalonen said to the STT.
Mr Jalonen says that last week, experience was already gained, among other things, of the activities of the Association of Neighbourhood and Fundamental Assistance for Super and the Social and Health Trade Organisation of Tehy, which lasted three days.
Their effects were rather limited.
The prohibition on overwork and exchanges of JHL applies, inter alia, to municipalities, churches, state workers and private social and health workers.
For example, family day caregivers are excluded.
At this stage, the work struggle concerns almost 100,000 JHL members.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL's actions may last long.
The Union has also been prepared for other action in the field of work, if the law of termination continues to be prepared.
The government should now admit that this is going to run into the wall and hard.
The family believes that both the Ay movement and the government must come against us.
That's what's special about the fact that the hard ones are already in the pipe, even though the performance has not yet been given, Jalonen will update.
The great Korallice is born with children and adults in the fitness circles of the performance, studying rash and marine horse gestures
In other rooms, the College of Great Korallirisus received his first night last spring in Hamburg, and last Saturday it was played twice in Finland, this time in Kanneltalo.
Like the previous works of the group, the Great Korallirity is a work that will be built from the beginning to the end together with the audience.
This time, however, a clearer proposal is also built, which refreshs and stresses the findings made in the initial exercises.
The theatre game also provides saumatic magic for children's participants.
The child’s perspective has already been included in the preparatory phase.
However, the great Korallirisus is not a children's performance, but a show that adults and children do in collaboration.
It provides adults with information and observations about children's manners to receive information and make art.
The ability of children to throw into practice and joint games also diversifies distance between adults and children.
The great coral retreat reminds me of some kind of satubalet, fitness and natural information, but it will ultimately be triggered in different non-human habitats around visits.
The great coral recession begins to become familiar with the movements of the bodies and fish living on the coral reef.
Six different fitness circles are taught, among other things, of rams and sea horse gestures.
Finally, a presentation of less than an hour, where music, lights and shining paints and suits help to get to know the life of the coral reel.
In the Great Coral reef, we are both diversified people who watch the coral reef and the corals that are being looked at.
In addition, we are the bodies that look at the corals.
The eyes and observations pointed in several directions make the presentation thick and life blurred.
Being a landscape of some organism, a landscape reviewing organism, and a second organism or landscape, and all this at the same time.
It doesn't seem difficult for children.
In other spaces, the group aims to pursue the limit of thinking and activity to which to reach when both children and adults are made up of the group is challenging.
On the other hand, having children is making it more important.
After the workshop, Sitrator will hold a quiet demonstration on behalf of threatened corals.
The damage beyond human understanding should not be allowed to harden, even though it might be difficult to understand the importance of self - sympathy in the face of the prospects of destruction.
In other places, it has built its work so that it respects the diversity of life also with political gestures.
There are other generations, there are other kinds of consciousness, other species, and future generations of them, whose admiration and play it cleans space.
The kids grow up too fast, I'm happy that when I was a kid, there were no smartphones.
Today’s children and young people are increasingly irresponsible.
Young people begin smoking and drinking at all times when they are younger and younger.
I think children should be children throughout their childhood, and they should not mess up their lives because of drugs and sex, because others say so.
I was creepy when my friend told me he had to pick up his fifth grade sister from "boyfriend" this weekend.
When he came to pick up his drunk sister, he told me about his sex experience that night.
I couldn't imagine my own sister in the same situation because we've been told and warned throughout our childhood that drugs must not be touched and sex is an adult thing.
I hope today's children are able to live a proper childhood, and they should not grow up too early because of the group pressure created by friends.
I see younger girls in Instagram all the time, and they're making makeup on their faces and exposing clothes on their heads.
Snapchat is used in the evening to take and send exposing images.
It's even harder to know how old the girls are.
Today's 13-year-olds can easily look like 18 years old and older.
My childhood consisted of playing in the woods and playing board games.
I'm glad I didn't have smartphones when I was a kid.
I had to be a child for many years, and I didn't have to think about what others were thinking about me.
Yle: Authorities told the Government that the case Airisto Helmi is not related to national security
According to the Ilkka Kanerva interviewed, the Defence Police and Defence Forces went to inform the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees earlier this week.
The Finnish Head of State has been told that the investigation of the Helme of Airisto is not currently related to national security, but to organised crime, Yle reports.
Information on sources that were not anonymous was confirmed by the President of the Defence Committee, Ilkka Kanerva (kok).
According to Kanerva, defence forces and defence police took part in the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committee this week on the ongoing investigation.
This is considered primarily an economic offence.
They were quite strict that they did not speculate that there was something else here, Kanerva commented on Yle in an interview.
According to the data above, no evidence has been found of the confiscated material in connection with national security, but the investigation is only on its own.
We cannot yet know what can be found out, one of Yle's interviews says.
A week ago, the large searches on the island and continent of Turku have raised the question of whether the investigation is a mere economic crime or a threat to internal security in Finland.
The evening magazine used to produce a case this week that deals with claims on both behalf and against.
Video: The dream painting saved a series that Liverpool lost
Liverpool's 100 percent of Valioliiga's start was completed, but it was still more satisfied with the 1-1 team at Stamford Bridge.
Sunday is about a year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and ran to a 1-0 guest victory.
That's when the Pep Guardiola combination sent the entire Valoliga signal that City was serious now.
Everyone remembers how the last season ended.
And I'm sure Liverpool's manager, Jûrgen Klopp, came to West London with the same idea.
The Reds had started Valioliiga with six consecutive wins.
Liverpool started stronger and, in particular, Virgil van Dijk seemed to rule alone on his own field.
Chelsea, on the other hand, was underground with a very nice victory from Anfield Road on Wednesday.
That's when Eden Hazard rose from the changeover to solve the match with a wonderful individual performance.
Now, of course, Hazard was in the first place.
In 25 minutes, he first slammed in a small space with Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
Eventually, the Croat saw Hazard fall ahead and sent him a fully printed passport.
Hazard went a little off the perimeter, but he bombed a perfect left foot bet in the back corner.
Pool's bracelet Alisson was a little slow in his fight, and he didn't just get his finger on the ball.
CLOPP must have felt the loss position emphatically unfair because almost immediately after Antonio Rüdiger cleaned Mo Salah's control from the goal line.
In the second episode, Kepa Chelsea got into real action.
The Basque Guard quickly responded to Sadio Mané's bet and pushed the ball from the top to the corner kick.
On the other hand, Alisson zeroed his retreat to Hazard.
The best place for the guests came on the 72th minute when James Milner found Bobby Firmino on his concentration.
However, the bucket of the basket star was directed toward David Luiz, a country teammate, who saved the masters' leadership position.
That didn't last for 89 minutes, too, when Daniel Sturridge was free to shoot at 25 metres.
Sturridge played with his old home stadium, and the assailant bombed it to the top of the unresistant bet.
Liverpool's 100-percent league was completed with 1-1-second, but it's still leaning together with Manchester City.
Chelsea is also strictly involved in the masterpiece two points behind the top.
In the clock transfer conversation, the poters are deep
I remember when a decade ago a magazine asked different Finnish actors that share the Finnish people.
Juice Leskisen's answer was the only one in mind: Nen's end.
Some surnames have a nose end and some do not.
You know, they can be born wherever you want, and there's one bundle.
Finland has achieved in the EU that the annual clock transfer is being abandoned.
Many agree that the shifting of watches twice a year has been the work of fools and has caused a wide range of problems.
Finally, this achievement seems at least to be the easiest step of the solution in Finland, although it has not been easy.
The most difficult thing is now to decide what time will eventually end: the current summer or winter age or any other time zone.
This also allows the people to say their opinions on the.fi page.
The question has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and is open to Friday, 12 October.
The debate will take place in coffee tables and in social media, and everyone has their words to say.
With the effect of morning light on human well-being and summer time, their positions are justified by winter time, with the effect of the evening light on the desire for outdoors and through the well-being of people.
Both sides have strong supporters and good arguments.
Even according to research, morning light rhythms man's day and gives refreshment.
On the other hand, if you are not particularly affected by awakening in the dark, the light of people move outside and give more opportunities for, for example, autumn yards.
The number of additional lights after the normal working day has already been calculated for an hour.
I would prefer to take both, but, unfortunately, we can't do anything in the northeast of the earth.
The winters are too dark and the summers are too bright for many anyway.
Typical debate on the subject is that one’s own vision is driven and the other’s vision is very strongly opposed.
It is not much to listen to the argument of the counterpart, because the most important thing is how it feels.
Since almost everyone has an opinion on the matter, it is somewhat worthwhile to try to turn another head.
It's a waste of rugs.
The subject is very easy for the debate, because the issue does not require a great deal of confusion and a mutual feeling is sufficient to justify it.
In general, similar issues are more steeply and infertilely disputed.
It's a shame if the wrong option is chosen, but we'll be able to adapt to it.
And always it also offers a proper scapegoat if life feels bad.
Josba fought a foreign victory.
Josba's first guest game in Salibandy Divar produced three serial points against Nurmon Jymy.
Josba left Seinäjoki for a home trip with a joy of 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory.
The Nurmo also led the goal at the beginning of the third round, but Josba applied for compositions and recycled men in the chains.
In time 50.47, the brothers Edu and Juso Lehtiniemi ploted a 6-5 victory painting.
In both teams, they played decisive minutes at a level.
Josban’s most effective was Juso Lehtiniemi (2+1).
The second chain was firepowered even when Teemu Tuhkanen (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) also hit.
Miika Kosonenk (1+0) played its goal at the time of birth in the second chain.
After three serial cycles, Josba has six points.
Next up, O2Jyväskylä will be visiting in two weeks.
A 200th anniversary at Eno's church on Sunday
The 200th anniversary of the Eno Church will be celebrated tomorrow on Sunday in a partially sad atmosphere.
A week ago, the burning of an agitation threat in the church was a shock.
Even the uncle's church was guarded two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, today is still the place to celebrate.
Even if no one wants to do so, the Eno Church is now the oldest church in the Joensuu Congregation.
The church on the hill in the middle of the village has always had Eno's heart despite all the municipalities and other associations of the world.
The family fair starts at Eno's church today at 10:00.
Then we go to the congregation house at the cattle table.
There's all kinds of stuff in the program all day, inside and outside.
For example, the church building can be consulted with the guidance of Ari Räsäsen, a retired 37 - year - old congregation master.
The church’s birthday party also means the end of one era.
The church house, built in 1982, has already been deactivated, keeps its doors open for the last time today.
Now we're in the emergency room at the former municipal house, says Markku Koistinen.
The inner air problems were destroyed by the congregation house, but the church has stood well for that 200 years.
Elon Musk is dismissed from the head of the Tesla Government's speech, and the charges of fraud were settled for $40 million.
The electric car manufacturer Tesla and CEO Elon Musk have agreed on their case with the US Securities Market Supervisory Authority SEC.
The SEC suspected Muski was committed to securitisation, and Musk was in danger of being excluded from the company that was founded.
However, Musk can continue as CEO of Tesla.
On the other hand, Musk has to stay away from the position of the Chairman of the Government of Tesla for three years.
The company has to hire the chairman of the foreign government.
Musk will also be subject to tighter control.
According to the agreement, Teslan must employ two independent leaders and will continue to monitor the communication of Musk.
In addition, Tesla and Musk will pay both EUR 20 million (approximately EUR 17 million) to settle the case.
"The decision is to prevent new market failures and the damage caused by Tesla shareholders," says Steven Peik, SEC.
The case began in August when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might withdraw the company from the stock market.
Musk also wrote that the company's funding was secured.
The Tviitti just picked up Tesla's stock exchange.
SEC suspected Muski was guilty of a securitisation fraud.
According to the Agency, the TV was false and misleading, and Musk had not spoken about the arrangement with other managers or potential donors of the company.
In practice, the Agency accused Muski of misleading investors.
On Friday, the SEC announced to sue the company and Muski.
The SEC stated that Musk would be sentenced to fines and that he would be prohibited from operating under the management of the stock exchange companies.
The SEC challenge scared investors, and Tesla's share went into a strong fall.
More than 800 people died in the raid and tsunami of Indonesia
The number of deaths in the Indonesian earthquake and subsequent tsunami have risen to at least 832, reports the country's disaster agency according to the AFP.
The number of victims of death is still expected to increase, as it is in the middle of the investigation.
According to Vice-President Jusuf Kalla, the final figure may rise to thousands.
The Friday earthquake raised the tsunami that attacked the Please city on the island of Sulawes.
Tsunam was given a warning immediately after the shock, which was quickly withdrawn.
According to the authorities, almost all the dead known for at least for the time being are from the Salary.
The rescue authorities are concerned, among other things, about the Donggala region located at the centre of the earthquake, where the situation is still largely unclear.
There are already several people who are known to be dead.
Rainy Assistance Requests
The Indonesian army has been alerted to help rescuers find victims.
President Joko Widodon, arrived at the destructive area today, urged the soldiers to continue the rescue without exhausting day and night.
One of the centers of the rescues is a hotel in Palo, which is still believed to be 50 to 60 people in ruins.
Muhammad Syaugi, head of the agency leading to rescue work, said that the ruins of Roa-Roa Hotel, popular by business travellers, had been dug up by one person alive at night.
We also heard people's requests for help, he told me.
According to Syaug, the landscape and tsunami area would quickly be excavated for heavy extraction equipment.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find people who are lost.
Help me, you in Palo and the neighborhood.
My friend's family still missing, one writer in the Facebook group.
Political phone numbers were leaked into distractions in Britain
Many British politicians became disturbed when their contact information was leaked because of the shortcomings in the encryption of the application.
The alarms were accessed, among other things, to ministers' phone numbers.
This was the application used at the British Conservative Party's party meeting in the Government.
For example, Mr Michael Gove, Minister for the Environment, Food and Rural Development, as well as former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Boris Johnson, became the target of disruption.
A number of representatives received distractions.
As a result of the lack of encryption of the application, the public was able to access the profiles of politicians that were in the mobile application of the annual conservative party meeting.
The public was able to access profiles using a politician's e-mail address, which was easily accessible online.
The user who logs in the profile could view and edit the data stored in the profile.
Someone managed to change Boris Johnson's profile picture for a moment to be insulting the porn picture and my title.
Michael Goven's profile picture was replaced by a media mogule by Rupert Murdoch.
The Guardian colleague Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that the meeting application allows access to other people's profiles by e-mail addresses.
You can then look at the contact details of the profile person and send messages in this name.
The meeting application made every journalist, politician and participant's phone number public, Foster criticized.
The Conservative Party informant apologized for the information leakage.
He said that technical problems have been solved and the application now works safely.
The UK Information Authority ICO supports the data leakage.
The application was drafted by the Australian Crown Comms company.
The opposition's Workers' Party criticises that the Conservative Party cannot be trusted in security matters.
The Wall Finland shows a large number of pulicles each week in the audience
Watchy viewers paid attention to the reaction of the studio audience of the The Wall Finland vision program.
The U.S. format The Wall, a rapidly spread in the world, roamed into Finland's version Four last Saturday.
Heikki Paasose's hosted game show is described in Poland in the same studio where other international productions are made.
In the Polish studio, the possibilities of description were exceptional, as the size of the format was 12 metres high in the walls of the game required space from the farm.
During the start-up period, the social media highlighted the studio audience of the programme, which was considered Polish.
On Twitter, it would be a discussion about whether the Polish people in the studio will understand anything about the game they play for Finnish.
Head of four domestic programs Unne Sõrmunen illuminates the issue for the evening.
He tells us that there are players close to the studio audience, other Finns, foreign Finns living in Poland, as well as only Polish viewers.
The public is composed of international tapers in Finland's production, just like the audience of the The Wall episodes in the same production mode in other countries.
In Finland, too, there are such populations, so-called professional audiences, who take place in the descriptions of different programmes, Sormunen backgrounds.
He reminds me that following the game itself is not so difficult even if he does not understand the language in which it is played.
Red and green balls falling off the wall are easy to distinguish.
However, for foreign - language people at the studio there are interpreters that carry out translation work.
There are two interpreters that interpret the events as a simulant translating to the studio director all the time.
And then the studio director instructs the audience and tells us what kind of slope there is being thrown, for example, and what kind of situation is going on, Sormunen says.
He compares the situation with David Hasselhoff recently in domestic production.
David Hasselhoff was a member of Talent Finland's descriptions in Finland a few years ago.
He always got a simulation bounce in his ear, and he knew everything that was said in his illustrations as Finnish, the sum of Sormune.
The yaphone that squeezed south of Japan is moving towards the main island, and the authorities warn us of earthquakes and floods.
Authorities also warn against possible land vultures and floods.
At least 50 people have been injured in Taifuuni Tram, but according to the authorities, there are no major injuries and there are no data on the victims of death.
In the southern Okinawa island, the wind has been so hard that it has turned cars around.
According to the NHK broadcaster, people have been evacuated into shelters, and electricity has been cut off from over 300 000 households.
More than a thousand flights have been canceled, and the bullet trains are stationary for the storm.
The storm is expected to strike near Osaka during the half-day period of Finland’s time.
The capital of Tokyo is not directly on the route of the storm, but there are also strong winds and rains.
Train shifts have been canceled today in Tokyo.
According to the scientists, Trami tortures Japan until Monday.
The sky of the chess went darker
The early season of the mothers has been bad.
The sky was darkened almost as long as the team lost on Saturday at home to Vaasan Sport, read 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1).
The Porcines now have five consecutive losses, and a total of two points on 6 rounds.
No chess defender or two lower chain players have yet made a goal.
The pressures also grow all the time.
At the time of the game, about half of the game was left.
Six games are only played, and of course there is no reason to give up.
Of course, we're going to have to be here because we played that weakly.
Particularly the second series was a disgraceful performance, the Ace of America's power was 1+2 by Jarno Kärki.
Of course, sports gained.
The team had a game underneath Friday, so it would've been seen.
Maybe it did, but the Aces didn't know how to use it.
The number of visitors on bread day continued to grow
The mother of the bread day, Pirkko Goodinen, wonders the audience at the big hall.
Somehow, you thought that maybe this year there might not be so many people, Mr. Worinen will think about this morning.
In autumn 2017, at the same time with the bread day, Tractory Syndrome SM contests were held, so perhaps the audience would be able to decrease slightly from the previous year.
However, it happened differently; the corridors were already steadfastly blocked before 10, the sellers said that the products were finished, that the news was sold more than 500 times before, and that even the number of cars heard the increase.
The estimated number of visitors has been about 6000, Mr. Goodinen will tell you later this afternoon.
In the morning and afternoon for five hours, a special amount of programme was available for families with children, which, I think, attracted them to a record lot.
In addition, Goodinen estimates that the event is going further.
Sales also go to Liper every year from a larger area.
In this year, almost 100 salesmen of dental, bakery and harvesting products had arrived at the breadkeeper.
The mother of the bread day, Pirkko Goodinen, was attracted to the audience at the hall view.
At the beginning of the bread day, the harvest was blessed.
In the children's series, the beautiful bread of Teija Kivinieme won a public vote.
11 different forms of bread came to the children's bread race.
The winner of the roasted bread contest, Marjatta Vepsälainen, spent the day in the martyr pie cake.
7 x the most beautiful lights from here you recognize a good lamp
Wake up the space, create the right atmosphere for decoration, and read the book without tireding the eyes.
It's a good light. It's a good thing to be smashed.
We gathered three good reasons to put on the lighting.
Vinkit gave Innolux sales and marketing director Tarja Jokinemi.
Do me a favor to your eyes
The greater the significance of the lighting is, the more ages behind.
A sufficient light can help with problems that many come with age when visual accuracy decreases and more and more suffering.
Elderly, the need for light is also growing.
A 60-year-old needs the light three times more than a 20-year-old.
Therefore, for health reasons, it is worth taking care of the effects of light and the characteristics of the lamp.
The good light gives you enough light, but it doesn't drift, Jokiniem tip.
Create Beauty around You
Beautiful decoration can only be found with the right lighting solutions.
The decorator of this moment will be able to choose.
There is an eleven, Scandinavian and Japanese style in popularity.
On the other hand, the modern and play retrotyl with strong colors, metal with different tones or ice cream grains have become bums.
The truth is fascinating in the same way as in the other decorations of the home.
The materials now show wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Show Your Personality
On the other hand, more is now being put in the house than before, and the decoration has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, they want their own homes to be customized, even a brave light that has a story to tell.
People clearly apply for Finnish and Nordic products whose origin and designer are known.
So let's be very well-design-conscious, Jokiniem says.
Not necessarily the most recent trendy lights will be acquired at home, but the timeless classic for which many years have been saved.
Certain kinds of timeless, jewelry and elegant classics keep their surfaces from year after year, Jokiniem says.
Thank you. Goodbye.
KooKoo showed the door to the Canadian fan after three games
Kooko and the attacker, Brendan O'Donnell, are breaking up.
The Canadian winner played in orange black a total of three League games without power points, KooKoo will tell you in the release.
In August, O'Donnell moved to Kookoho by the one-year agreement, including a long-term trial period until the end of September.
During the last period, 26-year-old attacker played at the KHL in Kunlund Red Star and at the KHL farm at VHL in Heilongjiang KRS.
There's no record of O'Donnell's new company yet.
The gamer wants to set an example in the recycling - the goods go to the world in the recycled boxes, the plastic switched to paper.
The game special store The gameman is now recycled in addition to the games, including packaging materials.
Products of stone-foot trade customers are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in paper bags made from recycling material.
Products ordered from online stores are packaged, for example, in packages from importers.
All the packages that come to us will be used for renovation.
We may use boxes for a dozen times, as long as the package is in the condition that it can be used, Ville Puurula Oulu's Gameman tells us.
As softening material, the company uses newspapers and other similar recycling materials in principle.
Couple plastics will be avoided as far as possible.
In the near future, we are meant to move in envelopes to recycling materials.
The movement wants to set an example for others, too.
According to Puurula, recycling is not an extra effort.
There's no big problem starting to recycle.
It will also bring economic savings when, for example, cardboard packings are reused.
Recycling is suitable for the Game Man’s activities in nature, as, alongside the new products, the main product range of the movement includes, among other things, the games and equipment used.
Each fashion-conscious purchase: One and the same shirt works every costume
Classic clothes work in a seasonal outfit than in a costume.
They create the basis of good garderob in multipurpose, as it is easy to collect different residents around high-quality classics in favour.
In the autumn, the most used classics of the wardrobe are high-quality knitting.
This category also includes a black pool.
The black knitted or crocheted fabric of natural material may not have a failure to purchase.
The clothing can be connected to direct pants, bored meat and jeans, and it can be created in a controlled set of clothing and a steep style.
Pooloneule is suitable for both a young modern dresser and a classical style skilled artist.
This is how you create style.
The autumn trend is created by gold browns and wide-length sponge metal pants, black pooloneule and grey niggers.
The classic pooloneule together with other classics, the blue-green scotter and the wine-red licks, constitutes a feminine and refined set of clothing.
Bring it to the black pooloneule by combining it with trendy clothing pieces: a jeans dress, high boots and thick socks.
Young and stylish!
The sabotage operation of Russian intelligence services has a long tradition
There is no reason to assume that the Russian Federation's foreign intelligence of SVR or military intelligence of GRU would have abandoned this practice.
During the Soviet Union, the so-called DRG groups specialised in sabotage activities.
The name comes from Russian-speaking words to a diversionno-razvedow group: a sabotage and intelligence group.
The representatives of the KGB in the western countries of the Soviet Security Service prepare detailed plans for important sabotage sites, reports the archive manager of the KGB’s westward to Vasili Mitro (1922-2004).
His information was published in the books of Christopher Andrew at the end of the 1990s and at the beginning of the 21st century
The targets were ports, docks, large dams, oil refiners and gas pipeline connections.
In Germany, KGB acquired for DRG groups Bundeswehr, the railways, the yardkeepers and certain persons uniforms and housing for cover operations.
This trick was used by Russian paratroopers in Crime in February 2014: they dressed in local Ukrainian police riot equipment, set up inspection posts for you from the peninsula to Ukraine and separated the Crimean country.
Agents of the Cold War's Time hide in the sabotage groups supplies packages with mines, explosives, lighters, and media.
In 1998 there was still the KGB's secret in Switzerland, which was exploded by the ansaminoite when it was injected by the authorities with a water pump.
At night, the police reached four drivers in the county.
The police caught four drivers of North Karelia across the street from Friday to Saturday.
In Joensuu, a 18-year-old man in the Cont. Guy blew 1,57 proms.

On the kneequake, the car fell off at 4:00 a.m., and the 19-year-old local man alone in the car blew up 1,54 proms according to the police.
He didn't get serious injuries on the way out.
In the centre of Outokummu, a 20-year-old local man who drove a passenger car blew up to 1.33 proms.
In addition to the road safety risk, the police suspected these men who were driving a carousel and the driver of the Polvijärvi.
On Saturday morning in Tuupovara, a 36-year-old man transported a local van at the Oillands and Hoikkatien crossing was blowing 0.52 proms.
He's suspected of a ride.
The police are asking for observations on the stabbing that occurred at the Turku railway station after midnight.
According to the police, the man was being assaulted at the parking lot in front of the station with life-threatening consequences.
The act was recorded on the surveillance camera.
The dark-haired suspects dressed in dark trousers and brown or beige jacket were removed immediately after stabbing with a dark farmer car in the direction of the bus station.
One suspect left the bicycle in the direction of Humalistonkatu in the centre.
A pedestrian died after I froze under the bus in Por
On the poris, a pedestrian died early Saturday morning after a bus run into him.

On TV tonight, a climber was left to die twice.
American Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on man's own experiences.
This evening's film was made on the basis of them.
Everest is now getting his first night on Finnish TV.
In May 1996, the destructive snowstorm surprised climbers at Mount Everest.
Baltasar Kormákuri’s 2015 guidance is about the survival struggle that has been processed cereal.
There's been a tragedy of films and documents before.
The real events are going through, too, in this case.
22 years ago, the world's highest mountain took eight climbers' lives.
Two of them were experienced leaders of expeditions: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It's just that Hall worked as the Weathers guide.
Weathers' life could be saved by an eye surgery before Nepal was left.
As a result of this pressure and the pressure of air, he lost sight, so the captivity of the peak had to be missed.
Rob Hall went on the way, and he didn't come back again.
However, the struggle for life and death had only begun.
When the storm got up, he got lost and found back in the camp.
When a man came to find him, he was found in such a bad condition that he was not trusted in survival.
Weathers was left to die.
But like a miracle, he got on his feet and found the others.
The poorly cold Weathers thought he would still die, and once again he was left behind his own happiness.
Obviously, against other expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, even spies with them began to believe in the possibility of giving him help.
In the movie, Beck Weathers is presenting Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
The 200-year-old Eno Church has been celebrated today.
Enon's 200-year-old church has been celebrated today in the church.
The church was introduced on October 4, 1818, and for the celebration of the year, the entire family was prepared for Sunday.
The celebration began at the Eno church, at 10 a.m., at a family fair, after which there have been gifts for the cattle table at Eno’s congregation house.
The church was full.
There were 517 participants in the family fair.
Eno’s church lord Armi Raudhair was glad that people had come to church so much.
It is a great joy yet for a long time and gives the strength to work, Railway (in the picture) says.
The fire of the incision threat church has touched many, and it was not overlooked at the 200th anniversary of the Eno congregation.
The Eno Church is now the oldest of the Evangelical Lutheran congregations in Joensuu after the destruction of the Church of Excitement in the fire.
The acceleration risk of wooden church was completed in 1770.
An agitation threat was held in the morning a harlot that slowed down and remembered the church destroyed in the fire.
Photos and videos: Mechanics flashed their magnificent powers in Greece - the sea disappeared and the street became a river
A powerful hurricane-type fallen from lunch to Greece on Saturday.
The Mediterranean hurricane or medican is named Zorba.
The Greek Air Science Institute has given red weather warning to the regions of Attika, Peloponnesos, the islands of Jonah, the Cyclads and Crete.
The pictures taken from the area show a lot of floods around Greece.
The video published on Twitter shows how the river has suddenly appeared in the town of Kiato in the area of Korinthia as a result of floods.
The second video shows how the car has been transported by flood waters.
In the southern part of the Peloponnesos peninsula, a hard wind caused a strong seafall.
The Finnish Athenia embassy instructs people on their Facebook page to prepare for a storm in Greece.
Delegation calls for weather information and local authorities' instructions to be followed.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or medican, brings with him the harsh roads and even the flood danger.
According to the CNN, a study published in 2011 indicates that medicans occur only once or two years in the world, typically on the road to September-October when the sea temperature is still high.
Now the blowing storm left the floods in Tunisia and Libya before going to the north and Europe.
Refugee camps in Greece, such as Lesbo, have also caused concern.
Thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in camps have limited access to proper protection.
During the summer, the areas destroyed by terrains are also falling under the storm in the Athens environment.
In Greece, the medican also drained last November.
We don't have to go to the sea, yet the flights are scheduled to take place on the Greek islands threatened by the storm of sympathy are currently taking place in thousands of Finns.
The trips to the sea are canceled and should be careful not to fly oxen or other bulk goods onto the storm.
Such instructions have been shared by guides in fair 3,500 in Greece for Finnish holidays through sunshine in the weekend.
Instructions will be needed, since even the storm of Zorbas, which is coming into the horror, is predicted to be invading the Greek islands this weekend.
In the nearest island of Crete, for example, wind speeds can rise up to 45 meters per second.
Hard rains that increase the frustration of the weather.
All those travelling from Finland through sunshine and Tui, who have announced their phone number, have been alerted to the winds of the travel organisers by text message.
Still the sun and the heat in the air
According to Inka Ikose, the solar travel specialist, by the beginning of Saturday night, has been avoided by the worst resorts.
For example, flights have landed and rising according to the normal schedule.
Of course, we'll keep track of the situation all the time.
Security ahead of us.
I supported media supervisor Antonia Schroderus tells me that their flights have also been on schedule.
We are constantly in contact with our personnel in the target.
At least the Krete was still calm, he told me about the night of the beginning on Saturday.
The most popular Greek islands – Rodos and Greece – currently have a fair share of 1,500 Finnish passengers.
In addition, few hundreds of passengers are on holiday in smaller places.
For example, the worst storm in the island of Kos will arrive on Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon, Rodo had riddled the sun, and the temperature was at 27 degrees, the Ikonen of Sunshine says.
Zorbas has been estimated to become the next Turk, although a little lesser.
In the event that we have already been in touch with Turkey and our staff there, and we have checked, for example, the number of Finns flying to Antalya, says Schroderus.
Shirly Karvilla and Janni Huss have all the identical evening suits in the Mission Final, so they react to the situation.
Media personality and fitness beauty Janni Huss arrived at Miss Finland's final on Saturday in an open-ended evening suit.
Hoss says he got a dress from Meslew.
I went to the store, and I decided to trust professionals who found me a wonderful suit for this evening, Hoss smiles.
Exactly the same silver nightdress had also been chosen by the connoisseur Shirly Karvinen.
The two themselves also noticed the same costumes and laughed at the situation.
Karvinen told the evening to Sanomi he was in a hurry to prepare, and he had to set up on a plane.
Hussi is a missitational driver of backstage and red carpet, and he's talking to the most premiere stars coming in.
There's a fresh move behind the Huss, because he moved from Kampi to Jätkäsaare on Friday.
I'm gonna stay there for now. Let's see what happens.
It's important that there's a private office in the new apartment, Hussi pondered.
Before he moved, Hussi took a vacation alone in Greece.
It was lovely. I was only in the hotel a week without leaving anywhere.
When the stress got out, I got the flu, but otherwise the vacation was really successful, Hussi tells me.
Shirly Karvisen's behavior on a plane attracted a lot of attention to the curious eyes of the pensioners.
Runner and Miss Shirly Karvinen 2016 told him on the red mat of the Miss Finland Final, she had enough to do with radio trafficking and Love Island Finland's descriptions.
The speed has been enough even to the extent that Karvinen arrived at the Final directly from Finnair flight.
I made a makeup and put my hair on the plane.
This is the glamour.
Evening change at home, Karvinen laughs.
Karvinen says he's pulled out his makeup in the middle of the pensioners.
His preparation also attracted the attention of travellers.
I had a big mirror and I saw people's eyes in the mirror.
My makeup was a pleasure, at least for everyone else.
Karvinen flies to Spain once a week.
In Marbella, he spends a few days at a time.
Karvinen tells us that she enjoyed her pestilence as a director of Love Island Finland.
He describes his experience to date as well as to stop.
Karvinen says he went to say hello to the singles of the program on Friday.
It's somewhat brutal.
They are real emotions of people, Karvinen describes the feelings of the single program.
How do I dress up with the top knee boots?
Three Perfect Coats
Classic clothes are clothing pieces that work in a seasonal outfit other than in a costume.
Often, classics are decades old, but sometimes they fit the most modern individuals.
A few years ago, the hittigence of the September and Winter season has not gone anywhere.
According to their name, boots that wear on their knees are repeated in style from year to sesong.
The visible boots share the opinions of users, but a brave model is worth trying, well - boldly.
Indeed, the upper knee boots are actually suitable for any form of housing.
It's a jean, a pizza, a barrel or a trico, and the boots have a simple leather or artificial leather surface.
The long boots look good in the celebrations as well as in the everyday suits.
The black over knee boots fit well for suits.
They appropriately balance the femaleness of a pink, squirreled pencil tooth and a squirrel-squirrel needle.
A gentle but autumn-style everyday dress for a romantic taste.
A strong and slightly retro-respiratory set of clothing is generated by a long copper brown cylinder, over- knee boots, displaying earrings and a boiler bag.
Even though there is a certain fineness in the over knee boots, they are perfectly suitable for relaxation with the t-shirt, long shorts and trendy shovels.
It's so easy and yet so stylish!
Two robot cars are starting to operate in Espoo
They operate for the rest of the year and take passengers, the city of Espoo will inform you.
Takenieme's robot cars are active in the role of a bus simulator, as the next spring in the area is intended to start transport with a robot bus.
The project will develop and pilot robotic vehicle traffic throughout the year and test the technical performance of vehicles under Finnish conditions.
We'll find out how robot cars can handle the current street network.
At the same time, the city offers robot bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in the real environment, says the transport manager Johanna Nyberg.
For the first time, robot cars are fully automatically involved in other transport without specific transport arrangements.
The safety of vehicles shall be the responsibility of the auxiliary traveller always sitting on board.
Vehicles sense their environment on several sensors and assess whether the road is free.
If it is not, they will interpret whether an obstacle has been detected by a vehicle, a bicycle or a snowboard for example, reports the Managing Director of Sensible 4 responsible for the development of robot traffic.
Robot cars travel throughout the autumn on three days a week: Tuesday 13-15.30, Wednesday 10:00 a.m. and Thursday 10:00 a.m.
Robot cars stop at six stops along the route and take passengers on board.
Robot car stops identify the stop markings.
The first stop on the Takeker will be taken by number 1.

It's a lot of relief. Fortunately, bones get better over time.
A good turnout and a quick recovery to Santu and a good turnout to another band plus a fan!
And thank you for last night, a great job was, but you promise to leave this strong drama out of the end of the job? writing a fan.
Police supervised hunting in North Karelia and Savo
The Eastern Finland Police Department carried out hunting surveillance on Friday and Saturday with the Metsähallitus and Finland's Hunting Centre in North Karelia and Ylä-Savo, and the police department's teammen reported in social media on Saturday.
The main focus of the surveillance was the lawfulness and authorisation of hunting.
Each hunter was checked with a hunting card and a hunting permit required in state countries.
In addition, the permits for the possession of hunting weapons and the allowable number of self-chartering weapons used for sewering were checked.
According to the police, 112 hunters were inspected during the inspection and only one hunter who lacked the required hunting permit was met during the inspection.
The hunter was assigned 12 daily tickets for unauthorised fishing.
In addition, the police blowed out 133 drivers of the vehicle, and two of them were suspected of driving.
In addition, the patrols dealt with five traffic violations in the fine procedure, the police once.
In conclusion, hunters are very well respected by hunting permits.
A lot of hunters were surprised by control.
One hunter said, "I've been hunting for 50 years in the area, and this was the first time someone checked the permits".
The Eastern Finland Police Department will continue hunting surveillance in autumn together with other supervisory authorities.
Silent goes to Turkey to follow the selection of Syrian quota refugees
Minister of Interior Kai Mykkänen (Kok.) travels to Turkey in the next few days to follow the selection of quota refugees to Finland.
Finland has been decided to take 530 Syrian refugees from refugees camps in Turkey this year.
Election travels are usually made a few times a year, with representatives from the Immigration Service, the Ministry of Employment and Economic Affairs and the police.
The delegation is already doing interviews in Turkey.
Firstly, the UNHCR is selecting people who are particularly vulnerable.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered to be in a particularly distressing position on refugee camps, such as single parent families, disabled and sick, women and children.
More people are selected for the future group in Finland than there is in the quota, as some are not actually arrived for different reasons.
In their way, the non-governmental organisations operating at the border of the Turkish Minister of Interior, Süleyma Soylu and Syria.
Ilkka Salmi is also the Head of State of the Ministry of Interior.
Quota increase
Finland has taken quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees a year.
For a couple of years, the quota was 1 050 a year, but there has been no agreement in the government to raise it.
The assembly has supported the increase of the quota, but the project has last fallen against the blue resistance.
President Juha Sipilä (Central) recently presented a progressive increase of 1 500 to 2 000 people per year.
A delay in visit is the first in this government period to be taken over by the Minister of Interior to monitor the selection of quota refugees.
The previous Ministers of Interior Petteri Orpo (kok.) and Paula Risikko (kok.) were able to move to their new assignments before the visits were organized.
Finland receives EUR 10 000 from the EU for each particularly vulnerable refugees.
Now we're going to the hacks. You don't know if you're crying or laughing anymore.
Last Saturday, the Karjalainen's news about a legislative proposal to amend the animal protection law.
The article found that the legislative proposal in principle prohibits the holding of all animals in production animals, pets or otherwise in business, which are not separately authorised by the ministries’ regulations.
In other words, all other animals are originally prohibited, except those mentioned separately in the Regulation.
If the legislative proposal ends, it would mean that we are rejecting the general principle in Western democracies that the law separately prohibits action that endangers the security of society or the good way.
We are now, in principle, setting out the prohibition of all activities to which the law or regulation does not give a separate authorisation.
This change leads to the fact that nothing new can be tried in business, for example, and that nothing else will be done until the law or regulation it adopts.
Government activities in law preparations have generally been weak.
If we are going to the road now that everything is prohibited in Finland, which is not permitted separately, you will no longer know whether to cry or laugh.
I don't doubt that the Animal Protection Act would require an update.
But this is the case with a legal project that does not belong to democracy.
Unfortunately, I do not know the Constitution very well, but I think it accepts this 'everything is prohibited, which is not permitted by the law or by the regulation separately'.
I hope there is a reasonable minister who will suspend the progress of such a legal project.
Metti Forssell tip: Autumn four trendiest skirts
The trend of this autumn comes in snakes.
It looks particularly good just in the skirts.
Connect the snake skirt to the more reflexed upper parts, such as the pool or the ordinary T-shirt, so that the set remains stylish.

Kimi Räikkönen crystallized the cause of Mercedes' superiority compared to Ferrari.
Ferrarin Kimi Räikkönen admitted that the worst competitor Mercedes was too hard at the time of the Russian gp.
However, there is no reason to fall into the panic camp in Ferrari, the experienced driver's assessment.
They were just faster than we were, but it's not a big deal.
Our car was the best in time for the whole weekend for now, but they were just too fast, fourth, and his stable friend Sebastian Vetteli, who had clearly left Mercedes' speed.
Ferrar had a hard time in the last race in Singapore.
The guy was asked why the sudden fall on Mercedes' ride was right.
They seem to go faster than we do... so simple it is.
If I knew the reason for that, we'd probably go the same fast as them.
But I don't know any more than anyone else.
This is always a guess, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
In time, there was rare deliciousness of the coming of the Räikkös in the Talli Sauber.
Charles Leclerc, who replaced Ferrar for the next period, was the seventh, and the last time session also elevated Marcus Ericsson.
For a Swedish driver, the tenth point of departure is best for over three years.
And even though five drivers left their drivers completely behind in the second driving session, the result was still tasty for Sauber.
And perhaps the encouraging Räiks, thinking about the future?
Yes, if you compare where they were from the early age, a step forward has been a big one.
Next year, there's a different story, so let's see, let's see.
That's where Robert Helenius knocked off Erkan Teper: "Robbe is back"
Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper's fight at Stuttgart's evening was in a smooth way.
The German was a more initiativeful party in the ring, but he didn't get any good hits.
Obviously, more extensively, Helenius controlled the fight with his hard series that found well there.
Finnish was also clearly in a better physical condition than Teper.
Finally, the solution came in the eighth round when Helenius knocked down Teper on the left straight.
The hit was so hard that a convict who fought before the home audience didn't even try to get up from the carpet.
After the victory was confirmed, Helenius ventilated quite moderately.
During the web interview, he first praised the good atmosphere and opponent created by the audience.
Then he changed Finnish for a moment.
Thank all viewers and Finnish encouragers.
We took the belt today.
Helenius was happy right after the fight.
It was a really big victory for Helenius' career.
Perhaps there would be a chance to even get to the MM match, Helenius commented on the evening magazine before the fight.
Instead, the death might have ended the whole boxing career.
Of course it's been in mind.
This is no longer a younger one, 34-year-old Helenius admitted before the Teper meeting.
The number of victims of the Indonesian disaster can multiply
According to the Guardian magazine, the Vice-President of the country asks to prepare for a clear increase in the number of victims.
According to the country's Vice-President Jusuf Kalla, the total number of victims can rise to thousands.
Difficult conditions
Saviors are searching for trapped, as well as dead bodies from the worst affected areas of the island of Sulawes: please a port city and its neighbourhood in Donggala.
So far, all the victims are from Palo, and the situation in Donggala is not clear yet.
Hundreds of people are missing and about 540 have been hurt badly.
There are still people in corrupt buildings that the saviors have not been able to get out.
For example, the hotel named Roa Roa in Palo has fallen.
The Saviors tell us that they heard the screams of the ruins of those who were trapped, but the lack of cleaning equipment has delayed the beginning of salvation.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has ordered the army to rescue and clean up.
There is a need for the military and its equipment, as electricity and communication connections are broken in a disaster area in many places.
Fuel reserves are also exhausting.
Miss Finnish finalist's hesitating response and long thinking caused the laughter
Billnäsin Ruuk is currently choosing a new Miss Finland.
At the interview round, each missifinalist was asked.
The finalists pulled the question of the glass bowl on the stage.
Especially the finalist number six, Emilia Anttikosken, 23, the hesitant answer was made by sweet but goodwill laughter in the audience.
The question to the Anttikoske had come through Facebook.
User Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what's the last book Missifinalist has read.
Anttikoski thought about his answer for a good time before he started hesitating.
Thanks for the question, Pirkko-Ella.
The last book I've read... Anttikoski said thinking.
In the audience, the debate took place until Anttikoski continued to answer:
The last book I've read...
I've read books in school!
It's probably something about economic science.
So the last book I've read was someone in economic science, Anttikoski answered.
After his reply, Anttikoski received a fresh applause from the audience by laughing.
Earlier, Anttikoski drew attention to Miss Circle because he did not want to pose in underwear because of his principles.

A pig's apple pear can take the tongue by the time he gets it.
This recipe is for you who have good, acidized apples from behind, for the domestic apple is at the store of shocking prices.
A pear may have to buy, even though a lot of people think that pear trees are already growing.
This cake can also be made of apples only if you do not want to buy pear.
Of course, the taste is more diverse if the pear also falls into the cake.
Shell apples and pear and remove seeds.
It's a slice.
You can slack in the roof.
Shake the eggs and sugar as a vacuum and then add maize flour and melt to the butter.
Combine corn starch, i.e. maize, and bread powder, and add it to a taic.
Add almond flour and wheat flour, mix well.
Lead the bread leaf with bread paper, squeeze 2 appetizer sugars to the bottom of the leak and spread pear flakes on the sugar.
Put half the magic on top of the pear columns and the apple blocks on the tail.
The end was swept on the apple blocks.
Cook in the oven at 180 degrees about an hour until the surface is beautifully brown.
Let me cool up in the leak and then reverse it to the waiter.
Cut the cake until it's really cool.
The cake is fragile in its structure and is easily fragile because there are almond and corn flours in the magic with no gluten.

Status symbols don't attract friends - Four facts of popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic or admiration?
Researchers at Sydney University have analysed two types of "coolity" consisting of a little different features: generally attractive coolness and contradictory contradictory colosiveness.
According to the description of researchers, a delightful cool human being had many socially desired features: they were outward-oriented, friendly, compliant and qualified.
In contrast, there was a typical distance, independence, revolt and twist.
They were thirsty with experience and only a little interested in external evaluations.
Both types were combined with good self-esteem and stable emotional life.
The role of hardness is no longer cool: high status in teenage age does not necessarily lead to success later in life.
This is what the US research published in the Child Development magazine in 2014.
Young people who were dating early, partying, picking up and trying to favor others, had an increased risk of drug use and offences when they were young adults.
In their relationships, they managed to do less than they once did with the less noticeable companions of their age.
The high-state lock of susks, purses or clocks don't make a person cool, or at least a truly attractive company.
In the study published in August in Social Psychological and Personality Science, most of the people were more prepared to make friends with their ordinary market suits than with those who dressed their badge - despite the fact that most people chose a marking shirt in the context of their access.
If you're in Greece's holiday islands, watch out!
There's a storm of storm in there, the weather warning shouts red
During the weekend, in southern Greece, it can be as much water as in Finland during the average period of six months.
The Zorbas horror storm strikes Greece during the weekend.
Prepare yourself for staying in Peloponnesos, the islands of Jonah, the Cyclates or the Crete.
The storm is very strong, so the Finnish Athena embassy will report it on its Facebook page.
According to the Embassy, the Greek Air Science Service has given red weather warning to the regions.
The approaching storm is also reported in the weather service Foreca blog.
It says the toughest hips of the storm are up to 45 meters per second.
Due to comparison, the Kuisma storm stormed Finland from the beginning of the week, with its hardest storms of fairness 31 metres per second.
According to the blog, however, the biggest concern of the Zorbas storm is not the wind, but the harsh rain.
At the weekend in South Greece, there can be more than 300 millimetres of water.
It is responsible for about half of the annual rainfall in Finland.
Weather Service Severe Weather Europa has shared the video of the development of the storm on its Facebook page.
The storm of Zorbas has caused floods to Tunisia and Libya this week earlier.
Do you recognize the man who died in Love Island -Ankun?
Youtube videos confusing
It is rare to know that the beautiful Anku, dead by several men in Love Island Finland, is also present as an athletic aunt in the Youtube videos published in 2010.
In videos, Anku advises fellows, among other things, to prepare a blueberry from an old paper roll.
Anchor also shows its sympathy style how you can squeeze a silk to which the right beeps grow.
Now we will make the Passover grass grow, but we will do it a little surprisingly, Anku implies and presents sawdust, socks, and seeds of rainbow, of which he will make a silk.
You can watch the videos from below or from the Anku Youtube channel here.
Mr. Bottas shake and pursued adrenaline in Sotsh, is he going to be the helper of Hamilton on Sunday?
Mr. Bottas shake a little further dozen minutes after the Russian gp's fasting place when he was in front of the media.
The great round left Mercedes the first time in Lewis Hamilton, and I'm sure he was a spiritually important critic for the Finnish driver gathered this season.
Nice tour.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he left the solution round.
I feel good. I'm still shaking, Bottas figured it out.
I've been at the stake only once this year, in Austria (in the middle), so time has been quite the same.
This track has been good to me before, and I got good rounds again.
Sochi's track isn't easy to pass, so the departure is in a particularly big role.
And, of course, Bottas was able to answer the curiosity, whether he's driving a win tomorrow, or whether he's in front of a Hamilton approaching the MM title.
My point of departure is definitely trying to win.
There can be no other goal when you go, Bottas.
But as a stable, we fight for both championships.
Lewis' leadership for Sebastian Vetteli is pretty big and the difference between me is very big, so it's got to be kept in mind.
Let's see what happens, though, Bottas added.
After driving, Hamilton was truly happy to succeed in Bottakse, and the Mercedes stable boss Toto Wolff was seen as a taste.
Lewis had a plan to win the Valter, but he couldn't do it in seven.
The counselor knows he's got to tear everything down to win Lewis.
And he was so charged that the adrenaline came out of his ears, Wolff shined.
The question is whether the stable will allow Bottakse and Hamilton to drive fairly, Wolff answered in a way that was avoided.
We'll talk tomorrow morning and see how the race goes.
The contested Erno Kinnunen arrived at the Rall championship in Finland
The SM series of the race was rarely over.
I doubt that the brothers have never ended up at the same time as the Finnish champions.
Now it was done in the windsulas Eerik and Henrik Peternen in a decision-rail driven by Turku and Salo in the environment, because Eerik won the SM1 and Henrik SM2.
The Christian Erno Kinnunen secured the best success of his career, when the third place of the final contest sealed him from the SM4 category of two-wheeled Finnish cars.
The Kinnune and Ville Mäkelä, who competed in Honda Civic, started the market's sub-competitive competition, because the starting points were clear: the investment in the top group would guarantee a SM title.
In the darkness of Friday night, the twins had to give a balancing when some of the additional lights were betrayed by another special test.
It must have blinded the third piece.
In such a situation, it's not appropriate to be fooled.
On Saturday, only the second set was the speed of Jussi Tepo, Kinnunen told me.
Syria demands the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw its troops.
The Syrian Foreign Minister demands the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
On Saturday, the UN General Assembly spoken by Minister of Foreign Affairs, Walid Muallem, says that foreign forces must leave Syria immediately and without conditions.
Muallem said that foreign troops in Syria are fighting terrorism, and he said the war against terrorists is almost over.
In his UN speech, Muallem also called on Syrian refugees to return to their country.
But there is no end to the seven years of war.
Over 360,000 people have died in the war.
In Germany on Friday, the Federal Chairman Angela Merkel said that a meeting in Syria was scheduled for October, which would include the Presidents of France, Russia and Turkey.
Not exactly Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the Supreme Court's judiciary on TV.
Judge Brett Kavanaugh and Professor Christine Blasey Ford who accused him of harassment, who was subject to the Supreme Court, received an exceptional number of people at the front of the screens.
The appointment drama of the Supreme Court judge fully powered in the United States took at least 20 million people to their televisions on Thursday.
At that time, Kavanaugh, named by Donald Trump, and Professor Blasey Ford, who was accused of being assaulted by him, were in front of the Senate Justice Committee.
According to the preliminary findings, six main channels, i.e. ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC, were followed by a total of 20.4 million viewers.
In addition to their online consultations, several million more were followed.
The NBC reported that the livestock was followed by 6.8 million people and the CNN reported that he made a record of the year at the start of the 8.2 million live shipments.
The CNN figure will rise by more than 10 million, calculated by Youtube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital has also reached 8.0 million launches.
Digital launches are owned by the channels, the TV scans are from the research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen publishes the final readings on Monday, but they're still peak.
Hard to reach 20 million.
In the United States, more than 20 million audiences are usually only available for sports games and the great Oscar and Grammy galas in the entertainment world, as well as random political events such as Presidential speeches and presidential protests in 2016.
The US's most viewed annual programme, the final match for the American football league's NFL in Super Bowl, of course, is a journey.
This year Super Bowl gathered about 103 million people on the NBC channel by the grids.
Last year, Trump’s first speech to the Congress, according to Nielsen, looked at about 48 million people and 30 million people in office.
That's a very important thing.
The judgement of the Supreme Court is an extremely important case in the United States, as the posts are lifelong.
Trump was already able to appoint one of the new judges when Antonin Scali died from the beginning of 2016 and the Republicans managed to prevent the bridge president Barack Obama from appointing a successor to him.
Another place opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced that this year he would retire.
Kennedy was appointed by the Republican President, Mr Ronald Reagan, but he was a so-called horizontal language, which could have been resolved by the position of the Nintendent Court.
He was the supporter of the right to abortion and to sexual minorities and, for example, decided in 2015 in a voice that the same sex was granted marriage rights throughout the federal Union.
Kavanaugh's much more conservative in his arms.
His choice to the Supreme Court may be confined to the right of the Conservative Power for decades.
Children have the right to obtain information for parents
Only parents of children under the age of 10 can see their children’s health information from the Kanta service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong, and it's weird.
The situation of the Kanta service was, of course, even more worrying than that: parents could not even look at the health information or recipes of the infants.
In the autumn 2016, the situation was provisionally characterised as a correction for people under 10 years of age.
After that, the practice has been promised to be corrected, but it has been astonishing for a long time.
Now the correction is promised in 2020.
Because the problem is clear, the change of the legal base should not have been more than an auction.
After that, the understanding of the earth is about pressing the button: when the bark is held, it will be opened.
Of course, a child can show his information to his parents if he's got a bank or an official ID card.
But how many ten-year-olds have?
Personal card is paid, and 10 years of age is not even available.
Thus, in practice, the fourth-class data of the sub-school will not be seen by anyone except by asking for them as printed.
It's not as much the right of parents as the right of children.
The child’s care is extremely important for parents to be involved.
Of course, the right of teenagers to privacy must be taken care of.
Even minors can have family situations where all things cannot be spoken freely.
They often relate to sexual health, free care of which is deeply relevant to human rights.
In the U.S.A., the FBI initiated an attack on Kavanaugh.
According to the U.S. media, the FBI will investigate the disruptions of at least two women.
One of the women was previously consulted this week by the Senate's Committee on Justice.
Kavanaugh has challenged the accusations of alleged sexual harassment during his study.
President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate charges at the request of the Senate Justice Committee.
The investigation should not take longer than a week.
According to Washington Post, it's a criminal investigation that's infinite, and it's not necessarily going to be public.
The man threatened to kill the cops at the police station in Kajaan.
A remarkable explosive continued to squeeze in the chamber.
The police are saying that they put a man in the police prison to "relax".
The police were targeted by a suspected assault at Kajaan the night against Saturday.
The authorities will inform you of the case that started when a fair 30-year-old man challenged a rough dispute at the central restaurant.
The man attacked another customer in the food shop.
This was the result of getting out of the restaurant.
A fighter outside attacked another man by dropping him on the ground.
When the third party intervened, the man hit him, too.
Trinity abuse led to a police call.
The patrol took the man and took Kajaan to the police station, the police will tell you.
The suspect still acted aggressively at the police station.
He kicked another cop on his feet.
He threatened to kill and assault the cops.
The police say they've sent a man to the police prison to "relax".
The man is suspected of three assaults and violence against the official.
Assistance organisations are preparing to start work at Sulawes in Indonesia - "The Clean Water is the most urgent"
UN Children's Organization for Unicef and other international aid organisations are ready to help in the island of Sulawes in Indonesia, says Kirsi Haru, head of information for Finnish Unicef.
Local authorities lead rescue operations, but the need for further assistance is already obvious at this stage.
Unicef operates in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programmes in Indonesia.
In addition to normal activities, Unicef always has full emergency alert, says Haru.
The first task is now to find people in ruins, both the survivors and the dead.
In Sulawes, please, rescue measures are ongoing, but the situation in the Donggala region is a little norther.
There are still places where the connections don't work.
Assistance measures are difficult because also the roads are broken, says Haru.
The buildings in Sulawes are often light-structured, so the damage caused by earthquake and tsunami are large.
Once the survivors have been found, they need protection, first of all, for example, tents and clean water.
Clean water is the most urgent in crisis situations.
For the first time, most people are able to offer water purification tablets that Unicef has in stock.
Water systems will be designed to repair as soon as possible, but in an emergency, water will be transported first by trucks, for example.
In times of crisis, many children get rid of their parents.
Finding family members and uniting families is one part of Unicef's mission field.
Food aid is organised, among other things, as a World Food Programme (WFP) as part of the UN.
At the start of the emergency aid, the funds previously collected are used.
However, among other things, Unicef has already begun to collect money to help the indonesian earthquake and the tsunami victims.
Miljard Elon Musk, as Chairman of the Government of Tesla, ends fines of $20 million for tweets
The founder of space missiles and electric cars produced by Elon Musk avoids fraud charges by agreement with the US Securities Commission.
Miljard Elon Musk quit his mission as Chairman of the electric car company Tesla Government and accepts the fines of $20 million.
Musk is absent from the task as part of the agreement he concluded with the US Securities Market Supervisory Authority.
By adjusting Musk to avoid fraud charges.
The US Securities Commission SEC threatened Muski for securitisation fraud because of the tweets he sent in August.
In them, Musk wrote that he was preparing to withdraw the electric car company from the stock market, which led to a rapid increase in the company's share rate.
According to the agreement, Musk must not act as Chairman of the Government of Tesla for three years.
In addition, Teslan must appoint a new "independent member" of his government and take two independent leaders to his leadership group.
Teslan must also set up a committee to monitor the communication of Musk.
Musk will still be the CEO of Tesla.
In addition to Muski's personal $20 million fines, the Tesla company will also have to pay the corresponding fines of 20 million to the financial administrator.
Tweets misleaded investors
According to the SEC, Muski's tweets mislead investors and Tesla's shareholders.
Musk claimed that he would have guaranteed the funding to rebuild Tesla from the stock exchange as a private shareholder.
According to billionaire tweets, the company would have been bought off the stock market at a price of $420.
Tesla's share price increased by more than 10% per day after tweets, but later it fell.
According to the SEC, Muski’s claims had no basis.
According to the supervisor, he had not actually negotiated his claim for funding.
Furthermore, he had not discussed the withdrawal of the stock exchange with another management group or company government.
On Friday this week, the course fell by 14 per cent when SEC announced the fraud charges.
The news agreement is expected to reaffirm the company's course.
The last judgment is not a reason
Of course, the watches of the court church don't ring when the wise ones don't move.
It's a technical mistake.
The tower of the Helsinki Court has stopped.
The wisers show us at 12:00.
The situation is like a medieval horror movie: even though the crypt of the church was a part of manuscript and the males were playing themselves.
Of course, this is not the case, but the clock has stopped for technical reasons: it has broken.
It's been seen by the repairer, but some parts have been broken, and a new part is expected to be seen by Evelina Jamsen.
At the same time, Jamsen confirms the point already mentioned by the Twitter account in Helsinki.
In fact, the account mentions that the last sentence is not the reason for stopping the clock.
Jamsen tells me the church watches don't ring for a mistake.
