Changes in corporate support policies - Regions - News - Karjalainen
In addition to EU firm grants, the management of national corporate grants will also be concentrated on four living centres from mid-September.
In Eastern Finland, the operation is responsible for the South Savo Ely Centre in Mikkel.
According to the new Company Support Act, which came into force at the beginning of July, EU Structural Fund grants must no longer be allocated to large enterprises unless it is entirely new.
The subsidiaries of more than five thousand municipalities are also counted as great respect.
Instead, investment in the municipalities' business conditions can continue to be provided with EU support.
In Eastern Finland, the strength of the EU and national support management unit will be about 30 people.
At least for the time being, they all continue to work in their current positions.
For example, the job of Kalevi Pölösen, head of the Structural Fund Unit of the South Savon Ely Centre is in Joensuu.
Researcher: This is what Russia is now trying to do in Ukraine
Russia works consistently, even if it does not always look like it.
The head of the DRC Strategy Institute, Colonel, dozent Torsti Siren, was not surprised by the contradictions of Monday morning in Ukraine.
This has been the same thing for a long time, Siren says.
On the other hand, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called for a immediate ceasefire and announced that Russia would not attack Ukraine (read more here).
On the other hand, Ukraine reports that its paratroops are currently fighting with the Russian tanker department near Luhansk Airport, and that the tanker department has received confirmations (read more here).
Lavrov demanded that the Minsk negotiations take immediate cease-fire without conditions.
Russia denies its involvement and must immediately receive the outcome of the negotiations in order to obtain their established position in Luhansk and Donetsk.
There's the whole thing, Siren says.
This is the big pattern: suddenly we need to start negotiating and specifically so that Russia can get its own grip in the areas of Luhansk and Donetsk.
Finnair outsourcing cabin services to the Norwegian company, holidays people
Finnair begins to buy cabin services by subcontracting from the Norwegian crew service company OSM Aviation.
The agreement relates to the routes of Finnair in Hong Kong and Singapore at first stage, but it is intended to be extended later.
The outsourcing of the two routes leads to a reduction of about a hundred working years in Finland, which will be carried out at the first stage of holidays, the company reported in its communication.
In addition, the work of some 80 Asian tenants will end at the time of the outsourcing.
Finnair already told me in June that it intends to outsourc about 20 route passenger services over the next two years.
Outdoors were ended when the savings were not agreed with the staff.
It is intended to start out in January-March next year.
According to the company, negotiations on cooperation will continue with other partners.
According to the study, sleep problems multiply the risk of neurological spinal pain, i.e. striking pain, in those who work hard.
The study of the occupational health service followed firemen for 13 years.
The connection of sleep disturbances to the squash tree must be surprisingly powerful, although many other factors were taken into account.
The good muscle strength and durability of firemen, which is regularly tested, does not appear to protect them from pain, says the director of the research, Docent Sirpa Lusa, in the newsletter of the Health Service.
The work of firemen is irregular shifting work, where the shifts can take up to 24 hours.
According to the occupational health service, sleep problems are common in this type of work.
The results are based on a survey carried out in 1996, 1999 and 2009.
Do you know the surprising new causes of water damage?
Damaging easily to other dwellings
Water wheezes Water wheezing is not at all caused by leaking pipes or spoons, reminding the specialist of the hosting union.
We have received contacts when the aquarium breach has caused a water damage in the house company that whether the aquariums can be banned, says Marina Furuhjelm, the law expert of the Hosting Union.
Furjellm reminds us that only pipes and sewerages are not common causes of water damage, but also today more and more new machines such as ice fire machines have caused water leaks in housing.
Many do not know that machines such as the dishwasher or the washing machine must not be left unchecked.
The water supply shall also be kept closed whenever the machine is not on, as otherwise the pressure in the pipe may lead to a water leak.
The resident may be considered to have been inadmissible if these obligations have been neglected, in which case the liability for damages is inhabited.
Of course, in these cases home insurance can replace the damage, depending on the terms and conditions of the insurance.
If it can be shown that the resident has caused harm to the careless person, the liability shall be the person responsible.
If a resident has fallen into a shower on the floorstone, it can often be proven that the negligence is proven because in these cases the water is flooded elsewhere and the caregiver comes to the apartment where the resident is deceased.
Furohjelm tells us that due to the generalisation of the leaf mines, many student dwellings are now equipped with two floor mines in showers.
Water wheezes have also been caused by water beds, although not to the extent that they used to be more popular.
Even the dog's water bubble and the fall of home wine can become real water damage.
I also know the case where there were many cats in the apartment that had pissed on the floor so that there was a great deal of damage, Furuhjelm tells me.
The principle of remedial liability always goes in the same way if the company’s company order does not provide otherwise.
The shareholder shall be responsible for repairing surface material and damage to the structure of the house company and for damage to other dwellings.
Water wheezing easily causes destruction in other dwellings because the concrete of the structure is very easily absorbed by water.
According to Furuhjelm, the batteries of the apartments are particularly difficult because the batteries easily bleed into the structures.
Water waxes can now be caused by generalised air heat pumps that produce condensation water.
The water should lead to a fixed sewer or a rainwater network, not just a container.
Participant also has the responsibility to remove water, snow, ice and garbage from the balcony, the lawyer advises.
Furjjelm instructs that although the rules of the household company do not require, for example, a fixed decommissioning hose of washing machine, the insurance may be subject to the condition for which compensation is not received for this reason.
You should be careful with your own home insurance terms.
However, I think that washing machines are irrelevant, for example, of water-resourced pipes as a major risk which has caused many damage.
I recommend that the drainage waters should always be driven firmly into the drainage pipe.
Snow and water removal on the balcony
Washing machine, dishwasher, etc. controlling machines while they're on.
Closure of water hens (washing machine and dishwasher)
Clearing the floor cabin twice in a half-year.
It is recommended that the drainage waters be firmly connected to the sewerage.
Check the goats and their possible leaks
Regular refrigerator melting

FC Honka lost again and enlightened as a serial jumbo.
In the sports park of Tapiola, on Sunday night, two of the weakest teams encountered a football gymnastics gymnastics.
In June, the last FC Honka was hosted by Vaasa Palloseura in the invincible tubes of seven games.
VPS just received his previous victory in Honka in July.
The meeting with the Espoolais team came to a good seam, for VPS returned to the profit rate for a long time, reading 2-1.
The head coach of the Vacants Olli Huttunen complained of the inefficiency of his team before the game, but the confused Honka defence facilitated the painting problems of VPS.
It's a game of very nervous performance.
We didn't get any longer attacks, we couldn't hold the ball," Huttunen judged the performance of his own.
In the first half of time, Honga's cowboy Milos Milovic - Kosta Manev played very uncertainly.
Both of the vase paints were born as a result of the loose play of the larvae of the larvae.
The opening painting was seen only after five minutes of the game, when Steven Morrissey guided Sebastian Strandval's shot by a Honka painter Walter Viitalan.
I'm sorry about the first half.
By the field, the team did the opposite of what was agreed before the game," said Honga's chief coach Shefki Kuqi manasi.
After the initial shock, the espoolans got their game together and rolled the ball at the end of the attack.
Especially the middle field player Carlos Portela and Roni Porokara were eager to search for places of work, but the last solutions were almost repeatedly miserable.
The closest goal was Honga's central fieldman Jussi Hammer, whose 20 metres of the shot was a little past the VPS painting.
VPS effectively attacked his vivid attackers and Honga's crazy top pair.
At half an hour, the vasians made a 2-0 position, when Morrissey and Cornelius Stewart got on their own.
Morrissey served and Stewart finished.
Morrissey was on a good head of play at the opening stage and created situations on the left side repeatedly.
But Stewart's speed all the time of the game seemed to be too much for the espool defense.
"In the middle of the day, if you lose, you lose with honor," Kuqi told me.
During the second episode, the indigenous Honka came up with a rage of mining painting.
The team was close twice until the third company succeeded.
Yerai Vilaboa was finalizing the paint in the middle of the punishment area.
After the Vilabo goal, Honga had half an hour to balance the match.
The Espoo team continued to take more risks, giving VPS a chance for dangerous counterattacks.
Both Stewart and Morrissey got their first chance with Viita, but the Honka Malay's rude fights kept the home team in the game.
At the end, Honka was a little tired, and he didn't get any more.
As a result of the loss, Honka enlightened the last of the Betting League when there are seven more matches left.
Journal: Putin threatened to take over Kiova in two weeks
Russian President Vladimir Putin was quite loud in a phone discussion with the President of the EU Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, reports the Italian La Repubblica magazine.
Putin expressed his irritation about the European Union's plans to extort sanctions against Russia.
If I want to, I can take over Kiova in two weeks, La Repubblica will tell me that Putin said it.
According to the paper, Putin's message to Barroso was this: it is not worth irritating Russia with new sanctions.
Putin gave the Russian television channel one an interview about the Ukraine crisis on Sunday night.
In the interview, Putin told me that he fully holds a conflict within Ukraine and urges the Kiova Government to negotiate directly with the rebels.
At the same time, he warned Kiova very much about the fire of civilian targets in Eastern Ukraine.
Russia "can't look next door" if people are shot to death from the nearest distance, Putin said.
Esko Roine confesses: The work of an actor destroyed the family
The hard work was raised by the Concar actress and the theatre suit to confess how the actor’s profession destroyed his first marriage.
The actor Esko Roine fills up next Friday for 70 years, but I think it's a valid saying that the age is only a number.
I don't see any difference compared to a year ago, two years or ten years ago.
A spiritual pubertetic seems to continue, Esko Roine says.
Roine's been retired for years, but he's still working for many men.
Sometimes it was a joke that there weren't many plays in this country without Esko Roinetta.
At present, Roine has roles in the Helsinki City Theatre's play How to succeed in business, in the End of the Tampere Workers' Theatre and in the Quartet of the Tampere Comedia Theatre.
The Roine will also be seen in the future Risto Räpppääja movie.
KUVA: Reijo Slow
The actor's career with the ropes didn't start promisingly.
I didn't like a tierna boy in school.
40 or 50 years later, the teacher said it was the reason that I was so bad.
Esko Roine didn't weaken.
The choice of career was clear, there was no choice.
It felt close and loved.
I was so busy in the field that I left school and volunteered to go to the army just to get to the theatre school as soon as possible.
Roine has done about 200 theaterirools and 300 TV shows little, depending on how to count.
If the work is calculated like the angels, that every part of the TV series is its own show, then there are over 600 TV stories.
I was three years in the New Day, three episodes a week.
The other spring I was killed when I didn't have time to do it.
Commitments to autumn 2016
Esko's older sisters Eila, 83, and Liisa, 76, are in full blow and make the Tampere Workers' Theatre Still has the steep roles in an anarchist.
Your little brother's gonna be on the stage for years.
That's what it looks like now, but you don't know about this age.
I always have to take a little booking to come if I'm alive.
Some commitments have been made or promised.
Calendar has reservations for autumn 2016.
They've left a man behind for years, too.
The age won't be on its own.
The knees are operated, the hip whistles and the arthritis is troubled, but when you don't let it too much bother, yes, these heads, Esko Roine says.
To the TV audience, Roine became familiar, including:
A pirate radio and a stunt where he shared crops with Antti Einie, hundred marks of banknotes.
It was Antti Einiö who shared the crops.
I tried to thirst that they were rainy, not crops.
In the Reinikaline series, Roine was an insignificant Inspector Rautatallio.
He became the favorite of the Tampere policemen, at the office when he happened to be the same inspector in the job.
A policeman stopped the car on the street, took the window open and screamed to me, "This Rautatallio is great!"
Working Group Successful
Theatres Roi and I have been remembered by theaters.
Producer and Master class of the Helsinki City Theatre, death of the Tampere Workers' Theatre Trade Traveler and a long-day journey of the Tampere Theatre.
All of this relates to the fact that the presentations have been popular.
It's not my fault. It's my team.
There's been a rimanade, too.
Pekka Woodhead's role in the movie is one of those.
There are others.
The reason is I've agreed too easily.
I don't know if I regret those roles, but the outcome is not satisfactory to myself or to the viewers.
As a rival actress, you can't choose your own job.
It's just nice to do what's been ordered.
In addition to the theatre work, Roine has also tried to succeed in business.
In the '80s, he kept a restaurant called Wanhat Roomeot in Tampere.
It was a teaching experience.
It was nothing when I tried to be the director of the Tampere Theatre, an actor, and then a restaurant lobbyist at the same time.
If I remember correctly, in a year, it turns out that they can't be reconciled in any way.
Typical was that when the show was over or out of time, and I had to think about if I would put the sauna on, the restaurant became a call that there were your friends here hoping to see you after the show.
Memories for the birthday
On his day of birth, Esko Roinee shows memories, as ghost writers Annika Grahn and Eija Mäkinen.
Some kind of twist they've brought about from the face twister's memory.
At the time, when I was playing in Zoom, I was called a face-blower.
Not the ones I've known.
The book has been made for years.
In time, Roine told me that there is no news bomb, because he hasn't done anything so creepy, or if he is, he won't tell me.
I made a little first sentence in the book.
I'm telling you, if someone is waiting for scandalous explosions or good rumors, you should stop reading this.
There's a lot of professionals in there, so as an actor as a director of the theater.
The publisher finds that there is also a turina from the abundance of the theatre school.
It was a pretty normal student life, but it was a kid from all sorts of tricks.
It wasn't as brutal as Turk's time.
It was very different.
I don't know how much more I got out of it than self-certaining that when the school has been so aware that it's not up to it if it's not healing.
I didn't have to think how good I would be if I had gone to school.
Roine also remembers the legends of the National Theatre.
I became friends with Pentti Siimes, Tarmo Man and Hannes Häyris and I was able to work with them.
Yes, there were legends from my first fatherhood since the Guard.
Pia Hattara and I had a very close relationship.
Tauno Palo was already gone, but I had time to get to know him during schooltime.
The middle boy of the fire, Martin, was in the same class with me.
At the theatre school, Roine met her first wife, Marjukka Halttu.
As a painful thing, he remembers his divorce.
After a relatively long fight, the children were divided.
Not in two parts, but by the way that the daughter went to my mother and son.
I did not think it was a good solution, and I believe that children are quite in agreement now as adults.
It's not rare in the theatre circles for silver to be distributed.
In my case, there was some part of me that I worked pretty much then.
I was in the theater close to every case.
Then there was a TV and a radio on it.
I've been doing a long day and family life has been hurt.
A party day, maybe a night off.
Esko Roine celebrates at the Tampere Workers' Theatre on 7 September.
The party will continue at the Helsinki City Theatre on 21 and 28 September.
It's where the apocalypse is urging.
I was working for 50s, and I was working for 60s.
When such an easy to move act happened, I thought we'd have the seventies now, then we'll get them off with one raid.
The ropes say there's no celebration on the real birthday.
I think it's a night off, but I'm not going to swear.
I may have spent some work that day.
Or maybe it's a strange night off I'm going to take off tonight, Roine says.
Aeronautical companies concerned with the production chain
Some of the smaller UK aircraft manufacturers are concerned that the supply chain’s production capacity problems may reduce the ambitious plans of large aircraft manufacturers to increase the production of passenger aircraft.
In Britain, thousands of companies belonging to the production chain of aeroplanes are currently enjoying an unexpected number of simultaneous aircraft and engine development plans.
Aeronautical and defence
At the same time that some enjoy ordering, there have been warnings about capacity problems and price pressure in the production chain.
"It is quite true that there is a price pressure, especially now that the production volume is challenging," says the director of the MB Aerospace of the major suppliers of the manufacturers of aircraft engines such as Rolls-Royce.
According to David Bailey, the CEO of North West Aerospace Alliance, representing a supplier of North West Aerospace production in northwest England, requires more capacity.
"Do strategies and investment plans respond to these growth plans?
To tell you the truth, I'm not sure about that.
We need more, above all, investing in new production equipment and machines, which are needed to enable these production volumes to be realised," says Gallagher.
According to some companies, the simultaneous implementation of new production plans and the increase in the aeroplane building is part of the problem.
According to Andrew Churchilli, JJ Chrurchilli's CEO of gas wings, the company has a "consuming time" when several new construction plans were started to be implemented at the beginning of the year.
We moved from very small production to a space where production capacity exceeded.
Many orders were only paid afterwards, and we had to try to move forward.
However, it is useless to try to explain that the problem is due to the simultaneous implementation of the new production plans," says Churchill.
JJ Churchill has responded to the challenge by investing £80,000 in new machines and hiring 26 new workers.
Several operators in the sector believe that investment and coordination between small suppliers is needed if Britain wants to maintain its position as the second largest operator in the aviation sector after the United States.
The President of Ford Aerospace and the engineer for fine-mechanics from Tynesid says that the order should increase the confidence of producers and the desire to expand and increase production capacity, as the work will be sufficient.
"If this doesn't happen, we'll lose in competition against other countries," Ford says.
Some major players are trying to solve the problem by obtaining capacity.
The FTSE 250 aircraft and engine noise-producing company Senior purchased UPECA 75 million pounds for the components of the aircraft in Malaysia.
MB Aerospace purchased companies from North America and Poland last year.
"It is possible to buy new activities creative Start-up companies, but in fact, most of the production slows down the limitation of design and the number of engineers," says Gallagher MB of Aerospace.
Both small and large companies have mentioned the price pressure that has shifted to them from large aircraft manufacturers and aircraft engine manufacturers.
Some believe that the problems of the production chain are exaggerated.
Mr Marcus Bryson, head of the GKN aircraft production unit, also representing the UK aviation industry, believes the President of ADS that the production chain has handled the problem better than in previous periods.
The supply chain is under pressure, but I wouldn't describe the situation as critical.
"The introduction of new technologies and advanced processes is more important than the flows," Bryson says.
Both Airbus and Boeing have learned from errors and are now more careful in order not to increase the number of buildings too fast.
When Boeing attempted to increase its production in 1997, it was faced with major difficulties when the company made losses and the factories and the production chain fought to survive.
Tony Wood, head of Rolls Royce Aircraft Production Unit, says that the company has not yet encountered any problems in the production chain that delivers most of the 18 000 parts of the engine required to be manufactured.
"You will certainly be a hole, but we believe that we have done more in-depth work on the supply chain by choosing the best partners and keeping in contact with the suppliers when preparing to increase their activity," Wood says.
According to Boeing's CEO James McNerney, the company's production chain has had time to prepare for the increase in supply volumes.
We have a good feeling about the strength of the production chain.
We have acted openly against journalists, which is very important.
Fabrice Brégier, CEO of Airbus’s Airbus Airbus Airbus Airbus Airbus Airbus, says that the company will do its best to reduce the risks associated with its plans to increase the production of A350 to 10 machines in a month by 2018.
"Even if one of the journalists fails, and our task is to try to prevent this situation and support journalists and seek alternatives, but it is waiting for major problems," says Brégier.
Bregiér says that Airbus is not looking for singuards: "The quality of the production chain is the responsibility of the editor.
So this is my job and Airbus' work."
Hong Kong demonstration teams start the "Central Intrusion era" in Beijing when banning open elections
China refuses to give full democracy to Hong Kong
Democracy activists are spreading to Hong Kong streets after China abandoned their open elections.
The Hong Kong Democrats emphasise that demonstrations can be stamped and sworn to ensure that in the city the age of "Central Intrusion" will begin to oppose the reforms proposed by the Chinese Government.
Thousands of demonstrators threatened the coming rain against Hong Kong’s glowing horisont, as they were walking towards the democratisation group of Occupy Central, in front of the Council holdings responsible for the implementation of the laws on Sunday night, where demonstrators called on people to participate in a wide-ranging attitude to deteriorate the city’s financial block.
The referendum took place only hours after Beijing had announced that it would deny the right of voters to propose public candidates in the Mayor elections in 2017, despite such demonstrations for months, which will further increase the city's recession.
At the beginning of the demonstration of the Occupy Central movement, the demonstrators will participate in the main government buildings in Hong Kong.
"We want fair and decent elections," says 24-year-old Maintainer Dion Tse, who attended a Sunday demonstration with his 50-year-old mother, Wong Chi-yin.
The government does not respect the voice of Hong Kong.
We want the government to listen to us and see the determination of the Hong Kong people.
The Chinese National Congress approved plans for changes in elections which led to the participation of only two three candidates in Hong Kong's first direct elections.
However, the proposal requires the approval of the 1200-century Committee, and opponent politicians consider this to effectively prevent the access of the election flags by the prosecutor of divergent political views.
The demonstrators participate in the demonstration organised in the course of the Central Love and Peace Protest, which was carried out in Tamar Park before the Hong Kong Government Building.
According to the police, more than 2,600 people were currently involved in the demonstration.
A large number of cops followed when some 100 demonstrators led by the Scholarism Student Group were gathered late on Sunday to Grand Hyatt, where Li Fein, a member of the Communist Party, was supposed to stay at the night after he arrived in Beijing.
Benny Tai, one of the founders of Central, participated in the press conference with members of the Alliance for True Democracy, Scholarism and Federation of Students.
Or, however, not to comply with the law, to say the exact date when the road blocking is carried out, but urged participants to follow the situation closely over the next few weeks, adding that the city is formally moving to the "Central Independence Period".
Benny or answer the press questions.
"Look at the person next to you," he said in the Sunday demonstration, in front of two characters representing disobedience in China.
That man has power in the center with you!
17-year-old conveniences representing Scholarism, Joshua Wong said earlier that the preparations for the demonstrations of high school students are underway and are designed to be held at the same time as thousands of university students are expected to show their minds by refusing to teach.
"In addition to academic responsibility, we have social responsibility," Wong says.
In Beijing, Vice-President Li Fei of the Committee of the People's Congress told journalists that the defence of the general voting rights "international requirements" is "time-lossing" and from some Hong Kong politicians who are trying to "blend society and mislead society".
"Inconductive proposals such as public candidates have wasted a lot of time," says Li, demanding that the method of electoralisation be created so that it fits the real situation of each society and the legislative framework.
Only if a large majority, i.e. two thirds of Hong Kong's 70-century legislative body, can be adopted as a law on public voting, which means 27 opposition members of the government can stop the initiative.
Li warned that Hong Kong might be drawn into a long-term political debate if the proposal for a reform is rejected by the right of veto.
"It would harm business and city development," he says.
Approximately 800 000 people voted in an informal survey organised by the Occupy Central movement in June in order to oppose China's requirements, and according to the requirements, the candidate needs the approval of the committee.
Even 172,000 people marched on behalf of democracy on 1 July, at the same time as the 17th August, a marshal against the Beijings and Occupy Central, attracted some 88,000 participants. The estimates of the figures come from the University of Hong Kong, although the estimates of police and organisers differ considerably from these figures.
Three injured lightning attacks on the beach in New York.
In a flash attack on a beach in New York, three people were injured.
According to the fire department, men were injured on the Orchard Beach coast at Pelham Bay in Bronx on Sunday night when the hard storms crossed the area.
The injured men are in hospital.
The extent of injuries is unknown.
The lightning hit when the tough thunderstorms swept across the city.
Storm rays, thunder and lightning interrupted the Labor Day weekend and the U.S. Open tennis in Queens and forced the music festival to close early on the island of East River.
Ten commercial flights arrived at the city airport were delayed due to bad weather.
A new idea is not to be pleased
This is the newest guide for employees and supervisors for network users and is shared by Harvey Schachter, author of Monday Morning Manager.
According to entrepreneur Seth Godin, a good idea to identify comments like "I don't like it" or "I don't understand."
If this is not the case, the idea is likely to be popular and self-evident — i.e. boring and daily — or the benefits it brings are so limited that it should not be pursued.
As a historian, Harvardin Drew Gilpin never repeated anything that had already been published so that people would not think that he had nothing new to offer.
Now, as principal of the university, he repeats the same thing several times so that the message can be reached widely.
Advisor Bob Hoffman thinks TV and radio are the best tools to create demand, while the network creates supply.
The fact that more and more people read news on the network does not mean that the internet would be good between advertising – just as the first phone was a popular communication device, but a bad alternative to advertising.
Psychologist Heidi Grant Halverson notes that there is one word to motivate workers: together.
In a study, participants were told that they would solve the problem as a co-operation, even though in fact they worked alone in an empty room. These participants worked for longer and solve more problems than those who were not told about cooperation at the beginning.
If the task is to find a repeated pattern or relationship between two units, performing expert Dave Paradi advises you to forget Microsoft's SmartArt and instead to use a Diagrammer.com program where you can choose between 14 different relationships.
Surgeries in the Mount Stuart hospital forbidden by safety risk
The specialist has been temporarily dismissed, and the UK national health system NHS ceased to direct patients to a goat surgery in this private hospital following the emergence of the hospital problems.
Two people went to Torbay's hospital after being treated at the Mount Stuart Hospital in Torquay.
The hospital in Devon said he was in contact with 19 patients who had been treated on 26 July and invited them to "smart clinical study".
The Mount Stuart hospital regretted it and said that it was an investigation since the doctor had been dismissed.
The case came to the Torbay hospital when two patients treated in Mount Stuart came to the emergency room for eye problems.
According to Torbay's hospital, none of the 19 NHS patients who were all studied on the same day had to be remedied.
The Torbay Hospital and the South Devon and Torbay Hospital have not been directed by patients to treat Mount Stuart after problems have occurred.
The temporary director of the South Devon Healthcare NHS Foundation, head of Torbay Hospital, David Sinclair, said that "we have identified the problem at its beginning and were able to contact all the patients concerned quickly.
Every time we direct patients to the care of the service provider, we perform quality and safety tests and ensure that the service provider meets the latest legal requirements and that its permits are in order.
According to Gill Gant, the head of Patient Safety of the South Devon and Torbay Hospitals, "the patient safety is always in absolute number one, so it is important that these goat surgery will not be carried out for so long as we can be completely certain that the treatment is safe".
The Ramsay Health Care UK, managing Mount Stuart Hospital, asked for "anonymously forgave all patients with complications".
The company was informed that "on a week when we found out about the potential problem, we later called from Torbay's hospital to all patients concerned".
This specialist has been licensed by Ramsay Health Care since 2005 and has been registered as a doctor since 1989.
By this date, he has performed 4 537 goat surgery in different parts of the organisation. According to statistics, the clinical results of the operations he has been excellent and the complication percentage has been less than 0.5%.
Mount Stuart added that the doctor has been temporarily dismissed until the case has been investigated.
What's "4chan"?
The nasty anonymous communication site first published fabulous leaked naked images
What exactly is "4chan", and why was it the hacker's first option when he published stolen images?
The "4chan" was set up in 2003. It has raised the debate on the communication site, which is called as much as it is praised.
The site is divided into several parts, i.e. reporting tables where anonymous users can discuss all possible, video games and travel to porn and hacking.
Unlike other online platforms, users do not create one, continuously used profile, and their publications are not stored.
Comments may be lost in less than one minute with the most popular reporting tables when the new publications are excluded from the bottom of the page.
These two factors have created a chaotic, anarchist and surprising creativity of 4chani.
Anonymous members of the Community have created some of the most well-known memories in the network (such as "rickrolling" and "lolcats"), but the lack of rules on the site has also led to a lot of questioning or criminal content on the site.
The website's most popular notification table is /b/, intended for mixed discussions and for which NSFW content is regularly published (Not Safe For Work).
This may contain summer porn, but also brutal and shocking images. An anonymous hacker published stolen pictures specifically on this notice table this weekend.
American CytRx invests in research and development of anticancer medicines
The aim of the CytRx company is to improve cancer – or at least slow it down.
The company producing biological medicinal products in Los Angeles, which recently became the target of the target of the active object of the stock sales, is specialised in the research and development of cancer medicines.
The most authorised medicine is aldoxorubicin, a more developed form of doxorubicin generally used in chemotherapy.
CytRx is conducting clinical studies in the treatment of aldoxorubicin soft tissue arcoma, Aids-related capos sarcoma and renewable glioblastoma or brain tumours.
It's like a controlled missile that goes directly to the tumour and not to the rest of the body, says Steven Kriegsma, CEO of the CytRx company, an anticancer medicine from aldoxorubics.
My aldoxorubicin contains the so-called combination technology that works like a Trojan horse.
It binds directly to a protein in the blood, which also accumulates into tumours, where the medicine passes directly to cancer cells.
I was able to give up the medicine only in an acidic environment, that is, cancer cells, but not in a healthy tissue.
This technology allows more and more doses of cancer to be given to the patient.
"It's like a missile that goes directly to the tumour and not another body," says Steven Kriegsman, CEO of the CytRx company.
Like many other biotechnology companies, which focus on the development of medicines, CytRx does not profit.
This year the company sold shares and thus collected USD 86 million for the maintenance and research.
CytRx is currently searching for 400 patients worldwide for an alternative treatment of soft tissue spam in the crucial phase 3 clinical study.
The soft tissue tumour is a type of cancer that develops in soft tissues of the body, such as blood vessels, muscles and fat tissues.
Alternative treatment is used to treat cancer when the initial treatment does not result in results.
If the clinical study is successful, CytRx intends to apply for authorisation to the US administration of food and medicines already in 2016, says Kriegsman.
The medicinal product could then be authorised for use in 2017.
Analysts say that the data from CytRx’s previous clinical study in December showed that aldoxorubicin was a promising treatment for soft tissue spawning.
"We haven't seen any clinical information about how much it differs from the medicine itself," says the investigator Andrew Fein of the investment company H. C. Wainwright & Co.
The publication of the results confirmed the opinion of many that this treatment is different.
However, Fein says that it is difficult to predict the results and schedule of the current clinical study, as it differs significantly from the previous study that has obtained good results.
"Most things have to go right," he says.
Fein compares the development of medicines to the mining industry.
“The first place is a lot of money to find that one golden vein, and the placement continues for so long that that golden vein is found,” he says.
Money will be spent on research and development for so long as the medicine is successful in commercialising.
Several shareholders have demanded the CytRx company to justice because they believe that it gave a better picture of its success.
In the complaints, the company was accused of hiring a DreamTeam Group, which then claimed that he hired people to write positive comments on the CytRx company and on the other articles published by Forbes, Seeking Alpha, Motley Fol and Wall Street Cheat Sheet.
According to the complaints, the articles did not indicate that the companies paid fees to the authors.
As a result of the news, Seeking Alpha announced that he had deleted the articles "which were against practice".
A number of companies’ articles were also deleted from other sites.
Kriegsman refused to comment on the charges.
The company has hired an external attorney to answer the lawsuits.
"I don't have time and energy to concentrate on this," says Kriegsman.
He believes that the real challenge of CytRx is to find talented workers who tend to seek employment in biotechnology centres such as San Diego, San Francisco and Boston.
"This is a wilderness in many ways from the pharmaceutical industry," he says.
Views of the Analyst magazine
The price of the shares of the CytRx company rose to $8.08 on 10 January and then fell to less than $3 in April when the charges for advertising of the shares came to the public.
According to the Analyst magazine, the claims and the negative publicity have lowered the price of the shares than their actual value.
"It's regrettable," Fein says, "but I'm not sure if there's any easy way to pass this thing as long as the idea is valid".
In the name of the law, the cameraman of the police series was killed in the middle of the descriptions.
The photographer of a series of real events, even in the name of the Act present in Finland, died Tuesday night when he was shot in the middle of the shooting incident.
The cameraman described a shooting between the suspected person on the armed robbery of a self-contained police department and a fast food restaurant when he was hit by bullets.
He died of the injuries that he quickly suffered.
According to the TMZ site, the police told me that a person suspected of armed robbery died in addition to the cameraman in the shooting incident.
The first series of real TV programmes in the name of the Law has been presented in the United States since 1989.
The series has been presented in Finland on MTV channels since the 1990s.
The issue of an external factor is a crucial role in the court law process that has begun Ulvila's death today.
Anneli Aurer is accused of the murder of his husband Jukka S. Lahde in 2006.
The Court of Justice of Vaasa now deals with the case for another time, since the Supreme Court returned it to the Court of Justice with the new evidence.
The purpose of court law is that the judgment will still be given on the side of this year.
In 2011, Vaasa’s court law freed Auer.
In that case, the court considered the possibility of an external author to be sufficiently probable.
In his opening speech, Prosecutor Kalle Kulmala told the prosecutor's view of the murder and of the facts that exclude the possibility of an offender.
In our opinion, the crucial question is whether the outsider has come into the house, who has killed Mr Lahden in the way and in time.
This is about the credibility of Anneli Auer's report," said Kulma.
According to the prosecutor, the church began a family dispute during which Auer had announced that he was leaving home and seeking divorce.
At some point, they moved to the kitchen where Lahti caught Auer and tried to stop him from leaving.
One of them took a kitchen knife", the Kulmala described the events of the night of death on Monday.
According to the prosecutor, a number of things prove that there were no external factors.
For example, an emergency call recording does not contain any voices from an external author.
The oldest child of Auer, the daughter of the interview, told me that he saw the killer when he left the fireplace door.
The 2011 liberating judgment of the court of Vaasa was partly based on the daughter’s report.
According to the prosecutor, a daughter's observation can't be correct.
"The daughter did not see an external author in the parent's bedroom, even though she went there twice to look," said the Kulmala.
The prosecutor's new witness is just related to the possibility of an outside agent.
Jukka S. Lahde's sister has told me about what happened since the night of the murder in the hospital.
According to her, she only told me at the hospital that she saw only Lahde's body when she was in the fireplace.
Auer's defence intends to present to the court investigation lines, which, according to the defence, have not been sufficiently cleared by the police.
After three years ago, when Vaasa’s court was freed from the charges against Auer, the court had to find a foreign man’s DNA as one of the references to the outsider.
The sample later proved to be a researcher in the Central Crime Police Laboratory.
That was when 700 people took a DNA sample.
At the same time, a significant number of serious suspects and alternative investigation lines were excluded," said the defendant, Mr Manner.
Another defendant of the new witnesses tells about a possible outsider.
The Ulvilan woman told the police about a poric man who, according to the woman, confessed to the act.
The police interviewed the man in the summer.
The prosecutor decided that a porcine man had nothing to do with a homicide.
The prosecutor filed an investigation request for a woman, as the prosecutor suspects the woman who lied to her report.
One of the new witnesses of the defense is a nurse who worked during the night of the death at the central hospital of Satakunta.
The court of the 100th tribunal sentenced Auer to lifetime imprisonment for murder last December.
According to the judgment of the Tribunal, the possibility of an external author was fought, among other things, by the children's reports of Auer, by the external author missing from the Emergency Centre records, and by the time required for the time of the events.
The judgment came with 2-1 votes.
The lesser judge wrote that contradictory evidence must be interpreted as the advantage of the defendant.
Therefore, the story of the daughter must be interpreted in such a way that, despite the contradictions of the report, it had discovered that the outsider was leaving the fireplace.
Two of Auer's eldest children have been called to be heard by court.
The daughter was first personally heard last year in the court of justice of the Satakunta.
In court, he no longer remembered the night of the murder.
Auer's second oldest child named her mother as a killer in the video interview in 2011.
The boy told me he heard the murder night events behind the closed door.
He also told me that Auer was planning to kill for six months.
As a lawyer, the boy has no obligation to say anything in court.
The court proceedings will continue today at the hearing of Anneli Aure.
If necessary, the hearing of Auer will continue tomorrow.
Anneli Auer is currently sitting for more than seven years in prison on sexual and violent crimes against children.
Should Putin be allowed to participate in the G20 meeting?
Putin's activities in Ukraine have made him the first of many.
Putin is to take part in the G20 Summit in Brisbane in November, and in Australia, it is urgent to discuss whether or not his entry should be allowed.
The Punkrock activist group, Pussy Riot, asked Australia to ban Putin's participation in the summit, with over 4,000 representatives from the most powerful countries in the world.
"We do not think that this person has anything to do with the G20," said Maria Alyokhina to the public at the Festival of Dangerous Ideas, a fully packed opera house in Sydney.
Kiova has warned himself to be on the edge of the "full war", and Putin calls parts of Ukraine "Novorossia" or "new Russia". Is it necessary to welcome him?
Tony Abbott's been saying he's making a decision.
According to Mike Callaghan, head of Lowy Institute Research Centre G20, Australians cannot decide who will attend the meeting, even if the meeting is held in the country.
"Austria can decide who it's going to let, but it's an international meeting," he says.
Just as New York hosts UN meetings or Washington hosts International Monetary Fund meetings, "the host's task is not to deny someone called to come", Callaghan says.
In the last week, Tony Abbott said that he's making a decision after Russia's depressing actions in Ukraine.
This is a very important issue.
Since Putin is coming to a very significant international meeting, Australia does not have the right to decide alone.
"But this is an important thing that I will consider a lot, and I believe that other countries will do so in the next few weeks," he says.
People attend an anti-war meeting in Mariupol, Eastern Ukraine.
The event will take two days and will be involved in a wide range of representatives of the world's largest and fastest developing economies, where around two thirds of the world's people live, representing 85% of global GDP and 75% of international trade.
Members include Canada, China, France, Japan, Russia, the United States and the European Union, as well as a few non-G20 countries, such as New Zealand, Singapore and Myanmar.
According to Callaghan, Australia had a questionable task of balancing different interests under high public pressure.
He believes that the best way to deal with this is to take advantage of the opportunity to pressure Russia to speak publicly about his recent actions.
"The Prime Minister should say that we are going to take advantage of this opportunity to pursue a very open dialogue and that he will require President Putin to make an account of his actions."
If Putin comes to the meeting, his duty is to explain his actions," Callaghan says.
There is clearly an increase in geopolitical pressure.
I think the world expects them to take these things up.
The Russian-minded rebels are preparing weapons for the attack on the Ukrainian military bases at Donetsk Airport in Eastern Ukraine.
It is still unclear whether to attend Put's meeting, and according to Callaghan, it may not be known until a few days in advance.
I'm sure this is the last thing in Putin's mind.
He hardly states that "I have to change my attitude towards Ukraine because I desperately want to go to Brisbane in November".
Mr Bill Shorten, the opposition director, will take the coming of Putin to Australia with "very reservations", but understands that this is an international conference.
It is probably time for Prime Ministers and Foreign Ministers to discuss with other countries and G20 countries whether it is appropriate to allow Putin to enter Australia.
It's an international conference, not an Australian conference, I understand that.
After the tragic events followed by the Malaysian Airlines accident, as well as the lack of proper cooperation in terms of pity, responsibility and air accident, and now that thousands of Russian soldiers are on the border of Ukraine, I believe that most Australians are very reservations about the welcome of Putin to Australia.
The German business world criticises Berlin's "secret"
Some of the German top business leaders warn that Germany has become "reliable" and "secret" because the government's policy threatens the country's challenge to achieve competitiveness.
The criticism of the federal counterpart towards the Government of Angela Merkel occurs at the same time as the largest economic economy in Europe shows signs of slowing down, which causes concern whether it is able to rotate economic growth in the euro area which is on the spot.
The criticism of business leaders is the result of the strongly opposed political decisions of the German business sector, including the introduction of minimum wages and the reduction of the retirement age of certain long-served workers for 63 years.
"I think that the biggest threat right now is overconfidence in Germany, which inevitably causes the feeling of self-determination," says Kurt Bock, the world's largest chemical manufacturer.
EU economy
He believes this: "Greatly, we have the feeling that we are doing well, we have money to use and unemployment at a relatively low level. What, then, is the problem?"
I think there's a great danger here.
The German Government's policy shows that we are not focusing on growth and are not favourable to the environment for businesses, but instead we are focusing much more on sharing wealth and meeting the expectations of certain parties.
According to Markus Kerber, CEO of the German Industrial Organisation BDI, "The German situation is good now.
In the next ten years, however, every developed economy must change. ...[in Germany] the reform programme does not achieve as much progress as in previous years.
The National Chamber of Commerce DIHK has also expressed criticism of recent political developments.
Germany's unemployment has remained at a low level and the budget is almost balanced; even once again, the slow consumption is growing.
However, the decline in GDP in the second quarter has highlighted the vulnerability of exportable Germany for external shocks such as Russia and Ukraine.
GDP decreased by 0.2 per cent over the three months preceding June compared to the previous year.
The weakened performance of Germany threatens to make the ECB's fight against low inflation more difficult and may make it more likely to have quantitative recovery.
Kerber would like the government to "return from public consumption to public investment", for example by focusing on the increases in future consumption in infrastructure and not so on retirement.
In Kerber's view, the Merkel Government will destroy the fruits of his socialist predecessor, Gerhard Schröder, at the beginning of the 21st century, with a rigorous policy.
According to Stefan Heidbreder, the Executive Director of the Stiftung Familienunternehmen Foundation for Family Enterprises, "The situation in Germany remains good compared to other countries.
It is thanks to companies and not to government policies.
The French example of the neighbouring country has shown that the use of funds for social assistance and the restriction of the freedom to manage the company is the wrong way of action.
The leading German investment banker described the situation more explicitly, in saying that recent government decisions are "a disaster".
Germany is threatening to lose everything that it has done so much work to please the voters.
This is my main concern right now," says the banker.
According to Bock, the energy reforms of the new government coalition failed to solve the fundamental weaknesses of policy, which have led to the cost of reducing competitiveness for industry.
At Ashton Kutcher's music festival, when security guards stop accessing the fan
Actor Ashton Kutcher participated in the Stagecoach Cantrimus Festival in Indio, California, where he was reported to have fought with a rigorous security officer.
Ashton Kutcher is reported to be driving a fight with a security guard at the Cantrimus Festival.
Kutcher's fan tried to approach him at the back stage at the Stagecoach Cantrimus Festival in California, after which the situation was robbed, the TMZ site tells us.
Kutcher was in VIP, when a young woman approached her to greet and hand her.
When the star of the Male Series went to say hello to the fan, the super-inspired security officer intervened and caused the wuss.
The actor and the security officer drove into a handcuff, and Kutcher's friends had to intervene to arrest Kutcher, TMZ tells me.
After divorce from his ex-wife Demi Moore, Kutcher dates Mila Kunis, like Kutcher, the stars of the former '70s show.
The Nujakka happened soon after Angus T. Jones was practically removed from the standard hit series actress card after he published a video where he calls the series "shit" and urges the fans not to watch it.
Actor Ashton Kutcher participates in Stagecoach music festivals in California.
Angus T. Jones, "Jake", calls the series "shit" and tells people not to watch.
The Baltic Sea bacterium killed a vacationer.
The bacteria that originated from Caribbean in the popular German tourist destination have affected six people.
One of the patients is in a coma.
Vibrio vulnificus is encountered in parts of the Baltic Sea and other parts of the world, but mostly found in the Gulf of Mexico.
The bacterial is most effective in more than 20 degrees of fracture waters.
"The bacteria can be found anywhere, as long as the conditions are correct", Dr. Heiko Will, Director of the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Health and Security Agency (LAGuS), told the Local magazine.
The bacteria are also found in Denmark, Poland and along the German coast.
According to LAGuS, the patient had been on vacation on the island of Usedom at the end of July.
He died at the beginning of August.
Another pensioner has been in a coma for three weeks, and it is possible that his leg should be amputed.
He went swimming near Ahrenshoop with a small wound on his leg.
The sick man went to the hospital after he noticed on his way home that his feet had become blue.
Physicians found blood poisoning caused by Vibrio vulnificus on their feet.
"My husband would certainly not have spent time in the Baltic Sea if he knew about the danger," said the sick wife Sonja Bruehl to Ostsee Zeitung.
Serious disease and damage caused by the patient and his family would have been avoided if the information had been better available. For example, the destination could have made a release.
LAGuS told the dpa news office that doctors have been asked for the next infection at the beginning of the summer, but no official notification was given.
Cold temperatures have resulted in a lower risk of bacterial disease.
"The test results of the [Maan] showed that the strain of the V. Vulnificus has been significantly reduced," says Dr. Will.
Cool weather has worked.
Vibrio vulnificus, a relative of cholera-induced bacteria, is particularly dangerous in patients with chronic liver disease and impaired immune responses such as HIV or diabetes mellitus and elderly people.
The risk of male disease is greater than that of women, as the oestrogen has been observed to be protected from pathogens.
If you get sick of the bacterial, it causes blood poisoning and sepsis.
The probability of death in the wound is approximately 25% when bacteria are exposed to the wound.
V. Vulnificus may also be ill by eating its contaminated seafoods, although Dr. Will says that in these cases this is not the case.
Containing food from the sea is more common in the southern half of the ball.
In Germany, V. Vulnificus caused poisonings for the previous time in 2010, when two people died there.
Vieno Kekkonen: Breast removal due to cancer suspicion
The 80 - year - old singer Vieno Kekkonen is working and practicing, but has also had to fear for his health.
It is incredible that the radiating Vieno Kekkonen has been filling for 80 years.
He himself is amazed at how all those years of age can suddenly be so many.
I didn't realize I was that old.
It sounds like a lot for 80 years, Vieno Kekkonen laughs.
Its birthday Vieno Kekkone spends her family.
At the end of August, he was organized a birthday party by the National Music and Pensions Association in Karttula, where he lived his childhood.
We were on the stage of Kekkola, where my grandfather was born.
I was so frightened about the party, the birthday hero tells me about the occasion where the three hundred stages measured were full of congratulations.
A few days later, Armi Kuusela was gathered together to greet the life of Vieno Kekkonen, who remembers to follow him when he was young.
And now we're both this age!
Vieno Kekkonen's laughing.
In his long career there are only few sides that Vieno Kekkose has not been seen in public.
One thing he has never spoken publicly before: 2006 he was removed from another chest.
There was a vague finding on my chest at a point that it was decided to completely remove it.
Then, at the end, it wasn't cancer, of course I was happy.
In the same surgery, a new chest was made, so it was a pretty big procedure.
Vieno Kekkonen has not thought that he lost his own chest in a way, because it would have been a difficult position and it cannot be dealt with.
I was just so relieved when there was nothing serious, Vieno Kekkonen tells and points out that the loss of his own breast must be more difficult for the younger.
Read the Vieno Kekkose extensive personal interview as a whole about the day of the evening-Sanom.
I want you to meet the digiley here!
The farmer will be made guilty of the sea condition
The debate on the weaknesses of the Baltic Sea and its connection to Finnish agriculture is depressing.
The voice of experts has been drowned in politically targeted opinions.
In particular, Helsingin sanomamat and Yle during the summer have stretched the responsibility of agriculture for nutrient emissions to the Baltic Sea.
Rapid action has been required to address emissions in the same way.
The average farmer seems to have a few environmental researchers and their help compared to relevant journalists as a superior nutrition expert.
The farmer knows that nutrients can not come from farming if the crop is sown with the same amount of nutrients that are harvested with the crop.
In Finland almost all farms are committed to the environmental programme.
It strictly limits the use of fertilizers and requires accurate monitoring and reporting of the nutrient balance.
The authorities shall monitor compliance with the conditions.
Nutrients stored in the field have also been rinsed into waters since fertilisation restrictions, but this has also seen for years a clear reduction in emissions.
Farmers are willing and prepared to continue working to reduce nutrient emissions.
However, everyone should understand that access to the zero level is impossible.
"If we want to have approximately the amount of agricultural production equivalent to consumption, it is only acceptable that this is the case," says Jyrki Akkula (MT 29.8.), Director of the MTT Environmental Research.
During the last summer, the Gulf of Finland was brought by a number of blue populations.
Researchers were quite unanimous that the rest received its growth power from the sea’s own phosphorus stocks.
The phosphorus stored on the bottom of the sea is partly departed from the farming of the past decades of the coastal States, but it alone does not explain stocks.
The waste water was cleaned by the growing cities of the Baltic Sea until the end of the 19th century.
The problem was also the waste waters of Great Helsinki, and they were not seen as a problem but as a problem with the pollution of their own beaches.
Coastal pollution was prevented by building a waste water pipe to the open sea in the 1980s.
Of course, the quality of water controlled there has improved over the years.
Nutrients that have ended in the sea during the time will not leave it even if agriculture would be completely discontinued from Finland.
Yet, every summer's blue-blue debate and charges are always against agriculture today.
The public debate marks the farmer guilty of the situation in the Baltic Sea.
The accusation is unreasonable, but it becomes increasingly difficult when it is used to implement political passion.
The Greens will lead their President, Minister of the Environment Ville Niinistö, to major changes in the environmental standards of agriculture.
As a propulsion board, Nigistö has used a summer rest discussion.
Societies have very much accused producers of the MTK of old stocks and regarded it as the most difficult obstacle to water protection.
Some boundaries should also be on political rhetoric.
Most of the specific projects for water protection are based specifically on cooperation between MTK, farmers and environmental administrations.
The assaulting style of the soil serves more the fishing of the city’s green voices than water protection.
That's probably the point.
Tough speeches, the Greens are preparing to leave the government.
In policy changes, the MTK is responsible for ensuring the performance of its members.
It is difficult to trade expensive changes for farmers unless a substitute is found for their costs.
The only money that Ville Niinistö has presented is the cuts from other agricultural funds.
The abolition of the mining tax isn't going through Palmer.
The latest attempt by the Abbot government to throw a mining tax into the trash basket seems to be destroyed, because Clive Palmer has declared that his senators will reject it without any changes.
The Australian Workers' Party also fears that the Government has included in the new initiative a rule which could limit employers' increases to compulsory pension payments up to 2034.
The government took advantage of a qualified majority in the House's subsidy on Monday in order to rush through the revocation process in the power of general confusion and to the workforce's political party's clear distraction.
It put the original revocation initiative on which the Senate had previously made significant changes and replaced the new legislative proposal, which it described, above all, relates to taxes, pension payments, social security and family social assistance.
It was originally an initiative aimed at abolishing the "incompetent" mining tax and other decisions, such as low-income pension fees (savings of USD 3.6 billion), income support bonus (1.3 billion) and the bonus for school-age children (4.7 billion dollars).
Clive Palmer, head of the Palmer United Party (PUP), did not accept the transfer of the government.
"A well-planned mining tax withdrawal initiative will not be accepted in the Senate without a low-income pension fee, a bonus for earnings, and a bonus for school-age children," he twiitad.
The government needs support for independent parties such as the PUP to ensure that the Workers' Party and the Greens do not oppose the initiative in the Senate.
Minister of Finance, Chris Bowen, accused the government of attempting to remove Parliament's power to decide on the compulsory guarantee of pension payments, giving the Minister of Finance all the powers of decision.
"This is unprecedented," he said to journalists in Canberra.
In this way, the government could delay other increases, whereby the objective of the 12% pension guarantee amount of the Workers' Party would move up to 2034.
"It is unacceptable in any way, and, of course, the Workers' Party will be opposed by all means," says Bowen.
The guarantee is now 9.5%, but the government wants to give the Minister of Finance the power to decide to stop future additions.
The man's body was found on the Brighton beach.
Sussex's cops picked up an unidentified man's body before the afternoon, and the police closed the area close to the beginning of Volk's Electric Railway.
The police and the coroner are working to find out what conditions the body was put on the beach.
The man hasn't been identified yet.
Scientists will review the list of missing persons to determine whether missing persons are connected to the body.
The police were still unable to confirm whether death occurred under suspicious circumstances.
According to the Mexican police, an accidental explosion at the border is one victim of death.
According to the police of Piedras Negras, apparently an accidental explosion at the customs building at the borders of Mexico and the United States caused the death of one woman and the injury of five others.
Felix Alberto Lopez Arenas is an operational leader of the local police in the town of Texas border.
He told the Associated Press News Office that a woman who died at the Sunday explosion had skull damage and five other injuries.
According to Lopez Arenas, the explosion occurred in the morning in the nights spent by customs officials.
The cause of the explosion is currently being investigated, but the authorities believe that the explosion was caused by the accumulation of gases.
The explosion didn't affect border guards.
Three Atlantic City casinos close in September
Three Atlantic City casinos close their doors this month
Male customer plays at the Showboat casino to close its doors, Atlantic City, N.J., 29.7.2014
Since September, a difficult month is expected for Atlantic City when three casinos share their last cards on the table
Three casinos close their doors this month in Atlantic City in New Jersey, which means that this neon-lighted metropolitan, known from the wallet of money machines, can no longer count to the payout.
More than 5 000 employees are unemployed when the showboat and Revel casinos closed this weekend, the Associated Press News Office told me.
There will be more unemployed when Trump Plaza turns off its light.
The expected closure of the three casinos, one of which had only been able to operate for two years, is the most recent disaster in the city after the end of the story of the Atlantic Club only eight months earlier.
By the end of September, more than 25% of the casino workers in the city, 8 000 people, will be unemployed, New York Times writes.
When gambling was allowed in New Jersey in 1976, the casinos were advertised as a sure choice for the poor economy in Atlantic City, the AP News Office writes.
However, the local gambling industry has gained a lot more competitors when the casinos in New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania are divided by a large proportion of such huge casinos once in Atlantic City.
Even if Massachusetts had been opposed to gambling, he will look at his own share of the amount of money by welcomed three casinos to the state.
TVO: The new schedule of Areva is difficult to accept
According to the Industrial Power (TVO), it is difficult to accept the new estimate of the plant supplier Areva, according to which the Olkiluodo 3 reactor is available for commercial use only 2018.
According to Jouni Silvennoise, the director of the power plant project, this is due, among other things, to the fact that the construction works are already largely ready and the number of work in the mid-term is known.
TVO will continue to evaluate the information received from Areva.
In the Notice, Silvennoinen notes that TVO welcomes all initiatives to speed up the project.
Areva submitted today to TVO the updated schedule of Olkiluoto 3 according to which the three-reactor construction work will be completed in mid-2016 and commercial activity could begin in 2018.
According to the Areva Communication, the recent delays in the project were mainly due to the approval of the reactor automatic systems received in April.
This was the past four years of negotiations with the TVO.
Olkiluoto 3 was initially to be completed already in 2009, but the timetable has been postponed once and for all.
TVO and Areva have been arguing for years about which one is responsible for delay.
Debates in the arbitration court where Areva has demanded compensation of EUR 2.7 billion from TVO.
On the other hand, TVO considers Areva's requirements to be unfounded and demands about EUR 1.8 billion from the company.
Cooperation in the energy and water sectors is needed in the face of global challenges
Today, international leaders met in Stockholm within the 24th international water week, and they called on energy and water players to work together to meet the greatest challenges of our time to ensure that water and energy production continues to grow.
The theme of the 2014 Water Week is Energy and Water.
Water and energy are very often dependent on each other.
Energy is needed for pumping, preserving, transporting and cleaning water, and water is needed for almost all energy production.
If one of these increases or decreases, it will immediately affect the other.
These two resources are also an integral part of sustainable development, and they must always be borne in mind when making global decisions.
Torgny Holmgren, CEO of the Water Week in Stockholm International Water Institute, said at the opening of the Water Week, "the challenges are huge".
Global water consumption is expected to increase by 55% between 2000 and 2050 and energy consumption is expected to increase by 50% over the next two decades, and therefore urgently closer cooperation is needed between energy and water operators to find solutions that enable all world peoples to flourish.
This year's water award, Professor John Briscoe described the water as a possible basis for growth, which needs both society as a whole and other sectors. Briscoe said that "the developing countries face major challenges.
They need to mobilise these funds.
Briscoe added that there is no permanent solution to the [water crisis] anywhere.
Instead, there are challenges and solutions that form a circle.
Representatives will discuss over a week the ongoing and future work and cooperation of energy and water operators during more than 100 seminars, workshops and events.
Professor John Briscoe, originally from South Africa, receives the Stockholm Water Prize from His Majesty King Charles XVI from Sweden, in the ceremony held in the Stockholm City Hall on Thursday 4 September.
The Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI) is a research centre that provides research information and information to decision-makers in order to make reasonable decisions for water and sustainable development.
Flying dead foreign bodies home in Miami: Expenditure on the flight of bodies
The ferry transported 23 Cuban refugees to Miami in October 2012 fell, and 14 people were reported to be dead.
The same has happened to hundreds of people before, and this is certainly not the last of their quality.
Every year, more than 1 000 Mid-American migrants die in attempting illegally to cross the United States border.
Because of the first city, we're ready to die.
However, it is ironic that, after reaching the first city in the country, few plan to stay there until their last breath.
For many, this city is a temporary place of residence: either asylum, a port of effort upwards or a place of time waiting for a better opportunity.
Few people think they're gonna die there, and when they approach death, many are planning to return to their homeland.
In the popular cities of migrants, a relatively large number of foreign-born and temporary residents reside, and death and return to the country continue to work.
Approximately 20 per cent of the bodies of the dead in South Florida are flyed elsewhere. The number is more than any other in the United States.
Most of the human remains (HR, a short form of professional slang of words, human residues) are flyed to the country of residence at the international airport in Miami.
Since 1964, according to Pierson, the largest company in the sector, the Managing Director, about 80% of this transport travels abroad. The company flys bodies to several destinations in Central and South America and to several European countries.

The more migrants move into popular cities, the more they die there.
Even after death, there's a cost at home.
Miami is the main airport of the American Airlines airline for Latin American flights, and the figures of the table describe the human residues flying back to the airline's homeland in 2013.
The return of the bodies to the country is not cheap: prices can vary from five to thousands of dollars.
Religious, cultural and general health requirements related to the flying and delivery of human residues also vary.
Migration communities in the popular cities of migration sometimes organise funeral communities to help with costs, as the return of bodies is expensive, the government does not help the process and the dead are often young people who have no insurance.
A few credit institutions and non-formal health insurance programmes have been born of such communities founded by Italian, Jewish and Greek residents in New York – the first groups of migrants in the United States.
The new generations of Mexican, Chinese, Phillipin and bangladesian migrants now work in many of their favorite cities.

Death abroad always causes difficulties, as few immigrants are planning to make their last resting town.
For example, in Dubai without the will of the dead foreigners will be subject to the Sharia Act, even if the laws on the recovery of the dead country were different.
The entire assets of the dead shall be frozen and then distributed in accordance with the decision of the Sharia Court.
A network transporting human remains of Aer Lingus, which considers Dublin to be central (
2013) the scope reflects the multicultural demographic structure of the city and the Irish.
The airline interrupted the service, but started it again in 2004 after receiving negative feedback from migrants.
The idea of death is rarely present when a person travels through the city that is popular by migrants or when he lives there.
On the contrary — temporary or permanent migration to the city of migration is an open declaration of a migrant’s way to watch life, not death.
Death in a foreign country, however, means making the immigrant the most powerful and irrevocable decisions — decisions whether to belong to the local or global community, to the universe or to the country, to short-term or to eternity.
The Centre and the Left Association make an issue of inequality
The opposition parties and the left-wing union intend to raise to the government an intermediate question of low-income earnings and the increase of inequality.
The parties want to raise the debate on people's livestock problems that are undermined by poor economic development and worsening unemployment.
The growing inequalities are also seen between the different parts of the country and within the large cities, the parties in their communication.
In the next year's budget, the government's cuts and tax increases, according to the parties, are affected by small incomes such as students, unemployed and pensioners, family and ordinary work while, among other things, food, medicines and housing continues to grow.
In fact, almost half a million people are already unemployed, the parties say in their communication.
The income problems of the workforce have also been worsened.
The Parliamentary Groups of Central and Left League will discuss this on Thursday.
The third opposition party's basic Finns have already announced to leave an interim question of police and internal security resources.
The session of the Parliament's sympathy begins tomorrow on Tuesday.
The West Indian Day of New York City starts soon.
Caribbean culture is once again in New York City, where the West Indian Day parade is one of the biggest outdoor events of the year, and there also politicians see each other and will be seen.
The annual parade will be held on Monday in Brooklyn.
It gives rise to the celebrations of the traditional fasting times pre-past carnivals, and part of it are dancers who carry complex, often made of feathers.
The president of the Brooklyn region, Eric Adams, is a festival champion this year, but there are also many other known faces of politics.
Parade is an excellent opportunity for politicians who are currently and candidates to welcome the public a week before the pre-election.
Despite the celebrations, the parade weekend has also been involved in violence in previous years.
The police have said that they are trying to keep the event safe by means of additional measures, including by monitoring the activities of the nearby gangs.
Is it worth even asking rhetoric questions?
Everyone knows the rhetorical questions, right?
You shouldn't answer that question.
This language image, i.e. a question that is not expected to be answered, but which suggests in the direction of a particular answer, tastes both high-flight speeches and more everyday expressions.
The early words of the prosecution of Ciceron's famous Catilina are a chain of rhetoric questions, of which the first is "How long are you going to take advantage of our patience, Oi Catilina?"
The same applies to my wife's lately asked questions: "Why do you think I should not warm children five days old chicken?"
Why are you so tense?
The difference is a better word for the rhetoric question.
The power of the Retorical question lies in the fact that the issue is open and the public will be persuaded to accept the question.
A conscientious rhetoric question makes it clear that no one in full sense could agree with it.
In the 18th century, the author of the author of the material book described the question of the retorical question, "to some of the words shown, which are admirable to produce a strong feeling of truth about something, and at the same time their challenge is impossible to disagree."
Skills to bend
Retorical questions can be raised afterwards if you want to achieve more ambitious objectives.
A number of subsequent retourical questions, designed to express grief or irritation, are called epiplex.
For example, Job uses them when he appeals to the Almighty: "What will you benefit from to oppress me -- ?
Do you have the same eyes as us?
Do you see the same way that a person sees?
The chains of retorical questions can also be found in my wife's comments: "Why did you cause children food poisoning?
Are you crazy?
Can't you do anything right?
In addition, there is a hypophora, which is the case when a question is asked and answered immediately.
Isaac Hayes provides an excellent example of this: "Who is the black private egg that is a sex horror for all women?
Bitch!
That's right!
Who would sacrifice his life for his brother?
More examples from my wife: "What is the only food that children have eaten and where have they become ill?"
This chicken.
Who the idiot fed it to them?
You.
Strangely, the rhetoric question does not usually seek to persuade, even though retourism means bending skills.
If you try to talk about someone around, instead of trying to preach to those who have already been turned, or you'd be confusing about someone's selfishness, you should use the rhetoric questions to spare.
They are more useful in trying to reconcile opinions than in trying to get one to accept his own opinion.
If the public agrees with the argument "I am not comfortable when it's so sunshine out?", the rhetoric question shows that the speaker is sure of his claim, which is better bound by the speaker and the public.
However, this will only happen if the speaker is sure that there are no different opinions.
Suppose that consensus has been reached, rather than consensus, the speaker may appear, well, self-esteem.
In other situations, the retorical question refers to the weakness of argumentation.
In the headlines of the newspapers, the retorical question is too often the strongest possible argument in a very weak case: "Do aliens develop pyramids?"
In both cases, there is a risk that the question can lead to a response which differs from the suggested answer.
"Are you thinking the same as us?" was a risky campaign clause for the British Conservative Party in the general elections in 2005.
The party's gone.
Some of the findings of such cases have become a hobby, and the QTWAIN questions (the concept of Questions To Which Answer Is No, which is not the answer) are popular.
A few years ago, a friend of mine arranged a competition that looked for the best examples.
The contest was clearly won by the song “Do You Wanna Be In My Gang”, which was sang by pop star Gary Glitter before he became a child's sexual exploiter.
The author has also written the book You Talkin' to Me?
Researcher: The time for the federal state compromise may be over
At the beginning of the conflict in many countries it was still thought that the federal government could be some kind of compromise in the conflict, Saari says.
The Russian President, Vladimir Putin, earlier in the Russian channel interview, said that peace in Eastern Ukraine would require discussions on the state station in the region.
In practice, this would mean some sort of self-government in Eastern Ukraine.
Putin said it would protect the legal rights of those living in the east.
According to Saare, Ukraine's transformation into a federal state is a certain priority for the objectives pursued by Russia.
Ukraine is surely rightly doubting that Russia would thus seek to influence the internal policy of Ukraine, he says.
If the federal solution is not available, the second option from Russia could be a frozen conflict where Russia would effectively control Luhansk and Donetsk, Saari would assess.
The West and Ukraine have accused Russia of sending both weapons and soldiers to the east.
Russia has argued that, for example, the Russian-spirited rebels themselves have said that they have fought "locational, voluntary Russian soldiers".
Head of Upi: Kataiselle's chart for an influential task
The brick reminds me that the job is new and still depicting.
He believes that the idea is that Katainen would coordinate or even lead to the work of the Commission on matters related to competitiveness and employment.
One of the priorities of the Commission's new period's programme is, of course, the competitiveness and employment of the Union.
That is how we are at the heart of the Commission's power, Tiilikainen says.
The Brick believes that the background, economic skills and role of Katai during the economic crisis will give him the opportunity to play a good role within the Commission.
According to the plan, it would be a portfolio-free task, i.e. Katai would not be under his authority to the Directorate-General.
Instead, Katai would be a teamman in the EU's competitiveness and employment field, so that he could have other portfolios related to the sector, in addition to the economic Commissioner's portfolio, to be coordinated.
In practice, management of the team could mean planning and guidance, for example.
Military mothers: up to 15 000 Russian soldiers in Ukraine
According to the Russian Military Mothers Organization, up to 15 000 Russian soldiers have been sent to Ukraine in the past two months, and more than 7,000 Russian soldiers are currently in the country.
According to human rights organisations, at least 200 Russian soldiers have died.
According to the organisation, the hospital of the city of Rostov, close to the border of Ukraine, is wounded in the Ukrainian war.
The soldiers' mothers collect their information from the soldiers' families.
The Nato Military Union has estimated that in Ukraine there are more than a thousand Russian soldiers.
BB-Andte of his alcoholic use: "There's a case after a little drink."
Big Brother Jussi and Andte drove on Monday night to think about the life of the BB house.
On the basement side of the basement, Jussi was on the Monday night with the Kartano residents, sneaking around with the Andes.
The twins were wondering how their actions seem to the view of the program viewers.
Not until he saw the road, Andte said.
Ifsin thinks most of the time in the BB house is waiting and spending time.
Any celebration or assignments form only a break-in part of the BB-house's life.
It is more than expected, wondered, and talked, and living.
Andte, Anne and Jussi.
On Wednesday, the people of Kartano spent the evening in wet marks, and in particular, the alcohol got onto Andte’s phone.
Jussi's intelligence from Andte whether the party had made a man more sense in the house of his life now that he had been able to talk to them in a small hippo.
I'll have a little drink, and then there'll be a case, Andte admitted.
Look at the Andte interview from the ISTV video!
Let Abreu expose his body enthusiasm in our women
Let Abreu tells us in our Women's magazine that he decided to lose weight two years ago when he stayed at the show.
That's when Anna, who was tired of the show, thought she was getting more energy with weight loss.
Fred Montana / Splash News
Let me dream about a body like Victoria's Secret a few years ago.
My body gem was a Victoria's Secret model.
I wanted to look good, and I thought I wanted to lose weight, and Anna's gonna tell the paper.
Anna, who presents his trained body with the job and music videos, says that he is not a celebrity teacher, even though he has been named that.
Viena Kyttöjoki
In Timm's condition, let him practice at the gym and do boxing.
The visible muscles are not important to me, but the fact that I can raise a certain amount of weight in the gym, Anna points out.
Sometimes the pop star allows himself to taste.
If I do, I really do.
Sometimes I'm pulling the unhealthy guys, and I don't know if there's more pounds.
Instead, I'm wondering what my body's thinking.
I'm disgusted if I do something bad to my body.

Anna says she likes her body.
Entrepreneurship is favourable to shareholders but does not increase growth
Did Australia’s stock exchange companies today simply seek to please a large group by agreeing to the shareholders’ wishes for greater profit distribution and buying back their shares?
Is the decision-making power to move from governments of companies to shareholders that the government serves?
The distribution of profits is most important, it was shown last week at the end of the reporting period 2014.
The prices of shares in companies that have rewarded investors in the form of repurchase programmes and by more profit sharing have risen clearly.
And there's nothing wrong with that.
However, the reverse side of the coin is that capital consumption is reduced faster than the analysts have predicted. This fact leads many to questions whether the popularity of the short term is overweighted and whether it is adequately focused on the growth in the near future and for a long time.
Some companies, of course, return money to shareholders and finance business by other means.
For example, more funding will be acquired from cheap stock markets.
From the point of view of the company, this is reasonable, because the loan is currently cheap, while there is no capital.
However, even if the funds acquired from the loan market are not taken into account, it is clear that openness to shareholders is financed above all by using less money to invest.
The net result of the wave of these purchase programmes (and the cancellation of profits investment plans) is a decrease in capital on the Australian market.
Credit Suisse calls for this reporting period 'capital deduction period', during which firms have made every effort to keep the amount of shares low.
As part of the same plan, companies still have less capital.
At the end of the reporting period, the value of the repurchase programmes was EUR 3.7 billion and the value of the expected unfulfilled capital procurement programmes was EUR 1.5 billion.
Credit Suisse has gone so far that it considers capital consumption as a chrysan in one of its reports.
Although we now have figures that confirm that such a trend exists, non-formal evidence has existed for months.
Glenn Stevens, the director of the Australian Central Bank, considered it sufficient to point out a few weeks ago that companies need a little more "fighting spirit" to increase their investment.
Stevens is not concerned about the prospects of individual companies, but about the overall impact on the economy, as slow capital consumption usually leads to negative consequences for economic growth and employment.
Credit Suisse says that "reporting companies' own estimates of their capital consumption have decreased by 4% over the previous two years on average.
On average, estimates of the amounts of free cash flow have risen by 2 per cent.
Improved cash flow is likely to increase capital consumption.
This fast view seems good from the point of view of the current shareholders and the stock market, but it is also some evidence of corporate obedience.
If I could get a coin every time the CEO has said that the short-term price of the share is not important, I would be... well, the end of the sentence is easy to guess.
Of course, this argument is not correct.
The Managing Directors are very closely following the prices of shares and are very concerned about price variations.
The short and long-term bonus packages of the managers are determined by the value of the shares and the position of the managers depends on it.
The CEOs would like to say that some decisions (whether they were business transactions, increased investment in the organisation or distribution of profits) are not always immediately popular, but are useful for the medium-term strategy.
In fact, business leaders often complain about the fact that there is a very short-sighted approach in the investment market.
Therefore, the current conservative stack of conservativeness seems to be admissible for the short-term objectives.
Those who assess the cheap share market and support capital savings are of no concern, but during the final reporting period it was too clear that the weight was in reducing the consumption of future capital and the most sustainable companies were welcomed.
Large mining companies, such as BHP and Rio Tinto, held the first in reducing the consumption of capital, but many other companies also acted the same – part of the compulsion and part of the fear of the reaction of shareholders.
Then why do investors pressure companies to share profits?
According to Hasan Tevfik, Credit Suisse's strategy, it is clear that the shareholders want more income, since the profits of other traditional fixed-term investment products have declined when the central banks have suddenly lowered interest rates worldwide to bring more money on the market.
In this way, investors have been forced to seek profits on the capital market and, on the other hand, pushing companies to share more profits.
The shareholders have also made it quite clear to companies that they are not willing to invest in high-risk companies with uncertain profit distribution.
Investors would prefer the money at the same time as more and more investors approach the pension age.
The statistics for the previous reporting period clearly show that the distribution of profits had a great impact on the cost cuts of companies and not on the increase in turnover.
Public naked film leakage cases seem to be data-surgery or e-mail account breaking
Jennifer Lawrence's photos and some sources suggest that an unknown hacker who leaked videos on the Internet wonders about information security experts and Apple.
Although the hacker has published lists of women's publicity persons in a chatroom and said that he has more pictures of women, some of the ones described have reported that their images were forged, while others have said that they were pictures removed a long time ago.
There is a lot of pictures, and there is a number of people called Jennifer Lawrence, Jenny McCarthy, Rihanna, Kate Upton and American actress Mary E Winstead.
After the hacking, the biggest question is what was done through the attack.
And were the pictures and videos real and where they were downloaded?
The main source of the news for images – a disgraceful and thorough attack on Apple's iCloud service – is unlikely to be the most likely option.
Large companies such as Apple have invested in inside-house information security teams to try to infiltrate the company’s own systems regularly.
"The hacking of a large scale for Apple's iCloud service is unlikely.
Furthermore, the original publisher does not claim that the claim is correct", observes Mr Ferguson, Vice-President of the Trend Micro Information Security Research Unit.
A simpler and more probable explanation for these hackers (and every day for hacks for less famous people) is the e-mail address and password leakage, either by guessing or by crawling information, i.e. by deceiving a person to sign in with their information on a true-looking site and then using these data against them.
Apple will continue to examine the alleged attack on the iCloud service used in iPhone phones to store the settings and, above all, to recoup the images when they are transferred to the cloud server.
The user's account can be registered in the iCloud service by giving this email address and password, and then their images and other information can be downloaded from the account.
This can only be prevented if the account owner has introduced a two-step identification ("two factor authentication", 2FA), i.e. an additional protection against intrusion to the account, where the owner's mobile phone is sent a code before the account can be entered.
However, relatively few are using 2FA properties either because it is not known or because it is considered difficult.
Apple will continue to examine whether all the information is from its iCloud service, and if so, how widely the user accounts were invaded.
The company has not delivered an opinion on the matter at the time of publication of the original version of this text.
Ferguson considers it possible that the hacker has used the "You Forgot Password" link in Apple's iCloud service by first collecting e-mail addresses for persons, for example, from the address book of another hacked device.
It is also possible that the celebrities have used the same password in several services, when the passwords were kidnapped through them.
The publisher of Lawrence's photos claims that the pictures are real, but they won't tell us when they're taken.
Winstead said in his tweet that this could be a long-term hacking company.
These photos were removed a long time ago, so I can only imagine how long this took a creepy effort.
I feel compassion for all those who have been hacked," he wrote in his tweet.
However, an independent IT expert, Graham Cluley, pointed out that Winstead may have thought that he had removed the pictures of his mobile phone, but the removal of the image from the modern smartphone does not always mean that there are no copies of the picture.
Today's smartphones regularly store photos to the cloud service because they often do not have room for a large number of photos taken by the user.
Apple's iPhone's standard set is to save images to iCloud; Google Android uses the Google+ service and Microsoft's Windows phones to store images for OneDrive.
Individual service providers, such as Dropbox, offer automatic image and data storage services.
"The people take and remove pictures, but they don't understand that the pictures are downloaded from the account," says Cluley to The Guardian.
Ferguson agrees: "Absent does not always mean abolished," he says.
Photos and videos can be kept for years.
If someone accesses the user's email address and password, he can reload all the images and videos that have been sent by email.
Photos from Apple's service can be downloaded to Mac, Windows PC or any Apple device.
The hacker published a screenshot that was alleged to display videos and images that were currently not published on the Windows PC.
Two-step identification protects from such hackers because it requires all who are trying to copy an existing account to another device to provide the original user's device, usually the code sent to the mobile phone.
Without the code, access to the account will be prevented.
Both Apple, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo offer two-step identification to the account, but it is not yet known whether these public persons used the service or how many of them used it.
Some have said that the pictures they claim to be are not real.
Ariana Grande's representative has said that the pictures in which Grande is supposed to be, are "fullly counterfeit."
Victoria Justice wrote in his tweet: "I think the naked images taken are DEFINITIONS, don't you understand?
Let me break the roots from the rumors right into the beginning.
Cluley will bring out another option.
Because the people of the public were targeted by hacking, someone who could break into their accounts who managed their social media accounts or regularly handled their e-mails.
"I'd like to know if the actors' agencies or any representative have a part to do this," he's wondering.
However, these publicity persons do not use one publisher or agency.
Another option is that someone who installed a security attack on the victim of one or more systems or helped it to configure and secretly changed the system so that all information could be returned.
This was the case in the case of a florist Christopher Chaney named "Hollywood Hacker", where the hacker distributed photos from the e-mail accounts of Scarlett Johansson and Mila Kunis in 2011 and sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment in December 2012.
Chaney was accused of intrusion into the e-mail accounts of more than 50 people in the entertainment industry between November 2010 and October 2011. In one case, he asked Aguilera to take pictures of the star in the name of this stylist as a small suit, and then published photos online.
Chaney later apologized, saying that his actions were definitely one of the worst insults of privacy that you can imagine.
Chaney was also claimed to be spying on the network for more than ten years.
According to Cluley, "In the case of Chaney, they broke into the stars' e-mail accounts, and they were changed so that someone sent their information forward even after they changed their password."
Cluley says that the obsessive action of hackers breaking into these accounts "memorizes the gathering of butterflies."
They just want to collect this kind of information.
In this case, it is possible that someone had encountered a list of information and access data in these accounts in services such as Dropbox.
Hackers have also been able to try to intrude for a long time
or they had access to information from an email account, such as the address book, and then fished for information from other persons.
I don't think it's a simple iCloud security hole.
Australia has offered its intelligence service to help the UN track 44 peacekeepers who were kidnapped by Al-Qaida terrorists in Syria.
The terrorist group Jabhat al-Nusra is believed to be imprisoned by 44 Fiji peacekeepers, and this terrorist group captured a crossing position in the Golan hills last week and forced the United Nations troops to surrender.
Peacekeepers have been missing since Wednesday, and there is no record of where they are.
Ministers, including Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, taking part in the UN Conference of Small Developing Islands, are very concerned about what has happened.
Bishop discussed the situation with the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon at the summit and has offered Australia's help to rescue the missing peacekeepers.
"I am convinced that Australia will help the United Nations in everything possible by providing intelligence assistance," he said to the AAP news service from Samoa on Monday.
We're very close to all the teams and friends of the intelligence network -- to ensure that we can track them down and that they're safe.
Bishop has already convinced the Fiji Prime Minister, Frank Bainimarama and the Foreign Minister, Ratu Inoke Kubuabola, that Australia will use its position at the UN Security Council to monitor the situation.
At the same time, the Filipino Peacekeeper group held prisoners in its armies was reported to have escaped from the different parts of the same controversial area.
The United Nations has been monitoring the Golan hills since the ceasefire of Syria and Israel in 1974.
The cheaters are trying to steal your money through a carbon tax eradication initiative, warns the Australian Competition Authority ACCC
The cheaters use the carbon tax withdrawal initiative to steal money, the ACCC warns.
The Competition Authority SCAMwatch has warned consumers and businesses not to rely on too good offers from government agencies that offer thousands of dollars of credit.
Fakeholders may use the figures seen in the media to prove to the consumer how much he can save goods after the carbon tax has been cancelled and offering it up to $7,000, the warning says.
Fakeers may sound very convincing because they have examined the personal information they use in trying to obtain bank information or trying to get the victim to pay the reward.
They're discussing topical topics to cheat on the victim.
They're using non-carbon tax fraud to access money, and their stories are more advanced, and they're using topical things to build a fraud around them.
Also, a plane lost on the flight of Malaysia Airlines, MH370, and Robin Williams' death, have encouraged frauds.
The ACCC instructs the company to contact the company in the form of contact information, rather than the contact information provided by the caller, if there is little doubt about the identity of the caller representing the company.
If you receive an unexpected call or an e-mail from someone who claims to represent the government’s agency or company, such as the energy company, and according to which you are entitled to compensation for the cancellation of the carbon tax, be careful.
If you believe you've been deceived and given personal information or transferred money to a fraudulent account, contact your bank immediately.
If the offer sounds too good to be true, for example, free money shared by the government, it is likely.
Economic statements: Lipponen blames the EU's Russian sanctions
The former Prime Minister, Paavo Lipponen, criticises the sanctions imposed on Russia by the EU in the interview of economic statements.
Russia's policy priorities are to drive its own interests.
This does not necessarily work," says Lipponen in the interview.
Lipponen has begun work as an investigator for business in the Arctic regions of the Central Economic Union of the EC.
He is concerned that the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, EBRD and the European Investment Bank, as part of the EU's economic sanctions, interrupted its project funding in Russia.
"This means, for example, that the environmental projects of the Northern Dimension, which have clear visibility, go into ice," says Lipponen in the interview.
The freezing of funding now impairs cooperation, which Lippose says that it may be difficult to rebuild if there is no trust.
However, he believes that the interest of Finnish companies in cooperation projects in the Ice Sea region continues to be as large as before.
He is currently presenting an explanation to the EC of the Arctic policy and the opportunities of companies in Finland in the north.
It does not affect the acute situation in Ukraine or the situation in Russia.
We're looking forward, talking about tens of years," he says.
It is rare that the elephant comes to low water or close to the facility, says nature pedagogi Vesa Heinonen at the lecture center of the museum in the Nordic region.
In the Vaasa Suvilahde, today, the elbow swiming near the beach was seen on Sunday.
According to Heinos, the elbow is likely to come after Suvilahte’s food.
It's not messed up.
This means there's fish in the area, Heinonen's tip.
According to him, the Sundom Bridge, for example, is seen especially in spring and autumn Norps, who arrive specifically after fish.
Norppa, however, is not a common species in the Vaasa Sea Region.
The payer sees an elephant in the villas, he continues.
Norppia lives, among other things, in the Period and the Sea of Saaristo.
According to the South Austrian Court, the murdered pizza owner Robert Vallelonga acted aggressively and violently outside the nightclub
Murdered South Australian pizza owner Robert Vallelonga.
In the hearing of the court, it has been discovered that pizza owner Robert Vallelonga was acting aggressively against both his partner and security only minutes before he was killed outside the nightclub.
At the lower court of Adelaide, the lawyers accused of killing Vallelonga asked for his client to be released against the guarantees, because it was "selfly" self-defense.
Marie Shaw, QC, said that the case is not serious enough to keep his client, whose identity has not been published, in the back of prison until the trial.
"The evidence shows that the dead were acting so aggressive that he had to be removed from the nightclub," he said.
After that, it started with a twist, which led to the 40-year-old drunk man -- tore the security's shirt.
It is important to note that, according to the prosecutor, death caused one hit, which clearly refers to self-defense or defence.
A 25-year-old man is being accused of murder until now.
Vallelonga, 44, was found unconscious near the Rundle St and Synagogue Place crossing about 2,25 p.m. on May 4.
He died of his injuries at the royal Adelaide hospital early the next day. Friends and Pizzeria's clients were mourning the "local legend of One Tree Hill".
According to the prosecutors, there was no reason for the murdered, and after the case, he had said to the taxi driver, "he went to bed with someone for a few days."
But the video footage of the security camera now proves something else, Shaw says.
"It confirms that the dead acted aggressively -- his partner tried to calm him down and got himself part of the hard and violent behaviour," he says.
Our client has both the suspicion of innocence and the evidence that he defended himself, which will be mentioned in the trial.
The prosecutors opposed the release of the man because only one of the three security officers in the night of the crash had been missing Vallelonga's behavior.
According to them, the other security officers did not consider him to be threatened because he was short, and he used the vocabulary of the great man because he wanted to avoid physical confrontation.
They also said that a taxi driver clearly saw the case would prove that Vallelonga was beaten "powerfully" and that he had no chance to defend himself.
Judge Elizabeth Sheppard ordered a man to be arrested until the next week, when he would declare his decision.
The controversial dolphin hunt began in Japan as a tradition - foreign news - evening words
A bad weather was expected to be postponed in a world of largely deplorable hunting.
In the Japanese Taij city, the annual hunting season of dolphins began again on Monday.
It is expected to last until the end of February.
For example, the British newspaper Guardian reports a great opposition to the hunts that have been involved all over the world.
In Jahd, hunters drive hundreds of dolphins to a remote slope, where mammals are slaughtered after being chosen among them to transport the most suitable individuals to delfinaries and theme parks around the world.
Delfin's meat also ends up in food.
According to local authorities, however, it was expected to start hunting due to a delayed weather.
Information on the practice spread to the world with the 2009 The Cove documentary film on the subject.
During previous hunting periods, and not only animal protection but also diplomats have criticised hunting.
According to the opponents, dolphin meat in any case have limited markets due to its high mercury content.
It is a tradition, according to those defending hunting, including the Japanese government.
Defenses have also reminded us that dolphins are not endangered.
Delfin hunting was resisted during the weekend by demonstrations in several countries.
In Tokyo, the Protestants said that the hunt damages Japan’s reputation in the world.
In Helsinki, too, a demonstration was held on Monday in front of the Japanese embassy.
Some of the NATO Member States are uncertain about investing new troops in Eastern Europe
The military union within NATO is divided into the view of whether NATO bases should be set up in Eastern Europe and the Baltic as a response to the Ukraine crisis, reports Financial Times.
Poland and Estonia have asked the military alliance to bring permanent troops to their countries, but Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has been against the plan.
"Ukraine has given a new perspective on Russia's policy and threatens to destroy European security," told Michael Clarke Financial Times, director of the Royal United Services Institute of London.
The NATO Member States will be gathered in the beginning of the week and the military union will have to publish its new preparedness plan.
The key issue of the plan is whether NATO can infringe the TAE agreement on conventional weapons signed in 1990.
The NATO and Warsaw Association agreed on how they put armed forces in the Atlantic and Uralvuor area.
In practice, the agreement prevents new military bases in Eastern Europe and the Baltic.
Russia freeze its participation in the agreement in 2007, but the country did not actually withdraw the agreement.
In view of the tightening situation in Ukraine, NATO will consider whether the terms of the agreement still need to be complied with.
"Nato's resources must be available in all NATO countries that need resources," said Sir Malcolm Rifkind Financial Times, chairman of the British Parliament's Security Committee.
Matt Guthmiller, the youngest flying around the world
When other teens learned how to drive, Matt Guthmiller learned how to fly.
The 19-year-old Guthmiller just became the youngest flyer around the world – and yet alone, reported by CBS News correspondent Carter Evans.
A young person in South Dakota flew 30 000 miles, stopping 23 times in 15 countries in five continents.
On his way, Guthmiller was treated as a rock star because of his record flight.
Guthmiller also heard critical comments:
"It's too risky" and "Something spoiled, rich kid just wants to see a little world and have fun."
Mr Guthmiller had little to say to the rapporteurs of such comments.
Of course, I enjoyed a lot of fun, but it also included a lot of work, and I hope that with my record, I will also encourage other people to go to the world and do great things.
Guthmiller's flight experience started when he was young, and first he asked his parents to get to the airport cafes.
Later, he demanded to get to flight lessons.
My parents let me on a short, $20-minute, 20-minute flight, but I think they were thinking at the time that my enthusiasm would stop.
It didn't stop.
Shortly thereafter, Guthmiller made an agreement with his parents to give him more time in the cabin.
I agreed to share my father's car all the way to high school instead of getting my own car.
In the exchange store, I could fly aeroplanes.
By the age of 17, Guthmiller had received a license, and two years later, he enclosed a single-engine Beechcraft plane for its solitary flight around the world.
A young man studying at MIT university took care of the maintenance of the aircraft himself and made fuel calculations.
Many hours in the airs also meant that he himself needed an additional tank —
In practice, a lot of caffeine and Oreos cookies.
Guthmiller says he's eaten a couple of brewerys in full during a long flight.
Flying into the cloud was both fantastic and scary.
Air traffic controllers in other countries had no regulation to help them navigate around the storms.
I had no idea which clouds were just a little above the plane and which of them rose up to 45,000 feet and rip the plane into pieces.
Guthmiller's plane wasn't pressured and there was no oxygen reserve, so he couldn't fly above the clouds.
The number of fuels in the machine would not have been higher than that.
On the day after the interview, another young pilot, a 17-year-old Haris Suleman, died of his plane when he dropped on a flight between Samoa and Hawaii in America, which Guthmiller calls his trip to the most difficult part.
Guthmiller flew from the same airport as Suleman, and he believes that the increase is technically challenging because of the high amount of fuel required for 16 hours of flight.
However, despite the risks and even the horror of a high place, Guthmiller managed to break the record and collect money for ATK training via Code.org.
He's a coder himself, and he set up his own company at the age of 12 years.
Guthmiller's goals are here in the sky.
It would be great to set up the next Apple, but let's see what happens now.
Anyway, Guthmiller's going to aim to high.
Aim for the sky and you can achieve something great.
Finding a real kind of franchise entrepreneur is harder than you think.
Lori Joyce was thrilled when he arranged for fans in his Cupcakes by Heather and Lori stores around Canada after the Canadian W TV channel began to show the Cupcake Girls TV program in 2009.
The enthusiasm continued until it became clear that one franchise entrepreneur was not suitable for the task.
"My French entrepreneur sat in his car and called me that a hundred potential customers are quenching out outside the store ready to buy a cupcake and he can't handle the situation," says Joyce.
This event opened my eyes because it was a huge wasted opportunity for us.
After the event, Joyce decided to change the selection process of franchise partners to emphasise the company’s culture-like leadership skills instead of baking skills.
"Whoever can shine in the interview -- they know what I want to hear," he says, adding that he's had about 100 interviews for each 11 franchise movement.
We start with six weeks of training, but the workers work completely differently in the working environment, so the whole process is quite difficult, and this is why we emphasise, above all, the suitability of business culture.
Finding the right franchise entrepreneur is vital to any small company's development.
A strong and honest leader is able to edit and develop an organisation, while a poorly qualified director can cause expensive damage to the company.
"Before I thought looking for a franchise entrepreneur is like dating, but it's not true, during a date you can do much to get to know another one before you get married," says Joyce.
Instead, in the case of a franchise partner, a permanent contract is signed, a guarantee is made and a new shop is built.
Being involved with someone before seeing how a person works is an enormous step and a significant confidence test.
The symbiotic relationship of the Franchise Parties resembles a strong marriage because they have common objectives, explains Lorraine McLachlan, Chairman and Managing Director of the Canadian Franchise Association (CFA).
That is why McLachlan also believes that the franchise entrepreneur should be careful when complaining about the future French donor before entering into such a long-term partnership.
"This is the same idea as human relations: if a date partner is rude already on a date, imagine what he's like in marriage?", he says.
It is equally important for both parties to choose and evaluate the future partner and to pay attention to the smallest alerts on each side.
McLachlan adds that franchise donors like Joyce can learn from past successes and errors, but for the first time, those who act as a franchise donor must be more careful when choosing the first, most important partners.
On the basis of a successful parent company, the new franchise donors must conclude what challenges they have to face and what skills the new franchise entrepreneur needs when faced with similar difficulties.
Companies acting as donors for the first time may also ask for the assistance of the French advisor to create a profile based on practice in the sector.
McLachlan also reminds us that for the first time, those operating as franchise donors and entrepreneurs will be offered a great deal of help on the CFA’s website at lookforafranchise.ca.
However, the process will be easier later, as the French donors learn to better assess potential entrepreneurs, but also because the first franchise entrepreneurs can provide advice and help in the evaluation.
"The work of the first franchise partner helped Brian (Scudamore, founder and CEO of the 1-800-GOT-JUNK?) significantly in this creation of a company and a franchise system," says Erik Church, the operative director of the O2E Brands company. O2E Brands include companies 1-800-GOT-JUNK?, You Move Me and Wow 1 Day Painting.
The franchise entrepreneurs helped Brian create something he couldn't have created alone, so the first franchise entrepreneurs have to choose this idea in mind.
Church has 216 franchise entrepreneurs representing all three brands of O2E, and is also a partner of the Toronto franchise of You Move Me.
Chruch's method to find a real franchise partner is simple.
"We may have a confidence test to ask ourselves, "Would I call this person to me for the weekend's barbecue?", he says.
"If the answer to this question is 'n', you probably don't want to spend a great part of your working day looking with them for solutions to major business challenges."
Church also points out that the O2E Brands company is largely thanking its franchise structure for its success.
In the company organisation, managers often see their position in short-term and the relationship with a lower management level as very formal, while franchise entrepreneurs are engaged in partnership with long-term objectives and are thus more committed to the success of the company.
"The French partnership has much more good sides than the traditional business structure, but the partnership is also much more intensive," he says.
This is a partnership, not a relationship between the Vice-President and the Local Operational Director.
Such a partnership is more difficult, but well-behavioured, it produces better results.
Rail delays lower cereal prices in the north of the United States
The delayed rail transport has led to a significant fall in cereal prices in the North Central of the United States, weeks before the massive harvest is expected to be under a new pressure on the transport network.
Commercial cereal siles in the North Dakota state offer farmers only $2.7 for bushels - about a dollar less than control prices - because of the costs of ensuring the capacity of the train tracks receiving, traders and farming organisations say.
IN Raw materials
The problems are the most acute on the BNSF Railways of Warren Buffet Berkshire Hathaway and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company.
The Federal Railway Controller will hold a consultation on service problems on Thursday.
In the northern plains, we have to use irons in the transport of agricultural products because they are far from river networks.
The delay in rail transport increased when a very cold winter followed by a large crop in 2013 caused the slowdown and shortening of trains.
Some farmers believe that increased transport of crude oil from the North Dakotan Bakken oil formation has excluded cereal transport, which is not true according to railway companies.
According to the manager of an international cereal trade company, the costs of cereals and transferring sellers to ensure the use of the train have risen from up to $2,000 to $3,000 per year from the wagon.
Someone has to pay the costs.
"These costs will be paid either by the farmer or by the customer," says the CEO.
The U.S. Agriculture Agency estimates that North Dakota’s soybean beans will grow over a third and the spring crop will grow by 16 per cent.
Randy Gordon, chairman of the National Organisation for Cereals and Feed Association, says that "we are usually trying to start a new crop from a clean table, i.e. sufficient storage space has been emptyed on the rain and the cereal has been sold and moved.
However, we are now starting late because of the last year's service problems.
The railway company BNSF has assured its customers and controllers that it handles the transport of this year’s harvest smoothly.
John Miller, Vice-President of the BNSF farming products transportation company, said that the company has reduced long-term transport (trailers ordered by customers for more than four days) from the beginning of April 16 500 to about two thousand.
"We have moved almost everything from the old rain that we were supposed to move," says Miller, referring to the last harvest to the remaining cereal.
However, the latest reported speeds of the BNSF cereal trains were nine per cent lower than in the second quarter of the last year, which is a sign of congestion.
Miller admits that the development is 'equivalent', but noted that the company is currently investing $5 billion capital this year in order to improve the processing capacity of all types of transportable products such as cereal congestion.
The speeds of the Canadian Pacific railway company’s trains affected by the second womb are 11 per cent lower than the same time as last year, but clearly higher than the much low speeds in the early year.
The Canadian Pacific Railway Corporate has told the Surface Transportation Board that changes to the ordering system of its train wagons should improve their ability to handle transport by 15 to 20 % in the next harvest period.
"The autumn action plan for the Canadian Pacific railway company focuses on continuous improvements in the speed of the trains and efficient use of trains so that we can deliver more and more train wagons every week," said the representative of the railway company.
The crisis in Ukraine may be resolved by the NATO 'identity crisis'
Heads of major countries, diplomats and experts have often been concerned about the future of NATO and whether the end of NATO's mission in Afghanistan will also mean the end of NATO's significance itself.
However, this concern is very premature, as can be seen at the NATO Summit in Wales this week, involving 60 leaders, including President Barack Obama.
There is no shortage of the world crisis on the political and diplomatic mission list, even to the extent that the exit of the Afghan troops, which was prioritized, is no longer the most important.
Instead, 28 states' alliances are needed after Russia's reintegration into Ukraine, which is a shocking reminder that the threat of European independence is not necessarily just a part of the past.
World leaders are looking for new ways of punishing Russia, but they will also move troops, promise more money to defence expenditure and re-engage defence cooperation.
In some ways, NATO has to thank Vladimir Putin.
"It (NATO) sought something of its purpose -- and had a rather significant identity crisis in progress," says Mr Heather Conley, head of the European programme of the "Central for Strategic and International Studies in Washington" (Central for Strategic and International Studies).
NATO has not only found a new purpose, but has also been strengthened.
Obama has also added a new task on the agenda.
The President of the United States has promised to try to get world leaders to create a common strategy for the rapidly popularisation of Islamic State Militants in Iraq and Syria.
According to the official opinions, the President will face significant challenges in trying to inspire his bored partners to respond to the military response, particularly to a crossing of the border from Iraq to Syria.
However, President Obama is under pressure to show that he leads the world to find a strategy to win the extreme islamists, once he first pointed out that we have no strategy.
Western experts have made careful expectations for the summit to achieve breakthroughs during discussions on Ukraine or the Islamic State.
Additional economic sanctions are designed as the main instrument of the attack on Russia called Ukraine.
The European Union officials dealt with it this weekend, but postponed the decision on new sanctions.
The US officials pointed out that the countries, of which Obama hopes for the main partners in the Islamic problem, may not be members of NATO.
Two years ago, when the previous NATO Summit was held in Chicago, when the debate was overwhelming the withdrawal of soldiers from Afghanistan.
One year earlier, Robert M. Gates used his last speech in order to say that the organization has almost achieved the "common military meaninglessness" point.
The US officials continued to complain that the other countries did not reach their financial objectives.
NATO members promise to spend 2% of their GDP on defence expenditure, but only four Member States – Estonia, Greece, Britain and the United States – achieved this goal last year.
Now, however, the White House officials say that they noticed the change.
NATO members are expected to sign a contract in Cardiff in which they promise to increase their funding for defence cooperation.
The details were discussed late last week, but the White House found that this time there is a genuine desire for the company to see the potential threats in the real size of the Member States.
Following Russia's invasion into Ukraine, the Union's "defense promises are more important and more important than once after the end of the cold war", says Charles Kupchan, President of the National Security Council of the United States.
We are quite hoped to reach a consensus between 28 Member States.
Obama uses a large part of his journey to strengthen its commitment to defence cooperation for the neighbouring countries concerned by Russia.
The President will start his trip on a three-day trip to Tallinn, Estonia, where he will meet the leaders of both Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
NATO has recycled its troops in Estonia after Russia joined the Ukraine Crimean Peninsula this year, and NATO troops will be regularly recycled in Estonia when the new preparedness plan published this week is put in place.
The plan aims to shorten the time needed by NATO to react to attacks in the border countries, says officials.
The plan includes increasing air surveillance and other visible defence cooperation marks.
The changes pose a small risk for NATO, which refrained from setting up permanent bases for Eastern and Central Europe as a demonstration of friendship with Russia.
According to the officials, the new plan does not actually break the agreement, but it may also be a mere semantic difference, says a Western diplomat who did not want his name to be public before formal information.
NATO's presence is likely to be described as long-term, not permanent, said by the diplomat.
Putin's powerful "talviase" is using it to Ukraine?
The Russian President, Vladimir Putin, has one ace in his sleeve with regard to Ukraine.
The Western countries and Ukraine have repeatedly accused Putin for the rebels of the East Ukraine and for the sending of Russian troops to Ukraine's soil.
That is why the West has imposed sanctions on Russia.
As the situation in Ukraine is exacerbated, western countries are planning more severe sanctions against Russia.
However, Russia has a card: winter is coming, and Ukraine's main energy source is Russia.
According to the American authorities, Ukraine's primary energy sources are natural gas (40%) and coal (28%), Geysar Gurbanov, acting at Harvard University, writes according to Business Insider.
When winter comes to Ukraine within less than four months and coal mines are located in the eastern part of the country's conflict, Ukrainians are freezing into their homes when the gas supply is lifted from Russia.
Therefore, if the rebels fail to achieve their goals, Gazprom, the Russian energy waste, will help Putin to win the war at the end, Gurbanov writes.
Last year, half of the gas used in Ukraine came from Russia.
Russia cut the supply of gas to Ukraine on 16 July due to unpaid invoices.
Earlier this month, Gazprom announced that Ukraine's debt for gas was already EUR 5.3 billion (approximately EUR 4 billion) by 1 August.
According to the New York Times, Putin commented on the coming winter as follows:
I think no one will think about it (in winter) anymore, except for Russia, Putin said.
There are always ways to make this work easier.
Firstly, the immediate end of hostilities and the correction of the necessary infrastructure.
In order to refill the stocks, the necessary repairs must be made and prepared for a cold period.
According to Business Insider, Putin's comment can be interpreted as a masked threat.
If the Ukrainian army does not retreat in front of the separatists, Moscow can use natural gas as a weapon.
The Japanese holding company Nomura, Alistair Newma, noted last month that Russia's talks about humanitarian interference and the planning of a possible new natural gas crisis in Ukraine will be intensified in a few months if Russia can maintain the operation of separatists until then.
In Moscow, it has already been reported that Ukraine must pay for the gas supplies that are coming in advance unless Kiova has paid the accumulated debts.
The EU is trying to negotiate an agreement that would allow the continued imports of gas to continue temporarily.
Last week, Ukraine's Prime Minister, Arseni Jatsenjuk, said that Russia is planning to stop gas supplies to EU countries in winter.
Later, Russia's Minister for Energy, Aleksandr Novak, said that the speeches were infinite.
He said that Russia will do everything possible to bring gas to EU countries.
Liberal Saudi Blogger received ten years of imprisonment and thousands of scratch attacks
The Saudi Arabian court has maintained a 10-year imprisonment sentence to Raif Badaw, the Liberal Free Saudi liberals, which was founded in May.
The sentence contains a thousand cuts and a million fines (approximately EUR 200 000) as an additional penalty.
The judgment was based on the establishment of a website degrading Islamics.
On Monday, AFP was informed by the second founder of the organization of Suad al-Shamari.
Badawi himself has been imprisoned since 2012.
In July 2013, Badawi was already sentenced to seven years of imprisonment and 600 years of rape, but was appealed and reintroduced.
The judgment was also appealed in May, when Amnesty International also pointed out its injustice.
Madventures Riku Rantalan's childhood experience in Afghanistan: "It was one of the revolutionary human encounters"
Today, Madventures published a new book of World Explanation - an explanation of the Adventurer for everything.
We asked Riku Ranta for an explanation of the future of the world and the differences between Indian and Finnish culture.
Riku also tells us about the most important human encounter in his life.
The author, the journalist, the Madventures, the other party, Riku Rantala, is a busy man.
Today has been published a new book, yesterday there was a film picnic at the National Museum and Wednesday starts the second production season of Docventures.
Ever since morning, he's been running from place to place.
From Maicari's morning TV to take a child to a day home and from there to a week's room.
The most facially agreed interview must be transferred for a phone interview.
Otherwise, I don't have time.
In the middle of all the rush, he and the other half of Madventures, Tunna Milonoff has had time to stop and write the World Explanation Book, which, according to the cover text, is the adventurer's manual for everything.
Everything?
Oh, pretty much promised.
The book discusses a number of themes, such as what is our future, why another culture is doing worse than another, why we are here and who we really are.
We used the interviews we've been doing over the years.
The book includes both professors and artists.
We worked the book actively for about a year, Riku tells IS by phone.
You've haunted a pretty big piece of the book.
What is the key message of the work?
The fact that we need to know more about the world and the big questions is worth considering, because then we will be doing the best in this world.
On the other hand, the idis of the book is good travel reading, but it is also meant to make people discuss and share ideas at home.
The debate may even lead to action, Riku says.
KUVA: Pete Aarre-Ahtio
One of your themes is the future of the world.
How does it look?
We concluded that the human race is optimistic.
Despite the warming of the climate and the current state of the earth, we have to believe that at some point we will make decisions to improve our situation.
The world is like an alcoholic.
First, it should admit that we have a problem, only then can change, Riku philosophyi.
Riku tells us that some research indicates that Western humanity has reached the top of happiness in the 1970s.
After that, prosperity has not increased our happiness.
This can lead to the fact that when we have enough money and our basic needs are satisfied, we are happy.
Money doesn't increase happiness.
We therefore want to raise people to discuss what is enough.
Using our natural resources is not enough for long, Riku says.
You're also considering the differences in culture in your book.
How does an Indian person differ from a Finnish person?
People aren't much different.
Of course, the starting points, such as education, health and hygiene, are different.
The culturally large difference is that the Community's importance is much greater in India in both good and evil.
When the West is prosperous, people live more alone.
Let us separate ourselves from others and may lead to loneliness and anxiety.
When we find a proper balance between socialism and loneliness, we would be pretty close to happiness, Riku tells us.
Riku has encountered many different people in the world.
What is the best thing about human encounter in his mind?
It's my childhood, when I was with my family on the first big foreign trip.
We lived in India and Pakistan a year when my father was there for the United Nations.
I was seven years old, and two of my smaller sisters were involved.
My brother was just a baby.
They came home to Finland on the ride of a big moving car.
We drove a war in Afghanistan when there were a huge number of refugees on the road.
On the road, a girl my age walked, carrying her little brother in his arms.
I sat on a big mercury bench in the hands of a coke cake.
Our eyes were facing, Riku's describing.
A child of his age will understand the situation.
It was one of the transforming human scenes that I will always remember.
KUVA: Leena Koskela
Riku and Tunna in 2013 at book fairs.
That's when Riku went to the cabbage, that other people should be respected, even if they were considerably poorer or they do not have the same conditions of life as we do.
At that time, Riku realized that money could not be a measure of human dignity.
From the memories of the adults to the surface, the people who met in New Guinea are rising.
I couldn't stop wondering how traditional people live there.
They use natural materials for everything, not much using money or metal tools.
They live in extremely challenging living conditions.
Survival is really hard.
It had to think about it.
And to think about it, he wants to have his new book readers with Tunna.
The idea is that our book will inspire people to read, look, and listen to more.
That it would make people work for a warm love for a conversation or even until a fist fight, Riku throws away.
It's the Kauhajoki magazine.
The events moved on from the time the couple arrived at the bus station and ordered a cab.
When the cab moved, the man on the yard threw a taxi after some object.
The driver got out of the car, and the man who was a passenger.
The man who was throwing the scene stabbed a man’s passenger with life-threatening heads and hands and left the place.
The stab is a tank of 170-175 inches, a short-haired man.
According to the newspaper, there has been a young, blonde pony woman in the vicinity of the scene.
They hope to contact the police.
The police also ask for clues from all those who may have made observations about events or persons related to the case.
The stabbing occurred on Wednesday at 7:50 p.m. 27 a.m.
"Hi!" said the brain to the brain, the world's first telepathic message passed through the Internet.
The scientific publication PLoS ONE has published the article that the international group of researchers has been the first to communicate the message directly to the mind.
The first messages that were sent through the system were "hala" and "ciao", which is in Spanish and Italian "moi".
The electric brain curve of the consignor was monitored in the experimental arrangement.
The sender was trained using the program to send bits either by thinking about the movement of the hand or foot.
The imagination of the foot movement was interpreted as zero, and the movement of hands was number one.
This data coded in bits was sent via the Internet to the receiver.
The recipient was accompanied by a magnetic stimulation of observations of light flares per single bit coded.
The receiver had been taught to interpret the flashes as a message.
Researchers admit that this is still a field of research in their children's shoes, but believe that computer-auxiliary telepathic communication is routine in the near future of mankind.
Commitments - Point - the future of the countryside
The EU is preparing for new sanctions against Russia.
The United States is also strangling its own sanctions.
There is a political need for sanctions.
It would be impossible for the EU and the United States not to react when Russia wars in Ukraine and occupies Crimea.
International policy follows the reaction, act countermeasures.
Experience shows that all sanctions will only be bitten in the long term.
Iran was inclined to negotiate its nuclear programme only after years.
For decades, the South African Racial Orthodox Government was seated, although trade was banned by UN decisions.
Sanctions have also been used against Russia.
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union was not allowed to export excellence of electronics or military technology.
Russia itself has put barriers to trade on the world page.
Last time, the wooden timber was frozen.
It is clear that the sanctions do not bring Russia on their knees.
The Russians have been used to bad times, and the disappearance of Viola from the store does not cause panic.
When the EU intends to ban the imports of vodka from Russia, the main issue is a joke.
The Russians would like to drink that vodka themselves.
EU sanctions are also selective.
The French are allowed to take air support ships to Russia, but Finland cannot export milk.
The gas flow from Russia to Germany continues.
The biggest disadvantage for Russia is not the dropping of imports of cheese or exports of vodka.
The most harm comes from financial constraints.
They're only gonna work in the future.
The Russian state cannot operate on the international loan market.
It has to shorten the old loans, but it's hard to take a new one.
Even though Russia has huge foreign reserves, they will not last forever.
The lending of Russian companies sneaks and the money rises.
My own banks are not able to finance everyone.
More money must be weighed, or companies will have problems with payment.
The bankruptcy is even competitions in Russia; Russia is a capitalist country.
If the crisis continues for years, the modernisation of Russia will stop, as René Nyberg wrote in Helsinki.
It wouldn't be the first time.
At the same time, Russia would return to Russia once again and stir inwards.
An exceptional free button event was held in North Korea
Approximately 10 000 North Koreans, along with a number of diplomats, followed international free pressures held in Pjongjang on Saturday.
To the event organised by Antonio Inoki, who moved from the lawyer to free painting, took part in the painters of Japan, the United States, China, France, Brazil and Mexico.
In addition to the free movements, the taekwondo games of local athletes were also seen.
According to Inok, the aim of this event was to bring the disputed states closer to the world and promote world peace.
In their speeches, the politicians wished to improve between North Korea and Japan.
During the summer, Japan eradicated sanctions imposed on North Korea as a result of the kidnapping of Japanese in the 1970s and 1980s.
On the other hand, North Korea promised to reopen the investigation of these cases.
Lastly, in North Korea, international free pressure was seen in 1995.
The SOK reduces about 110 people from the trade organisation.
The Yt negotiations began in June, where the reduction was estimated to be up to 130.
According to the company, overlaps have now been removed from its organisation and clarified responsibilities.
The SOK states that it clearly calls for better cost-effectiveness and synergies between different sectors.
In addition to the decline in economic downturn and consumer demand, the background is the structural change in trade, which has shaken the trade in goods, especially in use.
The result of the S-group trade has been lost for some time.
The YT negotiations concerned all employees and managers of SOK’s use and day-to-day assets trade, i.e. around 530 persons.
Turun Says: Some of the self-medicines behind the dish
According to the newspaper, there are more medicines to be taken from the recipe and from the shelf to the recipe, which can be obtained without a prescription, but only after advice from the pharmacist’s employee.
According to the Finnish Pharmacovigilance Union, for example, eye drops containing antibiotics could be subject to advice.
Following a pharmaceutical or provisor interview and in compliance with the pre-defined criteria, the medicine should be given behind the dish, the President of the Pharmaceutical Association reflects Kirsi Kvarnström Turku's Communication.
In Finland, there are already a few medicines needed to be obtained without a prescription, but it is necessary to provide advice.
One of these is a post-prevention product.
Corruption for more precise causes
Finland pays greater attention to the fight against corruption.
It has been recommended by the OECD and the Council of Europe, for the world is amazed at the minority of bribes and judgments in Finland.
By the end of the year, the Ministry of Justice will consider whether the provisions of the Criminal Act would be necessary for trade in and abuse of influence.
For example, the differences in legislation emerged during the trial of the Patria’s bribe case in the Slovenian branch in Hämeenlinna a year ago.
In Slovenia, the trading of influence brought two years of imprisonment to the former Prime Minister, but the Finnish law does not know the corresponding criminal code.
The anti-corruption cooperation network has strengthened its cooperation as required by the Government Programme.
According to the recently completed map, corruption is not much studied in Finland.
The Ministry of Justice has now ordered a survey from the University of Vaasa and from the University of Applied Sciences in various areas of corruption.

Wanderers Coach Tony Popovic believes he's gonna get the Champions League of Asia to Korea
Tony Popovic doesn't have three key players in Korea.
Many of the Western Sydney Wanderers team's players are in the first game, and coach Tony Popovic is not hesitating to throw other players at the Asian Champions Leaguen witchkattila in the FC Seoul fight.
The Wanderers are in Dubai on a 10-day training camp, including two friendship games in Abu Dhab, so that the team can prepare for the first semifinal match on September 17th.
Due to the excessive yellow cards, Tomi Juric, Brendan Santalab and Shannon Cole skipped the Korean journey, but Coach Popovic believes in their fans.
"Of course this is a loss – they have been three very important players in ACL for us," says Popovic.
Tomi Juric was banned from this gesture in China.
It's a back strike, none of the players should be gone, but we didn't have Mattya (Spiranovic) in the first game, and so far Daniel Mullen has been injured.
Whoever comes to replace, I'm sure he's done a lot of work, and I'm totally trusting the whole team.
I'm not afraid to play anyone in semi-finals.
The Wanderers must also be without Spiranovic, which is still recovering from ankle surgery.
The defender of the Socceroos team was injured before the beginning of the season, but has continued running, and it is possible that he plays a return match at the Pirtek Stadium on 1 October.
"He's back in career and he's gonna be okay," says Popovic.
He follows his own training programme and goes with us to Dubai, which is a great news for him, because it means gradually returning to the field.
He's already been practicing a few times outside, which is good.
It's gonna take a while before he's perfectly well, but he's gonna be okay.
In Dubai, the Wanderers team has the world's top-sized facilities at the Al Sheba Sports Complex.
Popovic also believes that the trip to Dubai is a good opportunity for the team to get to know each other better after the major changes in the end of the last season.
"We know this will help players to create bonds," says Popovic.
We have a lot of new players, and this is a great opportunity for them to get to know each other even better both on the field and outside it.
So we use the camp for many purposes.
Eliiti burger pays three times the monthly salary of a worker
01.09.2014 21:18 In North Korea you can enjoy the luxury of rich economies if it hurts to be part of the country's elite.
The opposite of the tremendous economy is reported by Financial Times.
In North Korea, unofficial markets may flourish more than ever.
They offer wealthy or sustainable ordinary citizens a luxury that has not been used to joining the dictatorship state.
Financial Times has visited Munsu Water Park: a entertainment center where only a ticket will pay up to ten months of ordinary worker wages.
That's where you get burgers that pay $76.
It's 3-5 months' salary for the country's normal dunar.
At the swimming pool, men drink beer in their short walls.
Life looks expensive and nice.
North Korea's "western markets" began in the 1990s, when the country suffered from famine.
The government allows them to exist, even though the price of supplies can be the worst.
Yet, in the capital of Pjongjang, many have a mobile phone with a doorh of $200.
Some reason may be the ruler of Kim Jong-un, 31 who has tried to create a self-energy and youthful picture.
During his time, the government has stressed the importance of technology in the flourishment of the country.

Ormiston House: Stormont Council hopes for sales
The Stormont Council hopes that it has found a buyer for the Ormiston House, a building in Belfast, which cost taxpayers nearly £3,000 a week.
The Council purchased a building from the 18th century in the east of the city 13 years ago and paid GBP 9 million.
The Council failed to sell the building further, when the security and maintenance of the building came to the Council to pay about GBP 400 per day.
The building was recently sold at 1.25 million pounds.
The building is apparently to be used as a private residential building.
The Council purchased a building classified in class B with a historical value of 9 million pounds in 2001, because it needed more office space.
However, later it was noted that the building was not suitable for this purpose.
Ten years after the purchase of the building, it was put back on sale at a price of GBP 2.5 million this time.
The building was not sold and the price was calculated.
Last year, the Ulster Unionist Party, Mike Nesbitt, suggested that the Ormiston House, perhaps fit into the premises of a new international trauma centre.
However, the Council has now confirmed that it will negotiate the sale of the building.
According to the representative, the building will be transferred to the new owner as long as the paperwork is completed.
Both the Council and the real estate broker remain silent about the buyer's identity and sales price.
The weekly security and repair costs of Ormiston House are about GBP 3,000.
The Council purchased the building from the police force, which preceded the Northern Ireland Policing Board.
By the beginning of this year, the safety costs of Ormiston House amounted to GBP 885 641 and maintenance costs were GBP 371 379.
The price for repair and maintenance professional services was GBP 250 015 and the fees for development and design professionals were GBP 212 466.
The building was formerly owned by the shipbuilding director Sir Edward Harland, who lived in the building until 1887, when it was purchased by Harland’s partner William Pirrie. Later, Pirrie became president of the Harland & Wolff company.
Shortly after Lord Pirrie died, 1924 the Harland & Wolff company became the owner of the building. In 1928 the company sold it to Campbell College, who held it until mid-70s.
"Equivalence is growing": Helsinki intends to reduce school supporters
There's no savings, says JHL.
The radical reduction of the number of school assistants is being prepared in Helsinki.
The reduction would not concern the child’s personal assistant.
The Helsinki Board of Education ended in the spring to present some 2.7 million quarantines of the resources of school assistants.
In Helsinki there are about 600 school assistants.
If the contractions come true, they will enter into force in the middle of the semester immediately from the beginning of the year.
According to JHL, the trade union makes the decision more inequality.
More and more children need support for learning.
However, for the sake of savings, it is regrettably easy for aiders to be reduced because the amount of assistance to learn is not clearly defined in the law.
Savings are certainly not born, on the contrary, the workload of the educational staff is increasing.
With schoolchildren, savings lead to a greater risk of dropping from the goals of learning and the share of teachers is hard, emphasising the JHL's CEO Day Niemi-Laine.
The plans of the City of Helsinki inequalize schools, as small schools and students need support for future resources no longer receive assistant resources.
The goal of the City of Helsinki is to prevent exclusion.
A successful preventive work is being done by school supporters.
However, the adaptation measures of the Agency are mostly addressed to this group.
All parties will continue to suffer from this.
In the autumn, the Helsinki City Council will make a final solution to the resources to which I hope to look far into the future and act in accordance with its objectives, says Niemi-Laine.
Israel will dominate the land on the west coast
Israeli women walk in a Jewish dwelling named Gevaot near Bethlehem in the Ethion rehabilitation area.
On Sunday, Israel took over almost 400 hectares of land on the west coast in a Jewish settlement near Bethlehem, which may be a sign of Israel’s future significant construction in the region, and at the same time damaging the Palestinians’ request not to build more housing and threaten the general opinion of the world community.
The Israeli "Peace Now" group, which opposed the expansion of the West Bank's authorities, felt that Sunday events could be the largest individual takeover of the country in the West Bank for decades and could "dramaticly alter the situation of the region".
The Palestinians aim to establish their own country for the countries which Israel conquered in 1967.
According to the Israeli authorities, the political agitation to assess the situation in the land after three young Israeli were kidnapped and killed in June after they were lifted in the region.
In July, the Israeli authorities arrested a Palestinian, accused of being the main factor in kidnapping and killing.
The timetable of landing makes it understand that it was meant to be a kind of reimbursement for the population of housing and punishment for the Palestinians.
It was a necessary step in order to allow Israel to start planning buildings in the region if Israel wants to start planning.
However, Ahmad Lafi, the Mayor of Surif of the nearby Palestinian City, said that the land belongs to the Palestinian families.
He told the Palestinian official news office WAFA that the Israeli army and its staff published early Sunday orders in which Israel announced to take over lands containing olive and other trees in Surif and in the nearby villages Al-Jaba and Wadi Fukin.
Any objections should be tabled within 45 days.
The kidnapping of young people caused the Israeli army to carry out a retreat on the West Bank against the Islamic Group of Gaza, Hamas, which Israel said was behind the kidnappings.
The tensions on the border of Israel and Gaza blew up to the 50 - day war, which ended last week in a ceasefire brought about by Egypt.
The takeover of the land has quickly given attention to the West Bank of Israel, and has revealed the conflicting objectives of the Israeli Government, which hinder the wider development of the Israeli and Palestinian peace process.
Lapland’s crises are usually a lot of problems.
A growing proportion of Lapland's municipalities is in trouble, reflects the well-being research carried out by Lapland University and Lapland University of Applied Sciences.
There are no quick solutions to crisis problems.
According to the professor, reducing municipalities' duties by EUR 1 billion is not enough.
The common features of the crisis include weak municipal economy, poor employment and loss of migration.
According to the Emeritus Professor Asko Suikkasen of the University of Lapland, new crises are coming from the west border and from Eastern Lapland.
In the survey, residents have a realistic assessment of the situation of their municipalities.
Even pessimistically viewed the prospects of the well-successed municipalities in the study.
Fast expectations affect consumption.
People hope that the present everyday and well-being will be maintained, perhaps even a little better.
During this time, there is no fear of considering longer-term investments, such as buying a dwelling, says Suikkanen.
The group of researchers surprised the great differences between municipalities.
For example, the cost of income support per capita varies from a few to a few ten to a great deal more than 100 euros.
The municipal tax revenue per capita varies from Ranua's fair to EUR 2 000 to EUR 4400 of Pelkosenniem.
The shower says Lapland's municipalities are different.
How money is used, how much state shares are obtained and what is the degree of debt, is much different in similar situations, he says.

Britain may close borders from returning Islamist fighters
Britain may temporarily prevent the return of Islamist fighters who went to Iraq and Syria to their home country.
It's a matter of reference to BBC's government sources.
However, according to the BBC, the British citizens suspected of terrorism would be allowed to keep their citizenship.
According to the government source, this is one of many proposals to be considered.
The proposal is currently being finalised, and Prime Minister David Cameron is about to present it.
The government is also looking for ways to make it difficult for potential fighters to travel abroad.
One way could be to increase the authority's powers so that they could temporarily confiscate the passports of potential fighters at the border.
On Friday, Britain increased the possibility of a terrorist threat to the second highest level.
Bob Carr welcomes the immediate release of the Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor from the Libérian prison
The Australian attorney Melinda Taylor is expected to be released from a Libérian prison today.
The federal government welcomed the news that the Libyan authorities are expected to release an Australian attorney Melinda Taylor today.
Foreign Minister Bob Carr said that "all will be well" and that the International Criminal Court's lawyer will be released in custody of the Australian authorities this evening, after which he will board a plane flying to Europe by midnight.
"We are pleased with the news that he is likely to be released today," the representative commented to the AAP News Office in New York.
We thank the Libyan authorities for their cooperation.
Australia also thanks the wider international community for its assistance and support, said the representative.
Taylor is likely to fly to Rome before the journey continues to his home to Haagi.
On 7 June, Taylor and three of his attorney colleagues of the Criminal Court were arrested in Zintan, Libarian City, representing Seif Al-Islam, the son of Muammar Gaddaf, the former dictator of Libya.
According to the Libyan authorities, Taylor took to Seif the papers that they believe threatened national security.
Senator Carr has seen a lot of effort to release Taylor, including traveling to the capital of Libya last month to Tripoli to do this.
Taylor couldn't have talked to his husband or his little daughter before the last week.
According to Senator Carr, Taylor was allowed to call his home shortly after the visit of the Australian Ambassador David Ritchie.
Carr also spoke with John and Janelle, who lived in Taylor’s Brisbane, who were relieved to hear that Taylor was finally given the phone.
Taylor’s parents had begged Libya to release their daughter before the third birthday of this child in July.
The three other lawyers of the Criminal Court are from Lebanon, Russia and Spain.
Carr said a week ago that the discussion between a lawyer who was released in the Hague and the Libyan authorities "the lawyer of the Criminal Court was sorry and apologized for any misunderstanding".
The International Criminal Court has not spoken of errors, but has promised to examine the activities of its team thoroughly since its members returned home.
"After the International Criminal Court has decided its investigation, it will ensure that all those who have acted wrong will be judged properly", the Court announced in its communication last month.
The International Criminal Tribunal calls for a trial to Seif Al-Islam, aged 39, against crimes against humanity during his father's administration, which suddenly ended last year.
According to Tripoli, his trial should be local and made an initiative on 1 May, in which it announced that it did not accept the decision of the Criminal Tribunal to hold a trial in the Hague.
A young enthusiast saved Barcelona - ESS.fi
Barcelona took another victory in the early stages of the Spanish football league, but Villarreal did not easily fall at home.
The blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue.
The winning painting was made by a surprising man: 19-year-old, an attacker Sandro Ramirez, who made his first visit to La Liga, had come to the field only 12 minutes earlier.
The young man who received the invitation from the Barcelona Second Team was finalised near the time that Asenjo had rejected the Lionel Mess company.
The collections to the Ferguson police ended mysteriously after the $433,000 overrun.
Maintenance sites closed two online collection sites without an explanation this weekend, after collecting sites for over $400,000 for the police who shot an unarmed 18-year-old in Ferguson, Missouri.
On the open GoFundMe benefit website for the general public, two separate pages, including similar names – "Support Officer Darren Wilson" and "Support Officer Wilson", have collected $235 750 and $197 620 for a ferguson-like policeman who shot Michael Brown.
The similar site maintained by Brown's family lawyer had collected $314 099 after Sunday afternoon.
The shooting followed several weeks of restlessness and demonstration mostly against the almost white police forces of Ferguson, which forced Wilson to hide while the local and federal investigations were attempted to decide whether to shoot Brown for no reason.
The network gathering campaigns have caused some resentment of Wilson's defence, especially after some visitors had written a comment on racist comments that have later been deleted.
Both pages apparently ceased to receive donations at the same time on Saturday and did not give reasons for this.
When visiting the site, he sees a message that says, "The gifts will no longer be accepted!
The organiser has stopped collecting donations.
On Sunday, a representative of the GoFundMe site gave a briefing to Los Angeles Times that the site has not prevented the donation.
"Each organiser of the GoFundMe campaign decides when to stop receiving donations," said Kelsea Little, a representative of the GoFundMe website in his communication.
Organisers can also continue to receive donations later if they want.
The "Support Officer Wilson" page, with a profit of $197 620, maintains a charity group of St. Louis's police, Shield of Hope, which is the recipient of the donations approved by the GoFundMe site.
The three officers named officially in the Shield of Hope's state collection register, Joseph Eagan, Timothy Zoll and Jeffrey Roorda, did not respond immediately on Sunday to e-mails asking for more information about the collection campaign.
Zoll is the official informant of the Ferguson Police Department, Eagan is a member of the nearby city council of Florissant and a member of the Roorda Missour representative room.
The Times page also did not immediately contact the anonymous founder of the "Support Officer Darren Wilson" page, who uses the name "Stand Up" and has collected $235 750. He has not been confirmed as a donation recipient approved by the site.
However, in its communication to The Times, the representative of the GoFundMe site assured that anonymous charitable exists.
Only little information has been provided to donors on the anonymous charity of the collection campaign, in contrast to one of the owners of Wilson’s website or Brown’s donation sites.
The unnamed Wilson charitable wrote to visitors two weeks ago a message that the page cooperates with the Shield of Hope group to become officially accepted donation recipients.
Approval has not yet been granted.
The charitable gave additional information to visitors with an alias Gmail e-mail address, but did not reply to the request immediately on Sunday.
In its communication to The Times, the representative of the GoFundMe page said that the anonymous collection page has been deleted from the search results of the main site and added that "this campaign will no longer meet the requirements reported by the GoFundMe website, according to which a functional Facebook account should be used".
In the information safety practices of the GoFundMe site, users are invited to “subject only to the users of GoFundMe who are personally familiar with and to whom they trust”.
Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that the content of the collection website published on the GoFundMe website is accurate and honest.
However, according to the representative Little, GoFundMe has "have been in contact with the campaign organiser, and it has no reason to doubt his honesty.
GoFundMe will also be able to arrest all the funds collected if it is necessary to start research in connection with a campaign.
However, GoFundMe did not consider it appropriate to maintain the funds collected by that campaign.
The popular Facebook page "Support Officer Wilson", which has organised campaigns supporting Wilson, told the followers of the page this weekend that lawyers are trying to find "selling" why the donors of the GoFundMe website have been prevented from donating, but the page did not provide any further information.
The Facebook page also has anonymous administrator and the independent source has not been able to confirm these comments.
Arsenal's top winner on the last year's page - Valioliiga - Ilta-Sanoma
