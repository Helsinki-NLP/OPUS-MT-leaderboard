Putin: Ukrainian troops shoot civilians
The Russian President, Vladimir Putin, accused Kiova’s leadership of refusing direct political discussions with the Separatists of Eastern Ukraine.
At this moment, the leader of Kiova does not want to conduct an essential political debate with its country's eastern part, Putin said the news office according to Itar-Tass.
He also said that the Russian-minded separatists, whose Kiova and Western say to be assisted by the Russian army, tried to push Ukraine troops away from their present places in which Putin said that the troops of the Ukrainian army are shooting civilians.
The goal of militia fighters is to push away these armed troops and their tyres so that they can't shoot the inhabitants of the region, Putin said.
The event was held on Friday and Saturday at the Ryrmi repair plant.
It was a surprise that the people came from the very beginning.
There were visitors waiting for two days. Promoter Tom Kangas says.
The Seinäjoki Hiphop Festival was held for the third time.
Next year again.
We're still going to be hiphop fans, which means we're not allowed to pop, Kangas assures us.
On Tuesday, Finland will enter into force a law limiting the acquisition of materials suitable for the manufacture of explosives.
In the future, individuals shall apply for authorisation from the Police Government to buy or keep in possession of substances or mixtures which could be used as a so-called explosive source.
These substances include hydrogen peroxide, nitromethane, nitric acid, potassium chloride, potassium perchlorate, sodium chloride and sodium perchlorate, and mixtures containing them if the specified concentrations are exceeded.
Hydrogen peroxide is present, for example, in cleaning and washing agents, but the concentrations do not generally exceed the limit values.
Nitromethane is used, for example, in acceleration drive.
However, prior to the entry into force of the law, the source materials acquired may be held and used until 2 March 2016.

Valioliiga: Super Raheem brilliant - Mario remained in shadow - Valioliiga - Ilta-Sanoma
Only 19-year-old Raheem Sterling again showed why he was considered a hope for the future of English football.
On Sunday, White Hart Lane had an electronic atmosphere when the Mario Balotelli confirmed Liverpool arrived as a guest of Tottenham.
The first visit to Super Marion was promising: experienced English journalists saw a 24 - year - old Italian working on the field with a different attitude to Manchester City.
Balotelli was still far away from his peak vibe.
The Italian wasted three quality targets and feedd only half of his sixteen feeds to his own team.
The pool carriers who have already favoured the player are waiting for better in the future.
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers planted Luis Suarez as the second attacker alongside Daniel Sturridge.
The team aims at the top of the middle field diamond, instead of the Kimalsi Balotelli, Raheem Sterling, who blew the important opening painting of the 3-0 win by Hugo Lloris.
Sterling, 19, it doesn't just shine on its power.
Balotellia is 20 cents shorter than the English is between the opponent's lines than the fish in the water.
Characteristics are not common to a player who thanks the lawn at its best at about 34 kilometres an hour.
Rodgers too deserves great thanks for Sterling's development.
After the fight, the Northern Irelandian told me how Liverpool has systematically developed a more comprehensive player of the northwest lobby in the root of Wembley.
Susanna Mälkki was chosen as the master of the Helsinki City Orchestra - "I'm happy and proud"
The City Government of Helsinki has decided to appoint Susanna Mälki as the next master of the city orchestra in Helsinki since autumn 2016.
The magazines in Los Angeles Times have asked what orchestra he's gonna take next.
Susanna Mälkki tells me that she will start with her new mission with joy and pride.
The Helsinki City Orchestra has played a key role in our country's music life for more than a hundred years, including by representing a large amount of Sibelius' music.
The Orchestra has led the best Finnish corridors and I have worked with many orchestra members before.
I'm looking forward to our future cooperation," he says.

The management of the SAK, the Programme and the STTK of employees' organisations will deal with the negotiating situation in the morning.
Thereafter, actual pension negotiations are to be continued.
The labour market organisations have evolved, among other things, the dispute on the binding of retirement age to life expectancy.
The organizations have promised a career solution by autumn, but according to the latest estimate, it would be born during this week.
In a stack of stains.
The Rovanielean women's Airball League Woman Volley stumbled into the Vampire Athletes at the final of the tournament on Sunday.
The Vampula twisted five to the winner of a stretched match of 3-2.
The last round of WoVo lost 15-11.
The neighbor was a step ahead all the time.
The fight was good, but in the defense game and passport game Vampula was a little better, saw WoVo Coach Teemu Mäkikyrö.
WoVo's six was so rising that 190-century American center Jennifer Keddy was stuck in the back.
As a center, Sara Niemi played.
Karoliina Kyllönen, despite his thumbs, was gambling and formed the most fiery combination of WoVon with Johanna Pekkarise.
Jenna Keskmäki, who started as a hacker, was able to make room for Jana Jaudzema for the last 1.5 rounds.
The best part of the injury was a skilled Russian passport and a libora Hillael, a Spider who had WoVo spinning as much as possible.
WoVon's preparation for the league continues next weekend when the HPK of Hämeenlinna is on Rovaniemi.
The team meets on Saturday at "trade" at 18:00 in the official practice game.
On Sunday, you'll meet at the sports school again.

The company has more than 4 200 employees in Finland.
Ovarian cancer is more commonly killed in few areas due to late diagnosis and troubled treatment
Angelina Jolie and his brother James have published a video of honor to their mother who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women living in Australia are at greater risk of ovarial cancer than those living in cities.
In 2005, more than 1100 australian women had a diagnosis of ovarian cancer and found that only 35% of women, or more than five years after the diagnosis, had been studied by researchers.
The main researcher Susan Jordan QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in few residents and distant regions died by 20% more likely during the study than women living in urban areas.
RESEARCH: New medicines may slow down lung and ovarian cancer
Scientists went through women’s health history over seven years.
According to doctor Susan Jordan, the age of a woman at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, the previous diseases and the socio-economic status affected the possibility of survival.
In older women and cancer, the probability of survival at the time of the diagnosis was lowest.
Women living in rare residents and distant areas died by 20% more likely during the study than women living in urban areas.
The study did not seek to find out why women living outside the city are less likely to cope with the ovarian cancer, but Jordan considers possible reasons for delayed diagnosis and difficult access to treatment.
"Special doctors in geniological oncology will best deal with this disease, and their reception is mostly located in major cities," says Jordan.
While the treatments carried out as remote services are becoming generalised and the importance of distant is reduced, the researcher also proposes to increase the mobility of doctors so that specialists can treat patients closer to their homes, as well as programs to support patients with remote home care.
According to Dr. Jordan’s study, long-term survival rates for women with ovarian cancer are poor regardless of their geographical location, which underlines the need for better treatment and better cancer prevention programmes.
The research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
With a family mother in Gold Coasti, a 33-year-old, Elisa Neavella, she found malignant ovarian cancer.
The city of Rovaniemi wants to strengthen the stationary of the Kelkkapark business in the Friendship Park, located next to the hotel Northhov.
The City Government decided on Monday that the proposal for a status plan for the Friendship Park and its surrounding environment will be put on the service point to be publicly viewed in Osviitta.
The draft formula is requested for opinions from the Environment Board and Lapland Ely Centre.
With a change in position formula, the city wants to allow the continued motor cycle activities related to tourism in the region.
The site is intended to form a park area which is within the area between the current Park of Friendship and the river.
At the time of the presentation, no more than 200 motor rolls shall be allowed permanently during the period from 15 November to 30 April.
In addition, tanking points may be placed in the area for a specified part.
The new park area will also be allowed to operate maintenance.
The city of Rovaniemi has rented the area of Friendship Park for safari companies for motorcycles during winter.
The lease agreement has been renewed last spring 2014 and the contract is valid until spring 2018.
Kelkkaparking and formula change have also provoked hard-sounding opposition.
The people of neighbouring circles have had their voices and concerns about emissions.
However, emissions in the area have been investigated and there have not been any findings beyond the guidelines in the surveys.
Renewed vehicles are also less than old ones.
As a park park, it also supports that, if the place of departure were moved further, safari customers in the hotel should be transported to safari departures in buses estimated to be 15 departures a day.
According to the city, the area and the surrounding environment of the friendship park is also sufficiently wide, better than the locations presented for replacement departures, such as the east side of the Ounas River bridges.
For the sake of its location, the friendship park is good because activities can expand in the future, for example in the Ounaspaviljong region.
The establishment of parking activities is part of the urban strategy approved by the City Council of Rovaniemi, which aims, inter alia, to create a good framework for business activities by providing sufficient quality areas to logistically and functionally favourable locations.
The friendship park is also marked as the starting point of the motor cycle in the central general formula, which has not yet received legal power.
The number of owners' dwellings can be seen in garden stores
The decrease in the number of residential owners, especially in the group of people under the age of 35, may lead to a decrease in the turnover of garden stores by tens of millions, when young consumers today reach their age in the study of the United Kingdom Garden Trade Association (HTA).
According to the Financial Times report, the renters spend only 55% of the money used by housing owners for garden management.
The study has also shown that more and more people live in very urban dwellings with no gardens, and that the size of the garden is reduced when the front yard is increasingly covered as a parking place, and these factors also threaten the garden area estimated to be about GBP 5 billion per year.
In the large area of London, housing ownership has fallen from 61% to 43% in six years, and there is the least money for garden products per household in the whole country.
However, according to the HTA and the UK Garden Association (RHS), the increase in the rental of dwellings or the decrease in the size of the garden does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, the leading garden counselor of RHS, says, "for example, plants grown in transferable farming containers are particularly popular among residential renters because such cultivation containers can be included in change if necessary".
According to the HTA report, the years 1997-2005 were the flourishing period of the resale in the garden sector, as housing ownership and property increased from the end of the '80s to the mid-90s.
The report also predicts that this year, thanks to better weather conditions, since last year's March and April's weather was worse.
Turkey interrogates US diplomats for the Spying Report
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has invited the most experienced diplomat in the United States to report on the report on the spying by the Americans and British in Turkey.
According to Vice-President Bulent, the U.S. Ambassador and the Turkish authorities discussed the report on Monday.
The German Der Spiegel magazine The Intercept wrote that the documents from the former analyst Edward Snowden leaked by the US National Security Agency (NSA) reveal that Turkey was the main spy object of the U.S. and UK intelligence services.
According to the Turkish news offices, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan deduced the importance of the report, saying that all major countries have been spying on each other.
The previous report on the spy of the German main intelligence service in Ankara produced a more angry reaction in the Turkish Government.
Cannes winner Croze is performing in the new Finnish film
The Canadian actress Marie-Josée Croze, who was present in several success reports, is attached to the female main part in the new Finnish film.
Croze plays director in Mikko Kuparisen's film for 2 nights in the morning, which starts this week in Lithuania.
Croze won the best female prize for the Cannes movie party in the movie invasion of the Barbars in 2003.
He has been performing, among other things, in the film Steven Spielberg, Munich and Julian Schnabel in the perhone glass flower.

The film will receive Finland's first night in September 2015.
Chief of Police, Mallorcan Magaluf, accused of corruption
Those who showed the case presented evidence of extortion by police and Calvià’s city government officials at the Mallorca Public Prosecutor’s Office on Friday.
The police officer of Calvià, located on the Mallorca Holiday Island, has been arrested for the moist celebration as a result of corruption charges presented by the movement and bar owners of the known Magaluf region.
Captain José Antonio Navarro was imprisoned after several business owners of the Punta Ballena street presented corruption charges against him. The Punta Ballena street is located most of the Magaluf bars and nightclubs.
According to Mallorca Diario, according to the report published in the network, evidence of extortion by police and Calvià city government officials at the Mallorca Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
The Spanish National Guard arrested two other local police officers in connection with corruption charges, and they are interrogating the judge with Navarro.
ABC wrote about the angered authorities of the owners of the nightclubs, a country-wide journal, which significantly troubled their business.
"There is no more money, but survival," said one of the owners to the court.
You're not destroying our business.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was in many countries in the magazine titles this summer, when the online YouTube video was spread, where 18-year-old British holidayr had had oral sex with 24 men during the so-called pub crawl.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to control the drunken and uncontrolled use of the lobbyists of Magaluf by reducing the number of participants in male, alcohol-driven pubs.
In addition, the Playhouse nightclub, where the oral sex video was filmed, was scheduled to be closed for a year, and fines were jointly imposed on Carnage, the owner of the nightclub and the organiser of the pub crawl.
Especially among young British tourists, the popular Magaluf tourist destination has also become popular by the so-called balconing trend, which has caused several accidents caused by alcohol use when people have jumped from the balcony to the hotel pool or balcony.
The children of Israel return to school after the Gaza War
Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in bombguards, when rockets and grenades bombed their communities in the war of Israel and Hamas for 50 days, and schools remained closed when the region recovered from battles.
The opening of schools caused joy and excitement in the bombing of rockets in the southern Israeli communities, but the remains of the battles are still visible.
In the southern Ashdod city of Pashosh day home, workers removed fragments from the walls and slippery before children arrived at the rocket in the daycare.
"We are a little frightened, but also excited," says Ronit Bart, who lives in a Kibbuts called Saad, an Israeli community, and works as an English teacher at the city school.
Many children living in this area need a lot of routines.
Bart's 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, thinks he's going back to school in a long time.
"We've had some difficult times when we didn't leave home anywhere," he says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbuts near the border of Gaza.
Before the last week's fire break, thousands of people of the border regions like Sad had stayed inside or left homes to safer areas away from Gaza to escape the fire of rockets and grenades.
Many of the inhabitants of Nahal Oz community in the vicinity of the Gaza Front are suspicious of the return of the Palestinian grenades killed by a 4-year-old boy in the community.
According to the Ministry of Education, the right ten families hadn't returned yet.
The children of these families have been invested in alternative schools so far.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjahu visited the school at Sderot, a city near the Gaza border, under a heavy Palestinian fire.
He encouraged children to study hard and promised that "children are being trained and safe".
Israel and Hamas agreed on the current fire break last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately interrupted the battles, but it did not bring a solution to many key issues, such as the demand of Hamas to remove Israel and Egypt and to reopen the Gaza Air and Sea Roads.
Israel wants to take away the weapons of Hamas and restore the body of two Israeli soldiers who fell in the war.
In Egypt, the beginning of the new indirect negotiation round is expected later this month.
According to Palestinian and UN estimates, more than 2 100 Palestinians died in the war, three quarters of which were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has disagreed with the number of dead, according to which at least half of the dead were soldiers, although it had no lasting evidence of this.
On the side of Israel, 66 soldiers and six civilians died, including a Thai worker.
In battles, Hamas and other Gazan soldiers fired 4 591 rockets and grenades in most of the cities of Israel in the south.
For Israel’s army, over 5 000 air attacks and other attacks were carried out.
Israel’s attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and it was estimated that 250 000 people fled to shelter for more than 100 UN schools that had been converted into temporary shelters.
When tens of thousands of people were still under cover and during the fights, school authorities moved the school to begin last week.
"I hope that the school will soon open and we will be able to go back to school, just like the rest of the children in the world and just like the Jewish children in the city of Gaza," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old.
According to the generally used meter, housing prices have risen most to seven years in the winter months of Australia.
The price index of RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic dwellings in the capital of Australia increased by 1.1 per cent in August, reflected the RP data on Monday.
Over the summer, July and August prices increased by 4.2 per cent, i.e. more than in the same months after 2007.
The annual increase in prices was 10.9 per cent, which is more than twice over the 12 months preceding August 2013, but prices have not risen evenly throughout the country.
According to research director Tim Lawless, Sydney and Melbourne are at the top of the price increase.
RP Data results show that the prices of dwellings rose by 16.1 per cent in Sydney and in Melbourne by 11.7 per cent in the previous year.
The housing markets in Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin are now the most vibrant; the average price increase is 5 to 6 per cent.
The weakest housing markets are in Canberra, where prices increased by only 1.4 per cent per year as a result of government expenditure cuts.
According to Lawless, the spring started in Australia increases the number of dwellings sold in the coming months, which is a real test for the housing market.
"In view of the increase in the sales of auctioned dwellings, the overall high sales rate and the continued low level of interest, it is likely that the price of dwellings continues to increase over the next three months," says Lawless.
The new Gösta Museum has drawn record audiences from Mänt
The new museum and art have attracted record audiences to Mänt this summer.
By the end of August, more than 70 000 visitors have visited the Serlachius Art Museum.
The new Gösta Museum was opened in June, and there have been some classic works of pop art from Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.
Mänttän’s artweek again told us on Monday he made a visitor record when 14 500 visitors were visited this summer at the moment of the Wait event.
These figures have not been used to.
The people have shredded from doors and windows," says the director of Pauli Sivonen Serlachius.
Sivonen estimates that throughout the year the number of visitors will come to the Serlachius museums this year to converge with hundreds of thousands.
Over the previous years there have been some 40 000 visitors.
There are about 11 000 inhabitants in Mänttä-Vilppula in the middle of Tampere and Jyväskylä.
The museum director Sivonen reminds me that the new museums are always open to phenomena.
"The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent," he says.
It is hoped that the art season will continue far beyond the summer.
In the autumn, new exhibitions will be opened at the Art Museum.
The police are investigating four of the stolen in Kajaan last few days.
Sunday night, the Northlankadue broke into the business property by breaking the window.
The author had received a small amount of money from the cash machine.
Between Thursday and Monday, there were stolen fuel from the tank of a truck on the deep-boy street.
The boat had been taken from the port of the retreat between Sunday and Monday with the boat with the trailers.
The warrior boat was a fish-palta-marked outdoors light and indoors yellowing.
The inner wire read the text "OIVA".
A couple of suspects stealing the cops had a chance to get caught.
On Sunday night, the Tikkapuronti was broken into a business property.
The cop dog got a trace, and a 20-year-old paltamo man was found hiding under a tree in the woods.
On Monday, the police caught another man in Paltamo who was suspected to have been committed to the same fracture.
Lost amphetamine brought a murder charge in Kajaan
The disappearance of a ten - gram amphetamine resulted in a murder charge to a cajanian man born in 1977.
According to the prosecutor, the man had gone to the apartment with his open spouse and another man and shot a shotgun as a drug exporter of his suspected home owner, a cajanian woman, 34 years old.
The defendant dismissed the accusation and claimed the other man who was with him as a shooter.
The case came to the police's attention when the police patrol stopped the passenger car with a couple of clothes used for blood work.
In addition to the burnt garments, the car found a cut-off shotgun.
The right of Kainuu to take a judgment later.
August was rarely warm in many places.
According to the Air Science Institute, the average time of August is once more than 10 years.
The statistics of the ATM show that the average temperature in the country was higher than normal.
In most parts of the country, the deviation was one to two degrees.
Because of July and August's pearls, the whole summer became more warm than usual.
During the summer, the highest temperature was measured in Por, the first week of August, where the meter showed 32.8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says, my father never hugged me.
He never said he loved me.
Henry was born in Dudley in the Midlands region of Britain in 1958 from Jamaika, seven children.
Henry's father worked at the factory and died when Henry was 19, and the son and dad had a distant relationship.
Henry is currently practicing for the Rudy's Rare Records comedy show, which is partly based on his father's imaginary discussion, which has been developed on the basis of a series of Radio 4 channels.
The sound tracks are a mixture of reggaeta and rape in the upbeat-tape.
Henry's had to go through the sick children's memories.
He's been on therapy several times after his mother's death, and he thinks a lot about his relationship with his father.
Dad was very difficult to read.
His face was never seen, but the voice said, "Stop the noise."
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I'm looking at the cricket now.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were already adults when I was a child, went to the pub with my father and discussed, for example, the shape of the beer puppet or the beauty of the cricket night.
I never talked to him about such things.
Most of my life, he was the smileless man in the corner, reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metal melting plant in Dudley, and thus gained an idea of what his father’s life must have been like, although working conditions are better now than at that time.
Nowadays, the melts are a little lighter, but they are practically dark, smoked, labyrintic depths with flames, smoke, and noodles, which bring back to mind the cereal.
The father used to go to a bath and only lie in the bathtub, and slowly he began to sing himself when he washed the melted dirt out of himself.
When walking around the melting cabin, I realized that he had been doing that job for years to get us food to the table, and I began to appreciate him more.
Nevertheless, Henry’s childhood lacked the closeness offered by parents.
My father never hugged and never said he loved me.
Only when my mother began to sicken a little before she died, we began to repeat each other that we loved each other.
Henry has a daughter named Billie Dawn French, and through his own child, he has been able to share the love he lacked when he was a child.
Do you have to repeat "I love you"?
Stop hugging!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why wouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's still a good friend with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn's a good person.
Why wouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the reasons that led to Mom's death.
When I started suffering from a lot of overweight and diabetes symptoms, my doctor told me to make a full translation.
After that, I began to exercise a lot, and I also had to start hard diet to reduce the symptoms.
It's very difficult.
And boring.
No one enjoys eating carrots.
Henry's well-known, short beard may be describing his change during career development.
After receiving a lot of good feedback from the critics of his role as Othello, he has fallen into making a theater.
The next was the Comedy of errors and August Wilson’s Fences ("Aidat").
The theater's making offers a different experience than the sitcoms and the comedy Henry's been doing throughout his busy career.
Henry started in the field while he was only 16 years old at the factory.
A dishman noticed him on the stage making imitations and contacted the New Faces performance competition.
Henry's TV career started in the middle of the '70s. "Why long I was the only black imitator and comic on TV," he says.
Henry learned the job when he did it.
I had to grow up in the light bowl of the public, I had to learn to make jokes from the slide in 1975-1985 while living in starship and on television. It was a difficult time.
Lenny at the New Faces Performance Competition in 1975
Henry's manager had the right to play at the Black and White Minstrel Show, the light entertainment program, where the people appeared in black-eyed makeup, so Henry ended up in a comic program for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I had never participated in it, but I do not regret it.
Although my position was strange and deplorable, I was able to work in huge events and learn how to deal with the public.
Yet, "the awarded, multi-year favorite and light entertainment program" was "short parody of black people".
Henry worked in a second series of comedys in the '80s, where both jokes were made and admired the black British culture.
The Lenny Henry Show's first episode was shown in 1984, and Henry was known in the '90s, including his character as a cook in Gareth Blacklock as a comedy series of Chef!
Henry spent the next decade with commercials, documents, TV series and film sections, but after his LennyHenry.tv series in BBC in 2008, he said to himself, "What are you going to do next, Len – now it looks like you're just on your spot or on the sidelines".
Next was the documentary series of Radio 4 "What's So Great About...?".
The first part was Shakespeare.
I've always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It was not really properly taught to us at school, and I think it belonged to a white middle class using socks and with money.
That's why the Shakespeare theme raised fear in me.
All the people we interviewed in the program – Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench – said to me, "Come on.
Don't abandon the whole idea until you know what you're talking about.
You're going to date words and understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry said 20 radius of Othello's last speech for the documentary, and he was sold.
I felt I could do this.
It almost felt like some of me had been missing earlier, and now it was put in place.
"That's what it's about, this is important, so take it seriously, learn your text, do a small background study.
So the training process was rough, and I read the play for months before it was carried out.
Eventually, the play was a success.
Apparently, it was expected to fail, but that wasn't exactly what happened.
Soon afterwards, Henry played the main part in the comedy of the misunderstandings.
Suddenly, I acted at the British National Theater, and I couldn't believe it as true.
At one point, I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There were technical problems once in the play, and Henry clearly felt that it was his job to entertain the audience.
"The small voice in my mind said to me, "You have to do 10 minutes alone until the computer works again."
Instead, the director's assistant announced that the presentation will be resumed as soon as the problem has been corrected.
I walked out of the stage, and some of me were curious of relief.
It's not my duty.
I can leave it to others.
"You're part of the play, stay in your role"
Henry's "Fences" show at the Duchess Theater
It was challenging to learn the "Fences" show.
The panic is a good thing. It makes a person more sustainable.
This play was also well accepted, so it was like a sign from the gods; "This is what you must do."
This is what Henry, of course, says by voice.
So I decided to stay here.
I love this work sincerely.
I love rehearsal rooms.
However, Henry is still essentially a comic: small humorboys are constantly interrupting our discussions when he switches from imitation to one.
Abstance from the Stand-up committee is a question of will, as it seems dangerous to receive immediate thanks to the unknown public.
If you keep stirring it, it can lead to a dead end.
I sometimes spend a lot of time at the Apollo Theatre when it feels like it, but in general, it will no longer stimulate me in the same way as I used to.
I'm gonna ask Henry if he's gonna go to another stand-up tour again.
For me, it is a real joy to sit together with the director that will help me edit the whole journey from the beginning, the middle stage and the end, and I do not think that I would ever want to give up that feeling.
So this is his new birth?
I think so.
I like acting.
It's really funny.
The show keeps telling the story, and I'm enjoying it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenia is preparing a register of officials to remove "the ghost workers"
Kenia has begun to produce a biometric register of officials in attempting to remove "depressed workers" from the government's payroll lists.
Employees who did not report to the register during the next two weeks would no longer receive salary were notified in the Government's communication.
The government suspects that thousands of people will continue to pay salary after they have left their official duties.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to break public corruption after entering office in 2013.
According to earlier inspections carried out this year, at least a million dollars spent on wages and other economic abuses of ghost workers.
The government suspects that wages will be paid to the account even after the person has died or left his official mission, the Wanyama Chebusiri of BBC reports about Nairobi in the capital city.
All officials shall report themselves to the register during the next weeks at the identification centres in order to ensure that their data is stored in a biometric registration form, reported in the Government's communication.
According to this information, any person who fails to do so for a reason shall be removed from the payroll lists.
"This measure will consider the public sector to be rationalised considerably, as it will define how many people really work in their tasks, and this will clean up wage lists at both levels of the government, so that the problem of ghost workers will be resolved," says Anne Waiguru, an official of the Office of the Minister for Disordering and Design.
The result of the 2015 financial year of the Seinäjoki may remain a deficit of EUR 25.5 million unless the city adjusts its activities and expenditure developments in a tight economic situation.
On the basis of the current budget preparation, the annual ceiling is about 9.4 million in deficits.
Potential enhancement measures were to cover the scale and level of services, as well as the purchases of services, the sale and grants of assets, and the increase in tax and payment revenues.
Of the 10 million euros of investments, the total target for deduction is 8.5 million.
There's no relief to the localities.
The new obligations imposed on the municipalities, the insufficient increase in tax revenues, the increase in unemployment and the 5% cut in state shares further undermine the prospects.
The purpose of the economic seminar is to look for new ways to balance the economy.
The city government is unanimous that savings must be achieved.
The ship must be translated into the strategy target, says Kimmo Heinonen, President of the City Government.
The City Government also returned the presentations made for the preparation of the management group.
The proposals of the City Government are the basis for the preparation of the budget in the Council's economic seminar in Fram on Monday 8 September.
Following the mandate seminar, the draft budget will proceed through the Board of Governors to the City Government and to the City Council.
Ten Turkish police officers arrested as suspected of a "joo" against the government
All 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey as suspected of "government plots", local media sources tell us.
The police did not immediately comment.
According to Hurriyet Daily News, 14 senior police officers were arrested.
Some of the police were involved in the investigations of corruption in the last December, targeted by government officials, including four Ministers of Government.
In July, several police officers were arrested in Turkey in charge of organising a broad criminal community and monitoring phones.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who acted as Prime Minister during that period) said that the police activities were part of the action planned against Fethullah Gullenin, Islamist Director.
Not all children will return to school in Ukraine
Most of the schools in Ukraine opened their doors on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This is a traditionally important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk also took his daughter to school.
At the same time he told the prospective journalists that not all schools have reopened, but he said he was committed to defending the country for future generations:
The first day of September was not celebrated in every school.
There is no peace in all Ukraine.
We have to fight for peace.
The whole Ukraine, the entire Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Aleksan Pastukhov, who serves as a leading teacher at Slavianski's school, where Yatsenyuk's daughter visits, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally come back and that children can learn something that will benefit them in the future.
The festivals of the first school day include traditionally children’s written shirts, balloons and flowers to teachers.
According to Perry of Texas, the tweet was unauthorized.
In the middle of this hearing, a picture of the democrats' district attorney was sent from the Twitter account confirmed by the governor Rick Perry of Texas on Sunday night.
The Tweet was later removed, followed by a new tweet where Perry swore that he had nothing to do with the picture.
The Tweet was sent unauthorized from my account.
"I do not accept tweet and I have deleted it," said the later publication.
Perry's background forces did not immediately respond to requests for clarification.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry's fixed Twitter account, it is unclear who published the picture.
The first tweet included a distraction from Travis' district attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, sentenced to the Driving Drinking in April 2013.
Perry prevented the funding of Lehmberg's office when he refused to resign, which led to the meeting of the large jury in Austin this month when Perry was accused. Perry is a possible candidate for the 2016 presidential elections.
Tweet's title was: "I don't always drive drunk, three times more proms... but when that happens, I blame governor Perry for showing his finger."
I'm the drunkest democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office did not lead a large jury investigation against Perry.
The investigation was conducted by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor in San Antionio, appointed by the Republican Judge.
Perry has said he's innocent and has called the accusations politically.
His influential judiciary team has asked the judge in charge to reject the charges and said that the law on the basis of which the most distant governor in Texas is unexplained against the Constitution.
Perry cut EUR 7.5 million of State aid to a public infraction unit operating in Travis County and conducting public sector charges when Lehmberg refused to resign.
The decision of Perry received an official complaint from the follow-up team on the left.
Perry’s fixed Twitter account is regularly updated – and sometimes also famously.
After the fifth place at the Iowa Election Conference in 2012, Perry threatened to end up in the match by publishing a picture on Twitter on the lake "Here comes, South Carolina!".
Berkeley says the housing market is "normal" again.
One of the most important buildings in London has warned that the housing market in south-eastern England has "returned" to the normal level of activity.
The capital of London’s dwellings has suffered a huge demand and a sharp increase in prices, fearing a widely spreading credit bubble, which led the Bank of England to set restrictions on mortgage loans in June.
The founder of Berkeley and President Tony Pidgley, a high-level builder, said on Monday that "from the beginning of the financial year, the market and the number of shops have returned to normal after the year 2013," and added that this has enabled the "standable operating environment".
During the recession of the London housing market, foreign investors went well to the capital by flocks.
According to the country register, the prices of dwellings in the city rose by 18.5 per cent only in the previous year and thus clearly exceeded the average of England and Wales, which was 6.7 per cent.
The average sales prices for private, affordable and student buildings in Berkeley rose in about the fifth year before the end of April, reaching an increase of GBP 423 000.
However, the strengthened pound has made London's property less attractive in recent months - a part of the interest has also been affected by new real estate tax laws and political retourism from possible "card tax" before the May general elections.
Last week, the London real estate broker Foxtons warned that the April mortgage report, which reported more stringent borrowing orders, would lead to a lower level of market growth both in terms of the sales volumes of property and prices in the second half of the year.
The recent data from the Bank of England showed on Monday that the number of approved loans decreased in July, which refers to cooling housing markets.
Real estate broker Hamptons International has declined its 2015 forecast of London property prices, according to which prices fall by 3%, because the index of housing owners' opinion prices has already weakened.
The number of shops made in the most expensive areas of London in Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has fallen in the quarter of a year ago, the real estate broker WA Ellis tells us.
However, the demand for homes in the capital is a blessing to Berkeley, who raised income from sold property to over 2.2 billion pounds.
Pidgley added that "the demand for a well-planned, correct product at the best locations has remained stable and therefore has remained sharp".
In June, the company reported that it sold 3 742 new homes in the year preceding April, which is almost a third more than the peak of the economic crisis in 2007.
The annual profits calculated before taxes increased by 40 per cent over the year, thus GBP 380 million and turnover by 18 per cent to GBP 1.6 billion.
On Monday, before the company's annual meeting, Pidgley told me that Berkeley's year's earnings were equivalent to the current market expectations.
The analysts agree that GBP 450 million pre-tax profit throughout the year.
In the afternoon, Berkeley's stock was sold on the London stock market at a price of £23.96.
The hacker leaked Jennifer Lawrence's naked pictures on the network
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th annual Academy Awards awards.
A hacker who claims to hold a hundred other pictures of the Oscar actress, Jennifer Lawrence's dressing pictures on the web.
The star of hunger confirmed that the images were genuine and condemned by the hacker for "feeling privacy".
The authorities have been contacted, and everyone who publishes the stolen pictures of Jennifer Lawrence will get accusations.
The photos that were originally published on the 4chan image publishing page were apparently mishandled because of the weakness of Apple's iCloud recording system. There are dozens of other females on the list of hundreds of other hackings, such as Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed.
It is not known how much of the images are real, although Scott Pilgrim against the World Star Winstead condemned hacking in Twitter.
"For those who look at pictures taken in the privacy of my husband and me years ago: hopefully you will have a good mind," your Winstead twiitta.
However, the Victoria Justice of Nickolodeon's "iCarly" and "Victorious" series said that the authenticity of the images and the twisted that "the so-called naked images of me are DEFINITIONS, don't you understand."
Let me finish this right now.
On Sunday late, BuzzFeedin announced that pop star Ariana Grande's representative forbided the authenticity of the images about the star.
The only thing we have to do is take Howard Jacobson's new novel about love and j letter.
They were dissolved, it was the best thing that ever happened, and gradually they were separated from the rainy box.
Only occasionally, he heard from a woman that was too serious, intensive, intensive, distracted, and perhaps also a little bit sneaky.
That's when he squeezed his hand.
He recognized the giant.
Yeah, he was sneaky like a silk.
His last victim had been in the early stage, however, a relationship that had been promising; it had appeared that this relationship could have facilitated his lonely boredom, and it might have brought even some content in his life.
The Ailinn Solomons had unstoppable hair, and he was a delicate, delicate, delicate heart of joy, from the northern village, which was even worse and farther from everything than Port Reuben.
He had come south with an older traveling partner, whom Kevern assumed to be his aunt. Aunt had inherited a house that was located in a wet but paradise valley, and the valley was appropriately named in the paradise valley.
No one had lived in the house in years.
The tubes bleeded, all the bathrooms had spiders, the ethanes had left their tracks in the windows, keeping the whole place their own, the garden grew in weeds, which reminded the giant crawlheads.
The cottage was like children's plot, at the same time threatening and magical, a garden full of secrets.
According to the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is subject to the Booker Literary Prize in 2014.
Conditions will be published next week
Kevern had sat in hand with Ailin on broken terrace chairs in the middle of a long hay, enjoying a surprising warm spring afternoon, both listening to a distractive reception, through which the whole country heard calming music and calming news, when Ailin’s crossed, the sun’s brown feet brought to Kevern’s mind a song that had long ago been sang by a forgotten black performer, and his father had often listened to the cabin beams down.
Your leg's too big.
Such songs were predominantly too aggressive and no longer played in the receiver.
They were not prohibited — nothing was actually prohibited — they were simply no longer called.
They were wanted to leave them unforgettable, as did the word themselves.
The general opinion did not achieve what the laws and the declarations were made: just as in the literacy, people chose to read the memorials of the heroes, cooking books and romances, for music they favoured ballades.
As the day was devastated, Kevern began to pick up a imaginary piano and sing a cerenade to Ailin's big feet with a rude comic voice.
The Linn didn't understand.
"It was the famous song of Jazzpianist Fats Waller," Kevern told him, and naturally lifted two fingers before his mouth.
This is how his father always did before the "j" letter was allowed to escape from his lips.
It had begun as a game between him and his father when he was small.
His father told me he played the same game with his father.
If you let the word j begins with your mouth and you didn't remember to raise two fingers before your mouth, you had to pay for a penny.
It wasn't very funny at the time, and it wasn't it now.
He knew they were expecting it from him, that's all.
He was supposed to explain what jazz is.
Ailinn had never heard that.
Neither was Jazz actually declared forbidden, but it was not just called.
Improvation was no longer in fashion.
There was room in life for only one word.
When the song began, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
The same thing had happened to cleverness.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was the cleverness of music.
Although Kevern had not heard Sammy Davis Junior by the age of 10, Jazz music had become familiar to him through his father's spouse's CD collection.
Well, at least he didn't have to tell Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
Considering Ailin’s age, it was likely that he did not remember the time when popular singers were not black.
There was no need for laws or forcedness, either.
The sound society meant that each of its parts accepted as grateful — thanks to them as they were saved in the trade of happiness — the principle that each group did natural things.
Based on their Temperament and physical characteristics, people with afro-Caribbean genital roots are best suited to entertain and athlete, so they sang and ran.
Originally, those of the continent of India were like naturally talented with electrical equipment, so their task was to ensure that each family had a working phone used to handle matters.
Those left of the Polish community worked as pipers; the last Greeks broke the plate.
When SE, WHEN THE FREE, JOS TAPAHTU had come true, they were from the Gulf and Middle East, whose grandparents had not fled in fear of being accused of flames and fearing that they would come after them, they opened restaurants in which labneh yogurt was served and burned with water pipe, and continued their lives to look at them as creatures and bored.
Let everyone act according to their gifts.
Ailinn had heard only ballads, and he was difficult to understand how the insulting words that Kevern just singing had ever been put into music.
Through music, love was expressed.
"They're not really offensive," said Kevern.
Except maybe the big-foots think.
My father never hurt anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the abandoned garden created an illusion of safety.
No word would pass through the sound insulation of the giant cabbage leaves.
But it didn't make sense.
Why did your father love something like that?
He was going to say that the whole thing was a joke, but he didn't want to raise two fingers in his lips with Ailin.
The Tilin thought he was weird now.
"It was funny for Dad," he said.
The Blunt snapped his head in disbelief, and his hair covered the field of vision of Kevern.
There's nothing else to see in the whole world than Ailin's huge, spleen black hair soft.
That's all he wanted to see.
"If you say that," he said, but he didn't sound convincing.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
It seemed to be a real confusion.
Are my legs that big?
He looked again.
Your legs aren't really big.
Your ankle, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was still too early for it.
"I think you're charming because of your thick ankles," he tried to fix the situation.
I'm twisted in that sense.
This didn't help.
He wanted it to sound funny.
Often, when he wanted to entertain, the effect was quite different, because, like his father, he lacked the convincing charm that could control the cruelty of jokes.
Maybe his father meant to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same thing.
Despite his favorite eyes.
The Blind Solomons blushed and rose up from his terrace chair, and poured down the receiver, and shredded the wine they had just drank.
The wine was made only from a backbone, so he couldn't use it as a cause of a colliding.
In her nervousness, she seemed to shake like palm tree leaves in a storm.
"And your thick head is what makes me charming in you," he said...
Except I don't feel like it.
Kevern was sorry for Ailin, both for his own unnecessarily cruel words and for the fear that appeared in his eyes at the moment that Ailinn decided to stand against him.
Did Ailinn think he'd hit you?
He had never told Kevern about life in a hygiene northern island where he had grown, but Kevern was sure that it had basically been the same as life here.
The same enormous, hygiene sea that waved against them.
The same confusing men, though after TAPAL, even more slim and devilish than their smuggler and degrading grandparents, went from pub to pub, ready to hit every woman who dares to resist or to provoke them.
A thick head?
He'd see a thick fist if he wasn't careful!
Smoke first — kissing had become the most common word of the erotic encounter of a man and woman; the antidote of the unprofitable love ballads that pump out the receiver — first suck and then attack.
Kevern also thought that it was too much, for it was already hostile.
The body language of Tilin Solomons told him to leave.
He pulled himself up from the terrace chair like an old man.
Ailinn also felt exhausted, but the depth of Kevern’s sorrow surprised him.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
The Tilin followed him — just as his traveling partner watched Kevern go out the upstairs window — a man who was responsible for his own heavy life.
Adam's leaving the garden, he was thinking.
He felt pity for Kevern and men in general, even though some of them had lifted their hands against him to hit him.
A man who turned his mind into a bower, shameful, beaten, who had lost all the desire to fight — why did he feel that the vision was so familiar to him, even though he did not remember that he had ever seen such things before this moment?
When Ailinn Solomons was alone again, he looked at his feet.
A few years before the event just described, a smart and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher Esme Nussbaum, who worked in a private facility in Ofnow, did a brief study on the continuation of minor and medium-sized violence in the areas of the country where the decline of violence, or the ending of violence, was most likely, taking into account the money and energy used to eradicate it.
"A lot has already been achieved, and much has not yet been done," he wrote, "that can be balanced for thousands of years and most of the natural aggressiveness of the people who have won, especially in the abandoned and outer cliffs, where, despite the churches across the fences, human legacy has been rarely known in time.
However, some things will not be completely removed.
The higher the tower, the lower the desires it gives.
The people weep with sentimental ballads, the stories about vivid contradictions and the virtues of marriage and family life, while the old-fashioned cruelty is kept in an unsteady manner in taking both rural communities and urban housing areas, and there is evidence of a new, malicious opportunity to fight at homes, at work, on our streets and even in playgrounds.
"You have a regrettable tendency to dramatize," his director commented after reading the whole report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum dropped his eyes on the ground.
In addition, I have to ask, ‘ Are you an atheist? ’
"I believe I don't have to answer that," said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme continued to appeal to his right not to answer personal questions.
Feminist?
Once again, silence.
"I don't ask," said Luther Rabinowitz, "as I oppose atheism, lesbian sexism and feminism.
This job does not hold prejudices.
We are servants of unprecedented society.
Although a certain type of hypersensitivity is self-acceptable and respectable, it may sometimes lead to distorted outcomes, which you have just presented to me.
Clearly, you have something against the church — and what you call cruel or evil spirit, others usually call natural energy and physical strength.
It's like it happened yesterday, if it happened above all, that the fundamental vital vitality of the country would be destroyed.
Esme Nussbaum looked around when Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind the head of Rabinowitz, the flamingo pink LED light declared the direction that Ofnow had distributed to the country for a quarter or longer of the previous century.
Smile with your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to your ballades, go to music, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Talking is better than silence and singing the word is better than written, but nothing wins love.
"I understand well what you want to say", Esme Nussbaum answered with a quiet voice when he was sure that his director had stopped, "and I just want to say that we are not as effectively healed as we think we are.
I am concerned that, if we are not warned, we will reiterate the same mistakes that originally led to SIIHEN, what it was like, JOS TAPAHTU.
This time, though, we do not pour out our hatred and our distrust to others.
Luther Rabinowitz made a pyramid on his fingers.
This gesture meant endless patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "when you're depicting 'wrongs' the actions our grandparents may have done or not done.
You also go too far when you say that they poured out their hatred and their untrust to others."
A person like you should not be reminded that when it comes to understanding the past, or defending the present, we are not talking about 'we' or 'they'.
There was no 'we' or 'other'.
It was chaos' time, that's all we know about it.
"If we are absolutely honest, in that chaos," Esme dared to continue, "No group of society can say that he was acting well.
I don't blame anyone.
What was done was good or bad.
That's when it was.
There is no need to talk about this – we agree on this.
And just as it is unnecessary to share accusations, there is no need to make corrections, whether they were appropriate or not, and even if there is a way to do them.
But for what is there for the past if we don't learn from it --
The past exists so we can forget it.
If there's one more thing I can add...
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
"I'm going through your report," he said and expressed Esmen's time to leave.
The next day, when he was working in a normal way, he was hit by a motorcycle driving on the sidewalk, which was described by the drivers of driving as "sacred and mad."
There's an accident.
The Lesotho Army forbids its planned attack; the Prime Minister stays in South Africa
The officials of the Lesotho army have refused to frame an attack on the government's assault and said that they acted against a police officer suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane escaped from the country, saying that the army had surrounded his official apartment and took over the government buildings in the capital city of Masero.
The Head of State traveled with his family to the neighbourhood of South Africa after telling that there was a threat of death.
Major Ntle Ntoi, a military representative, said that the military responded to this threat from "political fanatics", said the police tried to arm the fanatics.
“The military forces of Lesoto took action following a number of intelligence that some police forces were trying to arm young party fanatics when they were ready to cause problems,” he told the Voice of America’s News Office.
According to Clayson Monyela, the President of the South African Government, the military activities appeared to be a revolutionary attempt.
"Although none of the parties have claimed that they have revoked the government by means of force, the actions of the Lesoto Defence Forces seem to be on all sides equivalent to the signs of the revolutionary company," he says.
According to officials of the Lesotho army, soldiers return to their barracks on Sunday, and there was a peaceful atmosphere in the capital.
In the meantime, Vice-President Mothetjoa Metsing will lead the government while Thabane is gone.
Thabane says he believes he's been targeted because he's tried to fight corruption.
There have been tensions in Lesotho since June, when Thabane interrupted the parliamentary sessions because of the differences between the large coalition government.
He denies such a denial of government power, although otherwise claimed.
Trade page: Microsoft sets up a data center for Newland
Microsoft has set up a large data centre for Newland in a place where the company is not willing to specify its location.
In the newsletter sent to Microsoft media, the company notes that it does not indicate the location of all its data centres for safety reasons.
According to Microsoft, the Centre is already fully equipped and connected to the network.
It's a investment for Microsoft for hundreds of millions of dollars.
In the public, Oulu or Kajaan had previously been betched to be the place of the Centre.
Microsoft will complete Oulu’s office, which will take about 500 people to work.
Overall, Microsoft has announced to resign up to 1 050 jobs in Finland.
Microsoft's communication director, Camilla Lindfors, tells STT that the company does not comment on how much staff the new data centre employs.
The creation of the Data Centre to Newland was reported by the Trade Paper on Monday.

Four tips for better underwater images and videos
If you want to take pictures or videos under water, you have several different devices to choose.
The most advantageous option is a waterproof, compact point-and-shoot camera, such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or action camera, such as GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which both cost about $300.
I myself took these pictures at the family party using several different cameras, each of which cost less than $ 350.
Regardless of the device, there are some rules that should be followed.
Always check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the camera's battery and other parts are waterproofly closed.
Set the camera description settings to match the images or video to be taken.
In some cameras or camera and video camera combinations, there is a setting to optimize the conditions of description under the water.
Also — before jumping into the water, make sure you can take your device deep.
Some cameras are only 5 feet of depth, others up to 50-60 feet of depth.
See both the usual and waterproof models in our shopping guide and the reviews of digital cameras.
Take a number of photos — many of them fail somehow.
Compact cameras have a LCD display that allows you to compact the picture, while action cameras often do not have this feature.
Even if you have a LCD, it's hard to see underwater, and it can either succeed or fail.
So take a number of pictures.
If your camera allows you to harness, which means taking several images at a time with different settings, use this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
The light will fall significantly deeper.
If possible, stay close to the surface when you describe the pool, lake or sea.
This will also give you more colors; the deeper you go, the less colors you see.
Try to get close to the describable object.
This is an important advice in the land description, but even more important underwater, because the light conditions are weak.
It is very important when an action camera is used: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide angle of image, i.e. the imaging device must be close to the target so that the target meets the entire frames of the image.
China does not allow Hong Kong to choose its leaders – demonstrators swear to revenge
On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided that the Hong Kong electorates should not choose candidates in election in 2017, despite the unrest of democratic reform.
The decision is likely to give a spark to Hong Kong's business block after the start of activists to design and implement demonstrations only hours after the publication of the decision.
The decision of the People's Congress of China in practice gives Communists the power to eradicate all candidates who do not obey Beijing.
"This was expected, but it's still annoying," says Chairman of the Democrat Party, legislator Emily Lau.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They've lied to the Hong Kongers.
It is clear that we are working with a self-righteous government.
Mr Li Fei, the Deputy Secretary-General of the Committee of the People's Congress of China, defended the Chinese administration, saying that the general candidate for the Hong Kong leader would be too chaotic.
Since 1997, when the United Kingdom gave up Hong Kong China, Beijing promised the inhabitants of the region that it would be able to choose its own leader from 2017 onwards.
According to Chinese leaders, the Sunday decision was a democratic breakthrough because it would allow Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but it also makes it clear that China wants to strictly control the electoral process through the appointment committee managed from Beijing.
According to the new clause, only candidates who love the country and love Hong Kong are accepted.
During the summer preceding the decision, Hong Kong organised some of the major and most remarkable protests in the region for years.
The campaign to defend democracy was largely behind the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, which the organisers have threatened to prevent the operation of the business block if Beijing does not grant Hong Kong a genuine universal right to vote.
On Sunday night, only hours after the publication of the decision, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters met in front of rain in Hong Kong’s main government buildings.
In the opinion, the organizers announced that the movement would move to a new era of civil disobedience and that they would bring about protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they apparently did not tell the details, fearing that it would lead to problems with the authorities.
In the communication published in the network, the organisers said that the Movement "to consider Occupy Central as the last means to be put in place only if there is no hope of dialogue and there is no other way".
We are very sorry when we report that today the last chance of dialogue has become obsolete and that the centralisation will take place.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for the Beijing announcement for days, and on Sunday security activities were tight near the government's main buildings, including police and barricades.
In Hong Kong, many people have a feeling that they are slowly losing power from their city.
The wave of arrivals from the mainland has caused competition from products and services.
Furthermore, there is fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of expression, are disappearing under the increasing pressure in Beijing.
Some have criticised the Occupy Central Movement because its demonstrations threaten Hong Kong’s living condition — the business world.
"The test they are talking about can lead to major economic losses, depending on how many people take part in it and how long it will last," says Legislator Regina Ip, who has long criticised the movement.
We don't want to be concerned that Hong Kong is slipping out of our sight.
It would be a bad idea for investing.
There are also stories in the media of the Chinese state that Hong Kong's democratic activists are the gospels of the Western powers of the revolution."

Your U.S. prom tradition hits British universities: private business for new students
We respond to our excited demand by establishing the British first luxury class travel form for students today.
In addition to a private aircraft, the company also provides other means of transport, such as Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1, so that the customer can ensure the most remarkable arrival at the university.
According to Stewart, there is also a safety aspect of the service.
The service is the best possible option for students who would otherwise drag their property across the country through their borders in cars loaded.
When this is linked to many VIF features (VIP-friends), we are ready to offer students today as easy and high-quality transport to the university as possible.
According to the representative of the company, reservations have not yet been made because the service has just been established, but added that "the students will start the orders in the next few weeks".
The company believes that there is a demand for the service, even though most students pay £9,000 annual fees.
Today's students are very different from 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago. Now it's more important than ever to create a remembered first impression, and VIF is the right way to do it.
However, the National Student Organization criticises the service that is not realistic.
According to Mr Megan Dunn, "this service plan seems to be very far away from the majority of students' lives".
Many of the beginers in this month are shocked at the level of living costs, since the financial support available in the form of loans and grants has been left behind from a huge increase in basic living costs, and only then can you begin to wonder where thousands of people would be available for so simple use as to enter campus.

Baseball: Fans inspiring almost too much: Sasu Salin was fainted in the field
Basketball Sasu Salin was the body of Finnish victory today.
He was able to forget about the sysmus of his US fight and twisted the blood of the other half of Ukraine with its standing solutions.
But Salin moved all the glory to the sushiphans and did it in style:
I was going to faint on that field at the end of the field. It was so great.
In my eyes, it was my summ, it couldn't do anything.
That noise and the white public sea were almost too much for me.
The power moments of Salin kept in them nine surfaces at a quick pace, balloon stripes, recorders and temility everywhere.
I don't know how that happened, but I got into a flow mode that everything worked out.
It's just coming from someplace, and now it's just an intelligible place, Sasu's spoiled.
It's my role.
Do all that.
Now it's good to see the others catch up with the plot.
It grabbed the whole gang.
Salin is a team of joy pillars and life-spokens, so no wonder his example raised the entire team to a flight that was too big and hard on the five of Ukraine.
Finland in the MM races after 32 years of break: The previous ones remembered a rude judge game
Heikki Montonen (oik.) bearing the bag was the main coach in Finland at the MM tournament in Argentina in 1982.
It has been 32 years since the Finnish Flying Ball Earth Team played the last time at the end of the MM.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish photographer in the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where legendary Reino Kosonen was Finland's second coach and the current player-agent Jouni Parkkali as a general player.
Kosonen and Parkkali remember one thing about the tournament like yesterday: it was a hot match against France in the beginning.
"The judge's game in that fight was brilliant," recalled Kosonen.
We've already won, and both teams were already set on the backline.
Suddenly, the game was resumed.
We lost it 2-3 and then the shit went more crazy," said Parkkali.
Finland played the chief coach in Heikki Montosen's command and finally settled in the 17th.
Now Finland is again among the world's elections when the MM tournament in Poland is on Saturday today.
Many things have changed dramatically in the international balloon over the past 32 years.
Players' power values are approximately the same as they used to, but quality and skills are now more.
The players' averages have also grown.
The game is faster," thought Parkkali.
But what happens in Poland?
Finland's player material has expanded and the burden can be shared.
I expect Finland to continue from the initial block.
Then you can get tight," judge Kosonen.
Seppo Circle
Olli Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were in a winning fight against Tunisia.
The current player agent Jouni Parkkali was a general player at the MM tournament.
Let's hope we're going to be betrayed by the 17th position.
South Korea and Tunisia should go to jail," said Parkkali.
Specieslegenda Reino Kosonen was the second coach of the country team in Argentina.
Jukka Savio, Mauri Leppänen and Kari Körkkö winded up in the Tunisian fight.
Sauna and evening practice at the Buenos Aires Maritime Church were part of the country team's programme at the MM tournament in 1982.
Kari Kalin (oik.) stretched with his teammates.

The Finnishists saved the Cita dog from the mountain in Norway: "These men deserve all thanks."
When the Norwegian Merethe Mikkelsen and his dogs got into trouble on Thursday at the mountains, Antti and Tuomo Soini boldly offered help.
On the weekend, Mikkelsen was looking for "international heroes" on Facebook so that he could thank his helpers again.
In the public Facebook update, Mikkelsen told him that on Thursday, Cita dog had hurt his bag.
The injured dog was no longer able to walk in a steep terrain.
I tried to carry it down myself, but I couldn't, so I had to let it go.
I tried many times to attract and pull it a little further, but its legs did not just carry it, Mikkelsen writes in his update.
According to Mikkelsen, there was no aid from the police, from the nearby hotel, or from the passers.
In the dark of the night, the situation started to seem threatening.
Fortunately, there were two walkers who were willing to help: Tamperean Antti Soini and his father Judge.
Men had visited the highest mountain in Norway on Galdhøpiggen and headed to his camp site when they saw a woman and a dog in the middle of the mountain.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively calm in relation to the situation.
We offered to help him with the dog, Antti Soini will tell us in his message to the evening-Sanom.
Soon there was also a German man who had a hiking mattress with him.
From Patja to Citalle, they got the pairs to which the injured dog was attached.
The German man came in a moment after us when we had thought about what to do with the dog and carry the dog in a moment from the bottom, Soini tells us.
KUVA: Judgment Soini
The dog could've been loaded down with the expedition mattress.
Soin said that performance was not physically heavy, but it was slow to carry it in a difficult terrain.
However, in about a half an hour, Cita was happy to get down.
After the event, Mikkelsen was still looking for "national heroes" on Facebook so that he could thank them again.
Soins answered him on Sunday, but apparently the German man is still unattainable.
I don't know what I would have done without these heroes, Mikkelsen will be happy.
If they hadn't helped me, we wouldn't necessarily have returned.
I'd like to find these people because I feel like I didn't thank them enough.
I'm sure they don't know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all thanks and honor, I am grateful to them forever.
The night before Monday, the Soins were already on their way home.
They had gotten Mikkelsen happy to hear: "Cita is better now!"

Genetic abnormality is often diagnosed wrongly
For years, the British woman was afraid to die because of the wrong diagnosis.
Karin Rodgers thought most of his youth he had only a few years of life left because he had diagnosed another disease.
He actually suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT). It means a series of hereditary diseases that damage brain and spinal cord external nerves.
According to the Charity CMT UK Goodness Organisation, the wrong diagnosis is a general problem in CMT cases, as it is so little known.
It is estimated that about 23,000 people in Britain suffer from CMT disease, which causes symptoms of motorism, such as muscle weakness, difficult walk and toe pain.
The disease may also cause feeling unconscious or pain, and it is irreversible and progressive, which means that the symptoms become worse within time.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he thought he'd suffer from Friedreich's ataxia (FA) with a very poor survival rate.
Rodgers believed he'd be in a wheelchair before he filled 18 and died before he got 30 years old.
Today, the 51-year-old mother says, "as a child, I knew I couldn't do the same things as the others.
I fell every day, and I lasted longer than anyone else.
I was never able to roll or roll with other children, and I was being bullied at school because I walked and ran differently from the others.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he had several cuts of someonellesjänte to direct his legs. In the event of surgery, he quickly looked into his research papers that said he was suffering from FA disease.
"I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I came home, I checked the disease information in the library and wrote to the FA Association," he says.
When I got information from them, I was shocked and panicked.
I thought I would go to a wheelchair by the age of 18 and die before I filled 25, and in the meantime, I would lose my entire capacity.
I went through this myself and planned my own funeral.
Rodgers tells me that by the age of 17, he said that his walk was not worsened as much as he had thought and asked his doctor about this.
The doctor just hugs me and said, "Daughter darling, I don't think you have this disease because otherwise you'd already be in a wheelchair."
I think you're suffering from something far less dangerous.
Based on some genetic tests, he was diagnosed with CMT.
"When they told me what CMT is, I thought I was postponed," he says.
Charity CMT UK organises a CMT month to pay attention to the disease.

Russia's space test failed - the geks sent to sex died
The five little gecks sent to Russia to increase space have been dead, reports the Russian Federation's Space Organisation Roscosmos in its communication.
Gekos traveled over a month and a half on the Foton-M4 satellite.
The satellite returned to the country on Monday morning at Finland’s time.
The purpose of the test was to examine the reproductive capacity and use of the genes in an irritating state.
One male gig and four females participated in the test.
Although the test sounds strange, it was meant to be serious.
The effects of weight loss on the development of fertile eggs are known to be limited.
Through the effects on gecks, it can be sought to anticipate the effects of weightlessness on humans in a situation similar to longer times, illustrated New Statesman in July.
According to Roscosmos, the date of death and the cause or cause of death of the germs will be settled.
According to Interfax, passengers crossed into "sex sexgirls" were frozen.
Surprisingly, it also shows that the fruit flies traveling along the same Foton-M4 survived the journey, and also gained reproduction.
France arrested a terrorist suspect at Nice Airport
France arrested a suspected man at Nice Airport on Saturday.
A 22-year-old man was suspected to be recruiting a jihadist group in Syria.
The French authorities announced this on Sunday.
The authorities were able to track the man after he had lured a 16-year-old girl to go to Syria with money.
The girl was supposed to fly to Turkey and cross the Syrian border.
The airline did not believe the explanation of the girl that he was going to visit his grandmother in Istanbul, but alarmed the authorities.
The authorities contacted the girl’s father who was completely ignorant of the daughter’s intentions and told the authorities that the family had no family in Turkey.
According to the authorities, he is from Chechnya, but now he lives in France.
The French intelligence authorities had been following the man before.
In France, the authorities have been concerned that radicalized young people attracted to Iraq’s or Syria’s wars constitute a safety risk for France as well.
The authorities estimate that, during the last conflict, some 800 French citizens or those in France have travelled to Syria, returned from Syria or are currently planning to leave Syria.
Copenhagen: We have good chances of winning
The wishes of the basketball country team for the follow-up are in the game when Finland meets Ukraine in the second match of the MM contests today.
If the opening loss for the United States had been expected, Ukraine belongs to the countries for which Finland should take the necessary profits.
Ukraine is a good gang, but I believe that we have a good chance to win, Petter Koponen foresight.
On Saturday, Ukraine struck the first match of the races from 72 to 62 in the Dominican Republic.
The team trains the NBA veteran Mike Fratello, whose commanded Ukraine plays aggressive basketball.
The key player in Ukraine is the game leader Eugene "Pooh" Jeter whose sister Carmelita Jeter is a 100 metre world champion three years ago.

Pooh Jeter is a quick guy, but we've been playing these games before, and we need to get our standard defense fixed, Koponen said.
Hanno Möttölä promised that Finland would play better than last night's loss to the United States.
We need to find our own strength again.
I can assure you that there's a normal wolf span on the field, Möttölä said.
The alleged snake pictures of Hollywood stars spread online - part secured for real
A number of naked images are spread on the Internet, allegedly representing well-known publicity.
Among other things, an actor Jennifer Lawrence has become the victim of a "subject campaign".
The entertainment site TMZ has published the angry comment made by Lawrence’s representatives, which seems to confirm the authenticity of the images.
This is a tremendous violation of privacy.
The authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes (Internet) the stolen images of Jennifer Lawrence will be charged with, representatives will be threatened.
According to the TMZ, actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that the pictures that spread him are real.
He had taken these pictures years ago with his husband.
When I know that those pictures were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine what a creepy trouble was seen for this.
I feel compassion for all those who were victims of hacking, he writes according to the site.
Instead, an actor Victoria Justice calls his own name pictures forgery.
There are also real or fake naked pictures of Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovski and Teresa Palmer.
The Honka-Mailkeeper criticizes his own: "They don't work enough to get out of here."
Football club FC Honka is currently the last place of the Betting Liga.
After the Sunday VPS match, Walter watched the painting, the comments of the sketchy situation of the company are very ambiguous.
I haven't had a goalkeeper coach in four months.
But everything has to be adapted," Viitala said after the battle ended at 1-2.
Honka made a lot of defensive mistakes in the fight, especially in the first half.
The Earthkeeper Viitala wasn't in the mood for a bad defense game.
Player transport has been in Honga this summer, and therefore the defenders in front of Viila have also changed to a steep pace.
As a player, many young players have also received opportunities that they may not even deserve.
"Osa does not work enough to get out of here sometime," said Viitala, without a name for any individual player.
Honga’s chief coach, Shefki Kuqi, was somewhat in agreement with Viita.
"I told certain players after the game that if you come to practice and games to have fun and think you're a betting player, and you don't have to work, you're probably wrong in the team," Kuqi said.
I've given many young people time to play.
If they don't want to take that place and use the opportunity, it's not my fault.
However, Kuqi also reminded us that players cannot expect immediate success when their gambling friends are constantly changing.
This period has not had the same composition twice in a row.
Especially in defence, there's been a change of people.
That is the biggest reason why we are here," said Kuqi.
After the VPS loss, Honka is a serial jumbo, in the second with the last TPS.
There's still seven more rounds of betting, so there's still time for the espools to avoid falling into Ykkös.
I've never dropped a team, and I'm not gonna drop it now.
We are certainly not going to drop out of this series," the goalholder Viitala threatened.

It's been a great time today.
This is what the basketball player Sakari Pehkonen said in 1995, when Finland had played at the EM end tournament against France in the Athenian Marouss ballroom.
The Pehkonen didn't exaggerate.
I remember the game when he was there.
So were about 100 Finns who cried for 20,000 viewers, otherwise noises in noises.
I wonder what Pehkonen would have said 19 years later after the MM game in Finland-Ukraine.
In Bilbao, hundreds of Finnish fans have eighty-fold troops.
The 1995 EM contests were the search time for Finnish basketball.
Men cleaned their way to the final tournament by winning, among other things, Russia's quarrel at the Helsinki Sports House.
That victory opened the doors to the cream of Europe.
Everything looked good.
There were promising young people, like Hanno Möttöla.
Chief Coach Henrik Dettmann raised Möttölä on the limestone lines to the final tournament team.
The solution that many disagreed with.
Now you can say that Dettmann was far-fetched, even though everything didn't work out according to the script.
After Athens, the basketball ground team went deep.
In Athens’s races, Finns were known to be present a little over 100.
There were journalists, players' relatives, Finnish basketball coachs and some fans.
There are journalists, relatives and coachs in Bilbao, but there are also fans.
And there's a lot of them.
The effect has grown to incomprehensible proportions.
I don't think anyone can tell you exactly what the Finnish racers say.
The estimates have moved between 7 500-10 000.
There was any number in there, no matter what, it's quite an incomprehensible number.
Here's an explanation for the sports socialodes.
In the global economy, businesses move across borders.
There is still an opportunity for sports to look at how we are doing internationally.
As mobility increases, we can visit our girls and our sons to see how they succeed in the world, says professor Hannu Itkonen of sports science.
There are definitely Finns in Poland, both in Spain and in the MM balloon races, who apply for a living.
Co-experience.
But it doesn't explain everything.
You know, sports, too, have to be attractive.
Sneaking is a part of the popular culture of sport.
It's a lower threshold to go to a sports race than to Berlin to watch art.
But without success, masses can't move.
Let's get back to 1995.
At that time, the main coach Dettmann challenged the basketball union and the players to enter the top-sport professionally.
It took almost ten years.
Then the direction changed, and the country team's activity was lifted to the leg.
The balloon forces made the same move a little earlier.
Now they both enjoy the fruits of the work.
As Itkonen says, both species have managed to produce their top-sports, where holy trinity works: sport-media-sponsors.
The audience will also be interested.
And the media has taught me what such carnival support is, Itkonen reminds me.
Can ball sports move this massive interest to home series as well?
On average, basketball and airball plays for hundreds or a little over a thousand viewers.
The cryon considers the question to be a good one, and it does not necessarily give the answer that would be very good for the species.
Another school believes that interest is moving.
The other one is the one who doesn't want sweet stomach full.
This group is ready for a retirement trip to the MM, but in their basic thinking, the domestic series are not of two interest.
It's a challenge for compatriots in the middle of drugs.
Ensurement to the Bottaksen property - almost 1.5 hectares from the lake
Nastola rewards the formula driver at the beach house of Valtteri Bottakse.
The municipal government unanimously approved the donation of 1.4 hectares in its meeting on Monday.
In the future, a leisure apartment will rise to the property.
The success of Bottax has been observed in Nastola since this maping times.
He is trained as a good ambassador to market Lahtea, Lahde’s neighborhood and Nastola.
The gift tont is located in Koiskala, on the beach of Kärkjärvi.
It has become owned by the municipality of Nastola as part of the bigger real estate trade.
There are seven buildings in the area, from which the municipalities will be dismantled at the expense of six by the end of this year.
Bottas reached formula 1 in the Belgian sub-competition this year, his fourth prize ceremony.
He's at MM points on the fifth.
Bottas is a born Nastolan and lived in the Villähte of his childhood.
He lives in England now, but he always goes to Nastola when he's free of formulas.
Bottas has visited high schools and youth facilities.
Design Intelligence comes, but hardly for the poor.
It presents and tests them at the U.S. Open competition in New York.
Ralph Lauren's smart shirt testers are ball members of the field, but also amateur Marcus Giron of the tops of the university gambling.
According to him, the shirt helps him follow his own development and control his recovery.
Silver sensors have been strung into the nail shirt, from which the information is transmitted to the sweater and from there to the smartphone or the board computer.
The sensors measure the heart rate, the rhythms of breathing, stress and steps.
The central unit buckle shall be removed before the shirt is thrown into the washing machine.
The fashion house has not told us the exact time to start selling the shirt nor even suggested the price, Tech Times news.
Raph Lauren isn't the only company in smart clothes.
The Californian Athos has brought down a smart shirt and smartshorts.
They measure heartbeat, breathing, and muscle work.
The clothes cost 100 bucks a piece and the center unit of the thumb they demand will pay two hundred bucks.
Red Orbit also wrote about technology.
Smart way to save textbooks
The cost of college books in America exceeds $1,000 for many students, so soon the second year of study, Matt Schroeder, who begins with his study, found a smart way to save money.
He developed a system where students of the next year’s courses borrow their books against nominal compensation instead of passing the books forward immediately.
"My mathematical book would normally have paid 180 bucks; I paid $10 for the entire semester, and a shovel sandwich," says Schroeder, a 19-year-old, studying at Covenant College in Georgia.
Schroeder says his last semester book would normally have paid $430.
Instead, he spent $20 on them.
According to the University Board, the average student spends over $1,200 a year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have many ways to reduce these costs.
Students increasingly end up using creative approaches such as online shops and Schroeder's idea.
More and more students rent textbooks, so they can use the book throughout the semester and pay clearly less than the students buying the book.
According to Neebo Inc, which holds more than 250 campus books shops, the rental of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Statistics on the sector reveal that about a quarter of the books from university books were rent books in the spring, says Trevor Meyer, President of Neebo.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are purchased from campus books.
Here's the simplest way to save money.
Online trades
In online shops, the new book can only be obtained by a third of the price it would pay for in the campus bookshop.
Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler's ninth edition is a recommended price of almost $290, but Chegg.com's book for special books is available at a price of $239.99.
Buy as Used
The books used are a good option if the reader does not interfere with other notes and past appearances.
For example, the "Calculus" book will be obtained from the Chegg.com online store at USD 93.49.
Last year of Brigham Young University student Matt Casaday, 25 years old, says he bought the book "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business" using the Amazon.com online store for only $ 0.42.
The new book would have cost 48 bucks.
Director of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls School, Ingrid Bracey and other academics recommend that students ask their professors whether previous publications can be used at the course.
At times, reforms of new pressure are not essential for teaching.
In this case, the old print can only be found with a fraction of the price that should be paid for a new one.
In addition to the Chegg and Amazon book deals, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular place to buy books used.
Rental
You should consider renting textbooks if you take good care of them, remember to return them, and you do not need them when the course is done.
By renting, you can save more than 80 per cent of the price of the new book.
For example, renting the "Calculus" book for the whole semester costs about $20.
Explore the rules of the rental company, such as notes, the use of the highlighting cap and the subsequent charges.
Rentress, be careful: if you forget to return the book, the late payment may be higher than the purchase price of the book.
E-mails
Procuring e-books instead of ordinary papers can also ask the question.
These books are sometimes rented to pay for the right of use of the e-book to its holder, such as Amazon.com, Chegg or Barnes & Noble Inc bookshops.
The Chegg store makes the "Calculus" book e-book six months for about $61.
According to Bracey, many literacy students save the most because many classics can now be downloaded free, while books in science and technology can be very expensive.
Comparing the various sellers is worthwhile, which option you choose.
Joe Gault, 29, which will soon begin in Pepperdinen law school, recommends using the book ISBN in order to determine the price, because it will help you to ensure that you are looking for the right book.
Before you order the network, make sure the book is in stock, Gault says.
He himself learned this through the heel.
The delivery of the book he bought was in ice for four weeks, and he finally had to obtain the book at the university's bookstore at a full price.
The Tampere Legion Theatre fills 20 years
The theatre established in 1994 opposes unemployment, exclusion and passiveness.
All those who want to make performing art are welcome to the action.
Organize sporting activities for long-term unemployed persons aged 17-35 from expression weights.
The presentations often take a position on society.
In recent years there has been reports of narcissism and classical adaptations.
He believes that every person can change his own life.
In the fires almost double the number of people died from last year
This year, almost twice the number of people have died in fires compared to last year.
According to the media monitoring of the Finnish Rescue Organisation (Spek), 55 people have already died in blocks in 49 different pieces.
Last year, at the corresponding time, there were 31 fire deaths.
Most of the dead, 36, have been men.
There were 11 people over 65 years of age.
According to the organisation’s statistics on fire deaths, the worst situation was last in 2009, when 64 people died in fires by the end of August.
Most of the fire deaths occur in the apartments.
There have been 17 fire deaths in flat houses, 21 home houses, seven in rows and other small houses.
Spek reminds me of repeating home fire safety.
At least the operation of all home burners should be ensured according to Spek.
In addition, everyone should check that extinguishing equipment is easy to use.
All of the premises of the home must also have an unavoidable exit route.
Children should also be told what electrical equipment they can use when they are at home alone.
NATO Summit: First Protests in Newport and Cardiff
The opponents of the NATO Summit protested in Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds of them met in the center of the city of Newport on a marshal against NATO.
On Sunday, about 150 people met at the so-called Summit of Cardiff City Hall.
Stephen Fairclough followed the events this weekend and spoke with demonstrators who had arrived even since Belgium.
Young people were rescued by flight from the Blue Mountains of Australia
TWO teen-age patrolers were brought to safety after they were stuck in the night on mountains of Blues in the New South Wales region of Australia.
A 16-year-old girl and a 18-year-old man left for the Govetts Leop on Sunday after noon.
Families were concerned about young people who had not returned home and called the police at 8:00 a.m.
A search team composed of local police and aiders was sent to search for young people, and the two were found at about 23 a.m. near Bridal Veil.
The girl had hurt her knee, and the man had fallen and hit his head.
The cops spent the night with the couple, and they were raised to safety on Monday morning.
The patrols were taken in an ambulance to the Blue Mountains Hospital, and their condition was stable.
Ukrainian soldiers retired from Luhansk Airport
Ukrainian troops have withdrawn from the Luhanski airport.
According to the Ukrainian army, soldiers were given a resignation order.
According to Ukraine, the parachute forces have worked hard together with Russian tanks on the field.
According to the military representative, the fire fire on the counterpart has been so precise that the shooter is likely to have Russian professional soldiers.
During the past 24 hours, seven Ukrainian soldiers have died.
On the Asovan Sea, outside south-eastern Ukraine, the U.S. Scout ship was drowning in the morning, reports the border guard.
Eight marines have been rescued and two are still missing.
The border guard had no assurance where the ship was shot.
The separatists told me yesterday in social media that they fired the ship.
According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Russia will not attack Ukraine.
However, Lavrov demanded that the Ukrainian troops immediately withdraw to positions from which they cannot fire civilians.
According to the Foreign Minister, in the Minsk negotiations today between Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE, a immediate cease-fire without conditions should be achieved.
Lavrov also recalled that Russia would respond to possible new economic sanctions.
First, we will protect our own interests, our economy, the social sector, our businesses.
At the same time, we will also draw conclusions on the activities of our partners, Lavrov threatened.
The rainfalls made Malmo and Copenhagen flood
The streets flooded on Sundays in Malmö and Copenhagen, when the harsh roads blew southern Sweden and Denmark.
The flood waters cut several roads, mixed traffic and buried cars underneath them.
On Sunday, the authorities estimate that the flood may last, even though the rains were predicted to cease by Monday.
The harsh rains were able to surprise the Swedish authorities, and there was no prior weather warning about rains.
Ari Mustala, Ari Mustala, the modern meteorologist of the Finnish Air Science Institute, estimates that the harness of the area was very local.
The rain area looks creepy and permanent.
No wonder it's been hard to predict.
The French Socialists should "be quiet and help France", says Francois Hollande's main supporters
Mr Valls called on the broken left to "exhibit your feelings" for the Socialist President in difficulty, whose composition did not receive the approval of the French majority.
The President deserves respect for all, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
"Our mission is to stay with him," said Valls and earned applause.
As a satisfying gesture, the Prime Minister asked the Government to leave alone the 35-hour working week in France, despite the new economic minister, Emmanuel Macron, who had previously tabled this week, that the rule should be simplified.
On Saturday, Hollande asked socialists to cooperate with the government.
However, Minister of Justice, Christiane Taubira, caused a divergence by the emergence of the socialist controversy of different opinions and by criticising the Socialist Party that it would allow "France to give up hope for the future".
Marine Le Pen, the head of the judiciary national front, mocked the continuous division of the socialists and said that Valls' new government would not last for a few months.
François Hollande may have gone to war, but also Manuel Valls, whose duty was to form a new government after the last one did not last even for the summer.
"And the new government won't last until autumn or winter," said Le Pen to journalists.
He repeated his party's proposal for a disruption of the delegation and firmly held the electoral victory of his party in premature elections and would be willing to lead the party itself.
The French dominant party suffered a murmur loss in the municipalities in March and the extremist right held a list of importance in the May EU elections.
According to the opinion survey of the Journal du Dimanche, 76% of the French people believe that the Socialist Party may decompose to several competing groups before the end of the Dutch period in 2017.
Political researcher Pascal Perrineau of the Po University warned that the French would soon lose their patience unless the new Socialist Government succeeded in improving the economy and recording unemployment.
"There is a small chance of success, but the public must quickly notice that the change is happening," he warned.
Otherwise, things can get worse.
Pokka betrayed the Morning of the Finnish contenders Kirsi Alm-Siira, Nina Rahkola, and meteorologist Pekka Poudan's twisted badly in the recording part of the program.
The Morning Finnish programme published a fun video of the recordings made on Thursday last Thursday on Facebook.
On the video designers Kirsi Alm-Siira and Nina Rahkola, as well as meteorologist Pekka Pouta, are trying to record the Morning of the posting of the Finnish advertising buffet next day, but the recording is not exactly going into the tube.
Alm-Siira is confusing in his words when he tries to say the word "budgetary riot", and his confusion also makes Pouda and Rahkola lose his face once and for all.
And these heroes should still be allowed to draw a direct broadcast tomorrow, Morning in the Facebook update of Finland.
The video has become very popular in Facebook and is both loved and shared in Facebook more than 10,000 times.
Jorma K. Pouta, 68, worked in the newspaper photo office, was placed in the third potret series in 1972.
The picture contains Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir.
At Fredrikinkadu Helsinki, a Socialist International meeting was held in May 1971 at the House of Construction Chairs.
There were many Heads of State at the meeting and the security measures were enormous.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven bodyguards went with him.
At the beginning of the meeting, however, we received more than five minutes to photograph.
I took this picture in four yards.
The light and the background were correct.
Right now, I realized that this time I succeeded.
From the look of the sea, you see that the leaders of the Middle East have had a difficult time before.
In that case, the contest was carried out with images taken by well-known persons or events.
It is great that today you can succeed with other images as long as you have an idea and visual torque.
This is the second best picture I've ever taken.
The best is Lasse Virén's crash image of the Olympics in Munich.
That's not what I sent to the competition.
Debate: More than EUR 5 million already paid by the Arnio research
Examining the legality of the activities of the Helsinki Police Department of Drugs has already cost more than EUR 5 million and has demanded a 30-50 working year.
Jyri Rajamäki Jyväskylä’s doctoral work for the University of Jyväskylä.
Rajamäki suggests that the enforcement of the lawfulness of police activities and the fight against criminal offences could, above all, be significantly improved by combining IT systems for investigation and judicial treatment.
According to the borders, modern technology makes it possible to multiplicate the use of criminal material.
He notes that it is possible to build a system where data collected to investigate the offence is automatically electronic evidence that meets the evidence chain, while allowing comprehensive legality control.
The claim will be checked on Saturday.
Top: The idea of vegetarian food in 1999 was forgotten on the school wall: "Casvisdiet belongs to fish and chicken foods"
A picture of the special information on the walls of the school of women traveling in Pirkka caused a dining volume in social media, reports Yle on his website.
Greenfooders!
Fish and chicken foods belonging to plant diet at school lunch.
Only when there's meat on the list, we're making a vegetation option!
This is the case in the 15 - year - old newsletter for a forgotten school wall.
You can see the picture from here.
The picture in the social media has led people to send a disgusted feedback to the Pirkkala municipality.
The head of the food and cleaning service Arja Vaarma states to Yle that the unforgotten note on the wall is not true and should have been removed a while ago.
Apparently, before I come, there has been a thought that has been discussed with health care in time.
Each student receives a meal according to his wishes, he says to Yle.
On this day at Pirkkala schools, students will only be offered an alternative vegetative food only with the permission of parents and the certificate of a doctor or nurse for vegetarian food.
The danger justifies the solution to Yle by leaving young children’s vegetarian cooking to diet short and the absence of meat or chicken can create a miracle from the parents of the pupils.
Norwegian Cruise near the Prestige Cruise Agreement worth $3 billion
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. NCHL.O, the world’s third largest cruise company, will negotiate to buy its competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for three billion dollars.
As a result, the Norwegian Cruise company, whose market value is 6.8 billion dollars, would be able to use Prestige Cruises and wealthy customers against the Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N), while continuing its competition.
According to sources, information on the possible agreement may be published already this week, although it is also possible that negotiations do not produce results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private capital investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20% of Norwegian Cruise.
Sources did not want their names to be public because negotiations are not held in public.
The representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments and Apollo’s representative refused to comment.
The Norwegian Cruise company from Miami has 13 cruise ships with a route map covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, the Mediterranean and the Caribbean.
Its turnover increased by 13 per cent from 2012 to 2013 with turnover of USD 2.57 billion.
Prestige Cruises, which operates so far from Miami, has the names of Oceania and Regent, including eight cruise ships, and the route map covers Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its turnover in 2013 was EUR 1.2 billion, which is six per cent more than in the previous year.
The rivalry industry worth $29 billion is expected to benefit from the rise in economies that are developing in the coming years, such as the average Chinese and Indian classes.
Companies compete to become the first option of these new customers when choosing a cruise.
Prestige Cruises registers its first issue of shares on the US stock market in January 2014.
Apollo has owned most of the company's shares since 2007, worth USD 850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was established in 2000 with its current composition, following its merger with the Genting Bhd (GENT.KL) cruise company. The latter is the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay entertainment and casino company.
Apollo invested a billion dollars in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise was listed as a public company in January 2013.
According to the information published, Genting accounted for 28% of the company, Apollo 20% and TPG Capital LP 8% from the end of June.
The combined share of Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise in North America’s cruise capacity is 82%, reflects the registration document published by Prestige Cruise in the course of the invoice.
The Tampere City Government is discussing this today.
Animalia hopes that the city government will firmly support the initiative.
According to Salla Tuomivaara, the Executive Director of Animalia, who prepares a dissertation for the University of Tampere, it is appropriate to end rapidly during the delfinaries in Finland and around the world.
Fortunately, in recent years around the world, there has been a general view that the presence of developing mammals such as dolphins in dolphinates is not animal-protected and ethically sustainable.
This view would also be hoped for Tampere.
The termination of Delfinaario is not only a matter of animal law, but also a question of Tampere's imago as a tourist destination, the Court of Justice points out.
According to the convict risk, the death of Näsi-delphine confirms the requirements of the delfinario activity.
Death in sight is a sad proclamation to the darker history of the Delivery of the Sacred Neighbourhood.
It is time to put a point on the deaths, to close the dolphin prison, and to begin to find out how the dolphins in Tampere could be transferred to a limited sea area, a kind of dolphin safe home, the judgment requires.
The vision did not have time to return to the original habitat of dolphins, but hopefully the rest of the dolphins living in the Sacred Emergency were able to experience even more life than the unfriendly concrete, the judge hopes.
The Animal Protection Union aims to prohibit the use of all species of wildlife in circus in the overall reform of the animal protection legislation undergoing preparations.
This group also reads the dolphinarians.
In support of this requirement, the Executive Director of Animalia, the Court of Justice, is taking part in the 1.9th demonstration of the dolphins to be held today.
The demonstration of the Japanese Embassy in Helsinki will take a position against the delfin hunting period in Japan.
During the hunting season, about 2300 dolphins are being taken or killed cruelly each year, either for the use of or for the food of the dolphinates.
Putin demands Kiova to open negotiations on the new state with Eastern Ukraine
Russia's President Vladimir Putin requested on Sunday that the Ukrainian Government end the fight against separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on the "state" region, the Russian news sources.
His representative, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean that the Eastern Ukraine region controlled by the Separatists would become part of Russia, but that its position within Ukraine should be reconsidered in order to give the people of the Russian-speaking region the power to defend their own rights and interests.
Putin's demand to the Government of Kiova on negotiations with Russian-minded rebels as equal negotiators corresponds to his obvious strategy he has followed since the violence started five years ago: he is trying to help the separatists to take over the region and thus force the Government of Ukraine in practice to grant the recently declared Novorossier independence, which enables it to go to Russia instead of the west.
In the State Channel 1, Putin condemned the efforts of the Ukrainian army to take back the Eastern Donetsk and Luhansk region, which was reintroduced by the Separatists in March 18, following the accession of Moscow to the Crimean Peninsula of Ukraine.
The Kreml and Separatists have recently embraced the area as "Novorossija", "New Russia" – this term reminds us of the days of the glorious glory before the revolutions of the Russian Empire.
According to Itar-Tass, the Russian news office said that the planned peace negotiations are "illution" as long as Ukraine's politicians carry out campaigns for the parliamentary elections held on 26 October and the government's troops attack civilians in separatist areas.
"We must immediately start broad negotiations, not only on technical issues, but also on the organisation of society and the status of the state of south-eastern Ukraine, taking into account the interests of the people living there," he says.
According to Peskov, the reference to the "nationality" relates to a broader independence, which has been discussed for months with the leadership of Kiova in attempting to eradicate the fears of Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights would be threatened.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant east regions the independence they need, Peskov says.
This issue cannot be discussed between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov says, "as this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict between Ukraine".
The mid-notice of the Kremli representative, which was designed to correct Putin's comments' misinterpretation, stressed that the Russian regime deals with the rebel of separatists in the eastern regions in a different way than in the case of Crimea, where it in practice took over the region, whose majority of the population of 2 million are ethnically Russian.
Moscow would be much more difficult to link even Donetsk or Luhanski’s regions in Eastern Ukraine, since most of the people living in the region are not ethnically Russian and, according to the pre-conflict opinion surveys, the majority of the population supported staying in Ukraine.
The independence that the Russian diplomats have discussed in international forums would give the Ukrainian local governments the right to agree themselves on their own trade agreements and external relations, which would in practice give Greece the power to join the Russian Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula, which was linked to Russia five months ago, is located in the Russian main fleet and in the ports of commercial sea and historical coastal areas.
There are also mines, factories and metal soils in the area between Rostov and Crimea in Russia that produce essential products for the Russian army.
On 7 June, the President of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, proposed that the Ukrainian legislators, after the new elections, consider constitutional changes in order to increase the decision-making power of the regions departing from the nuclear area of Ukraine on their own economy and languages.
However, his vision of independence seems to differ dramatically from the viewpoint of perhaps armed and littered separatists in Kreml and Moscow.
Putinin made his latest demands to the Government of Kiova on negotiations with Russian-minded rebels as equal partners after the rebels moved on last week after the Russian tanks and troops invaded East Ukraine earlier from the peaceful region of the Azov Sea.
The Ukrainian security authorities fear that taking over the city of Novoazovsk of the separatists supported by Russia is the beginning of a greater effort to take over the entire strategicly important coastal area up to Crimea.
It has led to a massive civilian and military staff to strengthen the city of Mariupol. Mariupol is known as a steel-producing port city between Novoazovsk and the narrow area of the Crimea Peninsula.
On Saturday, Poroshenko spoke to the leaders of the European Union in Brussels asking for further measures to prevent future violations of Russia in Ukraine, the former Republic of the Soviet Union, which has been independent for 23 years.
"We'll soon arrive at a point where there's no return," Poroshenko warned me.
There are now thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks in Ukraine.
The EU Summit did not take decisions on direct action; the leaders proposed further sanctions to introduce them if the crisis in Ukraine is re-introduced under unclear circumstances.
The Ukrainian soldiers had to retreat their positions in the Ilovaic region after two Russian armor departments and 1 000 soldiers moved to Donetsk last week to strengthen the separatists in difficulty, General Andriy Lysenko, a representative of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, told journalists in Kiev on Saturday.
According to Lysenko, the first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers in Russia in Ilovaisk were replaced by 10 Russian parachutes jumps in the region of Ukraine a week ago.
Milan's opening painting was made by a Japanese writer Keisuke Honda on the seventh minute of play.
In the second half of time, Sulley Muntar first hit and a little later Jeremy Menez from the retreat.
Laziok got a ranch at the end of the game after his mining paint, but the goal watcher Diego Lopez rejected Antonio Candreva's shot.
Lopez moved to Milan for this period from Real Madrid.
In the Inzagh training debyy of the former attacker of Milan, the San Siron stadium was only halfway.
39,000 audiences were notified.
Australian celebrations and Gabi Grecco in a naked scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten has announced that he's been nuts about hackers, perhaps stolen his fiancée and Hollywood A-list Gabi Grecko's naked images.
In the entertainment world, a number of naked pictures of Jennifer Lawrence were published on the Internet as a result of a wide range of celebrity search scandals.
Hacker has been said to have a total of 60 naked images of star of stargate Lawrence and other superstars, such as Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and an actor Kirsten Dunst.
The pictures of the Australian actors, Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Grecko in Melbourne, appeared to be stolen in connection with the iCloud leak.
There are 101 famous names on the list.
Edelsten, who asked Grecko last month, said to the Confidential magazine, "This is disgusting."
All personal contacts and images should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and spread.
In New York, Greckon is reported with a comment on the case in the web magazine "ashamed" and said that the victims "recognised themselves."
Hacker believes he has 30 pictures of Palmer with this last boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two samples of Palmer on the topless pool edge.
Palmer's film deals include the film "Love and Honor" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck's star Strahovski and Sucker Punch actress Browning didn't comment on hacked photos yesterday.
Lawrence's representative said to the TMZ that "this is a ruthless violation of privacy".
Actor Seth Rogen hated the hacker in his tweet: "The publication of stolen images does not differ in any way from the sale of the stolen product".
The publication of stolen images should not be made possible, even from a legal point of view alone.
Finland played almost as a homefield and rising to sensational victory from Cuba at the MM balloon.
Look at the pictures of the fan humidity.
The Polish Katowice was white on Monday: not the Polish red-white but the Finnish blue-white.
According to the STT, Finland’s profit was followed by almost 2000 Finnish carriers in the Spodek region.
It felt like he was playing at home.
The fans had such a big effect on our game, and the Finnish Captain Antti Siltala told the STT.
Finland was already in the fight at the loss of item 0-2, but went to the victory of item 3-2.
