A 28-year-old cooker was found dead at the shopping center in San Francisco.
Even the 28-year-old cooker who moved to San Francisco was found dead in the local shopping centre's stairway this week.
But the victim's brother says he doesn't know anyone who would have wanted to hurt him, and says, "He finally went well."
The body found at the Westfield Mall shopping center on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old Frank Galician, San Francisco Death Investigation Office.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was determined as a homicide and that the investigation is underway.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC's channel to the KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a line-hockey in Boston, had received his dream job as a line-hockey master at the Sanfrancisco Songs & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
The representative of Sons & Daughters said that they are "aboved and shocked" because of his death.
"We have a small team that works like a tight family, and he will be very missable," said the representative.
We will send our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank spent the night at the hostels, but recently, "they finally went well".
"He found the apartment and met a girl," Louis Galicia told the KGO.
Louis Galicia said she didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt her younger brother.
He was charity, and he had a big heart.
His way of feeling intact with the family was to make us food, make us dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of controversy.
He was a brother who drove with the power.
"In the world, where so many things are wrong, he was an unsweet diamond that shined more brightly every day," he said.
Everyone with information is asked to call the San Francisco Police Department's clue line at 415 to 575-4444.
Physician trainers on strike: Requirements for new work fighting measures
The representatives of medical practitioners have asked their trade union to adopt new work fight measures in their dispute with regard to the new agreement.
The Committee of the British Medical Association (BMA) Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) asks the Council as a whole to support the new work fighting measures from the beginning of September.
The JDC says that ministers have failed to address concerns regarding the agreement.
In July, doctors and doctors voted to reject the agreement agreed with BMA.
58% of the voters rejected it.
On Thursday night, in a letter published by Twitter to the members of the JDC President Ellen McCourt said that the government had remained "secretly quiet" on matters which he said led to the rejection of the agreement.
He said: "In this light, the JDC Government has voted to reject a completely proposed new agreement and to demand formal renegotiation of all your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Government has today made a formal request for a specific meeting of the BMA Council to give a mandate to the early September progressive and expanding work programme.
The dispute has led to the fact that doctors have participated in six strikes this year, including the first complete workout in the history of the NHS health care system.
The head of BMA’s medical practitioners, Dr. Johann Malawana, divorced after the vote had been rejected, the terms recommended by BMA.
He had told BMA members at meetings before the vote of 54 000 doctors and students that the agreement was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the agreement will be ordered to doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: external association?
Ele, which ended up in a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to hand each other and to declare that the battle of words and economic sanctions lasted for eight months was officially terminated.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish colleague in the golden hall of Peter’s palace, I had a clear impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
Yes, they did.
But Putin’s smile looked like a man’s face, and he did not threaten the heat, even according to his own controlled standards.
On the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan kept talking about his dear friend Putin five times according to one report.
I lost my mind.
He also swore that relations with Russia would return not only to the level before the crisis, but even to a better level.
The next day, the newspapers here described Erdogan as being acting like nothing bad ever happened.
I think his own enthusiasm illustrated the opposite.
But the viley from Putin showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the reason for the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: when Turkey shot down the Russian battle plane at the Syrian border.
The reaction of Moscow was mad at the time.
Putin attacked Ankara for stabbing Moscow on his back.
The insult was even worse when it came from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
The opinion of the Russian public has also changed since November.
For months, the media controlled by the state led to an amazing, thorough attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that the Turkishs were guilty of everything.
The most serious was the accusations of high officials that Erdogan’s own family had benefited from illegal oil trade from the Syrian territories under the control of Isis.
He has denyed this firmly.
But in Peter, the official message was that it was time to move forward.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology requested by President Erdogan.
Russia gained some kind of victory.
The benefits of concluding a harsh armor are clear.
Firstly, Erdogan needs all potential friends after he was almost removed from power in a failure of the last month.
He has also been clearly shaken by continuous terrorist attacks in Turkey.
There is also an economic motive.
Russia's economic sanctions have been severe, especially a ban on ordering flights, which usually carry several million Russian seats on the Turkish coast annually.
The amount has fallen by almost 90 per cent.
As far as Russia is concerned, local travel organisers and ordering airlines will certainly be easier when the flights are finally continuing.
They're hoping for a late season to run into the Mediterranean.
And already this week, public television has predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables after the import of agricultural products from Turkey is allowed again.
"You traveled there, tomatoes back here," as the Vedemost report was formulated.
But the visit also had political added value to Moscow.
In harsh people are angry with the Westerns about what is considered as a weak response to the attempted coup.
When it adds a long-standing grudge to the progressive EU membership negotiations, Putin, who is eager to take advantage of coolness and shatter Turkey's ties to the western countries.
The Russian leader must have received points from Ankara, where he called after the revolutionary company to support the designated authorities.
Of course, this is a survivor to Moscow who has a deep rooted in the exchange of fear.
So this meeting in the Pramean Sea Train enabled the "external association" presented by Russia and Turkey, as an analyst described to me: two countries who experience the West, rejecting them and treating them wrongly, combining their power.
However, these two have great disagreements despite public reconciliation.
The key problem is Syria, where Moscow has recently agreed on the role of the peace maker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It may be a great deal of speech that, after almost three hours of discussions, the presidents told the press that they had not even discussed it.
The President of Turkey was consciously avoiding answering the question in relation to their disagreements, while Putin chose to emphasise them.
There is no clear consensus on where they can look for a common basis with regard to Syria.
After months of open hostility, and taking into account the possibility of a full disaster when a NATO member of Turkey shoots down a Russian fighter, it is certainly better that two leaders are even again speaking.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from external customers in Scotland
According to the Executive Director of the Bank, the RBS brand will be reduced to the back office role.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the international objectives of the Bank.
After the bank almost collapsed eight years ago and had to save it, it has abandoned these objectives.
The Bank’s strategics have used the "RBS" brand to protect other consumer finance bands.
It was supported by millions of pounds used to sponsor international sports, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon Master Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered right to allow the national brands to come first.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is in use with Scotland customers, but it will not be restarted from the beginning.
All RBS references in England and Wales are converted into NatWest, with the exception of the main office and stock exchange lists.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used by customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller private banking brands that gain more visibility: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed at the customer and staff round at Invernessshire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will be the employer of our investor brand and employees, because we will now become much more a brand bank."
When the bank became a global brand, the RBS became a global brand.
So I say that we no longer have global objectives, we have local objectives.
Each of these brands means something very different in its own communities, and our staff is working with customers under these brands.
The RBS has already said that it does not continue to sponsor Six Nations and has raised the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.
“It is now time to move towards the bank of brands, because basically (we are asking questions) it is about how we can concentrate on making this a better bank for customers,” the CEO said.
Three years ago, I would have been very cynical if we had said that we were going to be a great bank to customers and offered these brands.
But with the work that we have done focused on the needs of our customers, not ours, I believe you will see a lot of changes.
We can bring those brands back, so I think it's time.
Frankie Dettori wins in Newmarket with Prediletion and wins 3000 wins
Dettor sprays champagne after he has a total of 3000 wins after double victory.
The racist Frankie Dettor secured his 3000th British victory in Newmarket on Friday.
He reached the verstacle on his second victory on his way home, competing with John Gosden's training Prediletion.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey that reaches this milestone in the race.
He's following Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-fold masterjockey Dettor, who won before at Ghayyar, said, "This is special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too.
I am very pleased that this happened in Newmarket because I started here 30 years ago.
It's not a big event, it's not a Royal Ascot, it's a normal Friday night and 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very humble.
The Dettor sucks on the cheers when he pulls Prediletion out after the victory.
Two competitors have reached this verstacle at the frontier contests, the champion Jockey Richard Johnson, and the 20-fold retired master Sir Anthony McCoy, who had records of over 4300 wins in his career.
Lester Piggot, 9-fold Derby winner, 4493 wins
Frankie is one of the best racers in the present era, and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone, which few have reached before him.
He's stylish and strong, but his tactical bull will separate him in the other weighing room.
He is a great ambassador for competitions, his enthusiasm and charism have been dragging fans into the species for years.
I told Frankie in Epsom a few weeks ago that he would have ridden 6,000 winners if he wasn't just the weekend and the big race jockey!
To be serious, Frankie has ridden the winners in Britain most of the 30 years, which is great to see.
He's a living person who's good for the British competition, but he's also an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettor celebrated a milestone to his trademark with a drone landing from the saddle.
Flying off to drone landings, Frankie Dettori has been the face of the British race for two decades.
It's been a mountain track.
Increasing profits in big races, including his famous 'Magnificent Seven' victory in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived an aeroplane accident and suffered from the ban on drugs.
Three years ago, he had a hard time coming back after six months of competition, but he showed a significant nature when he challenged suspects and returned to his best condition.
And he may continue for a long time, but the Dettor has said that he would like to continue to compete until at least 50 years of age.
Russian Putin separates Sergei Ivanov, Head of Staff
Suddenly, the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, has dismissed Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin’s trusted internal circuit for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport Affairs.
The Kreml opinion said that Putin has ordered Ivanov to move away from the positions of the Head of the Russian Presidency, but it was not justified.
Assistant director of Ivanov since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his successor.
The persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
He was born in the capital of Estonia in Tallinn in 2012, completed a highly respected Moscow State Institute of International Relations Institute (MGIMO) and operated in the Embassy of Tokyo.
Later, he led the president's protocol and government staff, called the Kremlin website (Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as Head of State, as regards the drafting of the laws and the management of the implementation of your guidelines.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his place and recommended that persecution be appointed to his place.
Are smiles convincing?
This is a movement that has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of the closest allies of Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, operated in KGB of the Soviet Union.
As Head of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
In the meeting with President Putin, both men claimed that the Head of State retired on his own request.
But despite smiles on cameras, only a few people here are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So it's just some sort of power fight, isn't it?
No one knows yet.
But the official statement that the man who was once advertised as a potential president's candidate suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy has been truly suspiciously adopted.
In his comments quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said, "It is true that early in 2012, I asked you to give me four years of responsibility for this very complex, could you even say the job, the task.
Well, now I've been head of headquarters for four years and eight months."
Ivanov approved the mission in December 2011.
He used to be Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the State Security Service at KGB, as is Putin.
At the end of the 1990s, when Putin was head of the State Security Service at the FSB, which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his Deputy Director.
When Putin came into power, he mentioned Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
One time it was thought that Ivanov could become President Puti, after the second season of Russia, since the third season of Puti would have been contrary to the Constitution.
However, this mission went to one of Putin’s close associations, Dmitri Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before he returned to President only three and a half years later.
The Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson got kicked after he hit the producer.
Gibson was involved in a physical dispute last month at the location of the series in Los Angeles.
The series of producers, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, announced his separation in the joint opinion.
Special Agent Aaron Hotchner filed an apology on Thursday before his resignation was announced.
There were creative differences and disputes at the scene.
I regret that it happened," he said in his statement.
According to the opinion of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details of how Gibson's character is removed from a series of FBI agents are expected later.
The 54-year-old, who targeted Dharma & Greg in the past, has been involved in the series since its first period in 2005.
"I love the Criminal Minds series, and I have given it all my last 12 years," said Gibson in the opinion published on Friday.
I'd hoped I'd be with you until the end, but it's not possible now.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our incredible team, and, above all, the best fans that the series can have.
The beginning of the 12th production period has been envisaged for the 28th of September.
Mystery fish ended up in the garden in Banff
A man in Banff has asked for help in identifying the fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be windfish that the water wheel has left behind.
In Periscope, Bain, who lives 500 metres from the sea, published film material from the display, hoping that someone could provide clarity to the appearance of two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now extends to Fife
The project of 1,35 billion pounds is now expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have combined the north-east of Queensferry’s cross-road deck and the ground bridge, which means that the bridge now extends to Fife.
It's the first of the four seals between the "citizens' threats" that are now graduating around each of the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge share of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30 000 tonnes.
It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 bulk ropes.
The project of 1,35 billion pounds is now expected to be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Economic Affairs Keith Brown visited the country of work today and was among the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in building the overroad of Queensferry.
We all prove the very impressive engineering work in this project, using over 30 000 tonnes of concrete and steel alone to build this bridge section."
Despite the enormous size and weight of the bridge, the finalisation of the feather between the bridge and the bridge deck is a demanding operation in which extreme precise dimensions must be agreed.
Overall, almost 79% of the bridge deck is now in place, and the final part of the cover lies today in Rosyth, which means that the entire cover is ready to be lifted to the bridge.
Michael Martin, head of Fort Crossing Bridge Constructions, said: "The first closure in any bridge project is always a major milestone.
In this fantastic project, this closure represents the top of construction technology.
When the last part of the road hack was installed and combined with the expanding North Pole road cover, we had to close the remaining part of the north, i.e. the internal land.
This was done by pulling the north coast bridge 700 millimetres south.
This was an enormous and at the same time very demanding measure.
An enormous, 222 metres long, weighs about 6000 tonnes and was to be pulled around 3% in the slope angle.
It is demanding because the allowed deviations that the team worked were tiny, only a few millimetres in each direction.
I'm glad everything went well, though.
Rescue at Moelfre Bay: Three men are "happy when they're alive"
Three men are "happy when they were alive" after they fell from their fishing boat to Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station alerted at 13.20 (BST) on Friday after the crew saw the event evolve in the Moelfre Bay Gulf.
Three men desperately tried to swim into safety while their boat went on ahead.
"We saw the boat circulating closer to men and imagined the worst," said Vince Jones, the guardian of Moelfre's lifeboat.
"Fortunately, the strong wind had blown it out to them by the time we got to move," he added.
The local fishing boat saved two men, and the third, 60-year-old man was found exhausted hanging a boy without a lifeboat.
The men were taken to the coastal rescue boat and brought back to the rescue boat station.
Jones said, "These three men in the water are lucky when they're alive and completely injured.
The boat engine had a knock-off rope, but it had somehow pulled off the boat from the time when the boat fell.
Someone took care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go is a respectable hunt for health and happiness
It's fascinating to see how the world changes.
During the past decade, many have been worried that teenagers and children are no longer going out to play, but they prefer to spend their leisure time watching evidence.
Pokémon Go makes people get up on the couch and participate in some activity.
The display time was initially limited to television, then to video games, and now recently to smartphones.
So it's great to see that technology and external air activity do not exclude each other.
Of course, I refer to the wildness called Pokémon Go. Application based on characters that were originally developed in the 1990s for video games (more, they created a series of drawings, gaming cards and other follow-up products).
As many pop culture phenomena, its popularity was somewhat diluted before this new game was published in the United States, Australia and New Zealand early in July.
After that, the game was postponed in other countries as the huge popularity overloaded servers.
Only in days Pokémon Golla had more users than Tinder and almost as much as on Twitter.
So how does it work?
As explained in the nut shell, players use their smartphones in search of Pokémones, which are tracked by GPS, which can be "valographed" (with the phone's screenshot) or "required".
The generation that played the game when you were young has joined the wildness and jumped up from the couch to the search.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the daily steps of the "central person".
The Apple Watch application Cardiogram, followed by 35,000 users, recently told Washington Post that the number of people moving 30 minutes a day in the game jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent in the followers of Cardiogram.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Gota, it only sees the level of training.
Many public health campaigns have not produced any results because the majority of public health warnings are bored and careable to people who seem accidental.
However, the importance of exercise cannot be reduced.
Regularly mobile people are at a lower risk of cancer or depression.
Activity helps control of weight, high blood pressure and diabetes, with too many benefits listed here.
The finest thing about Pokémo Go is that it makes people go out and do something they enjoy.
This covers three pillars of health: exercise, rainy air, sunshine and fun.
Some people even get new friends hunting.
As usual, the grieving cheerleaders are looking for things about which they complain about.
Yes, someone can walk the door.
So what?
There's been a breakthrough.
Although previously there were applications like Fitbit that could monitor activity, they did not give reason to move in the same way as this game.
The novelty disappears and the use is slowed down in time.
However, the success of Pokémon will result in other games that combine applications and the activity of virtual reality in the real world, helping many hunters to be more active, better conditioned and healthier.

Simone Biles caught gold in a multiplayer of women's gymnastics.
Forget the pressures.
Forget about the publicity.
Simone Biles is immune to everything.
Energetic in the jumps.
It's a smooth boom.
Incredible permano.
It's great everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic Winner.
The 19-year-old American gymnastics reached a multiplication of the championship on Thursday, leaving the gap between themselves and the rest of the world to the Olympics' spotlight.
He had his total point, 62.198, clearly better than the silver medalist and Final Five teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian pronch medalist Aliya Mustafina.
The US Simone Biles Balance Facility in the final of the individuals of women in the summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday.
The party became the fourth American woman, who has consecutively won the match championship, and all over the fifth American champion. At the same time he strengthened his reputation as his generation, and perhaps the best of all time.
He broke into tears when his final point was announced, and his long journey towards this moment ended.
This achievement raises his same class with the best athletes of his generation, such as Michael Phelps, who have raised their species to a new level:
The party has ruled its species for the last three years, winning 15 World Championship Medals, including 10 gold, with programmes with such astonishing mix of ambition and accuracy, that in 1984, the Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him "the best to see."
The last test was expected in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and other competitors, but between him and the burden of overwhelming expectations.
Returning a family home to Texas Spring, without a crooked gold medals, would have been disappointed.
The American Simone Biles, on the left, and Aly Raisman, after winning the gold and silver mill (in this order) in the final of the individuals in the summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, celebration.
The party reached the first medal on Tuesday, when he served as a celebration of the retired national team coordinator, Martha Karolyin, at the departure party.
Although Biles claimed that he has never thought about the future when he went to the top of knowledge, it is not entirely true.
Some of his permanto program, including his brand extremists, is adapted to Latin American music, which would also fit in the street next to the Olympic island of Rio.
This is not a coincidence.
The girl whose grandparents adopted as a taper, and the mother of Coach Aimee Boorman found that she was on the way to study at the gym where Boorman trained, has become a force factor.
He has not lost in a multiplayer since summer 2013, and this winning pipe will continue as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafina was a small leader after two rounds, it was just a delusion.
Balance Bounty and Permanto, where Biles is a dominant world champion, waited.
He rose to the top at the boom point 15.433 and crossed them at 15.933 permano.
Raisman hailed him goodwill when they waited for the endpoints - just formality - and tears rose up into the eyes of Biles with glitter red, white and blue, when the dream he once wrote in his playbook came true.
Raisman's performance was some kind of revamp from four years ago when he was divided in a third place, but he lost the bronze to Mustafina in rehab.
This time, 22-year-old team leader, the Americans called Grandma, was clearly in charge.
He sent air kisses to the public after his permanth performance, in a emotional collision of return, which sometimes seemed to be a questionable.
As far as Biles is concerned, this wide-ranging tweeting of the 19-year-old in the past this week will have a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in serial murder were shot when they listened to music in the car.
During the most deadly attack of the first serial killer in Phoenix last decade, two women and a 12-year-old girl were sitting in the car talking and listening to music when they were shot, so they were reported in the police report on Thursday.
The authorities said that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on the road on 12 June.
It says that the shooter standing on the side of the car triggered the handgun up to eight times and then escaped with another vehicle.
According to the police, trinity death did not seem to have been the result of a robbery, because the attacker did not take any handbags or 2,900 dollars for another adult victim.
The representative of Phoenix police, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said that the shooting led the scientists to see if it was connected to the four previous attacks.
Overall, seven people have been killed and two wounded in nine attacks in four months, two mainly in the Latin American city.
"These things happen in the area of residence in front of the home," Howard said earlier this month to CBS's subsidiary KPHO.
Suspect is believed to have used several means of transport, such as Brown Nissan in the late 1990s, black BMW in the late 1990s and white Cadillac or Lincoln in the late 1990s.
Scientists have not agreed to reveal evidence that led to the conclusion that the attacks relate to each other and that they are the same killer.
Ellis, 33, went to a hospital that died later because of his injuries.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, died at the scene.
The witness told the police that they were sitting in a car parked often listening to music.
The authorities also published a police release on the shooting, which took place only half an hour before the triple death and was targeted by an empty open-package, which is also believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Scientists found bullet shells, bullet seats, and bullet fragments in the engine mode.
A 6-year-old mother with microchephalia: "Your business will be easier"
Edmund Picciuto, like most of the other six-year-olds, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But, unlike a large part of his old friends, Edmund is small-headed, this is the result of a genetic disorder from which his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know when he was pregnant.
"When he first came home, my first thought was that I couldn't do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't promise to do this.
What's not true at all - of course I made a promise," he said.
He and his husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund may never learn to recognize them, and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in institutional care.
"My first reaction was, "I didn't know people were still doing it," Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with a walker.
Edmund didn't sit or crawl like he was only three years old, and he still doesn't talk.
But he reaches slowly some milestones.
He walks with help and he drives a bike.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and sing.
Elizabeth's gonna show me how the sign Edmund's invented says "Would you sing to me?"
"We teach him a sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not a normal sign language, he tells me that Edmund has invented some of his own pins.
Microchephal may be caused by a number of reasons: genetics such as the case of Edmund, or during pregnancy virus infections such as ash vaccine or Zika virus.
Symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly.
It's too early to say how it affects the lives of those who have been infected with Zika.
Picciuto remembers the emotional burden of the uncertain future.
I was just asking what would happen.
What's gonna happen?
And he doesn't really know yet.
Actually, I haven't asked for a prophecy in a while because I don't expect anyone to give me that.
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for mothers who have children with birth defects caused by Zika.
It's gonna make things easier.
You can believe it's gonna make things easier.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
The rainy rain and flood caused rescue operations in Mississippi Louisiana.
In Louisiana, the harsh and widespread floods had the governor to declare an emergency on Friday, waiting for more rain to the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service reports that many rivers in southern Louisiana and the southern Mississippi flooded over their umbrellas and caused a large flood due to extreme rain.
Governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, said that the state authorities are constantly in contact with local authorities and that the aid is already coming to the counties that need it.
Mike Steele, a representative of the Governor's Office for Security and Emergency Preparation, said that they would receive requests for water vehicles, boats and sandshoes.
Steele said that the county of Tangipahoa alone asked for tens of thousands of sandbags.
The floodkeeper is valid until Saturday in a large part of southern Louisiana.
In the opinion of the Weather Service, there are still three to five cents of more rain in the area.
In the southern Alabama the flooding was valid on Friday, when the rain continued in Mobile.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River flowing near Denham Springs are both located in Louisiana, and they were predicted to set up the flood summit during the weekend.
Weather forecaster Alek Krautmann said that both rivers could flood several houses in suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that there is a lower threat to the flood of the Ascension county along the river when the rivers flood slowly to Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River in Lousiana Liverpool, south of the state of Mississippi, was at the highest level of all time on Friday morning at 9:00.
Saviors are still picking up people from the flood water in Amite and Wilkinson counties in Mississippi, southwest.
Leroy Hansford and his wife and grandson were close to Gloster on Friday.
62-year-old Hansford says that the water of Beaver Creek in his house, usually over 400 legs, rose rapidly during the night.
He says that another stepfather, who lives near, warned him.
"We wandered, and the water just kept rising," said Hansford.
It ran to my belt.
Hansford’s wife told her husband that she has not seen the water of the river so high during the 48 years she has lived there.
Hansford said that both he and his family have injuries, and that he is the only swimming skill.
Hansford said that rescue workers saved a threesome in a large, military-style truck and took them to a Gloster fire station where the rescued stayed on Friday.
Krautmann says that the floods “will quickly spread wide” as the roads continue, and that the authorities are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says that one eyewitness near Livingston reported a rain of 13.75 inches between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said that the country had been completely bored since Wednesday.
The flooding of harsh rain and streets led to the rescue of the inhabitants of the county of Tangipahoa from their homes and the cancellation of lessons in five school circles, the authorities told me.
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that a member of the city council in Tangipahoa said that 200 homes were flooded.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches, but they're both now under the flood.
The president of the county, Robby Miller, said that the authorities saved 72 people and 7 pets who had remained in the area of the rising water.
The cities of Amite and Hammond have opened shelters for those who have been evacuated.
"They can return to their homes when the water starts to fall," he said.
In the town of Hammond in the county of Tangipahoa, twenty streets were closed because of the water rise, and the inhabitants were allowed to pick up sandbags to try to keep the water out of their homes and movements.
"The latest large flood here was in March," said the city's governing authority Lacy Landrum.
This is going to be a similar case.
In Mississippi, Rupert Lacy, the emergency manager of the Harrison County, said that the steady rain continued on the Gulf of Mexico.
He said that on Thursday, the houses were reported to be flooded, but so far, Friday, there were no reports of flood.
Keith Townson, head of the Shopper Value Foods store in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and rain continues."
The six-year-old Mahaj Brown, full of bullets, survives the shooting in Philadelphia.
The police say that a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, which means shooting another six-year-old in the city this week.
The grandparents of the child told CBS Philadelphia his name was Mahaj Brown.
Grandparents say that Brown had several shooting wounds, including stabbes, legs, hand and stomach, but he was conscious when he was transferred to the hospital.
"He suffered a lot, his little body was full of bullets," the son's grandmother Delores Melendez tells the station.
I can't believe it.
In the hospital, the condition of the boy has been recorded as critical, and a number of surgery has been carried out.
The family tells the station that he's expected to recover.
The boy was starting his first class at local subschool.
Brown was one of the four shots in the Germantown block.
Three men were also shot: two 29 years old and one 32 years old.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported to be in critical condition; two other victims were in stable condition according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot at the front seat of the car together with a 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reported.
Two other victims weren't in the car, and the police are investigating whether one of the injured men could be a shooter.
Scientists tell CBS Philadelphia that it appears there was crossed between several shooters.
The type of anti-attacks, which originated from various attack weapons, filled the scene.
It seems that it was definitely a continuous battle.
There were shells on both sides of the walkway.
"So it seems that there were several armed fighters here, and that they were actively in battle," said Philadelphia Police Chief Anthony Ginaldi.
Several houses and transport equipment were also hit in the area.
No arrests have been made, and according to the information received, the police are investigating surveillance tapes.
Another six - year - old girl, she got hit by a deception on her hand on Tuesday when she was playing in front of her home in the neighbourhood of West Oak Lane.
He's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
That is why I call the Olympic Olympics team of women this year for more than one reason.
Firstly, I have been in every summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been such a dominant.
And secondly, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired many colorful girls.
The composition of this team, complemented by Jewish Aly Raisma and Catholic Madison Kocia, will make everyone proud.
This team looks like America at last.
It has also established the presence of black and Latin American women at the top of the species.
For the last four years, the most successful female forcer has been African-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were the first and second.
This is awesome.
In the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas surprised me as the Olympic Winner, and America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of the three-fold world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, where they present unexpected but mastery gymnastics.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American woman who has consecutively won individual culture in women's multiculturalism.
And teammate Aly Raisman got silver.
We see the top of the species, but the situation does not look like this in gymnastics across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie were all on the same path as Aly and Madiso when they reached the Olympic Team.
They are "Final Five" (the last five), because the following Olympic gymnast team will have only four gymnasts, and this is Marta Karoly's last year as coach.
The reality is, however, that gymnastics are a valuable species, and gymnastics are generally practising in private gymnastics, which are maintained by parents who pay training, spaces, travels, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (trainers and their gymnastics and families) and list continues.
Most of these gymnastics are located in prosperous suburbs that can support the species.
In these clubs, gymnasts receive all their training, and this is a costly and long - term commitment for the families of gymnasts.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles Coach, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started the gymnastics.
We need to bring cheaper and available gymnastics to communities where the numerous young girls Simone, Gabby and Laurie are encouraged.
I set up my gymnastics fund 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have offered free and affordable strength in Harlem for more than 15 000 urban young people (mainly for black and Latin) and we have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer high levels of gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this important Olympic species.
Strengthening develops body strength, flexibility and coordination, as well as mental greed, discipline and determination.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for good health and for school and work.
This team's enthusiasm makes thousands of young girls combine, and it's amazing.
Participation in sports is so important, especially for girls.
We're having an exciting time.
Thank you for Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for showing serious "girl power" by winning the Olympic team, and for motivating so many young girls coming from different backgrounds to start on the road towards a healthy, strong and successful young woman.
Physicians organizing new strikes after Jeremy Hunt's proposal was rejected.
Ministers had hoped that they would cease to change the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with the British Medical Association staff, but 58 per cent of the 37 000 doctors who participated in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt revealed the plans to force the contract, saying that NHS was on "unknown soil", and that even small delays damage staff and patients.
The first doctors will be transferred to a new agreement containing changes to working practices at night and weekends to improve treatment during difficult hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Committee of Physicians, said last night in the opinion: "The doctors still have serious concerns regarding the proposed agreement, in particular the fact that it accelerates the existing labour crisis and that it does not treat all doctors equally."
When only eight weeks remain before the first group of doctors are transferred to the new agreement, progress must be made and time is running out.
BMA’s attempts to resolve this dispute through negotiations have faced the government’s unwillingness to participate and periodically deep silence.
I saw Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door is always open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, eliminate the sanction and take into account the concerns of doctoral practitioners.
If he does not do so, doctors are ready to continue working fights.
At the end of April, the last strike meant almost 13,000 routine surgery and 100,000 postponement of reception periods when nurses and consulting doctors were recruited to act as doctors in the strike guard.
Ministers had hoped that they would end the changes to the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with the members of the British Medical Association.
BMA wants a better weekend salary for 54,000 doctors under the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, invited trainees to avoid strike.
Mortimer said: "The efforts achieve very little or nothing, but put pressure on the teams and services that are already in demand, and cause concerns, anxiety and disruptions to patients, caregivers and their families."
During the last two months, we have discussed the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, we have responded positively to their concerns regarding the role of control (Guardian Role) and the manifestations (Whistleblowing).
The employers were hoping that the continued positive debate on other important topics - such as development, flexibility in education, recurrence of sabbath freedom, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum programme, learning leave and gender pay gaps in medicine - would indicate how serious employers, the Health Education England Training Organization and the Ministry of Health are respecting the agreements reached with BMA in November, February and May.
Two pounds per day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients benefit from two pounds per day after the authorities recommended that it be given to humans longer.
A medicine that inhibits blood clotting, ticagrelor, drops the risk of recurring seizures in people with heart disease.
The medicine is given for 12 months after a heart attack in order to reduce the risk of stroke or other seizures.
NHS overseer NICE has advised that it should be given for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS' supervisor NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people get a heart attack each year in England, and one quarter of them get another stroke or stroke.
Cardiac attacks and strokes are due to a stenom forming a stenom that is accumulated in the arterial wall.
If the stenosis breaks, it can cause a blood clot that prevents the circulation in the heart, causing a heart attack.
If the coagulation is dissolved, it can go with the blood and break the blood circulation into the brain, causing stroke.
The people who have already had one seizure have increased the risk of getting another.
Ticagrelor, produced by AstraZeneca, the isobritannian company, which is sold by trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making clotting less likely.
The NICE guideline draft published today recommends that 90 mg of ticagrelor be given to humans for 12 months, followed by 60 mg of aspirin taken twice daily for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, head of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: "In spite of the availability of effective preventive treatments, even a quarter of the people who have had a heart attack will later receive another heart attack or stroke, the consequences of which are often disastrous."
Fear of regeneration can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of a person.
The evidence shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective to reduce the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
When we initially recommend ticagrelor, we are pleased to increase the available treatment options for thousands of people who may benefit from them.
As information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, especially with regard to the risk of bleeding for more than three years, the draft guideline is not recommended for longer treatment than for this period.
The culture of political correctness allows the prosperation of the electoral vile in Muslim regions
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was removed last year because of corruption, imposing a government report.
The culture of political regularity has led to the disregarding of the widely spreading vote fraud in Muslim communities, to be revealed today in a shocking government report.
The former Minister of Government, Sir Eric Pickles, calls on the police, the electoral officers and the city councils to ignore the evidence of electoral vineyards because of the hypersensitivity of the race and religion.
The former secretary of the Community, the current Emperor of corruption, said that the fear of voters on religious grounds is so serious that the police should be allowed to set guard chains to protect the voters who are scared outside the voting areas.
He recommends that the voters present the identity certificate when voting to prove who they are.
Today, only one voter must say his name and address.
The report even suggests that a voter's finger be placed in an indestructible ink so that no one can vote twice.
Sir Eric says we should protect the reporters better.
He calls for the press to be wider access to the documents and decisions of the delegation which the informal committees or the working group have taken.
"This would not only protect from election, but would protect local government from a wider culture of corruption and economic fraud, which goes in hand with the electoral vineyard," he said.
The government ordered the report following the vote scandal of the East London Tower Hamlets.
Last year, the Special Election Court decided that the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office as a result of a number of accusations of corruption and illegal activities.
The Court stated that Rahman "singlely distorted" the religious emotions of his Muslim community, as well as the silent accusation of his critics about racism and Islamic fear.
Rahman is said to "have led his campaign of elections on the basis of the religious obligation of faithful Muslims to vote for him".
Up to 300 votes were suspicious or resulted in the fact that a person was voting on another one.
Sir Eric said there's evidence in the wilderness in the whole country.
He expressed particular concern in the post-election of the election vineyard, where the members of the high-value Muslim community were said to pressure people to vote on the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric, in the picture, made a number of recommendations on the cleaning of the voting system, including the proof of identity with the ID certificate.
The report states: "The evidence was presented that vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, were pressured to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities with a Pakistani or bangladesian background.
"I was concerned that...the institutions of the State had ignored such behavior because of the hypersensitivity of "politically correct" race and religion."
Sir Eric put forward 50 proposals for cleaning the system, which included the prohibition that political activists would be allowed to deal with the voting tickets received by post in order to end the "speaking of votes".
The report examined by Theresa May also calls for more stringent amendments to registers in order to prevent the use of the election register for fraud in immigration and compensation.
Consider alternatives to demonstrating the identity of the voters before voting.
Use the finger of an undefeated ink voter so that no one can vote twice.
To carry out systematic national amendments to ensure that they are entitled to vote.
Set a three-year limit to requests for automatic postal voting.
Prevent the political activists from handling the voices and envelopes that have been sent through the post.
Let the police set security chains around the voting stations.
Change the law so that it is easier to accuse people of scary under the Representation of the People Act of 1983.
Make photography illegal at voters.
It requires only English (except Wales) to be used in voting places.
Strengthen training to ensure that the staff are in line with the rule that the electorate should go to the cab alone.
Sir Eric, you have the Great London police forces, saying that it's "astonishing" not after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The Electoral Court will remain with Lutfur Rahman and his officials as a result of a number of corruption and illegal activities," he said.
On the basis of a number of criteria, he was found guilty without doubt, on the basis of the criminal evidence threshold.
He also criticises the ineffective "rash screen inspections" in the voting offices of the city councils.
Sir Eric said, "The last year's Tower Hamlets sentence was a wake-up.
Our nation has a glorious heritage as a generator of parliaments, but this worrying and mysterious proliferation of electoral vineyard and the denial of facts in certain groups threatens this good reputation."
Insanely, Kate's bicycler twin solo and other pictures of the celebrity in the Olympics of Rion
This week, the fans at the Rion 2016 Olympics have gone crazy about a French bikeman, Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has been proven to be the impressive double player of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic representative is definitely not the only sportsman fighting gold this summer who can praise his own famous double being, at least according to the social media.
So for the honor of Rio's races and all the famous faces on our screens, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic athletes that clearly appear to be Hollywood's celebrities.
Hunter and wolf: a member of the US Men's Fire Shooting Team, Brady Ellison, on the left, is compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate's double creature on the bicycle track, many people online have been quick to point out how a certain shovel could be a star of Leonardo DiCaprion's twin.
Brady Ellison, a member of the United States Men's Fire Shooting Team, has caused a storm on Twitter after the surface of his images, where he seems to be scary as the star of The Wolf of Wall Street.
And in fact, when he became aware of the agitation of the social media, the bowling snipers acknowledged that he has heard he appeared to Leo since he was a child.
"I don't see a lot of similarity, except for a beard," Brady told Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess this is a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons in London in 2012 will certainly also emerge this year: a brilliant similarity between British long-term jumps Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The largest, apparent eyes of the Russian gymnast Alya Blackfina has been said to be a Cuban-American singer of Gloria Estefan's double creature.
And in the pool, a South African swimmer named Cameron van der Burgh has been comparing Glee Star to Matthew Morrison for years.
Larger switch to the eye: The user thinks Nathan is an Inception actress's "Athletic version"
Another long-term comparison has been tennis star Rafael Nadal and an actor between Josh Hartnett, where both have similar strong corner hairs and lips.
Russian silver swimmer Yulia Efimova has more than the same actor with Annalynne McCord as a brown skin and blonde hair, while the US team Nathan Adrian reminds the fans of "Joseph Gordon Levitti sports version".
Hard women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, distributes the same face shape and eyes
Not only: One Twitter user was very pleased that others saw similarities
Presentation of the theory: According to this user, there may be a reason between a couple of similarities
One Twitter user recently expressed his happiness on the site that "other people on the Internet think that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
And the U.S. football star and Dexter's actress have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings and his smile, which is almost identical with the smile of the actress Laura Linney, and the gold medal winner Gabby Douglas, whose own, beautifully wide smile match Bring It On to Gabrielle's smile of the Union.
The CBC Olympic Commander presents an apology after saying the Chinese swimmer "death like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth-year-old woman's 4x200 metre free-swimming message maddened on Wednesday CBC's direct Olympic broadcasters.
The Canadian TV company CBC had to apologize after one of its speakers said the 14-year-old Chinese female mackerel "dead as bad as smell" and "dead as a pig".
The reporter Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was turned off when he began to share some of his own opinions in the communication final of women's 4x200 meters free swim.
MacDonald, who came to the CBC's scanners to bring "color", was heard to say, "That little 14-year-old China flipped you, baby.
Too enthusiastic, lost like a bad smell, died like a pig.
"Thank you for that."
Chinese bather Ai Yanhan, 14, swim the message at the second time 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than the Canadian Taylor Ruck, which gave Canada the opportunity to catch China.
Viewers around Canada respond rapidly online after shocking the language and its volume.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did the CBC reporter just say that China's 14-year-old swimmer "dead like a pig"?
"The idiot didn't realize he was still in direct transmission."
China Ai Yanhan was described in the Communication Final of 4 x 200 metres of women's free swim as follows: "That tiny 14-year-old China is your collar, baby."
The review of Byron MacDonald against Twitter was heroic and fast, many challenged him.
Twitter users did not arrest themselves when they heard how ignorant Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and you make us all sound like a racist gang.
Soon after this, Scott Russell, who was running the CBC's shipment, apologized for MacDonald's comment, saying, "We are asking that the comment on the swim was sent to the shipment.
It was a unfortunate choice of words, we are sorry that this happened."
The CBC ended up asking for forgiveness more than 90 times for people who had tweeted as a reply to the comment.
Scott Russell, the reporter, had to apologize for MacDonald.
After that, CBC copied and joined an apology for over 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments.
The TV company also quickly apologized and published an opinion.
We are deeply sorry that these statements were made and that they were sent straight.
Last night we quickly took action, and in direct communication we apologized to our viewers and our successors in social media.
For the sake of clarity, it must be said that Byron's comments were related to the performance of the swimmer, not to him as a person.
However, this was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for his message.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologised in direct transmission and tried to define his observations by noting that he did not mean to be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize at this moment for the comment I made last night after the women's message," he said in the CBC Olympics.
"I was referring to the swimmer's performance, not to him as a person."
"It seems unnecessary to say that I didn't mean it to be disrespectful, and that I'm really sorry."
Primark’s client was shocked by a woman who rudely reconciled underwear in the middle of trade
Customers didn't know where to watch a woman take off in the middle of Primark's movement to try underwear.
It did not cure the fact that after assessing what she looked like in the pants, the woman peeled them off and put them back on the shelf.
He continued to twist and eventually agreed four underwear at the shop located at Bouverie Place's shopping center in Folkestone.
Primark's store at Bouverie Place's shopping center in Folkestone, where she reconciled her underwear and then put them back in the shelf.
At the same time, the mother of two children at the store said after testing underwear, the mysterious woman "weared again and walked away from the store without buying anything".
He said, "The people didn't believe their eyes."
The woman stood in the middle of the store floor, took a couple of underwear, stripped off her own pants and underwear, and put on his adjustable legs.
"He didn't even try to find a remote place for reconciliation, he just stood in it without shame."
"Everyone stared when he took off his underwear and clearly didn't like them because he put them back on the shelf."
He did the same for three couples before finally decided that he didn't like anything he saw, he dressed again and walked out.
"He didn't seem to care who watched or thinking about a person who would end up buying the underwear he agreed to."
Davidson, a 33-year-old in Kent's town, said, "It's hateful to think that someone takes home the underwear that someone else has tried, but which has not been cleaned."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added, "I ordered that the staff apparently tried to remove the wardrobes after she left, which is good."
"It would be terrible to go home with new underwear and see that another woman has dressed them and stripped them off, and they have not been washed."
Primark’s representative said: “Primark is aware of the incident that took place in Folkestone’s movement on Tuesday 9 August.
All the products in question have been removed from sales."
This way you can defend yourself from armed attacks using Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this Dailymail.com video can make it a little safer for you.
We talked to the New York Grand Master of Krav Maga Federation, Rhon Mizrachi, to find out how to deal with gunfighting robbers in the near range.
Then we approached you from the front or behind, this video shows how you can pay the attacker at the same time.
According to Mizrach, if you're approaching the back, the first thing to do is turn around to see your attacker and "scratch the line of fire".
Then you catch the gun between the elbow and the shoulder before you hit the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Keep hitting on the knee in the necks, and when the assailant goes into the pain of the pain, pull the gun from his hand, hit him in the back of the weapon, and stand back on him.
If the armed person approaches the front, the technology is similar: remove your body from the line of fire, grab the gun and turn it around so that the criminal can't fire.
At the same time, put weight on the gun and hit the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun from his sleeve, back and point him with a gun.
Does that sound difficult?
Look at the video, exactly how Mizrachi's doing this.
But remember, if you're not the great champion of Krav Maga, the safest way out of the robbery situation is to give up your money.
Tourist Ian Wright licks Europe's dirtyest places for a guide
The British tourist has put a serious challenge on its immune system and oksening reflex by licking some of the most dirty and nighty places in Europe.
From Suffolk, a contender and traveling writer Ian Wright, 51, laundered euro banknotes, piccadilly Circus, the toilet in the train and the Russian public phone to prove the strength of its immune system.
Before he licked each object, he used a photometer to show himself and us the situation he was about to face.
However, the experiment made by a film called the Inner Force, produced surprising results.
The idea of arrowing a few thousand people's train hydraulic label may seem completely unpleasant, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in the kitchen leaf.
On his way across Europe, Wright kept talking to doctors and medical professionals about strengthening intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, none of his arrows left him any other bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became a well - known intestinal sustainability tester when he traveled around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
This task extending from public railway stations to the toilet to the hydraulic device really tested his immune system.
In the film he made, he said, "I've been quite careless about my health since childhood, and I've put all kinds of things in my mouth from soil, worms, and rainy water."
He certainly confirmed his reputation during the movie.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
His sample had more than 4000 units in the photometer.
For the purpose of comparison, the reading of the newlywed hands should be less than 60.
But in one Russian public bathroom, he refused to lick when the photometric result showed more than 4,000 units, and the results of the newlywed hands were less than 60.
Wright has produced a traveller's film on the tracks of the Inner Power, together with the Finnish dairy, Valion. The film shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
In the movie, the wedding said, "This is almost the worst thing I've ever smelled in the toilet."
There's nothing dirtyer than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything because there's something to do here.
Inner power was produced together with the Finnish dairy, Valion.
The company offered to Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D that help enhance human intestinal obacteria and immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, head of the selection of snacks, juice and new categories, said: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to watch, and at the same time explains the interests of the probiotics.
We threw a lot of crazy ideas in the air, and we ended up thinking, "Let's call Ian."
They claim that interest in the health of the intestines is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: to tell us about the good and bad bacteria of our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and its connection to the immune system.
The growing interest in the health of the intestines is a global phenomenon, and this documentary film will allow us to inform more consumers about it in an interesting way.
In my opinion, the document also shows that we have a wonderful sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, director of the document, added: "Let's say it now: if Ian had kissed some of the things that I asked him, like the Russian toilet that was in the movie, I would have lost my respect for him."
Understandably, some of the licking issues were easier for Ian, while some were rather difficult.
I'm glad we got some of those dirty arrows saved."
In the survey carried out by the Commission in 2015, 84% of respondents combined the milk acid bacteria specifically with the well-being of the stomach and the intestines, 58% said that at least sometimes they use products added to milk acid bacteria.
The Humidity family destroyed the rental house in Cornwall Saltash, before deciding.
The vicious family caused the damage of £50,000 to his tenant house after they were expelled for the terroristisation of the neighbors.
Tanya Keldon and his partner, Shaun Trebilcock, have been thrown out of the building in Cornwall Saltash, following numerous complaints.
When they were forced to remove them from the property, the shocked residents of the housing company found that the property was in poor condition.
There were shooting holes in the walls, the floorboards were torn, the waste was spread on the floor, and the walls were smuggled with graffits.
The family has now moved elsewhere, and they are believed to live in private accommodation.
Conna McEvoy, host of Cornwall Housing, said he was afraid that the property could not be repaired.
He said, "This has been a real nightmare for the people, and I think that people should not have to live like this.
There are many issues to be considered here, as this property is likely to be known through the less comfortable groups of Cornwall.
This family is bad-famous, and their name is bad-famous."
The couple had three sons who lived in real estate between them, and the police said that the fear of the family had a street fight with baseball batteries, scaring nearby residents, using drugs, selling drugs, and overwhelming, arguing and crying.
In June, the 47-year-old Skeldon, whose name was the lease agreement, received a decision on unsocial behaviour.
There were old garbage in the rooms of many houses underneath the purgatory.
The property from which the drugs had been handed in the past, the floorboards had been swept up.
The neighbors said that the family was seen fighting on the street, and that the police were regularly called.
Cornwall Housing was forced by the woman and this partner's property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks, time to change voluntarily.
The facilitated neighbours thanked the call, saying that their lives had become a hell of a thing.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived in their neighbours for 20 years, and the situation has always been bad.
We've seen the police here incredibly many times.
"This morning, we didn't get any sleep.
We got up because it was so quiet here that we haven't used to it!
It's lovely, now that they're finally gone."
Cornwall Housing's neighborhood executive director Adam Fitzpatrick said that the family did not cooperate with the local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and the police were often invited to the property.
The garbage and old toys have been thrown down on the wild walls of the rental house.
He added: "It is a pity that the resident did not take any responsibility for the conduct of his own and his family, for the decision is always the last course of practice considered by Cornwall Housing.
This was a very difficult case, for behavior was extreme, and their actions must have frightened the neighbors.
I appreciate all the work of my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, as well as the bold members of the community that gave us information.
I hope that this development will bring comfort to the neighbours and send a message that antisocial use will not be accepted.
Fitzpatrick said that three boys all lived in real estate in different times, but they were all in twenty.
After the emergency, a dirty mattress left on the floor of one bedroom
Workers of the housing company need to clean up the waste surfaces surrounding the house now
In 2014, the police made a raid for real estate and found more than 70 g of cannabis, as well as vase, supplies and £1700 in cash.
Skeldon received fines after giving offences for the possession of a class B drug as a plan to extend it.
He claimed that the money was intended for his son, Lee Skeldon's gravestone, which died in a car accident in 2013.
Apparently, Tanya and her partners live homelessly after they are now frozen in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
A lot of graffitis were tucked on the walls of the house's rooms.
The police say they're trying to take away the residents who mock the rules of their rental contract.
Angela Crow Devon and Cornwall's police said that the decision was a clear warning to other tenants who continue to mock the rules.
"This is a message for those who think that their behavior is without consequences, and for those who suffer from such behavior," he said.
Devon's and Cornwall's police will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behaviour, and the police will continue working with their partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were terrified when a military skiing machine flew down the coast.
Sunbathing tourists in Aveiro, Portugal experienced a shock
The Portuguese Air Forces P-3C Orion would sweep by very low
Air Force said it was a training flight and claimed that safety was not compromised.
Just now, the terrified tourists began to panic when a low - flying shower was wiped across the full beach.
The dramatic recording shows how the military plane came to the nearest contact distance of the solar worshipers in the North Portugal Aveiro.
The holidayrs stood up when they were clearly concerned about the sound of the shower, even though they did not see what was coming from behind the clouds.
The incident took place in Costa Nova, near Aveiro last afternoon.
One of the numerous vacationers who published videos of dramatic passports in social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said, "It passed twice really low, and together it seemed to be falling into the country."
Nuno Arroja added, "I was surfing, and it really felt like the plane was falling on me."
The tourists on the beach in Aveiro were terrified when the plane appeared from the darkness and flew incredibly low
The Portuguese air forces today said that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify fishing boats near the coast, and that the plane had to land so low because it was the only way to check the boats.
He said that the shower had fly significantly lower than usual due to the poor visibility of the smoke of nearby terrains, but the air forces assured that no one was in danger.
The landscape fires have destroyed parts of the Manner-Portugal this summer, and four people have died on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air forces today said that the pilot had to fly because of the low visibility conditions, the smoke caused by landscapes and the thick fog,
The airplane was on a training flight, and as part of the training, the pilot was invited to identify the fishing boats.
Exoten the result of the first half of a year better than expected
The Social and Health Circle of South Karelia (Eksote) made a better result than planned in January - June.
The exoten result was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services where the development of preventive services has been able to dismantle plant care.
The custody was implemented in all the actions.
This year, the exote aims to shorten the line of action.
The exotic covers the surplus of the previous deficit.
The surplus may be used to shorten the lines and to buy measures for patients.
The result of the entire year is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The exoten government will deal with the six-year review at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 special ice creams were sworn in the military light in Immola
The 70 guardians at the Border and Maritime School swore a military response on Friday.
The Military Council of Army at the Border and Maritime Guard School was held in Immola on Friday.
The 10th Primary Bargaining Course was held at the sports field of the garage.
A soldier's whale swore 70 guardians.
Special frontiers will be trained for demanding cross-border security, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people picked up to be a special iceline.
The choice tests were called 250.
Special icelines have been trained in Immola since 2007.
Five veterans of the border forces were involved in a veteran meeting during the occasion of the voluntarily event.
The average age of those with him is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who participated in the event have been born in 1918.
A circle of robbers above - criminal intelligence helps to investigate crimes and reveals serious crime - ESS.fi
From the beginning of 2014, each of the 11 police departments in Finland has operated by RTA, i.e. a criminal intelligence and analysis unit.
The operation of the unit is invisible outwards.
In the Hämeen Police Department, the unit includes four officers in Lahd and Hämeenlinna.
It's pulled by the Sergeant in the Gulf.
He's an executive officer in Inspector Lahti.
In addition, the strength of the unit is a civilian dedicated to IT in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in civilian suits.
The unit has demonstrated its viability and necessity, see the deputy chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces a variety of investigations for the other police.
In a distraction, it has acquired information on asylum seekers.
The most recent reform of working practices
Establishment of analytical units is the latest reform of police practices.
The aim has been to prevent crimes, that is, the fact that the police would be more and less likely to go to the scene until they get the alarm.
With the information collected and analysed by the unit, daily police activities are targeted where it is most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, there was one crime intelligence centre, less than three national units and their own criminal intelligence unit in each police department.
The PTR Centre in the Central Crime Police in Vantaa will manage operations nationally.
PTR units work people from the Police, Customs and Border Guards, according to their name.
The RTA units, on their own, work in areas distributed according to the police departments and are responsible for providing information to both local police forces and national units.
Inquiry extends beyond its own territory
Where the individual police are aware of what has happened during their 12-hour shift, the task of the RTA unit is to know what happens in the entire area of the police department.
The intelligence also extends beyond the limits of its own facility, as crime does.
Those working in the RTA unit have better computer skills than basic police.
By means of registers, alarm databases and observations, the unit aims to draw the attention of the police to new phenomena, productive criminals or similar crimes.
This is called serialisation, and it is one of the most important tools for criminal intelligence.
All people have their own ways of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether honest or criminal.
On the basis of an activation, the factor is made up of a certain image.
The series may be carried out either on the basis of an act or on the basis of a person, depending on which police have more information.
Criminals Learn From their Errors
The employees of the RTA unit don't travel in the city with their necks standing up, but their work is not entirely public.
There are no reports of the methods used by both their own and criminals, because this could lead to the development of professional criminals and thus attempting to prevent police crime prevention companies.
The procedures of the police will be publicly informed if they are expected to threaten them.
This case was, for example, news from early summer, the way in which empty dwellings were used in housing breaks.
That's where the authors put the apartment in the outside door with a stick, a button needle or a piece of tape that they tried to see if the residents were really on their way.
The pre-examining material shall be public to the parties at least.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from the mistakes they have made.
The smartest are ordering a court protocol, for example, showing that fingerprints have been found on the site.
Next time, the gloves go to the thieves.
For the purpose of the case, an interrogation has been carried out by Tero Seppä from Hämee Police Officer, Inspector Tuomo Lepola from the Eastern Finland Police Office, Inspector Sami Joutjärve from Joensuu Police Station and inspector Arto Judgment from Central Crime Police.
The police are collecting and analysing information to plan practical activities.
In the background, the reduction in labour force and funding.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The last change was the three-step PORA reform, which ended by the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects information from the outside of its own institution and Finland's borders.
A school girl acceded to fathers from London killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of the three British school girls who left London last year to join Issi, has been rumored to die in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee said that the girl's family heard this death in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
The ITV News news on Thursday that the girl was believed to be dead at the Russian air strike in Raqqa, the foundation of the organization in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just when she was planning to escape the war from the land and return to Britain.
"You can only hope that the only benefit of the case is that it can act as a tombstone and a will for others that there are real risks to go to the war zone - that it could make people give up on such a decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sulta and two other Eastern school girls flew to Turkey, from which they went on a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultanan family was told that the girl was married to the Isis fighter in Syria, and that she only became a widow after a few months.
Reid says Clinton will consider Garland's Supreme Court candidate if he's elected.
The Senate’s Democratic Director, Harry Reid, says that he is convinced that Hillary Clinton, the candidate of the Democratic President, will appoint Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected President.
The Republicans of Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama appointed him in March.
Mitch McConnell, director of the majority of the Senate, says that the next president will choose a person to replace Mr Antonin Scali.
On Thursday's phone talk, Reid said he'd predict "very certainty" Clinton's going to pick Garland.
Later, Reid's representative said that he had not spoken to Clinton directly about his appointment with Garland, and that it was speculation.
He commended Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to "boat a boat" with a new choice.
Garland is the Supreme Judge of the Court of Appeal in District of Columbia.
Reid said that the Republicans that prevent Garland's name are the President-in-Office of the Republicans Donald Trump's "treaters" and "possibly" candidate.
He said Trump doesn't fit for office.
Treats says naked calendar is for women as well as men.
The Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere to publish the 1970s inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of naked celebrations, they intend to find their next top-model generation 2017 NU Muses calendar.
The Chairman of Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with naked images differs from the old school Playboy because "Playboy is for men".
I'm doing this to women.
Apparently, he thinks he's got a calendar for them.
"We must start again to introduce untimely and classical nakedness where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired with these naked women's circles," said Shaw in the press release, where the calendar was published.
Women want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful art.
Models can leave photos through the network or personally in open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl destination: Who actually buys discs?
Lonely, middle-aged men love vinyles.
Before you run to complete the comment with irritated insults, whose author has a name NoAllUnage One-ageMiehet, you will find that this claim is based on real information.
According to YouGov, the new arrival of much-speaking discs is not because more and more people born in this millennium become enthusiastic about the novelty of physical objects, but of the medieval well.
Apparently, those who have purchased a vinyl disc in the near future are most likely 45-54 years old.
In fact, the most unlikely to buy discs is the age group of 18-24-year-olds.
Moreover, the issue is not just the collection of adventures, but includes emotions: older buyers of vinyls are a little more likely to hold their feelings inside (56% vs 53%) and enjoy their loneliness (69% vs 66%).
But is YouGov's results correct?
If this blog were a TV news report, the camera would follow me when I was walking in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest grey suit on me.
Let's take a closer look at this.
At the same time, when Soho's charming power and dirt are slowly removed - hotels, chain restaurants and office cabins now fill the buildings that used to have independent movements - a brilliant specialized record store still remains.
For the next section, I would probably ask the camera to stop photographing for a moment when I stand very close to various men in some of these stores by trying to assess their age and emotional empire.
Studart of Glasgowlainen, 55, followed by Sister Ray (counter: two young women, three middle-aged men), Reckless Records (counter: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably twenty), spends his afternoon in London due to a meeting, and circulating shops to spend a few hours.
I'm asking if he's a collector.
"I guess I am," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records that appear above the picture (they sent the sample by email, I did not follow him home) cover his living room walls.
The reason for obtaining such a huge record and single amount is partly the result of his available income: now he can buy discs that he could not afford when they were originally published, and he can rebuy those that he sold when he was young and without money.
"A large part of the material I bought is late in the '60s and early in the '70s, records that were published when there were 11 or 12 albums that I was probably a little young to get," he says.
He agrees that the buyers of the discs are more likely to be introvertes that enjoy their company, and adds: "I do not smoke or drink much.
This is my badness."
A 25-year-old Wez, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of his encountered customers fit the YouGov profile.
However, he has noticed the people of a new wave that the media's enthusiasm has affected. People who have heard that the records have come back into fashion and who have come to the need to buy back their old records.
On the basis of my discussions, people have generally been separated from their collection in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records back," he says.
This may explain the increase in the number of vinyl susceptibles aged.
But what about the alleged emotion of the discs?
In a trade like Phonica, it takes a few seconds to realize that disclosing offers a comforting community to similar types.
According to Wez, some older customers have been injured, in particular, by the near-payment system.
Some vinyl fans can wander from the digital world and choose to trust in the persistence of familiar record covers; objects that bring up the memories of the Tennis Happy Days.
"I think that sometimes it may be about filling a hole or some kind of comfort, which is to be owned by objects," says Wez.
As a collector myself, I admit that this is true, and I believe it is true for many people.
It's an easy way to fill the thoughts.
"We're like their social workers!" another employee suddenly said from the recording.
The April opinion survey carried out by the ICM revealed that almost 50% of the people who had bought the vinyl plate in the previous month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a recordplayer that they never use, whereas 7% of buyers of vinyles do not have a recordplayer.
This is where the news report is likely to appear to be a serious concern when the bossa nova collections are on the back.
This "Award" aspect of the resurrection is something that has also been observed by Jonny, 42 working in the Sounds of the Universe (counter: three middle-aged men).
"Someone came in a while ago and said, "I don't have a recording, but I want to buy the Radiohead disc so we can put it on the shelf," he says.
This is not a major part, but this is definitely happening.
More product, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a recording player."
So not the parents, but the younger people, the late ages, who are just getting excited about it.
In the Fop, which now has a virtually full layer reserved for vinyles, I have a much more diverse audience on my arrival.
Seventy couples, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Even though the atmosphere is less relaxed than the movements mentioned earlier - the sounding of Wild Beast's latest sinful and sexy pop, and not the improvisation jazz - is great to see a variety of customers.
None of them look very lonely, but it's hard to point out the truth by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Foppi for a few minutes, watching various discs in sale.
He's making window purchases, not spending much money.
He tells me he doesn't make much money, so record collection isn't really an option.
"It's expensive.
It's easy to listen to music on a computer or something else, but the beauty of vinyl is..." he shouts in love.
"I don't know how to explain it, it's really unique."
My last stop is said to have raised the new vinyl lovers' generation: Urban Outfitters.
At the same time that I'm trying to look at the jeanshorts, I've seen a group of teenage girls gathering around the Polaroid cameras for a while before my father and daughter thought about buying Crosley's records.
On the left, there is a staircase with the wall of Adelen, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a blend of modern music and classics, any of the essential albums of the average collection.
No one will look at them, perhaps because they're just decoratives, and some are so high that it's impossible to touch them.
It's purely "art vinyls".
But given that even the small attention given to these items can mean more money for industry and send some customers to Soho's feeders to get more, there is little complaint here.
It is no surprise that the population that is more likely to have more time and money than others is also the one that uses most for luxury, such as vinyles.
But although my findings suggest that YouGov's results are valid at least in Soho's record stores, they do not exclude the large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world, in record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard at school or at the office.
They certainly do not spend their Thursday mornings by mapping around Berwick Street's record shops, explaining records and avoiding the creepy 30-year-old TV director's look at this incredible middle-aged men's shoulders in this skull.
The Holker is the most vivid spinal animal - video report
Scientists say the holker has a longer lifetime than any other planet's spinal cord.
Julius Nielsen, who studied the shark, says that the record is in a female whose age is believed to be between 272 and 512 years, which is five metres long.
The French Court rejects the application to dismantle trades from Jungle refugee camp
The French court has rejected the application of Calais’ authorities to dismantle tens of temporary stores and restaurants from Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
In court proceedings this week, Calais's authorities argued that the state should be able to dismantle all 72 temporary trades where people sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts or sell tea at 50 cents (40 cents), or sell simple food at a few euros of temporary restaurants.
The Office of the Prefect Calais argued that the sites should be dismantled because they represent the non-paid co-production of taxes and are a risk of fire and cleaning.
Humanitarian groups have told the Court that trades and restaurants are vital to say that free meals offered by the government and other groups do not offer enough food for the growing number of people in the camp.
They argued that temporary stores and restaurants often provide protection and free meals for those who need them.
The Court in Lille ordered that there were no legal grounds for extinguishing 72 temporary traders, but said that Calais's prefekt's concern was "to be fully understandable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafes and restaurants had a much greater role than just feeding people living in extreme uncertain conditions.
He said that the premises offered peaceful meetings for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places undergoing the bulk was the camp Jungle Book Kids' Cafe, whose activity is unprofitable and offers 200 meals daily, English and French hours, as well as asylum advice for hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect children’s coffee shop.
The letter sent to Guardian said that closing the coffee shop would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old.
Two charity organizations, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number of people in the Jungle camp has risen to 9000 people - top reading - after the number of arrivals rose sharply during the summer.
Food prices fall clearly faster in Finland than the average in the EU
Food will be cheaper in Finland for the joy of consumers and for the problems of producers.
In Finland, food prices have fallen by almost 5 per cent in three years, while on average in EU countries their price fell by 0.9 per cent.
At the same time, food has become one percent more expensive in Germany and Sweden.
During the last three years, the price of food has fallen to the second in Finland from the EU countries with the same level of wages as in Finland.
Compared in Britain only, food price has fallen faster than in Finland.
The data are published by the Director of Statistics Finland's Development, Ilkka Lehtinen, an article published in the Information & Trendit blog.
The media compared real prices, i.e. prices, which are proportionate to the overall development of consumer prices.
The latest information is from June this year.
At the beginning of the 2010s, the price of food rose strongly.
In 2013, prices fell close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came after EU membership," says Lehtinen.
Then the turn followed, after which the food has become cheaper for a year.
Now the bans on imports of food imposed by Russia, which have blocked the food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and producer prices have fallen.
"Putin's policy has helped the Finnish consumer in short terms," says Lehtinen.
The increased price competition in industry and trade has also affected the fall in prices.
Large trading chains S-group and Kesko have both fallen prices.
For the consumer, the price competition has been shown as a major advertising campaign.
However, Finland is still not a low-cost diet, even though the price of food has fallen abundantly.
In 2015, food was the fourth of the most expensive EU countries with similar wage levels in Finland.
According to the newspaper, the price of food sold in Finland has a significant impact on VAT.
He found that if the comparator countries had the same VAT rate, the third of the cheapest food would be sold in Finland from similar countries.
The journalist compared Finland with Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven in the comparative countries, only Germans and the Dutch would sell cheaper food than Finnishs.
"If we want to get to the level of food at the prices of the old EU countries, VAT must be pooled to the average level of the EU countries and continue to compete for prices," Lehtinen writes.
The journalist points out that the calculations made by him at the rate of VAT are indicative.
The school isn't exactly the same.
A returning to the school seat may notice that a change in school has taken place during the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all sub-schools.
It is an instruction that all schools in Finland operate.
The schools decide the details themselves, but the plan sets out the official objectives.
New instructions have been prepared for several years and differ in many ways from the old guidelines.
Among other things, the teaching of a beauty article is abandoned, and instead, schools start to practice coding.
Sweden's education starts at the latest in the sixth grade, and the social guide is already started in four.
However, the main change concerns the role of students.
It was thought that the teacher would teach students, but now everyone should be active and learn from one another.
This is how people try to make school visits more interesting.
The longest spinal cord found in the world - ice shark can live for up to 400 years
Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) known in the refrigerators reaches a genital maturity only at the age of 150.
It can still live for 250 years afterwards, report a new research.
The figures make the species the longest spinal cord of the modern world.
In the animal, only an Islamic womb, the oldest known individual has been scheduled to be 507 years old.
Greenland sharks swim along the North Atlantic.
They also have another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic region.
The females are stretching dogs longer, and they can grow up to more than five feet.
Since the growth rate is slow, according to the follow-up, only about a centimetre a year, adult individuals have lived for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues from the University of Copenhagen found out.
He determined the ice sharks of adults for every 28 nails that had been caught by fishermen.
The age of the fish was discovered from radio-carbon driving the eye lenses.
The average age of studied sharks proved to be at least 272 years.
Two of the largest fish in the sample, 493 and 502 cents of amazone population, were discovered by about 335 and 392 years of age.
Since previous studies have shown that ice-creaming stems are only more than four metres of genital maturity, researchers decreased that they were about 150 years old at the time.

We're fired from Stockmann to nearly 300 - salesmen will not be deducted
Approximately 300 workers are dismissed from Stockmann.
At the beginning of August, the cooperative companies in the company which had become troubled ended.
"The outcome of the negotiations will reduce about 300 jobs, of which the main part will be redundancies," Stockmann reports.
It states that the number of sellers in the goods sector is not reduced so that the customer service does not suffer.
In addition, some 80 employees of support activities will be offered a new job as a vendor.
Stockmann’s yt-negotiations concerned about 3,000 employees.
At the beginning, the need for reduction was estimated to be about 380 employees.
The reduction aims at annual cost savings of around EUR 20 million, which are to be realised over the next year.
Stockmann has already launched an efficiency programme to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
Stockmann's difficulties in profitability are the background.
Although the company’s adjusted operating result improved in the second quarter to EUR 11.1 million, the trade in goods is still losing.
According to Stockmann, according to CEO Lauri Veijalainen, the sale in the commodities has not attracted the aims set by the company.
"The reductions in human beings are unfortunately necessary to ensure the positive performance of Stockmann Retail in 2018," says Veijalainen.
The result improvement of the second quarter was especially the good success of the Lindex.
Ketju achieved the best second quarter of all time's turnover and results.
The operating profit of Lindex increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
During the corresponding period last year, the whole Stockmann Group’s operating result was 4.1 million losses.
Stockmann estimates that this year's net sales of the group will decrease last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the most rainy in the north... temperature below 20 degrees in the whole country.
The low pressure center on the north of Finland will keep the weather on a rainy Friday, reports the meteorologist of HS Ilona Láng.
Also in the middle of the earth there will be raincrows, but the southern is the fountain.
The temperature is no longer very summer, for the whole country's mercury is below 20 degrees.
In the rainy regions of the north, 10 to 15 degrees.
Kenya’s general sports team is shaking the dopingscandal - a strange explanation for the temperament of the coach
Kenya’s general sports coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Olympic Olympics of Rio after it became apparent that Anzrah was a country sportsman in the doping test.
The news office AP reported that an athlete at which Anzrah tried to act is a star of Ferguson Rotich of 800 metres.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of Kenya's country team, told me that Anzrah's identity was revealed after he had given a sample of Rotichina in the surprise test.
Doping officials came to report to Anzrah's authorities.
Soin said Anzrah was sent home because he "make his crimes against Kenya's country team".
He appeared as an athlete, gave a urine sample and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such use," Chairman of the Olympic Committee of Kenya Kip Keino, the news office of Reuters.
The Olympic general sport begins on Friday, and Rotich is about to run immediately at the time.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the case.
Rotich last year was placed in the MM races on his way to the fourth and has preceded Rio's winner favourites.
According to Reuters, the source inside Kenya's general sports team claimed that Anzrah went to the accreditation card only to get free meals at the race club.
When the antidoping officials met him, they assumed he was an athlete, and he was taken to the test.
The coach did not explain the situation to officials because he was afraid to reveal himself," the source told me.
Where's everybody?
Rio's general sports stadium is decomposing its emptyness
Where is everybody?
At least not at the Rio Olympic Stadium to watch general sports.
On Friday, Rio began a struggle for the medals of general sports, but the world’s top individuals were able to present their skills to a distracting empty viewer.
The organisers of Rion said on Friday that only 58% of the first-day morning race tickets and 65% of the evening race tickets have been sold.
Another was four years ago in London, where the stadium was bolted of the cheerful people.
Final tickets have already been sold in Rio.
The Olympics of Rio have already attracted attention before general sports.
For example, thousands of empty benches have been seen in the sights of rugby, noise and riding.
When the Brazilian medal drives Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach balloon in legendary Copacabana, only 70 percent of the view was filled.
After the Brazilian twin, Holland played against Russia, and about 30 percent of the 12 000 people were filled.
At least the bad pattern is explained by the fact that Brazil is far away from European and Asian race tourists in economic difficulties, and many of the Olympics are strange to Brazilians who are used to football.
Of course, even the first match of the Brazil football team did not get full of football stadium.
Mario Andrada, the informant of the competitors, said this weekend that 82 per cent of the tickets were sold at that time, which is clearly less than four years ago.
"There's still 1.1 million ends left for sale," said Reuters.
8.5 million of the Olympics in London sold 8.2 million, even though the tickets cost almost half more than in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from about nine euros to more than a thousand euros.
More than half of the tickets pay less than EUR 16.
In the Olympics of London, volunteers and military staff were allowed to sit in empty places, but this is not yet allowed in Rio because the organisers need money and try to get tickets sold until the last moment.
However, in Rio the organisers have given schoolers 240 000 tickets to less well-known species, such as golf and rugby.
Rion's stadium had enough empty places this morning.
Even a beach balloon on Copacaba's sand hasn't been interested in the audience.
Jukka Kesksalo competed in London 2012.
There's enough people on the papers.
A new way of protecting nature - to obtain the right to the land
Helsinki Foundation participates in the conservation of nature by new means.
The Foundation established last year acquires ecologically significant areas of nature.
Thereafter, private, companies and entities can redeem the rights of holders to the land.
The Foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The area has been virtually distributed into blocks that are willing to acquire the right of holders against payment.
The holder shall receive a veto right in its 187 square block, meaning in practice that no approval is required for each holder if the use of the land is intended to be altered.
Fairy rights can also be acquired for more sections.
Acquiring the right to administration is something concrete that can be left as a heritage or a gift.
There is no need to go to carry banderolles or chain themselves somewhere to protect nature," explains Juha Leviakangas, who has acquired control over its company.
The acquirer of the administrative right receives precise location information from his section, which enables, for example, a visit to the block.
On the Foundation’s website, the names of the holders’ rights acquirers are compiled in the same map, where the land section information is available.
The spread fabric is considered to be the risk of its natural protection procurement only to change the original idea of the Foundation.
The Helsinki Foundation has been set up as a foundation of general interest to promote the protection of the environment and of the nature.
The risk is that the Foundation would act in some way unethically or commercially, but it should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation's Fairy project is to protect the natural areas so that they can be intact and in peace.
The Foundation acquires land areas either by buying or donating.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of holder rights, but the Foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the Foundation is to acquire more protected countries.
It also aims beyond Finland's borders and plans to purchase land from Australia.
Helsinki Foundation presents its activities at the pop up forest on 13-19 August at the Helsinki Trade Museum.
Bike thieves tortured the great cities most of Turku - see the situation in your municipality
Bicycle thieves torture Turku for the largest cities in Finland.
This year, more wheels have been stolen relative to the population than in nine other major cities.
On the basis of the wheels reported to the police, Helsinki sanomamat explained the amount of bicycles and parts of them stolen in ten largest cities this year's January-August, calculated per thousand inhabitants.
In addition to the market, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti rose to the top.
According to the police, there were four to five wheelbugs per thousand people.
On the other hand, only about two bicycles per thousand people were notified to the police in Espoo and Kouvola.
It's a big difference.
"In other cities, there is a double number of thieves relative to the population," characterises the police inspector Tommi Ree.
The Turku police wonder why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more wheels have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I have no answer to that.
"The frequency of security can be influenced by the amount of movements in the city on wheels and the amount of wheels on top of it", thinks Sergeant Teemu Ääs.
Tommi Reen of the Police Government considers that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu are looking forward to getting to the top in comparison.
Bicycle thieves are largely based on study and cycling cities.
There is a close center in the market, short distances and a lot of wheels available for thieves.
"In the first place, Espoo is a very different kind of town where city centres are distant and bicycle is not necessarily a priority tool," Reen says.
In January-August, the whole of Finland, the police have been informed of somewhat less bicycle stealing than during the corresponding period of last year.
There's still no reason for great joy.
Despite the decline in recent years, the police will learn about a little more than 20,000 bicycles per year.
It means 50-60 ounces every day and only in Helsinki about 4,000 wheels per year.
"They're big," Reen says.
In fact, the thieves take more wheels, because only some of the victims report theft to the police.
Reen urges people to make a criminal report on bicycle stealing, even though less than every tens of the police report will be clear.
Typical bicycle robbery is the one where the police get information about theft immediately and the thief gets caught in blood.
"The other investigations will also find out when, for example, a drug case in the apartment can find stolen wheels," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bicycle thieves will be caught on a weekly basis or in connection with police investigations, reports older officer Timo Leppämäki.
He said that wheels are stolen, for example, from bicycles, interioryards, stocks and bike cellars, i.e. practically everywhere where they are usually stored.
The most private bike models are stolen in the same way as in the past years.
The U-lock gives the wheel a better protection than many other types of locks.
Some of the thieves take the bike, for example, for short-term own use, but most of the stolen wheels end up selling, for example, via the net.
They stay on the domestic market.
"At least the police have never found out that stolen wheels would go abroad," Reen says.
According to the police, the buyers of stolen wheels are normal Finns.
I'm sure some people buy a stolen bike without knowing.
Some may have doubts about that.
The buyer of the wheel used must be careful because he may be guilty of concealing crime or violation.
"The alarm bells should be ringing if the tiny wheels are sold clearly on their bottom," Reen says.
Special Library Officer Severi Hirvi will carry his colorful Nops for his working day to cover the Kallio library in Helsinki.
He's had five pieces of bikes, but none of them were stolen, the monster says. "It's never been taken, there's been a good monk."
"Even if this isn't so attracting thieves, there may not be any hipster value here," the hellhill monster wonders.
In the Kiosk in Helsinki Kallio, moving Valve locked his bicycle in a small U-lock.
Now the bike stuck the kiosk against the wall, but Valve usually locks his bike in a solid, like a bike.
"It comes to think about it quite a lot, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I own," says the Greek student about his white bike, whose body alone cost about 500 euros.
"All the time, you hear from your friends that wheels have been taken."
"Essentially bad wheels, such junkies."
A bike was stolen from the Valve itself from the inside of the house company a year ago.
But the bike had been unlocked, so Valve was expecting it to be trapped.
Under 15 years of age in charge of their crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with the U.S. peers' teams
In Helsinki, the so-called peer panel is being tried to prevent young people from getting into a criminal round.
At first, the experiment is applied to people under the age of 15 who are now missing criminal responsibility.
The jury is missing the first young person to commit a crime.
The idea is that the peer panel will discuss what happened with the offender and impose sanctions.
A week later, the offender himself can join the peer panel to make up for his actions.
For example, there may be other consequences of a letter written to the family explaining what has become and what has been learned from it.
The youth director, Tommi Laitio, tells us that the model is not strict.
We have other conciliation models that are used in parallel.
"All are guided by a young person in a more responsible direction so that everything is not ruined by the first mistake," says Laitio.
A model has been taken to the comparative panels from the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after the first crime, a young person does not go ahead with the adult panel, but reflects the events with some ages.
The model has been tested once.
Palmu’s service designer Iikka Lovio, following the experiment, tells us that this was an assault that was successfully solved.
In particular, the first crimes of under 15 years of age may not have been dealt with before.
"It has been a message that continues on the path you choose," says Lovio.
Comparative Board is part of the Helsinki project for Immigrants' Young People, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio stresses that new ways of action are offered for all, not just for young immigrants who need it.
More than 70 Republican influencers want the party to stop financing Trump campaign
It is said that more than 70 powerful Republicans have signed a letter asking the party to stop financing the Donald Trump presidential campaign.
From the letter, the American newspaper Politico, who had received a draft of it.
According to the newspaper, the open letter is addressed to Reince Priebus, President of the National Committee of the Republics.
The signatories want the party's money to be channelled to the Congress Halls instead of Trump's campaign.
"We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump, as well as his negligence, incompetence and record indifference, threaten to bring democrats to the elections," says Politicon.
Only the direct direction of all possible funds to Congress Halls can prevent the Republicans from drowning a Trump-decorating anchor in their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, because Trumpi's chances of winning the presidential elections will decrease every day.
Politico writes that the letter is to be sent in the next week.
The signatories include politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the organizational persons of the letter is apparently a Republican Andrew Weinstein against Trump.
According to Politicon, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "the people who want the party to protect their majority in the Congress" and that it is not the support of anyone.
The letter lists a number of Donald Trump's actions, which are believed to be offended by millions of voters.
He was also said to show dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials working on national security reported in an open letter that they did not support Donald Trumpia as President.
Clinto's permission to facilitate the family of children in the United States
In the United States, President-in-Office of Democrats Hillary Clinton reported the details of his economic policy on Thursday night.
I am trying to be President so that the United States economy can go well for everyone.
"Donald Trump seeks to be president so that the economy can go well for him and his friends," said Clinton in his speech.
At the center of Clinton's plan, there is a massive five-year programme of $275 billion to improve the U.S. infrastructure - roads, bridges and airports.
This would be financed in part through rich tax increases, partly through private money.
The construction program is a hand-adjustment for American duunaries who suffer from the transfer of factories to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the programme the largest investment in good-paid jobs after World War II.
We're a builder, we need to get back to building!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to facilitate the position of the family of children working.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders when he stressed that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if the company leaves the United States to become a taxpayer, it has to pay the starting tax, Clinton said.
Today, he is opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he has previously supported.
"I am opposed to all trade agreements against workers or wages," said Clinton.
According to the speculations published by the Washington Post before the Clinton speech, Clinton was planning to criticise the economic programme published by Donald Trump on Monday by the Republic of the Republic that it "is only favouring millionaires like this".
Trump's suggested reduction in corporate taxes has previously been named "Trumpin's porkhole".
On Thursday, Clinton stressed that he was the daughter of a small entrepreneur himself.
He reminded the listeners of small entrepreneurs whose bills Trump has failed to pay, and the clothes Trump himself produces in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America big again, he should start by making products in America itself," Clinton sneaked.
Such are Rio's viewers: Kisat has not glued Finnish to the grids, but mobile application is interesting
Usually, sports races can be seen in television viewer statistics as sharp mountain tips.
To date, the Olympic Olympics in Rio have not reached the sums of viewers.
At the same time, the races have been glued to the top of the screens by 12 per cent of the population: Tuesday night swim followed by 615 000 viewers from the Yle Olympic Channel TV2 at the same time.
For the purpose of comparison, almost 800 000 audiences were given at the end of TV2 by the public athletics a month ago, and the EMs in football were fairly another million.
So far, most of the Olympics have been interested in cycling on Sunday nights and opening the 5th Race Day, both reaching almost half a million viewers at the time of the Olympic Channel.
The top sport leader Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the audience figures, and reminds us that the viewers are first divided into the Rio Olympics in several different instruments.
In addition to television, Finns follow the Olympics from Rio Areena.
We're pleased to see how much of the TV watches are going to pick the Olympics.
TV2 and Yle Fem channels will also be distributed by viewers on the side of the television.
The Olympic Olympics of Rio are the first sports races for which Yle owned a whole channel.
When the shipment comes 24 hours a day, and the audience is from 20,000 to 500 000, it is a good basis.
The number of viewers is lower than in the 2012 London races or in the 2008 Beijing races, but the difference explains the difference in time - a large part of Rio's races will come to Finland during the nighttime.
Another reason for lame interest - if someone now thinks it's dirty - is definitely a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken some surprise medal from the first races, the interest would have bounced up along with it.
In addition, public sports are just beginning, as are other Finnish-interesting species: sailing and riding.
At first, the number of viewers have been close to the expected Pokkisen said.
When general sports begins, the spectators' figures explode.
Yle lanseered a Yle Rio 2016 mobile application for the races, which rose in the first days of the races in the Apple App Store for the most downloaded free application in Finland.
By Monday, the application was downloaded 150 000 times.
I'd bet we'd already go on the way to the charging of 200 000.
"We'll only get the blood's viewers later." Pokkinen says
Rio Areena has not operated in all users as hoped for.
Pokkinen says the feedback has come and the errors have been corrected.
There has been a delay in the use of Rio Areena and other minor technical problems in the early stage.
Applications have received updated versions that should correct errors.
The Olympic Games of Rio are visible on Yle's channels and in the arena wider than any other sports event ever before.
The Yle Fem Canal can be followed by some species, and on the radio Yle Puhe conveys races daily.
The Olympics are not only perhaps working animals for Yle ever, but also the last ones that can only be followed from Yle's channels.
Since 2018, Olympic sports are visible both in the top and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is your Sun, whose depth is 95.3 metres in the Crossbow.
It might be even deeper.
Matti Kannela, a technical suburbs trainer, found some 20 square feet of print on the Cross Sel, the bottom of which was 104 metres in the dive computer.
During the summer 2014, the Finnish Environment Centre attempted to reaffirm the observation by shouting.
The method may not be found in a little deepened 100 metres, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes include Inari Lake (92 metres) and Suvasvesi (90 metres).
More than 80 metres extend to Saimaa, secondary water and Head Lake.
They have not been investigated as closely as Päijänne.
Especially the bottom of Inari Lake has not been carefully karted.
"They could well find unknown depths," Kannnela wonders.
If the deepest lake is defined by medium depth, it is the Great Jukajärvi, 23 meters.
In view of this, your Sun will not enter the ten deepest crowd, and Suvasvesi will be farther from the top.
Correction on August 12, at 14.29: Corrected last piece where the deepest lakes of the middle were wrong.
Individual tax: Retired persons' tax tighter
Retirement tax is still tighter than employees.
The gentleman says that there was an inconsistency under the parliamentary elections and that the tax on pensioners was promised to be equaled to the employees.
This is not the case in the Government's presentation.
We think it should definitely be there.
The promises given should be followed after the elections, he says to the West Media.
At the beginning of this year, employees received reduced earnings, which reduced their taxation.
In the Parliament, the issue heated representatives of the opposition, who shined the electoral promises of Alexander Stubb, the Minister of Finance.
Purchasing power is secured, it does not grow
The policy presented by Mr Petteri Orpo (kok.) on tax reductions, according to the Ihal, is mainly about safeguarding and increasing purchasing power, as next year no wages will be increased.
He says that tax reduction will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other issues do not increase the uncertainty of people.
Ihalainen welcomes Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Orpo’s messages for the desire to respect the Competitiveness Agreement that has been reached with trouble.
He says that adhering to the agreement is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action of the government.
It has been done with the power of labour market organisations, so it should not be questioned.
It will be needed because the economy is so much for domestic demand and people's own faith.
Independence on long-term unemployment
The gentleman urges the government to tackle the long-term unemployment of the budget, at least to stop its growth.
In June, there were about 17,000 more long-term unemployed than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government's goal of increasing employment rates is to be run off to 72%.
He warns that if the challenge of long-term unemployment is ignored, there is a great social decline in the promise.
Ambassador: There are no known Finnish victims in the attacks in Thailand
In Thailand last night and last night, at least four people died in bombing attacks during Finland's time.
The Embassy calls on Finns in the country to be alert and to avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the guidance of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finnish civilians planning for Thailand to cancel their journey because of explosions, but the instructions of the embassy should be followed with caution, Westphale says.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to assess.
The Finnish travel period in Thailand is due for the year-on-year.
The majority of Thai tourists become South Europe and China at this time of the year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from the Finns in Thailand through Facebook after bombing.
The embassy has tried to seek, in particular, the Finnishs in Hua Hin to get information on the situation of the city.
However, several of our contacts in Hua Hin are currently missing from the city.
In general, everything seems to be fine, Westphale says.
No information about the author
Westphalen says there's no evidence of the attack.
The Ambassador believes that events may relate to the political disruption of the shared society in Thailand and to the last week's referendum of the constitution drawn up by the military jun.
The law was adopted in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people were arrested in the country who announced their opposition to the law.
In the southern provinces of Thailand, the ethnic-national conflict with the Muslim population, Westphale says.
Muslims want to increase their right of self-determination.
However, in the past, no attacks have been extended to tourist destinations.
It's a big, local holiday in Bangkok today, Westphale says.
He said that in the city, the queen's birthday and the mother's day will be celebrated.
Traffic in the city is very small.
The attacks affect the day so that the authorities are very specific to safety.
Thai police: There are no attacks on international terrorism
According to the police, the attacks are "local sabotage" and differ from the usual terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism is also closed, reports the Thai police news office according to AP.
In Thailand, at least four people have died during the day after 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as the popular tourists in Phuket and Hua Hin.
Even in the popular tourist destination of Finnish citizens, the holiday island in Phuket exploded four bombs at night, reports the Thai magazine Bangkok Post.
According to the current data, they did not require death sacrifices.
Two bombs exploded in Patong Beach, according to the paper.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga where one person was wounded according to the newspaper.
According to local authorities, the popular tourist destination Hua Hin has exploded four bombs yesterday and today.
At least one of them died in both double bombs.
In addition, in South Thailand, at least one bomb exploded in both towns of Surat Than and Trang.
At least one person died in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar with many tourists, as it is carried by Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao to the holiday islands.
Factor of attacks unknown
According to Prayut Chan-O-Cha, the leader of the military junta in Thailand, the perpetrators of the attacks are not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We shouldn't panic people more, he said to journalists.
According to Mr Prawit Wongsuwan, at least Hua Hin and Trang attacks are connected.
He told Thai BSB that the factors had been intended to destroy land tourism because all attacks had taken place in tourist destinations.
The Embassy of Finland calls on Finns in the country to be alert and avoid the most urgent tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for the Finns going to Thailand to cancel their journey because of explosions, but it is worth observing the instructions for caution, Westphale says.
Injured Europeans
The attacks and victims of Finland during the night are known very little for the moment.
Last night's attack in Hua Hin has a little bit more information.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, among whom at least nine foreign tourists.
There are at least Germans, Italians, Dutchs, and Austrians.
In Hua Hin's last attack, at least three people were wounded.
Two bombs exploded on a clock tower known as sightseeable.
Thai PBS tells us that the police have isolated Hua Hin from where they believe they have found another bomb.
Surat Than's bomb was hidden in a flower seat, according to the county governor.
In the attack, the municipal employee died.
There's at least one wounded.
The chief of police interviewed by CNN tells us that Surat Than's attack also used two bombs exploding around half an hour.
Bangkok Post said the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
The United States Party won the women's four-game
The United States Alexandra Raisman was second at 60.098 and Russia Alija Mustafina the third at 58.665 points.
Biles, 18, are still in Rio's races for a rolling championship with a perman, jump and boom.
The party has managed women's strength in mind for the last few years.
She has eight personal world championships since the last three years.
He has won the four matches and the last and second years three times in succession.
In the United States team, Biles has achieved the World Championship of two team contests.
The Biles's got a lot of softer MM medals and jumps and booms.
Thai Finnish entrepreneur: "Isku has no effect on tourism"
Esa Huovila is not concerned about the impact of Thai bomb attacks on tourism by the Thai Real Estate and the play club for children in the same real estate.
If there are no more attacks, then I don't think this will be any more wonderful, considering Huovila, who worked in Asia for about 20 years as a Finnish entrepreneur.
The experienced entrepreneur has seen close to many of Thailand trials of tragedies.
There's always something here.
First was tsunami, then a bird influenza and last year a bomb attack in Bangkok.
If these former tourists have not been expelled, this is hardly even.
The Huovala company office is located in a few hundred meters from the explosion site.
Huovila heard about the attack from his own employee.
The employee called about nine local times and said not to come to the office.
Huovila says both the beach street and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work in the morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks were set for the Queen's birthday, Huovila says and refers to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
At Patong, the atmosphere was calm and the main street movements were allowed to open at about 10 o’clock local times.
A lot of people on the beach hadn't even heard about attacks.
Half three o'clock in Thailand’s time in Patong, the traffic was normalized and most of the stores had opened their doors.
According to the attack site, the explosion has been pretty small, Huovila says.
Later, the car was seen in the Crownshop in Jouxholmint.
When the police arrived, the car was fired.
The patrol spotted two men suitable for the sensors, hiding in a close six.
The other man was immediately captured.
The other one ran away, but the man was found in the woods later by means of a police dog.
Men are suspected of stealing, stealing and brutal damage to the motor vehicle.
The police thank you for the clues.
Director of Research on Russia's Changes: Clear displacement
On Friday, a high-value change was made in Russia for years when President Vladimir Putin dismissed Sergei Ivanov, Head of Administration.
Ivanov's successor is a 44-year-old Anton Vaino.
He's a former diplomat and he's been the second man of Ivanov.
The Kangaspuro says that the reason for Ivanov’s separation may be Putin’s desire to prevent strong people from collecting too much power around him.
He adds that the recycling of management tasks is one way of power.
This is a way of preventing people from gaining an independent authority from the president.
It is also possible that Ivanov has been struggling with or screwed up with other leaders.
Armor dropping Ivanoville
Ivanov, a member of Putin's interior, moves to specific environmental and transport tasks.
On the tape presented by the public media, Putin called the transformation into a common decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had requested a transfer to other missions and proposed persecution to be replaced, said Russia Today.
The Kangaspuro says that from the Ivanov point of view it is a clear drop in position.
Environmental and transport matters are not very high in Russia's priority order.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of the Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the President's Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in KGB during the Soviet Union.
He was considered as a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became President.
Kangaspuro points out that the old card, such as governors, has recently been replaced in Russia.
The older researcher of Katri Pynnniemi from the Foreign Policy Institute says that more interesting than the heir to Ivanov's place is that Putin is changing his neighborhood to a younger person.
The Isis fighters used civilians as a human shield when they retired in Syria
They used civilians as a human shield when they fled to Jarabulus to avoid targeting them, said Sherfan Darwish, who is a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
The Arab and Kurdish fighters took over about 90 percent of the city of Manbij, which is important to Isas last week.
However, it is estimated that there were dozens of jihadists left in the city.
Corrected earlier news at 7:30 p.m., we were mistakenly telling that civilians were fleeing the city, actually the Isis fighters kidnapped the civilians when they fled the city.
Professor: Publicity line of the Ministry of Interior is illegal
The policy of the Ministry of Interior is illegal, says Professor Tomi Voutilainen of the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutian tells the STT that the publicity of documents cannot be based on the authority's own lines, but it is based on the law.
The Ministry of Interior refused earlier to release the list of participants in the event of the Minister of Interior to Ilta-Sanom.
The Minister justified the decision by the guidance of the Government's Office and the fact that the information was recorded in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Ministerial Communication Director tells the STT that the Ministry has noticed the need to reform practices.
The final Olympics show at Usain Bolt starts in Rio
Like the last few years, Bolt has been running against time under the value races.
He insulted his backwards from the early season and had to skip the Olympics of Jamaica.
This hasn't been a perfect preparation, but I'm much better.
I've been practicing well, and that's the key thing, Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
The press conference included small-shaped samba dancers and fans.
Porina Bolt around it underlines the fact that the Jamaican star has risen in the time when general sports have been fighting with the dopingscandals and the spooky interest.
The previous defeat of Bolt at the Olympic Games came in Athens in 2004, when he retarded at 200 metres in the beginning of time 21.05.
At that time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise that slowed down the injuries and loosened your rehearsal position.
Four years later, in Beijing, his kingdom began with a hundred metres in which he crushed the world record and the final celebration of the competitors’ confidence.
It's harder.
A year later, at the Berlin MM race, Bolt reached his career at the clock.
World records born in Berlin at 9.58 hundred metres and 19.19 two hundreds are still in force.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is seeking a 200 metre world record and a 19-second subcontraction, but no one believes in its birth.
At 100, Bolt's most challenging is Justin Gatlin of the 100th Olympic Winner of Athens 2004.
Last year at the Beijing MM-final, Bolt defeated the American with only one hundred seconds.
Bolt has not lost once in the final of the values races in Beijing during his reign.
In January 2011, the MM-final of 100 left Bolt without running because of a blunt start.
Bolt fills in a lot of weeks after 30.
He's an old man in the young men's species, and Rio's races are his last Olympics.
Bolt has set the next year's MM contests in London as the last goal of the career.
These are the Olympics that fire me from others.
I'm older and this is harder.
But every time I'm underground, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in the Sports Illustrated interview.
Explorations of Rio: Two Athletes suspected of a doping crime
According to Xinhua, the Chinese Swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has provided a positive doping sample in the Olympics of Rio.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyin's doping sample found traces of prohibited substances.
The Bulgarian drinker, Silvia Danekova, was also suspected of a doping crime.
In addition, a Kenya general sports coach was sent home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epo hormone.
He was located in Rio for the fourth time in a woman's 100 yards of butterfly.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estano, the Chinese bather has taken its doping case to refer to CAS at the International Tribunal for Sports.
Xinhua tells me that a sample given by Xiny on Sunday would have been shown in a diuretic hydrochlorothiazide.
There are also other doping doubts in Rio.
BBC news that Bulgarian female drinker Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epo hormone.
Kenia, on the other hand, has sent Rio a general sports coach home because of a doping stick.
On Thursday, the International Olympic Committee KOK reported that the Kenya coach had become an athlete in the test and had given a doping sample for this.
According to the media, it's a Kenya quick-run coach, John Anzrah.
According to Daily Mail, he had used Ferguson Rotich’s racepass for 800 metres in the situation.
There's no stopping the Phelps. Historical gold came into the show style.
The most successful athlete in the Olympic history, the United States Michael Phelps swim in a 200-foot confusion of his 22th Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic Golds.
At the same time, Phelps first swim the Olympic Gold of the same species in the fourth successive races.
The time of Phelps' victory was 1.54.66.
Kosuke Hagino, Japan, was in a confusion, second before China Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have a little fun, and BBC's Olympics Commander Helen Skelton is laughing at the nightmare's quick interview.
The case about Helen Skelton (oik.) on Monday is the most reader of this week on the website of the evening magazine.
I'm next to the commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn't have much stress if there's a small spot in some of his exposing and special outfits in the British press.
You know, TV's a visual media, she's stressing.
Skelton's dressed in high-rate shoes and shorts, with at least enough exposing to the eyes of at least a number of conservative British views.
But there are no rear steps.
It's important that you look good, and small courts are just a funny thing.
I'm sure Skelton wants to shout and maybe he's scaring me, but he's stressing that he doesn't want to be in the main role.
This isn't about me, he says.
We're here to watch sports, and the focus must be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter how much I dress.
Can you imagine that the womb has risen to Finland?
I can't, but everything that focuses on how hard these swimmers do work and how big sacrifices they make is okay for me, Skelton's swinging.
You know what?
It's a foul out of nowhere, if it comes from (brainer) dressing.
I'm a little funny if this one's hit someone's radar.
Rio's police made two arrests for a terrorist suspect.
On Thursday, Rio's police told me that it's arrested two people for suspecting terrorism.
The police made arrests in connection with the security of the races.
In the same connection, the police made five other arrests and interviewed two people before they were released.
All suspects have been Brazilians.
According to the G1 news site, the persons arrested for terrorism are part of the same group, whose members were arrested by the police in July.
They think they have connections to the Isis Extreme Organisation.
The arrested were known to have caused violence in social media.
Messages to be called for violence were distributed, among other things, in the popular WhatsApp service.
The safety of Rio's races is responsible for 85,000 police.
The police blew up a suspicious package in Rio.
Spain and Nigeeri were forced to begin the Rio basketball tournament in their opening block in an empty hall on Thursday.

Argentine's lady was decorated by the Deather-Siren, the Finnish spoke about protest.
Windfall Siren had a colorful competition day in Rio.
Windfall-Siren went through a lot on Thursday.
The Argentine lady hanged the Wind Fake Siren on Thursday in Rio at the opening of the day of women's surf.
The wind was clearly broken.
The opponent admitted a breach.
He got stuck because of the accident, and the others ran away, said Finland's chief coach Joakim Wilenius.
The athlete considered protest for a long time.
Then it was not worth doing it, because it would have been worthless under the rules of the Olympics.
I should've dropped in the water so I could have gotten a credit, Mr. Siren said.
The Finnish man hanged on his desk until the last time he didn't want to get into Rio's dirty water.
The Finnishman, along with the crash, stayed in place of 27th.
In the overall situation, London’s Olympic Olympiahopeamist 2012 is eighth.
The accident had little effect in terms of suffering.
Friday is an important day for the race 10-12.
Modified 0.39: By way of derogation from the first information, detainee-Siren did not protest.
7 special things that science says to extend the age
Science has studied everything possible between earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to bring extra years to a person's life.
Some of these are ways that directly or indirectly affect the health of a person so that his life lasts.
Sometimes things that cannot be influenced by a person itself can bring him more years.
These include a tendency to middle body obesity or social status.
Regular shopping can extend the age.
There's always no need to smash up... just to get a milk can.
The secret of a long age has been sought by many different studies.
Medical Daily presented seven of the most strange research results.
According to science, all these things may bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee drink has been shown to be protected from cancer, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.
The study at Harvard University found that moderate coffee consumption is linked to a "small risk of death", especially with regard to neurologic or heart-based diseases.
Again, on behalf of the alcohol, the investigations that suggest reasonable use of one to three daily doses may increase life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular dental wire use may extend the life of a person for more than six years, one research reports.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents the inflammation of the genitals.
They can, however, contribute to the outbreak of other diseases in another human body.
The study in Norway found out how laughing had an impact on human life.
The seven-year project observed over 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were more nerves than 35 per cent more likely to be alive after the end of the experiment.
Sex, when sexual protection is taken into account, according to many studies, is good for health.
Besides everything, it can also extend the age.
Unfortunately, just having sex as a person is not enough.
To give a person more years of life, he must also receive an orgasm.
Of course, mobility brings extra years, and it is not controversial.
However, long-term attainment does not require absolute solacticity.
In fact, a study at Oxford University found that women with a large buttock had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their body.
The same study combined these factors with lower mortality.
If it was an Olympic athlete or an actor who won Oscar, he is more likely to live longer than the usual adventurous.
A lot of research has been trying to find a reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitionful person is likely to live in a way that brings his life for years.
Some of the researchers suspect that the long-term is the result of a person's social status, which, for example, contributes to the pursuit of confessions such as the Nobel Prize.
The study on the shopping behaviour of over 65 years of age found that a person who shops daily, which is probably less likely to make shopping a parent.
This is due to a reduction in loneliness in concrete shops.
It has been found again to trigger biological mechanisms that may cause death to occur.
So you count your credit card on your hand, the net slot doesn't have the same effect.
The Umpihuman Drinking Drinks fell in the direction of the truck.
On Friday night, there was a serious truck and passenger car stove in Koske in Finland.
The accident occurred at Koskente, Koskente and Sorvastonte in the middle of Friday at 2 p.m.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when the passenger car received had drove on the same strip, hitting the right corner of the truck.
After the crash, the truck fell up, but it burned.
The driver managed to shut down the fire himself.
The passenger car slipped across the roof.
A woman who was born in 1972 who carried a passenger car stayed in his car.
The Rescue Institute removed the injured driver's car and was transported to Turku University Centre Hospital.
The result of a woman's blowing test was 2.02 proms.
He's suspected of a brutal ride.
The mail sent some stamps to the wrong city.
There were deficiencies in the range of Salon K-Citymarket’s bulk candy because the mail had accidentally delivered some of the load to the Seinäjoki.
On Thursday, Teija Halti, who lives in the potato, was buying cartons from the Salon K-Citymarket when a fun sign was hit in the eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product deficiencies in the bulk because the Posti delivered our load to the Wall River!
We'll get more when the Post gets the load delivered!
So if you don't rush in a lawn cut, it was written on the sign.
The sign of the trader is linked to the fact that the Posti expanded its services last spring to the grass cut.
The grass cut is available at the Post until the end of August.
Haltia thought the sign was mostly amusing and decided to share it in social media.
The popularity of the update hit me with a disgust.
Even the media representatives have been calling all the time, and the attention raised in this matter is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday night, the update of Haltia had over 700 divisions on Facebook.
Her own favourites were caught in a sachet, even though a few bars were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, responsible for the business of business transport services of companies, regretted the damage to Ilta-Sanom.
The background is that three of the five stages were distracted yesterday to the wrong place (Seinajoki) and we no longer left to perform a part-time (Salao) by three, but we took only five stages today, and Kaidesoja told the evening to Sanom.
It's the first news of the evening word.
The show Halt was not upset by the sign because he found all his own bulk candy favourites in the selection.

The coomic producer has cured tens of kilos since the birth of his child.
Lotta Backlund has weighted tens of kilos as a result of a change in life.
Lotta distributed a couple of pictures of his change in Instagram on Friday.
In the spring, Lotta was in the gym, and you were aiming at normal weight.
Lotta Backlund in 2014.
Coomikko, TV producer Lotta Backlund started his weight loss work already in 2009.
He's a wholesome change in life and he's lost a little quietly, thirty kilos.
On Friday, Backlund published an excellent performance in Instagram.
The picture shows how much Lota has changed in the years of its appearance.
Before and after Backlund, a couple of photos have gathered a number of thanksgiving comments from the contributors.
You're amazing.
At the same time, we're on our way, the motivation is hard!
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in making it now.
I'm going to get a lot of power and passion from your pictures, while the skies themselves are on the same road, the other one tells me.
In the spring Lotta dropped the last pounds, let's do it now.
At that time, he told the evening magazine that he wanted to finally get to the normal weight, which was 10 pounds.
During three months of gymnastics, five pounds eventually fell.
Wishing of a woman who was murdered in a wise manner: the memories of the victim for police dogs
A week ago, the family of a 42-year-old woman who was murdered in Loviis hopes that the victim would be remembered instead of flowers and recipients by donation for police work.
Sipoon Veterinary Station has published a Facebook update in which it will provide the victim’s family’s wish for donations for police dogs.
The publication states that the victim had worked as a substitute for the Sipoon Veterinary Station and also carried out his nurse’s training there.
The veterinarian's station reminds me of the words that touch the woman.
Happy, smart, sense of humor, and work is fearless.
Good friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number to which donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that donation funds are all going to police dogs, primarily for the purchase of security flags.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old lobby woman was murdered in her own homeyard in Loviisa Koskenkyla.
The woman's neighbors have told her that the victim was very loved by animals.
He owned several animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and flower.
A 27-year-old murdered man didn't know a woman, and he didn't have anything to do with each other.
The murderer was tracked by a police dog Börje, who was injured in a life-threatening state of arrest.
However, Börje survived and is recovering.
The right to governor was sentenced to Post for infringement of the Equality Act
The post had no right to arrest the salary of a refusaled worker for the training of the tenant, assessing the Court of Justice of Kanta-Häme in his judgment.
Post ordered him to pay the majority of his salary and EUR 2 000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have arrested only a part of the salary of the inquiry that corresponded to the share of the study throughout the day.
According to the law of the hierarchy, the employee was placed less favourable on the basis of his trade union activities, contrary to the Act of Equality.
The worker had complied with the Union for Postal and Logistics in the PAU’s organisational decision on the prohibition of inquiry.
During the last year's November postal strike, PAU decided that postal workers are not familiar with temporary workers who have breached the strike.
The people's news told me about it first.
Returning Turkey to the path that respects human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights development, write by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Minister of Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (ps.) in response to the Journalist Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (kesk) and Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (ps) agree on the situation in Turkey's human rights.
In his letter, the Journalists Association asked Sipila and Soin to express their concerns about Turkish freedom of expression and press.
Sipi and Soini repeatedly pointed out to Turkey the importance of freedom of expression and press.
Putin fired the head of his regime to replace the Estonian persecution.
The Russian President, Vladimir Putin, has dismissed Sergei Ivanov, Head of Presidential Administration, says Kremlin.
The Soviet-Viro Communist Director Karl Vaino's grandson Anton Vaino will be replaced.
The persecution is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
The persecution will also be a member of the Russian Security Council, the news office Interfax tells us.
Vladimir Putin fired his regime chief.
According to the Kreml Communication, Ivanov, which is part of Putin's close interior, will move to specific environmental and transport tasks.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had requested a transfer to other missions and proposed persecution to be replaced, Russia Today says.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union for the KGB spying.
Many viewed Ivanov as a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became President.
Ivanov was appointed President in 2011 before Putin's re-election in 2012.
BBC: ManU's giggling for a ban on the game... can't see at the opening of Valioliiga.
The world recorder of football transfers will not be seen on the field when the English Valioliiga is kicked off this weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban was followed by England.
Due to the ban on the game, the Manchester United is on the page of Manufacturing his league against Bournemouth on Sunday, BBC reported on Friday.
According to the British media, the Italian Society Juventus paid EUR 105 million to Pogba.
However, the UK Football Association FA keeps him out of the game because Pogba had a ban on Juvenus as a burden.
He received two warnings in the last season of the Italian cup, and it becomes a single ban.
That ban on the game has been transferred to England. The FA told BBC.
Pogba's next seam is in the second round of the league, 19 August, when ManU meets Southampton.
In Flow, the madness of size is good.
The precise criteria and ambitious visions of entertainment have established the role of Flow Festival as an internationally respected event, which the world's top arts are targeting.
Flow Festival begins on Friday in Helsinki.
Festars have typically expressed themselves by their own dress.
One of the top artists is this year, punk-legenda Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival event area is stylished with artificial grass and art instillations, among other things.
We have never had enough to have only beer and strawberry, says the artistic director of the event, Tuomas Kallio.
The Flow Festival in Helsinki Suvilahde this weekend has grown from a small block festival to tens of thousands of visitors.
In the background of success, there is a simple question: What kind of event would the authors themselves want to go?
It's kind of unusual to think this way.
Often, the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and act in accordance with the provisions of the authorities, says the artistic director of the event, Tuomas Kallio.
He knew a week before the event that Flow was coming to sell this year to the end.
The goal has been to raise the number of visitors over the last year by 5 000 people.
Festars are also seen this year by a number of interesting domestic and foreign artists.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because it has to be financed in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point, the mass would be like a flock of cattle that is guided in the vast routes.
That's what we don't want.
The ideals of the successful event have been evolved over 13 years so that there are 130 performers, art instillations, and numerous restaurant points and drinks.
In addition to the main ferry and the smaller stages, this year the tent of 15 000 people will be the destination.
Kallio admits that the event could be implemented more easily.
Maybe I'm a little mad at size, but at the same time, we've been able to keep Flow's life.
If it disappears, this isn't about us anymore.
The greatest joy and reward for the work done to the Rock is that today there are also great visions that are practically possible.
During the early years of the event in the mid-2000s, the activities were very dependent on the aid of about EUR 20 000 in the City of Helsinki.
Last year, the turnover of the Flow shareholder company amounted to approximately EUR 6 million.
It can lead to "creepy things" like the construction of that 73 metre wide tent.
Flow's visitors have typically expressed themselves by their own dress.
In addition to the music event, we can talk about the community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not been known to be a particularly fashionable profile.
We want to be separated, above all, with the contents.
Yet the fashion phenomena also match the value world of Flow: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the top artists is a penk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
A man has a huge crowd of fans in his own genre, but he's not the most typical performer of indierock, pop music, rape and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was busted, because it is probably the last time we see this job in Finland.
We're all interested in history and future.
Not just what's being played on commercial radio.
Iggy's last record is damn good, and he's been doing some damn good work in the last few years.
The bombs of the Thai tourist paradise were hidden in the flower bags, and tourists fled in their horrors.
In Hua Hin, two bombs blew up local time on Thursday night.
At least one local woman died in the attack and over 20 were injured.
The bombs were probably hidden in a flower bag and blown up by cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of which are foreigners.
They were exploded at the same time as tourists started leaving bars and returned to their hotels, told the police representative Samoer Yoosumra, according to CNN.
Since 1989, Edwin Wiek, the protector of wild animals, lived in Asia, clinged a great picture of the attacks.
If you don't see the TV properly, you can watch it from here.
Hua Hin was at least 11 foreign tourists.
The people ran against me and said that the bomb has exploded at the bars.
It was one of the biggest bar streets, told the Swedish secretary Emelie Olsson Aftonbladet.
The next morning, the local time exploded two bombs in Surat Than.
At least one of them died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon after this, the Finns also favored the Phuket island exploded two bombs.
No one is known to be dead.
At the same time, there was another double bombing in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three wounded.
In addition, one bomb exploded in Trang City.
The police told me that they found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that hadn't been able to explode yet.
According to the Thai authorities, there are probably rebel forces behind the bombings that are not satisfied with the action of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, there may also be criminal organisations.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently been harshly involved in the activities of criminal organisations engaged in trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new standby forces begins to fight first in the wartime.
In the acute war situation, guardians will only be ordered for battle assignments after several months of the conspiracy of the military light, says the Central Finnish.
According to the head of Defence Force Training, Brigadier General Jukka Sonnis, for example, 5,5 months of military attendance are only those who are at the end of their education.
According to the Head of Education, the reserves belonging to the emergency force are first assigned to the service.
No guardian or reserver is ordered for a mission that has not been given the required training, says Sonninen.
Earlier in summer, the Defense Forces began to train armed forces in immediate capacity units from next year.
Units may, if necessary, be used in military activities during military training.
Pamela Tola got the giant allowance from the home house.
Actor Pamela Tola and his ex-husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a hard fight at the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The trade price of a two-step separate house had been EUR 330 000.
However, after trade, there was a serious moisture problem in the house, which caused health-threatening microbial growth.
The couple had to sell the dwelling in a purchasing capacity in 2014.
The sales price had fallen to EUR 132 000, so the financial losses for Tola and Waroma amounted to EUR 198 000.
The couple took the case to court and demanded a discount from the seller.
The salesman refused the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in court and court.
The court delivered a judgment on Wednesday.
It held the judgment of the Court of Justice, which ordered the seller to pay Tola and Waroma for a discount of EUR 150 000.
In addition, the seller will have to reimburse the costs of the couple’s proceedings and investigations totalling EUR 47 344.
The right to a reasonable price reduction slightly, since some of the need to repair the dwelling had already been known by buyers in the course of the sale of the dwellings.
However, according to court law, the missing construction errors were essentially more serious than had been reported.
Tola was looking for a home for a good place.
Tola told me in court that the couple had specifically searched for homes for decent homes because they did not want to take up repairs.
He was born with the idea that the building was fixed and in good condition and that the points mentioned in the fitness check report would not be harmed.
The fitness audit report mentioned the risk and inadequacy of ventilation and the lack of adequate control of rain and melting waters flowing along the rocks.
However, the discussions did not indicate that this would have been a matter of urgency.
Tola and Waroma realized that rainwater from the rock might need to be controlled a little within a few years.
Commerce was made in October 2009.
In a few years, it appeared that the moisture problems of the apartment were much more serious than thought.
In 2012 and 2013, microbial growth was found in the building, according to witnesses, due to both rock rainwater and capillary rainfalls.
On the west side of the house, the air that microbes polluted could also be reached in the internal premises by the inspector’s assessment.
A healthy risky, cross-border bucket or ski was found in wing samples in the housekeeping room, in the basement staircase, in the living room window evaporator and in the basement washroom.
The terraces were built without permission.
The court also challenged whether the housing was extended against the construction permit.
The Court held that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision of the City of Espoo that there had been any anti-authorisation changes in the housing.
Among other things, the terraces were built, even though there were no appropriate permits.
However, home problems were a key issue in the court.
According to court law, the purchasers could assume from the seller, on the basis of the information they received before the trade, that the building was fit to live as such and that there was no need for measurable repairs in the near future.
In the opinion of the Court of Justice, there was no particular reason to carry out more extensive inspections.
Buyers have not neglected their accountability, the court has stated in their judgment.
A creepy archive discovery: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to have children for the Nazis - in the register also Finns
In his recent Dagens Nyheter article, journalist Christopher Andersson writes about the records recorded for microfilms in the National Archives of the United States of America in Maryland, with a total of 218 500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
Most women are Germans, but they also include Americans, French, Dutch and Russian.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian, 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted to be Nazi Morsiame.
Documents and registration cards are from the Nazi-German Race Agency.
The Race Agency was under the authority of the SS Director Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he was studied by the SS doctor.
The same was the case with even greater numbers of women who had to be able to bear up to 10 children.
According to Andersson, women were undergone gynecological studies to investigate the matter.
The Racial Office investigated the backgrounds of women, among other things, by studying church books.
The purpose was to ensure that there were no Jews in the family tree.
Women also had to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and to give the Racial Agency handwritten life stories and good recommendations to those close.
The Racial Office wanted to make sure that women were "children", "suppressed", and "good national socialists", who knew very German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as the bride of SS men.
The case does not tell us what happened to 14 Finnish women found in the archives.
The SS leaders created a programme supported by the State, known as Lebensborn, in 1936.
The programme, among other things, stipulated that each SS man should have four children, either in marriage or outside it.
The homes of Lebensborn take care of the children born outside the marriage and their mothers.
However, the programme was not very actively promoted; the U.S. Holocaust Museum sites are reported.
Instead, the population policy of the Nazis focused on family and marriage.
The State encouraged marriage by offering loans and support for children.
The German mother’s honor cross was awarded to women who had received at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, the marriages between the "Arians" and the "non-Arians" were legally prohibited, the museum’s pages were recorded.
At the sixth of Siren, the Nigger rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko was the third sailing Finnjolls the first departure of the day at the Rio Olympics, but the whole crowd remained the top of the tail in the second day leaving.
In the overall situation, the nigger rose eighth after five departures, but the failure of the second exit dropped him in place of 14.
Windfall-Siren fought positions 17 and three at the departures of the RS:X class day.
In the overall situation, Faithful-Siren is the sixth.
In the 470s Jonas and Niklas Lindgren remained in place of the opening of the day.
In the overall situation, the Lindgrens are in position of 19.
Jari Sillan Head Satulinna was recorded for a couple of hours at night: "I was so in a canvass."
Jari Sillanpää has been part of Finnish favorite arts for more than 20 years.
From a cruise ship to a tango king of 1995, a solo artist best sold by Finland, and as the stars of the dance stages and festivals, the Sillan head continues to porsque, and he is currently in a vicious lift.
The book about the life of the favorite singer, written by Mari Koppisen, Jari Bridgehead, was published today on Thursday.
In the book, Sillanpää tells about her life and career in both good and bad.
As he won the Tang king's crown in the Tango market in 1995, the career of the bridge grew into a total rise.
In the race, Sillanhead sang tangos, but he had already designed a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuopamäki had composed a tango piece on the bridge at the request of a man, which Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different form.
The Satulinna piece became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book says, however, that the recording of the song didn't go exactly according to the plan: the bridge head sang it on a tape in a terrible hangover and only after a few hours of nights.
We had a party tonight.
I was so in the pot!
It's like a bridge head in the book.
You wouldn't think it'd have been singing in a hangover.
Even though I wasn't physically the best I ever had, it was still good.
I learned that all the time, it is not necessary to demand perfect and excellence.
The second incident related to the most popular songs of a man, reported in the book, occurred almost twenty years later.
In 2013, the Sillanpää separated from its partner and the case ended in the end, too, you deserve gold texts that were published in the single year 2014.
The book tells us that the songs ordered from Saara’s Collect were not the same as the Sillan Head wanted.
The bridge head had imagined being making a record that tells the true story of his own life, but the words of the copy of the difference were not true, but it was written on the basis of the news of the magazine for 7 days.
The news of Jar and the ex-loving difference was explained by the excessive celebration and alcohol consumption of Jar, but according to Jar, it was a full bunny and was not true.
The book says Jari was mad at the record company and refused to sing the song, but eventually it ended up singing it, and that's good.
In June, the British also surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
Finally, 52% of the voters were in favour of the difference and 48% would have remained in the Union, even if the opinion measurements of the vote week anticipated the opposite result.
The British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of keeping in the EU.
No appreciated research institute or university flagged the difference, although a couple of individual researchers had to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The thesis "It's the economy, the stupid" in the British Brexit vote, of the former President Bill Clinton of the United States.
The economists were shocked when their voice wasn't heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not appear to be the most important issue of politics.
Economic collar language
Centre for Macroeconomics tivaa in its latest monthly survey from the professionals to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that the economists were not listened, because this time the electorates made a decision on non-economic grounds.
One of the economists' explanations for the loss of economic status is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the idea that the number of jobs is independent of the number of workflowers, so it is almost standard.
If the immigrant gets a job, it's out of the right British.
Many also believe that the depreciation of the currency would be a good thing because it promotes the export industry.
In the view of the Economy, the voters did not believe economic arguments because the consensus of the economists was not sufficiently expressed.
In particular, they were challenged by the equitability of the BBC, which only gave equal space to a few per cent of the economists in favour of the EU's difference as to the overwhelming majority.
The EU-inspired press was not interested in telling what the IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other economic specimens on the consequences of the difference are.
Those distant combinations spoke facelessly about economic growth, trade relations, government debt and currency.
And if the economists were both listened and understood, they were not transmitted because the economists represent an elite with which the voters feel that they have no common interests.
The academics of major cities such as economists would have remained in the EU, but the message in small cities and rural areas did not work.
Immigration is also an economy
The overwhelming profit argument of the Brexit vote was about immigration.
The immigrant will take your job, the immigrant will rush your hospital, the immigrant will use you.
These arguments worked.
Every café has foreign workers.
How much more jobs would the British have if they left?
Every health centre's waiting room sees immigrants.
How much easier would the British get medical times if they weren't there?
There are children of immigrants in every school.
How much easier would the real British kids get a school place if they got rid of them?
Every community lives foreigners.
How much more space would the indigenous people have if they left?
I believe that these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, the economists failed to respond to them, and if they succeeded, their answers did not receive visibility.
Economists failed to explain that, thanks to immigrants, the British have more jobs, less health centre lines and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and, in particular, EU immigrants - are net British public finances and their consumption generate jobs.
The Aberdeen Real Estate Fund was reserved for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was the Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are responsible for Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
He said that Aberdeen was prepared in time for Brexit by drawing up plans A and B.
Plan B, i.e. the profit of the EU-providing camp, started to be more prepared a few weeks before the vote in case of leave.
The concern was that investors would start withdrawing their funds from the market.
Real estate funds do not normally have large liquid assets, but now they might be necessary.
We went to raise cash.
When Brexit took place on 23rd day, we had 25% of the investment in cash or liquid funds in the Fund, the old man says the only open daily notebook of the real estate fund that was covered by the news.
According to the old man, the normal level would be 15-20%.
The value of the fund was 3.5 billion GBP at that time.
The total value of the company's funds is about GBP 20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, the old man says about all the Open Real Estate Funds in Britain.
He estimates that the lowest cash in these funds was 10% or even below it.
Thus, the building funds reserved very different strategies for Brexit.
Financing closed trade
When the camp wins the difference between the EU, Europe went nuts.
However, the few two weeks following the vote on the real estate market were very calm, the Old One says.
Then there were two things that changed the situation.
The first was Mark Carney's speech by the President of the Central Bank of England, which estimates that Brexit could be a major risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, frozen its trade.
These together robbed the situation and brought it to the headlines of Financial Times and BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to the years 2007 and 2008, says the old man.
This made the investors nervous.
The institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
Snowball started spinning, and the fund afterwards had to close its doors.
The situation in Aberdeen was good because of the cash collected, but it also eventually had to freeze its trade for six days.
According to the old man, they did not actually close the trade, but changed the pricing downwards.
In practice, the investors were given time to consider whether the money is now worth pulling out in the panic.
The message from Aberdeen was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it's not worth it, because it would result in losses.
It calmed down the situation, and most of them canceled the report.
After that, it was quite smooth, and now the market has been very calm for a couple of weeks, old man tells me.
He points out that, for example, the Manner European Funds in Aberdeen have not had any similar deplets.
However, a lot of questions came.
Unreasonable attention to real estate funds
The old man believes that the closure of real estate trading was unreasonable.
The most open funds covered by the closures govern around 4% of the British real estate.
The closure of Aberdeen lasted six days and the company sold less than ten properties from 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it might hold its funds on half of 2017.
At present, there is uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been cut down, but the situation does not appear to be "stronger" for Aberdeen.
The main issues are now about the future development of the British economy.
Despite uncertainty, the situation has even brought some new opportunities from real estate investors, the Older points out.
The rate of GBP and dollar is at the lowest in 30 years, and the market has a 15% discount sales compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
The dollar buyer can now buy the same property up to 30 per cent cheaper.
There's a lot of people to buy, old man says.
Brexit brought mines to the London real estate market
It didn't look so good at two o'clock in the morning.
But at 4:00, when Pertti Vanhanen, who was responsible for Aberdeen Asset Management's real estate investment in the British Real Estate Fund, came back to see the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
The word of power was in it.
I realized that this is going to the Plan B side now, the Old Man says in his other home in Helsinki.
He just went to work.
London City was already fully alive despite the morning's sleep.
At the office, the TV screens normally set out to be silent supported the news, and usually the loud people slowed down to listen fully when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera in the morning to tell his divorce.
When the market opened, the screen ends flashed just red.
It was one of those mornings that you would never have thought you'd live, the old man says.
Not because, despite the sale, Aberdee, one of the largest British real estate funds, finalised two real estate trades on the day following the Brexit vote, i.e. in the form of a junction.
The tunnel was confusing.
However, the company had well prepared the option, and therefore the situation was kind of calm, the Old One says.
The Brexit vote started the correction movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, the British leader went to change.
The market started to predict severe falls in the UK and, in particular, the London real estate market.
There were up to 20% of mines in London’s office facilities in the coming years.
Soon, a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trade once and for all.
Even Aberdee did that for six days.
Now the storm is slowed down, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
However, it does not show its last summer holidays on the faces of the Old People who spent in Helsinki this week.
He still thinks it is too early to say much about what comes from Brexit.
So much is still open: how the difference occurs and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
First information has already been received on the development of the London real estate market.
The CBRE data on price developments in the real estate service company cover approximately a third of the market.
According to them, the prices of all London buildings fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City's office buildings, the minus accumulated by 6.1 per cent, the old man listed.
The figures are not so bad, but they are months' changes.
The monthly index was launched in 1987, and only five months have had worse figures, says the old man.
All equal falls hit the 2007 and 2008 crisis years.
It is interesting, therefore, that Brexit was relatively quickly compared with the fall of Lehman and the global economic crisis from the US real estate markets.
The old man thinks that the parable is not quite a match, as this is a domestic crisis in Britain.
The tunnel is another.
The building market has now not seen such a panic sale as that time, but the willingness to sell to improve liquidity, the old man says.
There's a financial guarantee, too.
The repair movement could have been ahead in any case.
In fact, it's not a miracle for him to redeem prices... that could've been before without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen’s estimate, property prices in London and other world-wide cities have been too high for years.
We've been saying for two years that City and especially the offices are overpriced, old man says.
So the fall started really high.
London's prices have risen up for four reasons, the Old One's list.
The British economy has grown strongly, the population of London as well.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last category of ownership that is globalised, old man says.
New players have become marketed in the Middle East and Asia, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investment sites abroad.
London is an easy target as a well-known city.
In addition, prices have been fed by a low level of interest, which, for example, has led pension companies to seek revenue from new destinations.
The loan has been readily available on this point - although, according to the Old People, the debt line has now been used clearly less than during the boom preceding the 2008 crisis.
Disperse. Disperse.
In London, the price increase was settled last summer, the old man tells me.
Even Aberdeen began to reduce its ownership in London, and last year he was a net salesman.
There was some kind of turning that could be expected, and now it came.
What's going on now?
It depends on how the British economy develops, the old man says.
He's not afraid to estimate much for the future, but he says that there's hardly any rise in his promise.
The tunnel suggests that there is a downward or a steady way ahead of us.
The old man has already seen more movements up and down since 1988 in the real estate sector.
And still, he's an optimist who thinks they're gonna get out of the hole with work.
If you're well prepared for risks, you're in a better position.
He believes in global decentralisation.
If you've invested in one market, there's too much of a victim.
If you've been decentralised, the risks are also decentralised, the old man says.
The S Group will start registering more about the purchase information before
Soon the S Group will know what you're eating, because today the Trade Group told me that it would start collecting more accurate information about buying their customers.
Up to now, when information has been collected on the final amount of receipt, the group begins to coat it from the purchased products at the beginning of May.
The S group is coming here after Kesko, because the data of goods purchased with a plus card has been collected in Kesko's customer register for a few years.
According to K-Plus Oy's CEO Ismo Riitalan, the feedback from the programme has been mainly positive.
The product-specific data shall be collected with the agreement of the customer and shall be authorised to be used for marketing.
The most effective channel is e-mail.
Pretty few customers have banned the use of product information, Riitala says to Economic addresses.
He said Kesko is not going to react to the change in the registration of the S group.
Kesko already ranks his client in ten groups, according to the only dining shops.
The classification shall be updated on a monthly basis.
Stock clients are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount used therein.
The data are used for the targeted marketing of the customer.
Product-specific purchasing data are collected only from the K-group's own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, are not giving up their information.
Lidl Finland has no customer programme and is not planned at this time.
Finland's Close Trade has its own One-bonus customer programme, which can be associated with Selection Houses, Siwai and Euromarkets.
We are currently not collecting information on product or product group levels, we are staying at the final amount of receipt.
So we know where the purchases were made and what day, and the final amount of the client's receipt.
We haven't gone to the level like the K-group or the S-group, says commercial leader Anu Ora.
According to him, the stock customer programme is to be reformed in the future, but the Middle Trade will tell us later.
However, Ora does not promise that the product information should be registered.
Initial experiment
Even so, the SOK customer owner and customer register has been relatively wide.
In addition to personal and address information, the basic information included profession, education, the form of residence, and the births of children and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same economy and their role are also registered.
The purchase date and time, place, the total amount of purchases and the method of payment has been recorded.
In addition, information on S-bonus partners has been obtained from their cash systems.
From the beginning of May, the purchase data at the product level will begin to be deposited in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, the S-markets, Prisms, Kodin Terros and ABC chains are currently recorded at product group level.
For a long time, customers have been hoping that marketing could be further targeted, says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of Customer owners and Partners of the SOK.
The S group says they're informing their customers about the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing.
However, the information is stored in the bags anyway, wanted it or not.
You can check your information on the S-group website.
For example, the cashes can't access the information, emphasises the Saarikosk.
Video: Heila-doll is Tulli's latest dog confirmation - the pen becomes the first explosive dog
The black labrador utility kid shovels vigorously five similar boxes in the row at Helsinki Airport.
It won't take long when it sits firmly next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards her dog Heila to play it with her favorite toy.
From the box next to which Heila sat, a bottle of shells that squeezed to the carpet gas.
The gas is the first smell that has been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, the owner of the Heila dog.
Security and access to online trade
Heila is the first dog specialized in the search for weapons and explosives in Tulli and is placed to work at the Helsinki Airport next year.
Working tasks may also take Heila and Suntio to other border crossing points and ports.
However, the airport will be the main job in Heila because the international security situation has changed due to serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels caused measures in Tull and after the attacks have been confirmed, says Mikko Grönberg, the superinspector of Customs.
Another access to training for weapons and explosives is posts through Helsinki Airport.
With an increased internet trade, up to 40 million postal shipments are available annually through the airport, including foreign weapons and explosives.
In recent years, the customs duty has made online trades in purchases, passenger baggage and air cargo in Helsinki Airport about 300 weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives, as well as their source.
Heila will work across Helsinki Airport.
It's gonna look into registered baggage and mail.
In the ports it will have a great benefit in the future when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more accurate research, says Grönberg.
On the basis of Heila's performance, Customs evaluated whether more weapons and explosives will be trained in the future.
Grönberg hopes to respond to the idea.
School in Kirkkonumme
The training of Heila puppy is coordinated by the School of Dogs in Kirkkonumme.
Suntio is also taking training with Heila at the police and defence force experts.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and the Defense Forces with expertise in explosives.
Customs decide together with other authorities what smells Heila is taught to identify.
You will always be trained further if necessary, says Grönberg.
Heila's colleagues at Helsinki Airport have six drug dogs in Tulli and a cash and drug dog Massi.
The Labrador Dr. Heila has been chosen from the ten puppy puppies.
The selection criteria for the dog to be selected at the airport include a raft and a hunting ticket, as well as peace, because the dog is dealing with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntion's home, is a close colleague to the customs inspector, but also a family member.
Without Heila, there's nothing going on at home, Suntio is laughing.
The subtle orders will come to Heila from the batch.
The cameraman of the night-sanomas loses a camera cover for a quick dog, but Heila restores a toy-looking protection immediately from the hand of the "irti" command.
Hard competition for dogs at work
Heila's initial training will be completed next year.
There are still Level Tests ahead, next October, which will assess whether training is sufficient for the required workplace.
Heilan can see in work tasks at Helsinki Airport on the next half of the year, if everything goes according to the plan.
Sadly, passengers cannot come to silence the working vests on the dog, reminding Suntio.
The cost of one working dog is approximately EUR 60000-70000 per year.
Their working age is about seven or eight years, even ten, after which they retire to their owners.
The working days can be long, between eight and ten hours, but the active working shares can only last from 10 minutes to a few hours.
The owner of the dogs is a tough competition in Tull.
Well, Heila owned about 20-30 Customs employees.
Happiness hit the Suntion site that has never had a dog before, but he has years of experience with dogs and surveillance tasks in Tull.
The Mini state received its first Olympic Medal... the people will have a day off.

Drama in Rio - the Finnish artist fainted after the brutal performance
Milko Tokola, the weight donor, succeeded in his last attempt of 175 pounds after a hard fight.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature as a lifter.
During the severe lifts, or immediately after them, he has passed out several times.
No one really knew why.
Tokola was pushed in Rio with 175 pounds and a stunt of 145 pounds.
His overall result was 320 pounds.
Tokola tried to get his job at the last time, 175 pounds, just like the other one.
With the third company, the weights rose as a giant shouting.
The body trembled under weight until the judge accepted the lift.
The joy of the Finnish advocate was the fact that he had suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquired the Estonian Eagle Prosan - Betting Liga - Ilta-Sanoma
The Rovaniemi Palloseura, playing in men's football league, has concluded a lasting agreement with Albert Prosa, the Estonian assassin.
We are looking for the top player in our team with power and the threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi is small.
We went through more than ten players agents across the world.
A small number of people began to be separated as a good option, Prosa, Coach of RoPS, Juha Malinen, reported in the release.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from a winter Flora where he made a total of 51 goals in 109 matches.
He has also played in the Estonian country team.
Prosan is supposed to be with RoPS on Saturday at the Seinäjoki where the Rovaniemeans meet the dominant Finnish master SJK.
RoPS needed a new attacker when the last season's goal king Aleksandr Kokko moved to Australia.
The threaten Modern Family Star meets again: Tennis Star Shorts reveal almost everything
As the modern Family Comedy series nicely known as Alex Dunphyna, Ariel Winter will reappear by presenting his proud body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in minihorses that don't leave much for imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's legs but also the back of this.
18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by making his style and behaviour much more bold.
The star has posed in pictures of the social media that it has published very few clothes and took a number of tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen to wear very weak clothes.
Winter has recently also published several pictures of himself celebrating.
If you don't see the picture, you can look at it from here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter changed his publicity image so radically.
In this case, the founder of PowerwomenTV and CEO Amy Palmer suspected that Winter had a "typical Hollywood transformation" from a child star to an adult.
He's been on TV almost all his life and grew up during the period of Kardashian.
He's learned that the more explosions show, the more publicity and attention in Hollywood, Palmer tells Fox News and adds that the exact same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started in the Modern Family series only 11 years old.
The actor has upset some of his long-term fans with his image change.
It's not hard to know where he is in ten years, when the lower is already so hard, a woman in Winter's Instagram says.
Instead, some of the women's fans defend the actor and asks not to care about criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what the others say.
You're an inspiration for many women, a young woman.
The Japanese prefer the Nordics to Finland - tourists are attracted to the desert: in the autumn, it is possible to see a fairy mirror aurora
The aim of the campaign is to attract the Japanese to commence their trips from the beginning of the fall, Visit Finland will tell you in the brochure.
Inari and Levi are the main destinations of the Japanese Tournament.
Revonfire is the articulated cards of our winter travel, and they are strongly combined with the heart winter and snowy landscapes.
In the winter of Lapland, there is a great demand, but we are now trying to increase the sale of autumn trips.
Hardly people know that the fountain begins from autumn and continues long to spring.
In the autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the revontules from the vision of making two-layered, explains Visit Finland, see marketing manager Anne Lind.
Visit Finland’s main target group is wealthy 25-35 years old, Japanese women living in the city who are dreaming of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland, including online advertising.
According to the survey conducted by researchers from Aalto University, Turku and Tokyo University, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive image of the Japanese in comparison with other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would need clearer unique attractions from Finland, and Lind said that this revonut has enormous potential.
The nights spent by Japanese tourists in Finland have grown clearly more than other Nordic countries.
Last year, they spent more than twice in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interested in Finnish tourism as a target group, as they spent over EUR 80 million in Finland.
The average Japanese spent EUR 183 a day in Finland, says Lind.
The UK will be joined in the rugby-hopea Fid's master class as it leads to gold
The impressive progress of Britain in the rugby tournament collapsed into the final challenge of Fidz in the Thursday night of the final, when the team experienced 43-7 crushing catastrophe at the Deodoro stadium here in Rio.
Fidzi arranged a master class in the process, bites, distances, support game, running lines and silk when he won the gold... their first Olympic Olympic medals.
With the loss, there was a reasonable comfort from the third day of the United Kingdom, and they were proud of their hard work at the Olympic rugby launch tournament in which they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
Earlier on the same day the hard 7-5 wins of the semifinal from South Africa could bother them in the final.
But despite this, Fidi would have won a 15-year-old team in this condition.
Great Britain may be... but probably not... comforted by the fact that at least one British has a gold medal in his neck tomorrow: Fid's principal coach is Ben Ryan, the former British boss of Wimbledon.
Great Britain's trip has been quite a bit.
Eight years ago, as Ryan was trained, they lost every game at the Adelaide tournament.
This is where they lost only one.
This spinal sauna hurts, but it's scary.
Fidi had an excellent start to fight the British fights for fun.
Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, this was like they were running buses moving in the direction, and the world champions led 5-0 after Osea Kolinisau dived at the corner of the goal zone.
When Jerry Tuwai's other touchdown in the right line led to a goal shot.
12-0, and Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's brilliant bucket stopped the man-blooded Leone Nakarawa from making the third goal, but it was just a slow-down for Fid.
In seven minutes, Jasa Veremalu was painted at the right angle, and Britain was 17-0.
Nakarawa made the goal of the new start again, and there was still more than a minute left... the first half of the time.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvou fell through the British found fights and rode to the line to make a goal.
After the paint kick, the situation was 29-0 when we took a break.
It looked like Fidi was born to play rugby, while Britain just learned the game.
And that's actually what it is.
The United Kingdom made a series of changes that blocked Fid's dam... for a total of four minutes, which was well compared to the first half of time, until Josua Tuisova made a goal after the Fid's active feed game.
Dan Norton caught a goal for Britain when he made a touchdown at the left corner and narrowed the situation at 36-7, but the game had long been lost to the islands of the South Sea, whose supporters were singing, swinging tickets and dancing in view.
It was hard not to admire Fid's delightful approach.
Mata Viliame's last-minute goal was a choke in Fid's cake that didn't need a choke.
They were whipped, the Fidians hugged, and the United Kingdom fell on the lawn, completely beaten.
Previously on the same day, Fidi had hit the Japanese semifinal in 20-5, and the United Kingdom won South Africa in a tight semifinal where both made one goal - the British goal shot solved the game.
Kyle Brown took South Africa to lead during the first half of the time, but Dan Norton crossed the goal zone with a gloomy footwork and made a goal under the goal poles in the second half.
A great late bucket from Marcus Watson, the 15th-ass rugby team from Anthony's brother, secured the victory and eventually the silver medal.
The coach's battle against cancer wing Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to the battle victory
In these races there will not be any more unpleasant gold than feeling, and it really means something.
From the first bet to the last, 220 hard extinguishment towards history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a deeper meaning in his golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though they were alone, there were three votes on the boat, the echo of coach Robin Williams was present all the time when the twins would argue in the second consecutive Olympic Gold of Women's Couple Competition, the first women in the history books of British sports, which would be filled with such achievements.
Their control was perfect, and this was their 39th performance invincible, which is also a record.
This, what we see, is two great athletes joining the surface with a groom, not a complete picture of the nature of victory.
There is a group of helpful pairs of hands that gradually contribute to things that matter, and no pair of hands was as essential as a coach that was not known 30 months ago after cancer diagnosis.
As he said, the situation was a mess.
I had urinary bladder cancer, which is one of the things that could be cut, and they performed the surgery.
If they don't cut it, it'll spread everywhere.
The situation could have been pretty bad.
It's changing your thinking a little bit.
Williams received a diagnosis in December 2013.
The third was lucky that his treatment could be started at the beginning of 2014 outside the period, where they caused as little disruption as possible - if this expression could ever be used in situations like this.
I had to get paid, so I had to get better quickly.
It encouraged me.
I was at the hospital and I walked around the department 20, 30, 50 feet at a time when they said that a few steps would be enough.
That's how it started.
Playing in itself is a journey, but it makes it a little bigger.
Directly after the victory, the first couple of thoughts had Williams, who had had been nervous in the morning, and he had spoken a little more commonly trying to deal with his own nervousness.
Stanning, the captain experienced the command of Afghanistan in the group of royal tyres, said, "I've been a tunnel sleeping this week, which may be a little overreacting, but this means so much to me."
It just underlines how important this is to me, how hard I and Helen, and Robin, have been working.
The last three years with Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin, we wouldn't have anything, so he's very grateful, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have imagined a better intern or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost the competition in five years.
The couple set up a rigorous rhythm that their competitors didn't.
At the last 500 metres, when New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in stock.
We were very closed in a moment.
Helen shouted, "Physity in the process, stay in the process."
It's really important to keep control.
We had a good start, and at the same time we did not try to do anything special.
We weren't looking for fireworks today, we were just trying to win a good war and a race, and that's what we did.
A couple of years before you decide your future.
Glover will attend the wedding next month when he marrys a TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Right now, he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't mean to say that this would be my last competition.
It would've put too much pressure.
After London, it took about six months to realize that I was the Olympic winner.
Everything was so new, and I was so stressed.
This is where it lasted about four minutes.
This feels so much better," he said.
Iceland is changing the Panama leak government
In October, Iceland will organise premature parliamentary elections, which have already been requested by demonstrators who were mad by Panama's data leaks in the spring.
The so-called Panama papers revealed that several Islamic politicians have circumvented taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson was divorced because of the scandal, but it was not enough for the demonstrators.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election day has now been decided on 29 October.
According to analysts, it is difficult to predict how much the last-term rage of the nation affects the autumn electoral outcome.
In June the presidential elections, the criticism of the empires was clearly evident, and Gudni Johannesson, who was elected from outside of politics, was elected president.
Trump said he was sarcastic when he claimed to be the founder of Obama Isis
Donald Trump, President of the United States Republicans, revoked his last speech.
He said he was sarcasm in claiming that the sitting President Barack Obama would be the founder of the terrorist organization Isis and the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was involved in the establishment of the organization.
The Democrat Party was mad at the speeches and called for an apology from Trump.
You should never let anyone who can fall down like that, Clinton's tweet.
In southern France, the Mayor of Cannes has prohibited the use of Muslims' popular covert burkini swimming pools, reports British newspaper Guardian.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that it is forbidden to go to the beaches and to go to swimming for all who do not have a good way and have a bathing suit that respects the scularism.
The decision also states that bathing suits, which express greatly religious links, can increase the risk of order failures in France, which have been subject to terrorist attacks.
In the middle of July, 85 people died and hundreds of people were injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove into a crowd celebrating the French national day.
At the end of July, two extremists who joined fathers attacked the church in Northern France and killed a priest over 80 years of age.
The quality of bathing waters in the Oulu region passed through the sebula - in the parking lake, blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue
Water samples taken from official bathing areas in the Oulu region meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Blue-blue sequelae has been observed only on the bathing coast of Pyle Lake.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the environmental action in the Oulu region took water samples from nine EU coasts in the Oulu region and 30 other general bathing areas.
Apart from the coast of Merinieme, the concentrations of E.coli and intestinal enterococcal bacteria in all bathing areas were below the operational limits laid down in the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The concentrations of E.coli and enterococcine in seanieme bathing water were confirmed on Wednesday, when bacterial concentrations were lower than the operating limits.
The blue sand on the beach of the lake does not yet make water unswitable, but in favourable circumstances, the situation may rapidly change to the blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue.
The environmental action will follow the situation through more frequent inspections.

MTK Hakkarainen on forest donation reduction: More than 80% of forest owners outside
The reduction in forest gifts is one tax change in the next year's draft budget of the Ministry of Finance.
Income tax laws are proposed a tax reduction which would be granted on the basis of a gift tax on the exchange of forest generations.
In the presentation of the Ministry of Finance, the reduction in forest gifts has four objectives: to promote the generation of forestry farms, to youngen the age structure of forest owners, to increase forest size and to increase the supply of wood.
The Ministry aims to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
Forest owners would reduce the pure return on capital for forestry.
Overall, the idea of making such a tool that promotes the generation of forestry farms is good, commenting on the forest management director Juha Hakkarainen of the Central Association of Agriculture and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, he finds a critical tax change.
Forest gift reductions are presented to the task of the clean capital gains of the forest owner.
It is a capital income that has been deducted from all other deductions.
The MTK and Hakkarainen consider that the tax reduction would be more effective if the reduction could be made directly from the sales result of the wood.
The draft of the VM is based on reducing the pure capital income of the forestry economy by preventing the loss of capital in the forestry economy, which should be reduced in other taxation.
Such a person would benefit from tax benefits even if it did not sell the tree.
The calculation model is too complicated.
The average forest owner can't figure it out, Hakkarainen says.
In addition, he says that only a small part of the forest owners is involved.
The tax reduction limit linked to the return value of forests is EUR 40 000 in the presentation.
It's pulled too high for Hakkaraise.
In that way, he says that it will cut 82 per cent of the Finnish forest owners out of the deduction circle.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of the forest owners, he says.
The VM considers that the limit guarantees the objective of farming.
Forest policy has led to a reduction in forest gifts by Hakkarainen for decades.
It is behind the ageing of the forest owner.
According to the MTK, the average age of forest owners is now over 60 years and around half of forest owners are pensioners.
The powerful brute surprised the car drivers in Himanga... two cars fell down and ran into each other.
There was a special retreat in Himanga on the Fish River on Friday morning.
According to the Rescue Department, two consecutive-timed cars were squeezed into their divide, after which the fire came to run after the driver.
According to the head-friend's firemaker, Harri is suspected to have been caused by a strong rage.
In the back of the car there were two persons transported to the hospital.
There's no more detail about their injuries.
The driver who drove before didn't get hurt.
The accident occurred on the highway of 8 Himanga, a few kilometers toward the Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results from researchers at the University of Turku can help to develop cancer treatments more efficiently.
The findings made by Professor Johanna Ivaska’s study group show that cancer’s hardness increases cancer’s malignancy.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and the tissue cells grow normally in such a environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth was prevented in laboratory conditions by returning the cancer surrounding tissue to normal soft tissue.
In the future, the efficacy of cancer medicinal products may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cells in addition to cancer cells and the surrounding tissue.
The results of the studies have been published on 4 August in the appreciated Nature Communications magazine in the field of cellbiology.
The stack of a family home death continues in court, the prosecutor demands a murder sentence to another perpetrator.
Both convicted persons continue to cloak their family home death in court.
Two young men were sentenced to imprisonment in June for family home death in Muhko.
One received eight years for 4 months, including the murder and gross robbery of a young person.
The second sentence is 12 years of imprisonment for murder and gross robbery as a young person.
The convicted person was also sentenced to the brutal risk of road safety as a young person and to the transport of the vehicle as a young person without rights.
The prosecutor, the prosecutor, the lawyers and the man who had received a more severe sentence were complained about the judgment of the court.
The prosecutor demands a less punished man to be convicted of the murder of a young person for 12 years of imprisonment.
They were in full understanding at the time of the act
According to the law of the visitor, 17-year-old young people killed a school home as the head of the childcare unit, working for a man in July last year.
The 17-year-old indicted the murderer attacked the director in the living room's couch.
The director had been able to get rid of the line, and he was holding a young man to his room, and one of the young people hit him with a steam pipe.
The director was also strangled, beaten and kicked in the head, among other things.
According to the mental study, both convicted were fully understood at the time of the act.
According to the law, young people had planned to escape from family home at least from the previous day.
Icehai is the longest spine in the world, grows only at the age of 156
The longest living backbone in the world has been confirmed by the ice shark, reports the research published in Science magazine.
In the north of the Atlantic, such as the ice shark swim around Greenland, i.e. the holker can live for up to 400 years.
The female is only growing at the age of 156.
I'll give you more ice-cream life that it only grows in a centimetre a year.
Only one species of chimps are known to live longer than ice sharks.
The researchers found out the age by radio-carbon drive.
Due to nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
Based on these, researchers were able to assess the age of sharks.
For the oldest age, 392 years were estimated, although throwing in a direction or another could be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump's Economic Wisdom - The People's News
Donald Trump America doesn't need to change the world.
Even a third of all tax revenues from the State would be unacceptable if Donald Trump made a change in corporate tax.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, in particular with the most wealthy tax incentives.
Trump described it as a revolutionary presentation of its tax programme on Monday in Detroit.
The company tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
There would be a huge amount not to collect, $1,000 billion a year.
The excess income tax rate is now 39,6, after the reduction made by Trump 33.
They'd give up a whole tax on heritage.
Trump accused the state of excessive regulation of business and of bankruptcy of small businesses.
The environmental standards decided by emergency workers must be reintroduced and the energy regulation will be dismantled.
Barack Obama's health reform needs to be reprocessed.
The administration must be appointed "executives instead of bureaucrats".
According to Trump, the "destructive" trade policy is the major causes of the United States' problems.
The free trade agreements would be canceled.
For imports from the PRC, 45 % and 35 % would be imposed on Mexico.
We offer you a new future.
Americanity, not globality, is our credibility, Trump declared.
Donald Trumpin America does not change the world needs:
American cars are coming to drive on the streets, American planes joining cities, American ships overseeing the sea, American steel to raise new clouds all over the country.
By way of contrast, Trump read faithfully the speech written by assistants, even though well organized protests interrupted it 14 times.
The economists, including those near the Republicans, see Trump's program to bring the United States to a deep economic downturn.
Hillary Clinton published his own program early on Friday in Finnish time.
Attack from the past, the People's News
The sea is fateful, but the actual wave of assault strikes in the middle of Madrid's street hallway, the record with the past can begin.
It tightened the core of Pedro Almodóvar's news story.
The previous guidance work of Almodovar Matkalovers (2013) was a little fun and ronskin-side satiir comedy, the skin before it, where I live (2011) the tops of the Spanish career.
Julieta (2016) is located in the middle of some of those two works.
It's an in-depth love, human relationship and family drama in the middle of a relationship between a mother and a daughter.
It's a simple story, and we'll see a lot of them as a long backbone.
Life seems to be in a model for the middle-aged nominal person (Emma Suarez), but then all threatens to collapse.
A new male friend (Dario Grandinetti) in the aftermath of the incident must be wondered until the final meters of the film.
In the form of a guarantee and a long letter, Julieta repeated stages of her life to her grown-up daughter.
He begins from time before the daughter was born, from the moments when he met this future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, the time between Ommelte, Adraina Ugarte, who plays Julieta as a young teacher in the second female main part (2013-2014).
Juliet's age has been dealt with in a way that can be regarded as a stone, but I would say that it's kind of complimentary and literally a distraction.
For the Almodóvar movies, there is always a fair distance in Julieta.
It is a flatly played, controlled, place in place with good music, and quite sadly a movie that has the elements of the gesture.
On the other hand, the Spanish director has a typical visual colourfulness in store and is starting to put a little quietly in the eye more pure form than a working dramatic tool.
Diseases, deaths or other sudden loss of the film, but the surface remains the same as Korean.
This applies in particular to the costume: in the case of a nominal person, the dwellings change from a scene to another, and the same applies to visible ears.
Mr Almodóvar is precise in these matters, but the main issue is that there is no greater improvement in this.
When mechanically repeated, the impression is external and a little spiritless.
Almodóvar has written a manuscript on the basis of three novels of the Canadian Alice Munro prized in Nobel 2013.
The novels have been published in the book Fruit: Reports.
Almodóvar has contributed to the dialogue, resulting in a bit of written literature filming.
The material would have been emotionally versatile to a drama, so much big things - especially the crab guilt - deals with the thematics of the movie.
Guidance and manuscript: Pedro Almodóvar.
It's based on Alice Munro's three novels.
Mainly: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
It's the first night of the movie. It's 12.8.
The government's trying to vote on the people's news.
No new cuts are being made, ministers shouting so that the Finns do not fall completely.
In the spring, however, cuts are made by junk stores.
There will be no new surgery.
The four billion savings already decided are sufficient.
In this way, Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (Cok) are convincing under budgetary misconduct.
It is true in the light of the fact that there are no new cuts in the VM's proposal, since social security cuts were already decided in the spring framework line.
Children's allowances, national pensions, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension index will be cut by 0.85 per cent.
The duration of unemployment security for women undergoing a shorter period will be reduced from 500 to 400.
Educational surgery continues.
The Municipalities Haunt
Why are ministers so grievingly stressing that no new cuts are being made on them?
Because next year is the election year.
The municipalities will be held in April, and they will be the most important heating meter in the parliamentary term, not the gallups.
It has been seen before that the result of municipality taking the different directions of the Government's parties has been ruining the government's mood for a long time.
The Gallups, however, tells us that the basic Finns of the Government are expected to be lost, although the result of the previous elections was modest in 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the Basic Finns received 752 new mandates, most of which will be realised in the first spring of the right-wing government.
The government’s life wire of about as great as the three parties is in charge of maintaining the foundation of the Finnish people.
Now it has not endured, but more than half of the parties voted in the first year have had enough government policy.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group have also come to the surface.
First of all, new cuts will not come with rhetoric, the fact that next year they will be done dramatically and secondly, they will try to soften the expecting attack on the Finnishs.
Big surgery in 2018?
After a year, everything will probably be different... if the Sipillan government is still standing.
The government has set a target for the loss of debt during this parliamentary term, but the Petteri Orpo budget proposal will take EUR 5.9 billion next year, which is more than this year.
After the municipalities, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hands up in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is unable to comply with its own programme: debts are not folded or even slowed down.
The other one's holding on to the program.
This means new, even more severe cuts on the former people in the 2017 budget gap.
The budget would be at least close to the balance in 2018 and then in the spring of the parliamentary elections will be taken against what will happen.
These activities do not match debt
It is absolutely clear that the current activities do not seem to be in debt, even though Juha Sipilä how to try to liet the positive atmosphere.
The curves presented by Martti Hetemäe's Secretary-General in the awareness-raising committee will prove it unconsciously:
World growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be overoptimistic, i.e. not a petty aid from the international economy.
Finland's economy has not just risen since the collapse in 2008, except during the recovery policy at the beginning of the 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35 per cent in this decade and has been prolonged from 34 to 54 weeks on average.
Unemployment now costs three billion euros a year more than in 2008.
In the course of the current curves, government debt, which exceeded the 60% threshold in 2014, will rise to 70% in the middle of the next decade.
What's responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the debt eligibility of the Left Association was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment costs about EUR 6 billion, which is virtually fully covered by new debts.
This is the concept of a central, meeting and basic Finns about what is responsible.
Question: The municipality wants to leave a lot of tasks
Three of the four consider that the organisation of day care for children, youth work and exercises is the responsibility of the municipality, as shown in the study of the KAS - Municipal Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the people will also take responsibility for a single municipality for libraries, culture, civil studies, construction supervision, high school education and waste care.
The province's responsibilities are more clearly called for rural development, specialised medical care, vocational training, higher education institutions and the institutional care of developing disabilities.
None of the responsibilities of the municipalities in order to be transferred to the State.
A sub-aged driver ran after a ride to the police to run away.
Joensuu's 16-year-old motorcycler drove a police patrol in Joensuu in Ilomantsinti on Friday night at half one time.
The police patrol tried to stop a motorcycle without lights, but the young man left to drive the police away with a fair speed.
The rear drive continued on the Sonkaja coast, from which still to the Sorronahonti and the smaller forest road, where the motorcycle drove out of the way.
After this, the young man left running away, but the faster-footed policeman ran into a fugitive.
The blowing test for the driver showed 0.75 proms.
Nor did he have a driver's license that would justify driving a motorcycle.
The case will be investigated, among other things, as a serious risk to road safety.
The truck in the rock cart fell down.
The truck in the rock car fell on the knee lake on the Kavintee on Thursday night at 21.15 p.m.
The truck had drove out of the way in the left curve and fallen on its side of the river.

The ingredients of a major accident in the air, look at the photo gallery of Parafest's destruction.
The fall flow of the parafest festival tents caused massive damage.
The President of the Joensuu Paraphestys Arto Pippuri estimates that the festival is economically able to reach its feet, and the event can also be organized next year.
The last performer of the Parafest was Kalle Salonen at the end of Friday night on the market.
On Saturday, the program will continue at the premises of the city theatre at 13:00 a.m.
The art center in the Monkey is a Parafest exhibition from 13 to 15.
The programme will be organised as planned.
The flow rate is generated in the thunder cloud when the rainwater and its weight starts the lowering air flow.
The changes in the water state of the umbrella bind the heat and therefore the lower air mass cools and accelerates towards the ground.
It is reported from the Air Science Institute that fall flows occur in Finland over a number of summers.
It's hard to predict the route of the crash flows.
The eruption flow hit the Parafest event in the backyard of Joensuu Art Museum on Friday afternoon before five.
Three tents fell to reverse, and there were about 200 people in the tents.
In the event of an accident, four persons were mildly offended.
There was one child in the group who was transported mildly injured to further treatment.
Air Pollution Agens London
According to the study, lontoans' skin ages faster than usual.
The reason for ageing skin is air pollution.
The British investigation is about the Evening Standard.
The British skin care company Caci analysed London without the most toxic small particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many pension-aged lontoians is two and a half years older than an age friend living in the countryside.
Small particles that age the skin are very good dust pollution, which comes from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which according to Evening Standard, almost 9,500 Londons die every year.
The studies have shown that particles are small enough to pass the outer layer of the skin.
The study of Cac found that early ageing is a risk, especially for lontoans walking in close proximity to congested streets.
People in London may try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example, with different masks, but a more practical solution is recommended for regular skin cleaning.
The brakes of the tractor failed to push the man standing in front of him.
The man had moved stones on a tractor in his yard.
After he got out of the tractor and went to visit it, the brakes of the tractor were deceived and the tractor was floating on the man.
The man was not under it, but the tractor was able to push the man to the extent that he was transported to the central hospital for further investigations seriously injured.
The tractor couldn't go any further, because it ran into the rocks in front of us.
The Rivalry of the Newest Period
A river-suu League-Riento playing at the balloon Championship will go to a series that starts in October from a better starting point than men's memory.
The team's been packed for three weeks.
The common sound is found better than in the previous periods, when the beginnings of the series have been dark for Rienno.
As the head coach of Rienno, Jani Säisä continues to praise the new team to try and unite.
From the foreign triangle, the middle fighters of Fred Musoni start in Rieno for another period.
The new faces are the 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson in Ruanda's country team is a 20-inch hacker.
Garchet is accordingly a passer, a Brazilian has a measure of 198 cents.
Josban, Kataja and River Boys, to the US country team
Anne Jumppanen has played in almost all the MMs of the salibandy since 2003.
Now the sixth races in Tampere are on their way, only 2013 after Canada was better in North America's cartoons.
I was working in Turku and playing with women in the country when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. was setting up a Salibandy country team.
I was interested, and here we are, Jumppanen, 48, says.
Jumppanen was born in 1967, near New York in Elizabeth City.
The family moved to Helsinki when she was one year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen was able to study data processing at the University of Joensuu.
When I came to Joensuu, the species weren't played at SM level like salibandy.
It's a fake play at the university.
I was playing basketball in Kataja and later playing hockey in the riverboys in the SM series, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played a salibandy SM series with the university from 1991 to 1992, the following three went through Josba.
In addition to playing, he trained the company's A-girls to the championship.
The women's SM serial career went up on silver in 1995.
Overall, Jumppanen played in the women's SM series through 10, accumulated 169 in the 51+34=85.
The last SM season is 2001-2002.

Beach volley artist Essi Hasu's circle closes to Kouvola - SM gold missing from the prize cabinet
Essi Hasu is ending as a beach volley player, at least after a period of temporary duration.
Beach volley Finnish championships will be settled on the weekend in Kouvolan Sports Park.
In three days, medals are played both in adults and young people.
In cooperation with Kouvolan Airballers and the SM-final tournament organised by the Finnish Airball Association, the six best pairs of the rankings of each series are validated.
The local color in the tournament represents Elimäen NMKY's grown by Essi Hasu, who has been part of the Finnish beach volley peas for several years.
Hasu now residing in Helsinki is looking forward to games in front of the well-known audience.
I hope as many as you can get to the courthouse this weekend.
I'm sure there's going to be a great arena for Pesisstadion.
I haven't played in the adult series very often in Kouvola, so it's great to play in the finals in the home corners, Hasu feels.
The region of Kouvola set the Hasu spark on sport and gave good food for a fine hobby.
There are very memories in mind about childhood.
When I was nine, I started the balloon at Elimäe's NMKY's E-girls.
The top of the mind is too big a sweater, knee shields rotating in the ankles and super ace lips and choreographs after the point, Hasu remembers.
In a small place, a sports club was a strong community where everyone knew each other.
The group's common spirit created an environment where it was nice to play.
All the families were strongly involved, the father of the team club trained us, and our mother was the chairman of the company for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volley was already in junior time a natural choice of species to counterweight the inner air balloon.
There's been songs on the beach of the curve lamp since the 1990s.
During the visits, the activity has always been active.
I also went to the junior SM tours, thinking that someday I'd be there to play.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays this weekend together with a SM-finals with a twisted Anniina Parkkis.
Riikka Lehtosen and Taru Lahde after the tournament the second punished double is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
SM-Dear, we're still missing the prize cabinet, Hasu throws mysterious.
The weekend in Kouvola may be the last of Hasulle's audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges await civil work.
Yes, the international career is over after the Kisakallio tournament.
Otherwise, the toes are placed on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu is planning.

Solomon Koli went boldly to become a farmer
Agriculture as an entrepreneurship means risk-bearing, sweating and energy efficiency.
A young farmer, Solomon Koli, 25, became a farmer, because he believes in a positive future in the countryside.
About two years ago, Koli, along with her little brother, started acting as a continuation of their homeland.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and counsels the brothers with their own experience.
Initiation as a rural entrepreneur meant debt and increase in order to bring bread into hand from agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I've always been happy at the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur, I've put everything in the game.
If something starts, I think it needs to be done seriously and properly.
In 2013, we went to build a stove, and at first the bank had not been enthusiastic.
However, I myself really boldly joined the project, and I have been fully involved in it, Solomon Koli says and adds that he would not have taken action if he had no faith in the production of pure Finnish food and that everything would still be good.
Salomo Kol’s goal is to invest even more in the bigger slab.
The work has resulted, since Solomon Koli has been chosen for the ten best among the future of the Landscape in the young food producer's competition.
At the moment, he's competing for a potential victory.
He will be able to vote on the website of the magazine until 21.8.
Bulgaria declares inflation for the first eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest number of years (after June 2012) and the first figure above zero after October of the last year, when positive 0,2 % was reported.
The average annual inflation measured by the Life Cost Index was -0.8 per cent in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) when compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
The Life Cost Index in July 2016 was 101.0 % compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 %.
From the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) the inflation rate was -0.2% and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, the price of the following consumer goods was increased in July 2016: food and alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), leisure time and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), mixed goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household goods and routine care (0.5%), health (0.1%).
The prices remained at the same level as the previous month for alcohol drinks and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and training.
Snapchat's "anime" effect is judged as an Asian caricature
According to Snapchat, anime has acted as a source of inspiration for the filter, but some observers say it is racist.
With its lens tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to edit reality and play with identity in ways that are almost ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into a pine, a dog or a character that fits Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
The lenses are simple, face twisting tools that produce over 30 million improved self-wires a day.
All the misunderstandings will quickly end up in public documents.
Snapchat lenses have previously been criticised by the accusation that the application advertises blackface or black face masks or prefers whitened skin color as a beauty.
So when Snapchat announced this week to some users a lens that gave them creepy eyes, creepy teeth and cheeky cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people - the yellow face.
And they wonder if these repeated poles could be a sign of the greater problem of the company with regard to diversity.
News and misconduct spread on Wednesday with the reports of The Verge and Motherboard, a day later, Snapchat said that he had ceased characteristic.
The company offered an explanation: The lens was meant to be honored to anime characters, not to be a caricature of Asians.
But for racist observers, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes in operation.
Others said no anime comparison was absurd.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American artist whose tweet photographs were widely distributed, said in his e-mail that the lens was "at least offensive and uncomfortable".
He added that "it's difficult to argue against a comparison with the most brutal Asian caricature and filter efficiency."
It shows that the filter is not just a yellow face, but a yellow face taken to extreme degradation.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural traps.
American culture seems to be stuck in the endless struggle of diversity and inclusion, corporate meetings rooms to Hollywood and equipment that we are all carrying.
And Snapchat’s enormous, racially more diverse audience of young people can mean that they are even more likely to expect a comprehensive attitude.
25-year-old Katie Zhu said at the interview on Thursday that when one of the Snapchat lenses creates an insulting image of the user, "they are much more difficult to be ignorant than before."
On Thursday, Zhu, product manager and engineer for Medium, decided to remove his Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In his writing to Medium and his phone interview, he said he believed that the disputes related to race reflect the lack of diversity in Snapchat’s hiring practices.
Zhu criticized the company’s main white male leadership and decided its writing with hashtagi #DeleteSnapchat (#PoistaSnapchat)
"Whether they do not have a variety of representations of different skin colors in their staff, so they can make such decisions," said Chinese American Zhu, "or they have representatives of different skin colors at work, but they are not in positions where they feel safe or could speak directly."
Other observers share their opinions, a complaint which Snapchat has largely failed to reply.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its staff, noting its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the rotation of his staff, but according to the representative, the company hired the recruiter some time ago to focus on the under-represented populations and to move forward internal inclusion efforts.
For its part, Zhu said to keep his Snapchat account closed, adding: "Is it that they actually need more users like us to say that this is not okay?"
According to the Congress Panel, military officials distorted Isis intelligence.
In the report published on Thursday, the Congress Panel said that the US Armed Forces Headquarters has modified intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war in Iraq and Syria against Isis than was justified by the events on the ground.
In the report of the Working Group established by the Republican President of the Defence Committee of the Defence Committee, the Committee of Inquiry and the Defence Assistance Sub-Committee, the report of the Working Group of the Defence Forces found "extending dissatisfaction" among the survey analysts at the headquarters, which said that the supervisors were thrust in their assessment of the efforts of the Americans to defeat Isis.
The headquarters, known as Centcom, is the command of the Armed Forces Armed Forces Department in Florida Tampa, which supervises the United States Armed Forces operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The results of intelligence accepted by the higher-value Centcom leaders typically gave a more positive picture of the anti-terrorism efforts in the United States than the facts on the ground justified. They were more regularly positive than the analyses produced by other factors in the intelligence community," the report's press release said.
"Centcom's events are unacceptable in the war of our fighters who suffer when bad analyses are presented to high-value decision-makers," said representative Ken Calvert, the Republican of California.
The failures of Centcom's leadership will rise to the top of the organization.
The ten-page report describes in detail the ongoing problems in the descriptions and analyses of the headquarters of the United States’ efforts to train Iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015.
Although it does not provide clear evidence that the high-value administrations of the Obama regime had ordered the reports to be thumbened, it describes the fact that the analysts knew that Centcom's leaders would have put pressure on them in the positive light of the threat caused by the Islamic State.
"All the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and certificates of the headquarters were considerably more positive than events themselves," said the report.
For example, the Centcom authorities publicly stated that the major attack on Mosul's return could begin even as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still in the possession of Isis.
After months of investigation, this is very clear," said in the opinion, representative Mike Pompeo, the Republican of Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest intelligence leaders of the U.S. Armed Forces Headquarters manipulate the intelligence outputs of the headquarters in order to minimise the threat of Isis in Iraq.
The Republicans created a working group after hearing that analysts had raised concerns about the manipulation of intelligence in the Islamic state.
The report published on Thursday will be accompanied by more extensive results during the investigation.
The Ministry of Defence has initiated an extra, ongoing investigation of Centcom's intelligence.
On Thursday, the democratic members of the Democratic Committee of the Representative Room published their own findings, which were consistent with some of the final conclusions of the Republican Working Group.
"In the period 2014-2015, Centcom created an unseparated process for the intelligence assessment of Isis and Iraq's security forces," said Adam B. Schiff, the chairman of the Committee's Democrat.
Schiff said that this process "prolonged the publication of intelligence outputs", deteriorated the mood among analysts and "not given enough space for different perspectives".
Schiff and the Democrats said that they did not find evidence that the White House would have tried to pressure the analysts of Centcom to reconcile their conclusions on "pre-set or political statement".
The Daily Beast reported the preliminary results of the Congress investigation on Tuesday.
Last August, The New York Times reported that Pentagon's superinspector has started an investigation after Centcom's analyst complaints.
In his opinion, Commander Patrick Evans, a representative of Pentagon, said that the Ministry of Defence will not comment on the report of the Congress as long as the investigation of the superinspector is underway.
But he said that "the experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcomes a healthy dialogue on these essential issues of national security".
The investigation has other consequences than just the question of whether the bombing operations led by the United States are successful in Iraq and Syria (such as a growing number of defence authorities now claim).
Last year's charges questioned how much President Obama can rely on the headquarters to carry out an honest assessment of the military activities of Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis targets.
The criticism of Islamic State Inquiry reflects over a decade of guarantees when Centcom's intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research article that said that despite the objections of several analysts, President George W. Bush's administration supported a small army in Iraq and spent very little time considering the consequences of the 2003 attack.
Hooker was also a key role in rebelling about Islamic State intelligence.
According to the authorities last year, the Hoker Group concluded that despite the opposite public statements, air attacks against the refineries controlled by the Islamic State had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's economy because it had built temporary refiners to sell oil through the black market.
In September, however, the Times reported that this finding was not reported outside the headquarters.
The Centcom commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised last year after many legislators considered his testimony to the Senate as an overpositive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April, and he was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States wins the fourth consecutive victory in women's countryhockey, arrangeing an interim discussion with Britain
The day after having made three goals in the team winning Japan 6-1, Katie Bam made on Thursday the United States women's countryhockey team two first goal in the Americans winning India 3-0.
Five goals in two games sound like an unforgettable achievement, but 27-year-old Bam said he wasn't sure if he had done the same thing before.
"I have no idea," he said.
"I'm not really the kind of person who keeps records of his paintings."
But he knows this: the Americans are at 4-0 at the Olympic tournament, and they split their team first with Britain, who was still unbeatable after the victory of Thursday in Japan 2-0.
On Saturday, Britain and the United States will meet the first round in the last game.
Both teams have survived the quarterly, and this game will determine who will be first and who will be the second in their six teams' group.
The first to avoid a strong Dutch leader, the second group, when the fourth finals begin a little longer.
Whether Saturday's game ends, the Americans have aroused their surprising success here, four years after they stayed in London's Olympics last for 12 teams.
Bam was in that team.
He grew up in the Pennsylvania Blue Bell and picked up the groundhockey bay for the first time at the age of 3 (the older twin sisters in Drexel) as part of the country team at the age of 16, when he became the youngest player of all time.
He wasn't involved in the 2008 Olympics because he didn't get involved in his final playlist.
In 2012, nothing went wrong with him and his teammates.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an English coach, began to change.
"Cultural change, spiritual change, physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the same kind of work in London as we now have.
We've done a full translation.
On Thursday night, Bam started his first half-time painting with a creep from the paint.
India had come into the game with no victory at the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the situation in the 1-0 chapters until the end of the third round, when Bam took over the situation.
He drove the ball long to the left of the field, then rolled in the middle and pulled the ball to the finish, taking the Americans to 2-0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the fourth round in the middle of the last goal.
This zero game was the first U.S. goalkeeper for Jackie Briggs, who had made one goal in each of the first three wins.
He's in good shape.
So is Bam.
"We now have a good situation," said Parnham, but its goodness depends on the outcome of the Saturday game.
The peace of trampoline in the middle of the Olympics
Wherever you are, whatever the time is, the Olympics are on their way.
Rio de Janeiro’s events seem to be a message of ongoing and inevitable, rageous competition and effort.
It's like the Olympic Warp itself is a flammable message cap, sent from a swimmer to a swimmer and from a powerful triathlonist.
It is impossible to put on TV, read a newspaper or listen to a chat with a guest in the coffee shop line without hearing about the hatred between Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or Michael Phelps and Chad Le Clos.
And then Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the Olympics' first-time and the future heartbreaker with a smiling pile, could well be one of the names of all who are presented in the best time of view and supported by sponsorship agreements and good-minded TV advertising - if he was a swimmer, powerful or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28 from Lake Forest of California, competes with the Olympic Gold in Trampoline.
The Olympic Light does not illuminate all species as much.
Farther from the center, partly in the shadow, are the species that are not all generally accepted: air pistol fire, flexial fire, feather balloon, taekwondo.
We always have a chest swim, long as it's alive.
But if I can make a moderate number of my special favourites, I would like to draw attention to the reduced charm of trampoline.
Although trampoline has been an Olympic species since 2000, when it first attended Sydney’s races, its presence in the 16 years has been so limited that many of whom I interviewed did not realize it was an Olympic species.
This could be regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the species, it has never won a medal, and its athlete has gone to the final until 2012.
The Chinese and Russian usually share the medals of men, Chinese and Canadian women.
This year, the Chinese Dong Dong and the Canadian Rosie McLennan are defending their London gold medals.
However, Trampoline is associated with a certain kind of charm of the subcontractor, partly because of the fact that it sounds more suitable for a civilized ear than for a clown school.
Here I must admit that I'm not an expert. I'm just a fan of airlessness.
The species have the opportunity to entertain, as it is noted of the colour of the unfinished bombs of drawings, but it also has the glance of gymnastics and swimming, the two species that in principle combine.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means an explosion board.
The Championship seekers jump to a giant trampoline up to almost 30 feet, and they must carry out twisting business series (reverses, skills and voltages) and eventually land on their feet.
According to the official Olympics programme, they are evaluated on the basis of implementation, difficulty and flight time.
There are 32 athletes in Rio in 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The most common direction for the Olympics is straight ahead.
The hopes of the Medal must go further, faster, up and over, sometimes to the finish, sometimes to turn around the field.
They don't just hunt a goal line or a start-up show, they also, in television broadcasting, another loose border: the world or the Olympic event.
This determined pursuit is noble, admirable and even fanatic, and it can even get the viewer into tears.
But that is also the reason why watching races can be a little exhausting.
Trampoline offers a rest for this.
The trampoline's heading up.
The aim is not to move forward.
The competitor rises to a new rise, acting as irrelevant as an astronaut, goes up, then down, then again up.
Of course, this does not involve competition or difficulties, but during the programme there is no rageous rush towards the end, no jumps to the distance, only the inspiring, melting interruption of time and gravity.
It's as close to the zen space as it can be achieved in the Olympics.
Women's cartoon contests and then the final will be held on Friday afternoon at the beginning of the shipment at 13 (ET), men's races will also come on Saturday at 13.
NBC sends finals as part of his afternoon software from 14:00 on both days.
In the middle of the Olympic event, they offer a quiet, charming moment which is most likely not noticed in the general chaos.
And if awareness is achieved only by offering men's athletes to be stared and objected (such as the US men's forces recently suggested according to the Wall Street Journal), Dooley is just waiting for a shouting new fanship.
"The generation shows its mind" in Ethiopia, a long-term U.S. ally
Violence demonstrations in Ethiopia
Demonstrations in Ethiopia demanding political change have faced the violent opposition of the government.
The eyewitnesses say that tens of demonstrators have been shot dead in confrontations with the police.
Is Ethiopia breaking?
Over the last decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries, a strong ally in the West, whose economy is growing rapidly.
In recent months, however, protests against the government have shaken the country by spreading to more and more regions.
In the last week alone, thousands of people rode into the streets, demanding a thorough political change.
According to the human rights groups, the government's response was unpleasant.
The eyewitnesses said the police shot and killed tens of unarmed demonstrators.
Spreaded videos recorded in demonstrations, which are thought to be at the end of the last year or the beginning of this year, show how security authorities hit the young people on the bush while they were forced to stand on their hands against the wall.
The United Nations High Human Rights Authority now calls for a comprehensive study.
"The consolidation of this country was always difficult, and it will be even more difficult in the future," said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the African Sarven International Crisis Group research group.
After Nigeria, Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa, and the Western countries appreciate its stability.
American military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians in combating the terrorist threats of the region, especially in Somalia, and hardly any African country receives so much help from the western countries.
The economy in Ethiopia has grown at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved extremely much, and the capital of Addis Abeba is even a new work traveller train.
The streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
However, although Ethiopia has not been a model of democracy, human rights organisations have kept talking about the oppression of the government, the opposition of the country has been limited and the dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many have been expelled from the country, imprisoned, killed or driven away from the desert.
But this can change.
"If you suppress people, and they have no choice but to point out, this will happen," said Seyoum Teshome, a university teacher from Central Ethiopia.
The whole youth shows its mind.
One generation shows his mind.
The complaints are diverse and cover everything in the custody of the dominant coalition of land use.
After the greatly criticised elections last year, the ruling party and all the allies had the last place to hold the opposition, and now it holds every place in Parliament.
At the same time, tensions on the line against Eritrea are increasing, and the battle along this tight and controversial border required hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogade National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated over the past years, can try to use the destruct and rearm.
Many factors explain why bitter feelings under the surface of years are now exploding.
The first seems to be seemingly harmless: smartphones.
Only in the last few years, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate through social media, since cheaper smartphones have become generalised and the internet service has improved.
Even if the government closes access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during demonstrations, many people can still communicate via the remote network servers to hide the location.
Many young Ethiopians said that this was how they gathered for demonstrations.
Secondly, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia, ormons and ampharies, will be better suited.
The Oromos and the Amhara are not natural allies.
For a very long time, the Amharans, who come mostly from the Christian high places in Ethiopia, succeeded in politics and business using orphans, many of whom are Muslims and living in the landscapes.
But this is changing too.
"We're on our way to organizing under one umbrella," said Oromo Director Mulatu Gemechu.
The main demonstrations have been in the Amhara and Oromo regions.
Many amharats and oromos think that Ethiopia is unjustly controlled by Tigre people. The people cover about six per cent of the population and dominate armed forces, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the trouble is the loss of Meles Zenawin.
Meles, former rebel leader, was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of a secret disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who saw around the corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly qualified to observe early signs of displeasure and to use secret ambassadors in making opponents harmless.
"The current administration has no basic instinct like it," said the conflict analyst Abdi.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was gathered relatively unknown to fill Meles' boots.
Unlike Meles, from the Tigre region of North Ethiopia, Hailemariam is from the south.
The analysts say that the security services controlled by the tigres don't trust him.
Many fear that this can lead to increased bloodshed.
For the past time, Ethiopia was in the power of such a blur in 2005, when thousands showed their minds about elections, which according to analyticals appeared to be the first to be the government spooked and then robbed.
In the following intensive shock, many demonstrators died, although less than in recent months, and the period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised the leaders of Ethiopia for visual infrastructure planning, such as the new road train, and for significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But clearly, this has not stopped the disrespect of the Etiopian government.
And now it's starting to get a dangerous, ethnic form.
Last month, demonstrators in Gondar, in the Amhara City, attacked the companies owned by tigres, and the hatred against Tigre becomes increasingly common in social media.
The analysts say that demonstrations put the United States and other Western allies in a creepy position.
The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights in a neighbouring country in Somalia, even though it said some time ago that he closed this base.
Although western countries clearly want to support democracy, they also do not want their allies in the unstable region to fall.
"This," Abdi said, "it's real balancing."
Donald Trump explains his Obama base-Issi's claim to be "Sachasms"
Donald J. Trump tried to suppress his last campaign by overwhelming my argument on Friday, claiming that he was not serious at this week when he said a number of times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the terrorists of the Islamic state.
The study raised new questions about the ability of the Republican Presidential Advocate General to communicate clearly to the American public.
It also put his defenders, who have been struggling to defend him during a stormy period, into a difficult position in which they must explain the observations that he does not necessarily mean.
After the suggestion made at the campaign meeting on Wednesday, Trump said the same intensiveness in Thursday interviews, where he insisted that he really meant to say that the President and Clinton created Isis.
However, at the early Friday morning Twitter publication, Trump said that he was just sarcastic.
The publication was a full translation of the last day when Trump said that in several interviews he was really serious about the accusation.
When the conservative radio broadcaster Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump draw his remarks by reminding him that Obama wants to destroy Isis, the Republican presidential candidate took this in his ears.
The latest criticism storm comes in a situation where Trump has tried to refocus his campaign in the midst of the opinion survey results that fall into the economy.
Trump and Clinton fought talking about the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the subject again.
Paeten again to Twitter, he warned that Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he felt boring.
Trump has used a sarcasm fight before.
Later in July after he faced a broad criticism, apparently, when he suggested that the Russians should hack into Clinton's e-mails, he later explained his comments by saying, "Of course, I am sarcastic."
The approach enables Trump to go within the limits of political speech and then return if necessary.
"I think it's a model where he tests certain messages that are important to his fans. He watches how they work and then 'selects' in the direction or the other, depending on the reaction,' said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who has followed the language of both candidates.
But I also think that he is keen about his statements and knows that they are vague enough to filtrate them through a number of lenses.
Instead of alleviating their speeches for a large audience of votes, Trump has been more shattered in recent days when his favor has continued to fall.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey published on Friday showed that Trump laundered significantly after Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and that the race is tight in Florida.
Although Trump basically tries to avoid apology for provoking matters, he often accuses his critics of misunderstanding his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
When he faces an ever closer review of the presidential campaign in the last few months, Trump's jokes have forced his loyal allies to an uncomfortable position in which they must publicly support him, irrespective of how provoking his comments are.
The former mayor of New York, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who is one of Trump's most prominent supporters, worked hard to defend the candidate in the CNN interview on Thursday.
"I believe that there are real, political comments in his words," said Giuliani, when he was asked about the trueness of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton set up the Islamic state.
It is true in the sense that before Obama Isis was almost unknown, a small organization he called amateur, completely wrong, and that is why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most Republicans in the mainstream try to argue that the Obama Government, where Clinton worked as a foreign minister, allowed Isis to become worse because it failed to handle the situation effectively in the Middle East.
Before Pennsylvania's Friday meetings, Trump continued on Twitter to attack the news media that devour every word and are partial against him.
He mocked the "worn, pathetic" television experts who try to find out about him, saying, "They don't succeed!"
Some of the Democrats mocked Trump's excuse for being a new evidence that he was inappropriate as President.
Previously closed coffee shop returns to Greenpoint.
Verb Cafe was a reluctant, only a cash-accepting place in Williamsburg, where there was no wireless network, but who offered a good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the Bedford Avenue streetside was too expensive for it.
The movement that replaced Verb in summer 2014, Soap Cherie, sells soap cake shaped soaps.
The locals saddened it as the last loss in the middle-class city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead and Chelsea Hotel is broken and Verb is now a soap shop."
But if New York is a change, it's also reinvention.
In November last, the revived Verb opened to Greenpoint, less than a mile away from its original location.
There's a wifi in the new Verb and you can pay with credit cards, but some of the staff are still the same and there's the same unpleasant atmosphere.
Coffee's still good.
The new Verbi is run by Cisco Rodriguez, the long-term employee of the old cafe, who is the owner of the new place and the director.
He started in Verb in 2001 and was there until the end.
When the client offered to finance him in a new place, he said he was excited.
Rodriguez, 36, held many things the same.
Verb used the same bagel supplier and bought the same kind of espresso.
It even used old Verb's lights.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try.
He brought new ingredients.
The menu contains bacon-cannamon cheese sandwiches, for example capricas and onions.
There's brown rice in the bowls.
There's no more beer in the cafeteria, but fresh juices are made.
In nine months, Rodriguez says he's noticed the old stock clients of a level of power.
"Williamsburg was too expensive for many former customers," he said.
One of the last Sundays, Rebecca Oliveira was one of these clients.
Oliveira, 34, lived earlier in Williamsburg and visited Verb on a regular basis.
Even after he moved to Greenpoint, he went to the cafeteria.
He says when Verb closed, he gave up his coffee drink for a while.
"I understood that I enjoyed Verb's coffee and culture," he said.
Now he has returned to coffee, although that day he ordered a chai drink mixed in instead of his normal ice coffee, which is one of the new additions.
The second long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, visited Verb faithfully since 2003.
He went there before work and always made the same order.
"Every day, fifteen more than seven, regular than the watch, I went in and they were preparing for spices with my bagel butter," he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to do experiments and bring new ingredients to the menu.
Nowadays, Rosanthal is still making his usual order, but sometimes because of the variation, he has a room for spicy bagel bacon, eggs and cheese.
Rodriguez says he doesn't have a grudge for the soap store that took over the old spaces.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to prepare Verb for a special sapphire to use as an ingredients of cold-finished coffee in the cafeteria.
"I think we can still take the offer," said Rodriguez.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint have also accepted the cafe.
One of these new customers turned the menu into a party, and Rodriguez said that he was planning to put it out soon to make his new neighbours welcome.
The new location has other interests.
The local juice site wants to bottle and sell cold-extended coffee.
It is possible that the cafe is expanding to the next building.
Many customers have enough to get their old favourites in the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was the client of the position and said it was unsatisfactory when the place was closed.
When the new place was opened, Whitt said he felt like he came home walking in and ordering coffee.
"I had a longing to smell it," he said.
A Square Meal: Fallover food
In March 1933, soon after he became president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat from lunch to his office.
President Roosevelt was fond of the finest Fifth Avenue dishes, such as the geese liver snack, and Maryland's pant turtle cook.
That day his diet was more modest: filled eggs in the tomato sauce, potatoes and desserts from the plum pussy.
"It was a demonstration of culinary solidarity for people who suffer," said Jane Ziegelman.
His wife, Andrew Coe, added, "It was also a message to the Americans about how to eat."
A couple in Brooklyn Heights is food historians.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, told me about Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman told me about life on the Lower East Side floor house through food in his book 97 Orchard.
Their new collaboration, A Square Meal, published by Harper on Tuesday, is a history of American food during the great depression of the 1930s.
By demonstrating their own own culinary solidarity, they will meet a journalist at dinner in Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small, unpleasant lunch bar in the Flatiron region, which has been operating since the 1929 stock market failure.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered fresh cheese sandwich, and Coe, 57, took a dose of turkey, potatoes and vegetables.
When the journalist ordered meat mushrooms, the couple found it appropriate to discuss eating the degeneration period.
"The wrecks were very popular," said Ziegelman.
It was peanut-free, liver fractured, bamboo.
They were made from a manufacturing substance and from a low-cost constituent ingredients that continued the actual manufacturing material.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they would make you dinner.
Coe was so lame.
"I'm sure it felt like a lead problem in the stomach," he said.
In the years before the damaging period, the American tables, especially in the countryside, were like an eating, a lot like a jaksat-out table.
The groups of women made food for male farm workers, and the fresh pie was served at breakfast, lunch and dinner.
The Americans sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. The Square Meal book chronicled the ways in which the nation survived that suddenly was no longer a country of enrichment.
"That time, the food became a central, struggling topic for the Americans," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
One more troublesome was a new, affordable diet: Mystery dishes, such as sauces and boxes, became the main food, and the box was a "great way to use food stars", mentioned Ziegelma because the cooks could hide less attractive ingredients under the creamy sauce layer.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
From the flesh that had been in the middle of American meals for years, it became a sustainablely administered luxury product.
Special compositions were tested when calorie and nutrient content were more important than taste or even healthy sense in the kitchen.
During the investigation, Ziegelman also prepared a period of food for the book containing recipes, where fried bulbs were filled with peanut beans.
"It wasn't popular for dinner," said Coe.
Ziegelman specified, "It was unrealistic."
Peanut butter doesn't fit fried onions.
This was characteristic for many household resepts.
Home Economy experts, such as Louise Stanley, director of the federal household agency in 1923-1943, guided the country’s meal practices more than ever before or after.
In the newspapers and magazines, public recipes and articles were encouraged by women to become "budjetsmen" and to respond to the challenge of converting so-called spaghets and carrots into tasteful doses.
A Square Meal is the celebration of historic flavors.
Particularly delicious are the reports of the government's reaction to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover, let me eat your cake position.
At the same time that he publicly praised his child’s simple, iowan country food, he ate like a fined millionaire who had become.
"He liked the continental food, like the fish with the cucumber sauce," said Coe.
He ate almost golden in the dining room on his head a smoker.
He was great out of everything.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to be an example of his own stomach.
As the book says, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a farmer who had no interest in the taste, the White House became a place that "not only offered the most prestigious food in Washington, but also the worst prepared food."
Many of the depressed meals were abandoned as soon as the land returned to its feet.
The tradition is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, Ziegelman said, and the way science applies to cooking.
The couple said that when they wrote the book, they gained a better understanding of the eating methods of Ziegelman’s mother, such as how she could not throw food away.
"He really was afraid to waste food," said Coe.
Ziegelman remembered, "He even sick people."
There's been a bleached intermediate incident.
After the plates were empty in Eisenberg, he and Coe brought out the dessert that they had prepared at home: a plum after meal that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
Ziegelman added that the general trick was to give a name for modest receptacles.
There was no cream foam, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and rabbit.
They all immersed their spoons unwittingly in a sticky, brown lizard.
Suddenly, it wasn't bad.
Coe sniffed once and again.
As he sounded like a positive budgeter, he told his wife, "a bit of scratched German peanuts could help."
For Gilead, the costs of lawyers in the fight against hepatitis C against Merck
The US Congregation Judge has ordered that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to receive a lawyer’s expenses against Merck & Co Inc, a drug manufacturer in the case of hepatitis C patients.
In June, Gilead was freed from a $200 million payment after they violated two Merck patents related to Gilead’s successive medicines for Sovald and Harvon. This release followed when the American judge found misuses of Merck, including false oaths and other unethical practices.
In the Thursday judgment of the United States Confederation Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead was entitled to reimbursement of the claims.
Merck is trying to catch Gilead, who controls the market in a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can clearly cure over 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case runs until 2013, when Gilead and Merck challenged each other the right of the active substance in Gilead’s medicinal products for the possession of the laboratory work under the sofosbuvir.
The troops supported by the United States say that they have taken over the Manbij Manbij, who is fully controlled by Isis.
The troops supported by the United States have taken full power to the northern town of Manbij, near the Turkish border after the last remaining Isis fighters left the city, said the group representative on Friday.
The Syrian democratic troops (SDF) are now investigating the city after the last fighter group hidden in the city left.
The troops had released over 2000 winglet prisoners who were held captive by the fighters, from the Sharfan Darwish SDF federal force, from the Manbij Military Council, told Reuters.
"The city is now fully under our control, but we have started looking into it," he told Reuters.
Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015, paid 34.2 per cent of federal taxes
On Friday, Hillary Clinton published its 2015 tax declaration, which showed that the income of the democratic presidential candidate and his spouse in that year was $10.75 million and that their actual federal tax rate was 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated a million dollars to charity organizations, mainly to Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton made almost 5.3 million dollars of speaking allowances, and the former Foreign Minister announced that he had received 3 million publishers from Simon & Schuster in his booklet, which told his career at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Vice-President of Clinton, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, her wife, Anne Holton, published a 10-year tax declaration.
Their actual federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3 per cent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine set a standard for economic transparency," said Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton's campaign assistant.
As a creepy contrast to this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and revokes his previous promises of publishing his tax statements.
As a rule, the President-in-Office of the United States will publish its tax declaration, even though the law does not obligate it.
The New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have begged the tax administration to audit as a reason for refusing to publish tax declarations.
"Your turn," said Ian Sams, Champagne Assistant of Clinton, in Twitter, when he published a link to the tax statements of the democratic society.
On Thursday, the special assistant of Trump, Michael Cohen, told the CNN that he would not allow Trumpi to publish them until the audits were ready.
Trump critics, including Presidential candidate Mitt Romney of the Republic of 2012 and other Republican colleagues, have said that his refusal to raise questions about his capital, his contributions to charity, his business and many other links to Russia, for example.
Clinton has taken up the problem on Fridays with an online video that highlights visible Republicans that urge Trump to publish his taxes.
On Thursday, he raised the problem in his economic speech in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every candidate of the last decades has made: published his tax statement," he told the public.
Politico has announced that Trump has not paid any or very little taxes in the 1990s, and the New York Times business triangle borrowed on Friday numerous tax lawyers and accountants who said that the situation could still be the same.
Federal tax rates have become a problem in the presidential elections.
Clinton has supported a rule named according to Warren Buffett, a billionaire investor that would ensure that more than a million dollars a year deserve at least 30% of taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At the Clinton meeting in Nebraska Omaha last week, Buffett, the Berkshire Hathaway Conglomerate, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said that he also has the audit of the tax administration, and that Trump is not afraid of the tax collecting agency, but of the voters.
Clinton's campaign has published tax declarations until 2007.
The actual tax rate of Clintons living in Chappaqua in New York today was around 32% between 2007 and 2014 and their actual combined tax rate was around 40.5%.
Clinton’s 2015 tax statement showed that only $100 of their income came from wages, unlike most of the Americans.
Their principal place of investment was a cheap, indexed investment fund, and Clinton reported dividends and interest incomes of $100,000.

Chili powder condoms and sparkles enhance the protection of the ivory of Tanzania
Natural protectors in Tanzania use an unusual way to prevent elephants from traveling to people's homelands, throwing animals with chili powder filled condoms.
The art has proved to be effective, and the idea of Honeyguide Foundation invented several years ago, in conjunction with the United States Nature Conservancy, has enhanced its advertising by training volunteers in northern Danube villages to use the non-violent way of four steps in protecting homes and hundreds without the animals being injured.
In the past, many used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is the world's elephant day, dedicated to the protection of these animals.
"Since we developed the tools, we have seen a change in attitude in these communities, which are much more confident about being able to keep elephants out of their fields without harming them," said Damian Bell, CEO of Honeygues.
The first two steps keep inside the intrusion of an elephant with a flashlight and the ringing of a storm.
If it doesn't stop the animal, we'll throw the so-called Chilipilvi.
The condom shall be filled with the mixture of chili powder and land, as well as with a twist, and then the condom shall be twisted in such a way that only the wire remains visible.
When the condom is ignited, it breaks up and blows chili powder in the air.
One scent is usually enough to send an elephant in the other direction.
The last way is the trigger that shoots a Roman candle in the air, and the fire produces a loud, clear explosion.
RT News: The Jewish filmmaker criticizes the Berlin hotel that erased the Israeli direction number at the request of the Arabs
The French Jewish filmmaker released the media storm after revealed that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not list Israel's direction number. According to the employee, this is due to the "applications" of the Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, a Shoah documentary about Holocaust, purged his frustration in the Berlin Hotel Kempinski Bristol, writing an open letter in the German FAZ publication.
During his recent nights spent, Lanzmann sought to find the country's guide list offered by the Israeli hotel.
However, the country was not mentioned among the countries to which you can call directly from the hotel room.
How can it be that in 2016, in Berlin, the new capital of Germany, Israel has been erased and erased?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to call Israel through its own phone center.
When you were looking for an explanation, the filmmaker took the matter up at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann wrote that the answer from it was "aroused her."
The hotel's recipeist said it was a "a discretionary decision" in the management of the Kempinski Hotels.
The reason behind the decision was even more astounding in the filmmaker.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs, and they demand the removal of Israel's direction number," says the employee, according to Lanzmann.
Ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman of Israel called the case "great misunderstanding," Zuddeutsche Zeitung reports.
"We were terrified and shocked because of the case.
It's already a big misunderstanding.
But even more shame is that this happened in Germany and in this hotel chain.
This doesn't need explanations.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident produced quite a response on the Internet when people called it scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinski hotel was simply "adopted" to the alleged demands of the Arab customers.
"Don't worry," said the second publication, which pointed out that a beautiful hotel on Kurfurstendamm is standing near the synagogue.
The hotel itself challenged all the charges quickly and called what happened as "observatory" and "apologies" from Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reported.
"A clear command not to include Israel in the Quick Selection List has never been made," says the representative of Kempinski, said Suddeutche Zeitung.
It adds that the direction number has now been added.
The police used tears gas and gums against Brazilian students who showed their minds
Students joined the police on Thursday in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil, when students gathered to express their minds against the reforms of the government’s public education system.
The police used tears gas and rubberodes against demonstrators.
The problems began when law enforcement attempted to dismantle the student population, which led to the use of rubberodes and tears.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstration to express their horror of plans.
According to the proposals made by Governor Paulo Geraldo Alckmin of Sao Paolo, less than 100 public schools would be closed, and 300 000 students would be reinvested to save money.
Some of the participants in the demonstration were seen writing graffiti against temporary President Michel Temer on the walls.
This last demonstration took place only days after demonstrators went on a single set to support the arrested President Dilma Roussef when he voted for the senate of the country.
RT business: trade between Russia and Iran is suddenly increasing by 71%
Following the removal of forces, the turnover of trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the previous year, says the Russian Ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.
Following the removal of international sanctions against Iran, Russian companies have shown great interest in transactions in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies continue their existing links with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
"Of course, one of the main objectives of bilateral cooperation in Iran is trade expansion," said Dzhagarya.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, the turnover of trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period of 2015, totalling USD 856 million.
In particular, Russia's exports to Iran increased by 91.5% in total to USD 697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16% to 158 million dollars.
"Ambassador said that the growth of the economy was achieved through the delivery of machinery, vehicles and weapons.
Furthermore, this year Dzhagarya is waiting for a record of Iranian tourists for Russia.
Last year, the Russian Foreign Representative in Iran granted approximately 35 000 visas to Iran's citizens mainly for travel.
Iran was also for the first time among those 20 countries, the most tourists in Russia.
"It is safe to say that the record of last year's Iranian chaos in Russia will be broken," he said.
At the same time, rather few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes to change.
"I can personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, while the monuments of ancient Persian civilization have been preserved in good condition," he said.
Scoot Callum Skinner hit the goal when the British caught a bike cult
Callum Skinner of Scotland was honored at the Men's Team Prince at Rio's Bike Stadium last night, when the British team's triangle defended his championship in London for 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was an anchor in the role in which his scot collar Sir Chris Roy rehabilitated, the legend was proud of a young man, when he took the goal of catching the victory from the New Zealand team.
The British took the shock victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympics.
And they repeated the trick after being placed modestly by the sixth of March in the World Championships in London, even though Hoy has then completed his race.
The problem between Beijing and London was replacing Special Sender Jamie Staff.
This was implemented just in time when Hindes appeared.
The end of Hoy also created a vacuum that Kian Emad and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man from whom the British coachs held up the potential in Scotland, which now is a backbone.
Hindes, Kenny, who won the championship with Hoy four years ago, and Skinner made an Olympic record in time, but New Zealand took the lead in the first round.
And the British Trinity won a double fight for gold.
After his own round, Hindes was totally behind, but Kenny bumped into the team's leadership, and Skinner held it up.
The change of strategy was a major part of the transformation of shape, and it included Hindes' driving with a larger change so that he could slow down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to stick to the tabernacle.
Hoy followed his position as a BBC expert, and drew attention to Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they entered the prize height.
Skinner, 23-year-old, Glasgow, said, "The blood is flattering."
I'm just here to do my best and get a reputation.
At the final, we made an Olympic record and won the world champions.
It was incredible at his time.
There can't be a better way to win.
After winning in London 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately fallen on the track after a bad start.
He later revoked his comments and the British competitors have not complained.
This time, there was no similar problem with overwhelming profit.
Hindes said, "I felt like being in London when there were so many British flags on the back."
As a team, we found a connection in the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships, so winning the Olympics again is simply amazing.
One event, one gold medal for the people who won seven out of ten bikes, both in Beijing and in London.
If this describes the development of the last five months, we will be expected to have a successful five-day bike stadium.
On the basis of Kenny's properness, it is not impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy's urine, winning three Olympic golds in one of the Olympics.
It would mean that Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (the most apparently holy day in British sport, which is also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister's birthday), would rise to six gold and one silver.
It'd be like Hoy.
Kenny's next competing in a sprint that starts today and takes three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I just had a good time with this one.
The team race is always the best.
It's being won together with the guys.
Winning alone is, honestly, lonely."
Hindes said, "If he wins the other two gold medals, he should be given the value of the knight."
This was the only medal race of the day, but Britain received more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest four lives in time, four kilometers in the team.
Their time was 3:51:943.
In London, the world record wins gold in 2012 is 3:51:659.
The first round and final (22.42) will be held today, on the second day of competition, when Wiggins will certainly be at the heart of the attention.
He had a dispute with the judges last night before the time, when the officials invited him to the length measurement.
In the same race of women that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Milngavien Katie Archibald progressed in the world recording time at 4:13:260.
The British team has learned to trust that its awesome track bike team will take over the center of the Olympics and reach the whole range of medals.
After performing truly extraordinary and complete management in Beijing and London, expectations have been reduced before Rio races.
The background has been a drama, of which the smallest have not been the difference between the technical leader, Shane Sutton, in April due to sexualism and temptation charges, as well as the end of the competition of large individuals such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, based on the first night's competitions on bicycle stadium, it seems that the legendary reputation of Great Britain is now going up at the perfect moment could be true again.
Portland's unsolicited future due to the cut of the electricity contract
The future of the Aluminium Soil in Portland Victoria, as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers, is uncertain when the electricity-sharing electric company revealed that one of the owners of the factory is closing the distribution agreement, so the operation of all distribution contracts is expected.
The measure follows the earlier decision taken by the Victorian Government this year that the aid required for the operation of the plant will not be extended.
The 20-year period ends in November.
Even 2000 jobs may be in danger at the Alcoan Portland factory.
Even 2000 jobs can be at risk, directly or indirectly, with the closure of the factory.
In addition, the snowball effect can be possible, as the melting consumes about 10% of the total electricity production of Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry's melting, leading to the closure of the Anglesean power plant last year.
Alcoa Portland's melting loses money and is under the danger of closing.
The measure is now following the speculation of the future of the factory, which began as a result of the strong Australian dollar and has recently been caused by the production price of the factory.
AGL, which distributes electricity to a large aluminium soil from Loy Yang An's power plant in Latrobe Valley, said that it also expects the three other owners to conclude their contract.
Most of the factory is owned by Alcoa and Alumina, and the Chinese CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
"AgL expects to continue the operation of Portland plant, which means that the physical need for unsolicited electricity will continue," he said.
According to AGL, the agreements are so-called "protection agreements" which had to enter into force in November 2016.
The agreements have 12 months of redundancy, so they actually run out in 2017.
"For this reason AGL expects contracts to produce results in 2017," the electricity company said.
All possible impact on AGL from 2018 onwards is currently limited by the strong prospects of the wholesale electricity market in the future.
AGL said that it has already reduced the value of the contracts in its accounts for $187 million.
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate the agreements is "not affecting Alcoa's ability to keep the melting in operation or to secure unsolicited power supply".
The US company said that it concluded a 20-year agreement with Loy Yang in 2010 and that the agreement had to enter into force in November of this year, but it has not yet explained why the agreement was withdrawn.
The analysts have been guarded both by the unsolicited Portland in Victoria and also by the possible closure of the Tomago factory near Newcastle because the economic situation in the sector is poor.
Earlier in the week, AGL's CEO Stephen Mikkelsen told the analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity each year and Tomago uses about 900 megawatts.
"If both factories leave the market, this is a significant reduction in demand for the [electric] market.
As a power producer, this would not be a good thing," he said.
Kendall, not just the true TV star of Kardashians, is on the cover of the September Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and mother-manager Kris Kardashian-Jenner, the fourth daughter of the clan, is on the cover of the United States Vogue's desired September number.
Kendall, who is the brand delegate of Estee Lauder and has been a model in the fashion tigers of Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday in his Instagram account.
"Looking this deck in a room full of beloved people made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The cover was followed by a unique (or perhaps only suitable for Kardashian style?), a handwritten reality video where the entire Kardashian-Jenner clan (excluding the problem cases Rob and Caitly, and with all the favorite entertainment, the Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot the cover of his sister, but ended with a classic translation: they were planning a surprise party.
It is a cliché of almost every child's television series (Seacrest says the subtitles "I don't think we'd forget you" with the credibility of a dressed dress in the morning), but Krisin had to get his other girls to benefit from this publicity.
This is because we have certainly moved to the new Kardashian era along with the place of Vogue in September.
Kendall’s older sister, Kim, may have reached Vogue’s application first (they shared it with his husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September number is quite his own class.
The number of Vogue September is the most selling edition of the year.
Its thickness is more like a coffee memorandum than a fashion magazine, and the number attracts a huge number of advertisers (from Fashion, it declined that 615 of the last 832 guide was advertising content).
The discovery of its cover star is expected so hard for the last two years that the pictures of the magazine have leaked before the official publication.
Former women on deck have been Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangel and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have indeed been more "publics that work as models" than "models that are celebrities".
The Oscar winner and Dior's ambassador Jennifer Lawrence were on deck in 2013, year after Lady Gaga's position.
But if it happened that Jenner, who is described by the magazine as a "fortunate model" of his generation, would hit the first category mentioned, he would be with quite a good company.
These celebrities are not family or reality stars for famous people or today's young people who can make a good Snapchat video (even Jenner is all of this).
They are rightly talented women who succeed in the entertainment industry.
Last year's cover model Beyonce has been in Lemonade's publication for one of the strongest years of her career.
Of course, not everyone is pleased with Jenner's success.
His true TV history, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be a scratch.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and his colleague, Gigi Hadidi, calling them "butt this moment".
This feeling got up again with Jenner's Vogue deck.
But in unhappyness, spinning is incompetent.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the Vogue September number.
He's a super model in the purest sense of the word.
He's a model for Marc Jacobs.
He's selling you Estee Lauder's makeup.
He and all his sisters sell you pictures of themselves in their own applications that can be found at the back of the payment wall.
He sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter who he took to the LOVE magazine.
And at his leisure time, possibly just to see his sister, Kourtney, and her children, she's a real TV star.
Community legal centres turn 160 000 people away every year
More than 160 000 of the most vulnerable people will be reversed annually from the Community legal centres when the sector is preparing for the impact of additional financial operations on its activities at the extreme.
In Queensland, three of the five people - mostly old, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those who have no chance to fight unfair decisions and equivalents - are already reversed when they seek to express legal advice and representation.
Legal services already drawn to the Community's extremes are preparing for additional cuts.
In June next year, these legal centres are expected to lose 30% of their federal funding.
According to the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres, James Farrell, head of Community Legal Centres of Queensland, thousands of people are already being revoked annually.
Farrell said that if the federal government doesn't revoke the decision, the situation will only get worse.
"The legal centres of the Queensland Community are chronicly under-financed, meaning that thousands of people will be reversed annually from the essential services they need," he said.
People who leave violent relationships with uncontrolled and repressive debts, families in displaced homes, unjustly separated workers - all these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they are not receiving the help they need.
The federal government cuts funding by 30% in June 2017, which means that thousands of unprotected Queensland residents are forced to navigate in the face of complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Minister of Justice and on Senator George Brandis of Queensland to withdraw these financial operations immediately so that people can get the help they need in their legal problems.
Last year, the Government of the State made its promise to raise legal assistance to the level of national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the Community Legal Centre and their customer communities, and the Palaszczuk Government must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign was challenged to court after the employee was claimed to be threatened with a gun.
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was challenged to trial that they claimed that they did nothing after they were told that the head of the operation of the campaign in North Carolina threatened the workers in February when they drove in Jeep.
The incident was described in the action brought by Vincent Bordin by the former software practitioner of the state campaign in Charlotte on Wednesday at the State Court of Justice.
Bordini said that he waited for months to handle the situation internally before he realized that "this wouldn't happen."
"Captain Earl Phillip took out the gun, put his right front finger on the trigger and pushed the pipe against Vincent's knee slope", Bordini said in the cover.
After appealing to the local and regional campaign management, Bordini heard that at least four other persons had had similar experience with Phillip, it was stated in the action.
"There's no need to fire weapons to cause damage," said Bordini in the action.
The challenge will only be two days after the Presidential candidate of the Republicans caused anger when telling the general public in North Carolina that "the people of another addition", which is usually covered by arms owners and armed men, could take action if his competitor Hillary Clinton was chosen and could choose judges.
Trump's campaign said that the media has taken his word away from the connection, and that he does not support violence.
Bordin's challenge is to apply for compensation from the campaign for careless supervision and for the cause of violence, assault and emotional disruption.
Hope Hicks, a representative of Trump, did not respond immediately to the request for comments.
Phillip was unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local newsletter company in Charlote reported Phillip recently left the campaign.
The call request submitted to his consultancy firm in the Innovative Consulting Services was not answered immediately.
Donald Trump, President-in-Office of the Republic, has been controversial.

British must channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow
Heathrow brings recovery and flourishment into the whole stomach, not just local communities and across London.
To me, this was the great attraction of Heathrow, as was the charm of the London 2012 races, when we saw a huge effort to ensure that all our peoples and regions would benefit from the races.
The Olympics made huge benefits for Stratford and the East End.
And we will do that again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
10 000 new places of training and 40 000 new jobs are created for local communities alone, and youth unemployment is removed around the airport.
As before the London 2012 races, some will think that the challenge of extending Heathrow is too great.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for races and that we would be ashamed of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they're going to be wrong about Heathrow.
The obstacles must always be crossed, but Heathrow will answer every question that will be asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just a few.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and 211 billion GBP economic growth, both to leave the heritage of skills and employment around the airport and around Britain.
We have a great team in Heathrow that has implemented the 11 billion GBP infrastructure investment programme in time and in the budget: T5, which has been voted as the world's best airport terminal in five years consecutively, T2, built between the most urgent runways in the world.
Now the team is ready to run a third runway, supported by 16 billion GBP private money.
The Olympic Olympics in London in 2012 were a great success for Great Britain, and I am convinced that Heathrow's expansion is also that.
It is time for us to channel the spirit of the Olympics and to expand Heathrow, to ensure the future of our trade and to create a heritage of skills and employment, of which Britain can be proud.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook cat and mouse games on preventing advertising
For companies that receive money from online advertising, companies overturning ads are a "cass and mouse game", said one of the companies that produce this program.
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would prevent advertising inhibitors from using their computer websites, Adblock Plus published a blog in which it was said that users could update the program filters to prevent advertising on the social network websites.
On Tuesday, Facebook said that the code of its websites would be changed from around advertisements to make it more difficult for advertisers to detect which parts of the page are advertisements.
But now Adblock says it's been circulating a new code.
In the blog, Adblock's representative Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of a guaranteed fight between the community that prevents the open source code advertisements and its circles has been running since it was invented to prevent advertising" and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with its own solution.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has taken part in the fight is a strong demonstration of the sadness of advertising inhibitors to industry.
Worldwide, around 200 million people use advertising inhibitors, reported last year's research in Pagefair and Adobe. This is almost four times the amount that used these programmes in 2013.
1.03 million active daily users use Facebook with mobile devices, and mobile advertising now covers 84 per cent of Facebook advertising revenues.
However, the company is following the blockers of advertisements on the computer, as mobile advertising inhibitors do not work on Facebook's mobile applications for a social network or Instagram, said the representative.
Computer advertising continues to generate sufficient revenue in order to enable Facebook to consider the investment of such a measure worthwhile.
On Tuesday, Facebook also said that it would update its "premence" tool to give people more power on how to target advertisements to them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were worrying because they would also prevent part of the content of the site other than advertising.
"This is not a good experience for people, and we have plans to address the problem," said the Facebook representative in the e-mail statement.
Advertising inhibitors are boring tools, and therefore we have focused on building tools like Ad Preferences that give control to people.
A woman got under the car on a Swiss motorway, apparently because of suicide.
The victim was lying on the motorway in the middle of the night.
The police are looking for witnesses after a woman stayed on the motorway under a number of vehicles in early Thursdays in the case of suicide, apparently.
The incident took place on the A1 road near Morges in Vaud's canton just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman made a "desperate act" and settled in the dark to lie on the road where she was hit by several means of transport, the Vaud police said in the statement.
The victim who clearly tried to kill himself was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who hit several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Several drivers involved in the event have already been questioned, but not all have been identified yet, the police told the police who appealed to them and all witnesses who witnessed the incident to sign up.
Crime investigation has begun, which is a "loogical" step in this kind of situation, a lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
"Although it remains to be seen if any of the involved drivers are charged.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
It's gonna be the case for the prosecutor," said Hofstetter.
Two similar cases for the last five years indicate that drivers are not held liable.
In both cases, both of them had a person walking in the dark motorway, it was estimated that drivers can't expect to meet a pedestrian on the motorway in the middle of the night, the newspaper said.
Last year, the police were released from charges concerning the non-compliance-related death injuries after he hit and killed a man lying on the A! road near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and out of the way, and the court was told.
The Court stated that the police, who was responding to the emergency call, had timed in a reasonable manner, and that the man's presence on the road was "full exceptional and unpredictable", said the judge.
Everyone who has information on a Thursday case near Morges must call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus once had to live
According to the NASA's new climate model estimates, Venus was likely to have to live once.
The scientists at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to explore Venus' past using tools and algorithms that are similar to those used by climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus could sometimes be under ground conditions.
Scientists have previously expressed that Venus’ slow rotation speed explains its thick atmosphere.
But the most recent simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earthlike atmosphere, and it could still be slowly spinning.
The model also examined the early Venus surface formation.
The planet was likely to have more dry areas than Earth, but once there was enough water and geographical variations to allow life and to protect from rapid water drainage.
The advantage of the early Venus was also 30 per cent the thinner sun.
"In the simulation of the GISS model, the slow spin of Venus reveals its side to the sun almost two months at a time," explained the newsletter by researcher Anthony Del Genio of GISS.
This warms the surface and produces a rain that creates a thick cloud layer, which acts as an umbrella protecting the surface from the large part of the sun’s heat.
As a result, average temperatures in the climate are actually a few degrees cooler than the current temperatures in the country.
The model produced a story from the development phases of Venus, which is similar to what the planetary scientists had previously assumed.
Although Venus was likely to have been living sometimes, it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light over billions of years.
Its oceans faded and its water steams burned in ultraviolet light.
When its hydrogen escaped, the only thing left behind was a thick CO2 atmosphere with the deadly greenhouse gas effects that we now know is Venus.
Researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy's resigning from the Avalanche Coach's pest.
On Thursday, Patrick Roy resigned from the activities of the Coach of Colorado Avalanche and Vice-President of Hockey, namely because of the lack of influence in the decision-making process of the team.
Vice-President of Colorado/President Joe Sakic confirmed the information and mentioned that the team would start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the last three years, I have made my duty as Vice-President of Colorado Avalanche on Hockey and Head Coach with enthusiasm, passion and determination," said Roy, a 50-year-old.
During the summer, I have thought long and hard about how I could improve this team to give it the depth that it needs and to take it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the opinion of the Coach and the Vice-President on Hockey should be fully in line with the organisation's view.
He must also have the opportunity to influence decisions that affect the team's performance.
These conditions are not currently met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me today about his decision," Sakic said.
We appreciate all the things he has done for the organization, and we wish him luck in the future.
Roy was appointed as the winner of the Jack Adams Award for the best coach of the league in his first Avalanche period 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and the victory of the central division, but Minnesota defeated the first round of Colorado drops, and the team has not been able to continue in the last two years.
Avalanche's games over the period 2015-16 ended with 39 wins, 39 loses and 4 matchs, and the team lost five points to Wild, losing the wild card dropping site of the Western conference.
Hall of Fame's chosen goalkeeper Roy won four Stanley Cupia - two in both Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers continue negotiations and postpone strike
The main negotiators said, when all the controversial parties sit down for a new round of negotiations, the work of the North Sea oil workers is postponed for wages.
The strikes of the oil field service company against Wood Group have been randomly arranged on the North Sea drilling trucks led by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group, as well as Unite and RMT associations, can confirm that we have agreed to re-launch the process to resolve the current dispute", read the joint opinion.
In the next few weeks, we will have several full-day meetings early next week so that we can take a fresh review position into problems.
According to the trade unions, their recent work struggle, which they say is the first for more than 25 years, was an objection to possible, up to 30% pay cuts.
During this year Wood Group cut the premiums of North Sea contractors by about 9% due to negative market pressure.
The company premium reduction follows a 10% reduction of contractors in its countries from 2014.
The company said that additional operations would provide the company with the necessary mode of movement to overcome the downturn of the market.
Shell, on the other hand, has reduced thousands of people on his pay list and announced their plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries, while the company will reduce its activities as a result of its giant fusion with the British Energy Company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower oil prices, and this economic situation is undermined by the British June decision to leave the European Union.
The Scottish Member, Dave Anderson, met the federal leaders earlier this week to discuss one generation of the North Sea's greatest labour disputes.
He said that the North Sea is essential to the economy of the region.
"We need a economy that works for many, not just a few, both in the North Sea and in the whole country," he said in the opinion.
In 2016, the North Sea is expected to invest less than EUR 1.4 billion in new projects, whereas the average of the previous five years has been about $7 billion.
Kepler measures the speed of the stars in the Plejad Star Force
The last task of Kepler's roller coupon has helped astronomers gather the most complete list of the speeds of the stars of the Plejad Stars.
New information helps astronomers to understand why the stars of the Stars are rotating at different speeds, and how the circulars relate to planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we now learn more about the relationship between the star mass, its age and even the history of the solar system," said researcher Luisa Rebull in the press release of the Caltech Infrared Processing and Analysis of the Pasadena Centre.
The Plejad Star Force is 445 light years away from Earth.
Many of the stars of the crowd have been born about 125 million years ago and are now reaching adulthood.
They're on top now.
At the peak spin speed, these growing stars drop large amounts from the wind.
When these winds pass through the stars' magnetic fields, they brake the stars.
When the star becomes old, the speed of rotation begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by monitoring the appearance of identifiable star spots, such as sunlights.
The latest list of speeds in the stars indicates that the more massive stars rotate slowly than the less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, larger than smaller.
"In the "balet", we see that slow rollers are usually more massive, while the fastest wheelers are usually very light stars," Rebull said.
Since the Plejadi Star Force is so close, it is ideal for a cosmic laboratory to assess the characteristics of the stars at speeds of rotation.
"The Plejad Star Force offers an anchor spinning stars to the theoretical models that include both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, because and why the stars slow down their speed of rotation and so-called hang their "tance shoes" on the nail.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of the speed of rotation of Plejad in three articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
