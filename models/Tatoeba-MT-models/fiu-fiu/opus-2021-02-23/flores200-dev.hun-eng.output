Stars release light and heat while hydrogen atoms unite (or fusionate) and thus create harder chemical elements.
Scientists work on a reactor that could produce energy the same way.
However, this is a very difficult problem to solve, and it can take years before they build useful fusion reactors.
Because of the surface voltage, the steel needle is floating on the top of the water.
Surface tension is created because water molecules on the surface of the water are more attractive than air molecules above them.
Water molecules form an invisible skin on the surface of the water, enabling objects such as needles to float on top of the water.
The two edges of the contemporary snake are a sandy hole. The two edges allow better ice storage, even in a decision-making position.
Since the blade is a little shaved, as the blade goes on one side or the other side, the edge touching the ice also bows.
If the skulls fall right, the skulls turn right, and the skulls fall left, the skulls turn left.
"Extended energy" not more than energy."
This will be achieved by emitting small particulate light as a photon.
"The scientists call this process "stimulated radiation emissions" because the atoms are stimulated by strong light, which causes light photon emissions, and light is also a kind of radiation."
The photo below presents the atoms that release photos. In reality, photographers are much smaller than they can see in the picture.
Photons are even smaller than nuclear materials!
After hundreds of hours of operation, the filament of the electric circuit will eventually burn out and its electric circuit will not work.
Then the filament should be replaced and we should be careful when switching the filament.
First, the electric switch must be turned off, or the cable shall be withdrawn.
This is because at the filament metal part, the current in the reservoir can cause a serious flow of electricity to you if you touch the inside of the booking or the lower metal part of the bulb while it is still partly in the booklet.
The main organ of the circulating system is the heart that pumps blood.
The blood flows from the heart in the veins called arteries, and comes back in the tubes called veins. The smallest forces are called hair fibers.
The teeth of the Triceratops were not only able to bite the very hard branches and roots.
According to some scientists, Triceratops ate cikász palm, which was a widely spread plant in the creat.
These plants are similar to small palm trees, sharp and stabbing flasks.
The triceratops could have used his strong barrel to remove the leaves before you run out of the strain.
Other scientists argued that these plants were extremely poisonous, so it is unlikely that they were consumed by dinosaurs, despite the fact that the toxic leaves or fruits are consumed by snakes and other animals such as the papagassians (the descendants of dinosaurs).
If you were on the surface of the Io, you'd be less than on Earth.
The man who weighs 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth would be ion 36 pounds (16 kg) weighted. So gravity, of course, will affect you less.
The sun does not have a barrel for which it can stand on Earth. The sun is formed by gases, fire and plasma.
Gas becomes thinner as we get away from the center of the sun.
In view of the sun, the external part of it is called a photosphere, meaning “lightsphere”.
Approximately three thousand years later, in 1610, the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei observed that Venus had phases similar to the Moon.
The phases are developed because Venus (or the moon) only lights the side of the sun. The Venus phases supported the theory of Copernicus that planets circulate around the sun.
Then a few years later, in 1639, an English astronomer, Jeremiah Horrocks, observed one of the relocations of Venus.

The Audioeul alphabet was originally named Jeongeum Hunmin, which means “the right voices for the command of men”.
There are a number of theories about the emergence of the Sanskrit language. One of the price of wandering from the west to India, according to which its members brought this language with them.
Sanskrit is one of the ancient languages, and many compare it to the Latin European language.
The world’s first known book was written in Sanskrit, but after the upanis were compiled, the Sanskrit became insignificant due to hierarchy.
Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language, based on many modern Indian languages, just as Latin is the basis of European languages, such as French or Spanish.
By the end of the battle against France, Germany started preparing to attack the British island.
Germany gave the code name of the attack "Oroslanfoka Operation", most of the hard arms and equipment of the British army lost when evacuated from Dunkirk, so the army was quite weak.
However, the Royal Navy was still much stronger than the German Navy (Kriegsmarine) and could have destroyed any invading marine soldiers crossing the La Manche Channel.
At the same time, only very few ships of the Royal Navy stayed near the likely assault route, as the marines feared that they would fall as a result of German air attacks.
"Let's explain Italy's plans, and Italy was mainly the German and Japanese "small brother."
He had a weaker army and a weaker navy, although four new ships were built before the war began.
Italy's main goal was African countries, and to take over these countries, their teams would need a starting base to get through the Mediterranean and flood Africa.
Therefore, they had to get rid of the British bases and the ships in Egypt, and the Italian warships other than these operations had no other task.
As for Japan, Japan is an island country, as is Britain.
Submarine vessels are designed for underwater transport and long-term underwater stay.
They used submarines in World War I and World War II, and then they were very slow, and they had very limited range of ammunition.
At the beginning of the war, the submarines traveled on the surface of the sea, but as the radar discovery became more advanced and more accurate, so they were forced to sink under water so that they could not notice them.
German submarines were simply called U-Boats. Germans acquired extraordinary expertise in the navigation and operation of submarines.
Due to their success with submarines after the war, the Germans were not allowed to hold much of them.
Yes, Tutanhamon, who is sometimes referred to as "Tut King" or as "Grand King," is currently one of the most well-known ancient Egyptian kings.
In a surprising way, he was not regarded as such a significant personality in the old age and was not included in the list of most ancient kings.
However, the discovery of his grave made it famous in 1922, while many of the grave memories were robbed in the past, this grave was virtually left unaffected.
Most of the objects that were buried together with Tutanhamon remained in good condition, including thousands of artifacts made of precious metals and rare stones.
With the invention of the large wheels, the Assyrian combat wheels became easier, faster and better, and easier to turn off the soldiers and other war cars.
The arrows of their deadly numbers were able to influence the armor of the rival soldiers. About 1,000 after Christ, the Assyrians introduced the first horsemanship.
The horsemanship is an army that fights on horseback, and the rain has not yet been invented, so he sat on the hair of the Assyrian rider during the fight.
We know a number of old Greek politicians, scientists and artists, one of the most well-known figures of culture, Homéros, the legendary blind poet who created two masterpieces of old Greek literature, Ilias and Odyssei.
Sophoklész and Arisztotelész are still popular drama writers, and their plays are considered to be the most important pieces of the world literature.
Another famous Greek is the mathematical Pitagoras, mostly known for the relationship between the sides of the rectangular triangle.
There are different estimates about how many people in the world speak Hindi. It is estimated that this world is the second and fourth of the most widely spoken language.
The number of speaking mother tongues depends on the counting of very similar dialektuss.
The number of speakers is estimated to be between 340 and 500 million, and about 800 million of those who understand.
The vocabulary of Hindi and urdu are similar, but their style of writing is different. During the daily conversation, the two speakers generally understand each other.
In the 15th century, Germany had a major impact on Northern Estonia’s culture.

In Turkey, 3% of the territory of the country is located in the European part of Turkey (East-Three-Three or Rumelia in the Balkan Peninsula).
The territory of Turkey is more than 1600 km (1000 km) long and 800 km (500 km) wide, and its shape is largely similar to a brickboard.
Turkey's territory - including lakes - is 783 562 square kilometres (300 948 square miles), of which 755 688 square kilometres (291 773 square miles) are in southwest Asia and 23 764 square kilometres (9174 square metres) in Europe.
The territory of Turkey is the 37st largest country in the world, which equates about the metropolitan area of France and the United Kingdom.
Turkey is bordered by three sides of the sea: west of the Aegean Sea, north of the Black Sea, south of the Mediterranean Sea.
Luxembourg has a long history, but its independence begins in 1839.
Some of the current parts of Belgium were part of Luxembourg in the past, but since the Belgian Revolution of 1830 became a Belgian region.
Luxembourg has always tried to remain a neutral country, but Germany was obsessed with both the I. and II. World War.
In 1957, Luxembourg became a founding member of the organization we know today as the European Union.
Drukgyal Dzong is a ruinous fortress and buddhist monastery in the upper part of the town of Paro (Phondey village).
They believe that the fortress was built with Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgye in 1649 in the memory of the victory against the Tibetan-Mong Force.
As a result of a fire in 1951, only few of the Drukgyal Dzong relics were left, such as the image of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.
After the fire, the fort was preserved and protected so remains one of the most sensible attractions of Bhutan.

Learning the creation of interactive media requires generally accepted and traditional skills and the use of devices described in interactive hours (possible scenario, sound and image editing, history, etc.).
Interactive planning presupposes the reassessment of assumptions relating to media production and the learning of non-linear thinking.
The interactive design requires the interconnection of the components of a project and, at the same time, they must stand as an independent entity.
The disadvantage of the zoom-objectives is that the complexity of the focus and the number of lenses needed to achieve the focus distance are much higher than those of fixed-speed objectives.
This is becoming an increasingly meaningless problem, as the lens manufacturers are getting more and more results in the lens production.
This allowed the lenses to be accessible to create high-quality images that can be achieved with fixed focal lenses.
The zoom is one of the other disadvantages of the objectives to maximal opening (closure time) generally low.
Therefore, cheap zoom objectives are difficult to use with weak lights without blindness.
One of the most common problems in converting movies to DVD format is overpainting.
Most televisions are designed to meet the needs of the general population.
So everything you see on TV has been cut off from the bottom, top and side.
This means that the picture covers the whole screen, and we call it overpainting.
Unfortunately, when we make a DVD, the winds are likely to be cut off and if the video is too close to the bottom edge, it won't look completely.
The traditional medieval castle has long been inspiring imagination, parties, feasts, and racing in Arthur’s age.
Although we are among the thousands of years of ruins, we can easily recall the voices and smells of the ancient battles, almost hear the cake of the pots on the cat stones and feel the smell of fear of the castle.
But is our imagination based on reality? First of all, why have they built castles? How have they been designed and built?
The characteristic of the age is that the Kirby Muxloe castle is more a fortified house than a real castle.
His large glass windows and thin walls would not have been able to resist a determined attack for long.
In the 1480s, when Lord Hastings started building, the country was relatively peaceful, and it was only necessary to protect against courier robbers.
The system of balanced forces was a system in which the European nations were trying to preserve national sovereignty in all European countries.
The concept was that all European nations had to prevent a certain nation from becoming a strong power, and that is why national governments often changed their alliances to maintain their balance.
The Spanish heirloom war was the first war at the center of which there was a balance of power.
This was an important milestone because European powers were no longer on a religious basis, so the thirty-year war is the last religious war.
The church of Artemis was destroyed in Ephesus on July 21, 356 B.C.E. due to the fire of Herostratus.
According to the story, the purpose was to make a reputation at any price. The depressed Ephesians banned mentioning the name of Herostrothus.
The Greek historian, Stabo, later recorded the name, and so we learned about it, the church was destroyed on the same night when Alexander the Great was born.
As King Alexander the Great offered to pay for the reconstruction of the temple, but this was rejected. Later, after his death, in 323 B.C.E., the church was rebuilt.

The civilization in the Indus Valley was a bronze civilization in the northwest of India's subcontinent, which included most of today's Pakistan and some of India's Northwest regions and Afghanistan's Northwest.
Civilization flourished in the pools of the river Indus, where its name came from.
While some scientists think that civilization existed in the areas of the river Sarasvati, which has already been dehydrated, it should be called Indus-Sarasvati civilization, while others would be called the first area of digging in the 1920s as a civilization in Harappa.
The militarist of the Roman Empire has helped to develop medical science.
The doctors began to apply Emperor Augustus, and even he was the one who created the first Roman medical body to treat the aftermath of the battles.
The surgeons knew different tranquilizers, including morphine from the mags of the mags of the mags of the mags.
In amputation, patients were experienced to protect patients from suppression, towers and arterial obstructions in order to promote blood flow.
The Roman Empire has achieved significant results in the field of medical science over the centuries and has developed a large part of our knowledge today.

In children, awareness of different species and species stereotypes develops at a fairly young age, and these racial stereotypes influence their behaviour.
For example, children who are identical to a race minority associated with stereotypes that do not perform well at school when they know the stereotype of their minority, tend to do well at school.
MySpace is the third most popular U.S. website and is currently 54 million profiles.
These websites have been given great attention, especially in the field of education.
These websites also have positive aspects such as the easy to create class websites that include blogs, videos, photographs and other features.
The site is easy to access, only a web address should be given, which makes it easier for students to use the spelling or keyboard.

It's not a study disorder, it's a study disorder; it's “to affect 3-5 percent of children, almost 2 million children in America”.
Children in ADD are difficult to focus on things such as schoolwork, but they are able to listen to fun things, such as playing, watching favorite cartoons, or writing non-concentration phrases.
These children often get into trouble because to stimulate their brains, they “behave risky, fight and rebel against authority,” because their brains cannot be stimulated with normal methods.
ADHD affects relationships with its partners because other children do not understand why they are acting in such a way or why their degrees are different.
Since the skills of knowledge and learning have changed as described above, the speed of knowledge has also changed.
The approach to obtaining information was different. The focus was no longer on remembering the individual memories, but on the ability to respond to the text.
Overall, renaissance has made significant changes in the approach to learning and dissemination.
Unlike other mammals, man-made people are no longer using their hands in the process of changing the place, carrying the load, or floating between the trees.
The hand and legs of the chimp are similar size and length, reflecting the load function of the hand during the walk on the wrist.
The human hand is shorter than the leg, with even more finger minutes.
The two to three million years of fossil bones reveal changes in the specialisation of the hand from movement to manipulation.
Some believe that conscious dreaming, often artificially induced, can be extremely burdensome.
The main reason for this phenomenon is the prolongation of pure dreams between REM conditions.
The rhythm of the REM cycle at night (a condition when we actually sleep and our body regenerate) may become increasingly problematic.
It's as exhausting as you wake up on TV every 20 or 30 minutes.
The effect depends on how many times the brain is trying to sleep consciously at night.
From the beginning, things were almost wrong for the Italians in North Africa. In one week, the Italian war message of 10 June 1940 took over the Fort Capuzzo in Libya.

They're driving the sport on grass, killing the grass around the hole shorter, and they call it green.
Supposedly, the most common type of tourism that most people associate with travel: leisure tourism.
For example, when people go to a place different from their usual everyday lifestyles to relax and entertain.
Beaches, cheer parks and tents are places that leisure tourists visit most of the time.
If the aim of visiting a particular place is to learn about his history and culture, this type of tourism is called cultural tourism.
Tourists may visit the various advisors of a given country or decide to focus on a single area.
Seeing this activity, colonists also called for reinforcements.
John Stark and Colonel James Reed led Colonels 1 and 2 to New Hampshire (they both became generals).
Stark's men took their jobs along the fence north of the colonists.
When the low waterfall opened a gap along the river Mystic along the northwest of the peninsula, the fence was rapidly extended to the north to end it on a small beach.
Gridley or Stark put a watch from the fence to about 100 feet (30 meters) and ordered no one to fire until the soldier left.
The American plan was based on a coordinated attack in three different directions.
General John Cadwalder is launching a distractive attack on the British Army in Bordentown to block the path of any reinforcements.
General James Ewing would cross 700 civilians across the river at Trenton Ferry, occupied the bridge over Assunpink Creek, preventing enemy forces from running.
The main attack force of 2400 people would pass through the river, from Trenton to nine miles away will be divided into two groups: one under Greene, the other under Sullivan's command, to take an attack before dawn.
When running, if someone has become half-mile from a quarter to a half-mile distance, then the speed will be less important, but endurance will become necessary.
Of course, a first class, a half-meter, a man running in two minutes must have an appropriate speed, but it must definitely improve its stamina.
The best preparation for the running season is a small field run in winter and the exercise of the upper body.
Good nutrition alone does not assume excellent performance, but it can significantly influence the overall well-being of young athletes.
Maintaining healthy energy finances, understanding the various aspects of effective hydrating practices and supplementary diet can help to improve the performance of athletes and improve the enjoyment of sports.
The middle run is a relatively cheap sport, but there is a few mistakes about some of the parts of the equipment needed for gymnastics.
Products can be purchased if necessary, but most have little or no real effect on performance.
Athletes may feel that they prefer a product even if it does not provide real benefits.
The atom is considered to be one of the basic elements that make up all the substances.
This is a very complex unit that, according to the simplified Bohr model, consists of a central cell seed and its surrounding electrons, similar to the way planets circulate around the sun - see Figure 1.1
The nuclear seed consists of two types of elementary particles: protons and neutrons.
Protons have a positive electrical charge while neutrons don't have a charge.
Before investigating the victim, you should first assess the location in order to ensure your safety.
When approaching, you must observe the situation of the victim and any warning signal.
If you're injured when you're trying to help, it's just making things worse.
The study found that depression, fear and vision have been involved in the relationship between pain and disability in patients with dermal pain.
Weekly systematic exercises have only affected the effects of increased pain, not depressed and fear.
Participants in regular activities needed more support for the negative understanding of pain from the discomfort of chronic pain due to normal physical movement.
Sensation or visibility depends on visual system sensors or eyes.
There are different types of structured eyes, with variable complexity, depending on the needs of the body.
The different structures are equipped with different capabilities, sensitive to different wavelengths and sharpness, increasing their input perception requires a different processing mode and a different number for optimum operation.
A collection of organisms of a particular species of the population is a specific geographical area.
If a certain phenotype of each member of a population matchs, we call them monomorphs.
It is called polymorph when individuals show more versions of a particular property.
The colonies of the wandering sound are stretching and nesting at different stages.
At the nomad stage, the soldiers are marching at night and beating camp in the daylight.
The colony enters a nomad phase when the quantity of food available drops. In this section, the colony produces temporary nests that are replaced every day.
Each of these nomadic stunts and marches lasts for about 17 days.
"What's the cell? The cell word comes from the Latin "cell", which means "small room", and the first one was introduced by a laboratory investigating the structure of the paraph."
The cell is the basic unit of living things, and all organisms are composed of one or more cells.
The cells are extremely fundamental and important in the study of life, and many refer to them as “builders of life. ”

Elements and compounds can be converted from one condition to another without changing.
The properties of nitrogen gas are the same as liquid nitrogen, density in liquid state, but molecules are the same.
Water is another example, the aquatic compound consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
Its molecular structure is the same, be a gas lining, liquid or solid.
Although his physical condition may change, his chemistry will remain the same.
Time is around us, it affects everything we do, but it's hard to understand.

Concentrating thinking patterns are problem-solving techniques that combine different ideas or areas in order to solve them.
The focus of this approach is speed, logic and accuracy, and the identification of facts, the re-use of existing techniques and the collection of information.
The most important factor in this thinking is that there is only one right answer. You can only think of two answers, right and wrong.
This type of thinking relates to certain sciences or routine procedures.
Humans in such a way think logically, can identify samples, solve problems, and work on scientific tests.
Man is far from reading the thoughts of the most capable species.

At this resonance level, the magnetic field and radio waves make the atoms release of small radio signals.
In 1970, Raymond Damadian’s doctor and researcher discovered the basis for the use of magnetic resonance imaging as a medical diagnostic tool.
Four years later, a patent was issued which was issued in the first area of the world of MRI.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the construction of the first "full body" MRI device called "Retardless".
