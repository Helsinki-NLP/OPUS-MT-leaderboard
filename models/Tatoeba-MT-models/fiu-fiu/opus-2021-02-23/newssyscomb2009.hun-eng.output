The victory of right-wing populists in Austria, with a total of 29 percent
The two parties of the great coalition so far have felt a deterioration and a significant increase in the populationist parties on the right hand, according to the first preliminary results, the Austrian pre-initiative parliamentary elections on Sunday.
The Austrian People's Party (EPP), where the position of the current President, Wilhelm Molterer, was seriously affected, in particular, by a strong loss.
On the other hand, the President of the Association for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the Head of the Province of Karintia, Jörg Haider, is preparing to return to national politics.
On the basis of the preliminary results, the strongest party in the country remains the Social Democrat Party (SPÖ) with 29.8% of the votes, while compared to the latest elections in 2006, it lost 5.5% of the votes.
Even worse has been the EVP, which loses almost nine percent of the votes by 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results that have been achieved in the history of the after-war of Austria, and in particular the results are literally catastrophic in the People's Party of Preventions.
At the beginning of July, when the EVP coalition was removed, the population party had a significant advantage before SPÖ according to public opinion research.
However, the electorates seem to have been punished for letting the government fail.
In the first responses to the results, speculations have already been expressed about the possible cancellation of the party and the current alkancellor.
Observers believe that this can take place on Monday at the extraordinary part-session of the party.
This development would probably make it easier to re-establish the election result, i.e. the re-establishment of the SPÖ and the ÖVP large coalition.
Given the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ) in advance, 18% of the votes and 11% of the votes received by the BZÖ - the Social Democrats were also afraid of the recurrence of the year 1999 when the People's Party agreed to jointly with the populists (the FPÖ was still united in time, the BZÖ in 2005), which also imposed sanctions from the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he is willing to cooperate with any party, and I assume he can return to Vienna into national politics, obviously counts on this solution.
The Green Party, which, however, lost some of its popularity, has reached Parliament and has fallen from the third place to the fifth part of the Austrian political parties.
None of the other parties have crossed the four hundred-dollar border and failed to reach Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: You can cool out Indian relations
If it were not possible to solve the problem of the Czech scientists who were unlawful to collect bugs, the Czech Minister of Foreign Affairs Karel Schwarzenberg said that the Czech-India relations could be somewhat obsolete.
This is what the minister published in New York after meeting with Pranáb Mukherji, his Indian partner today.
"If this were not solved, yes, it would be a certain obsolete," stated after the meeting that took place from the Czech incentive.
After the trial, Mukherji told me that the executive power could be difficult to intervene in court cases.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, which has been released and sentenced by fine, the central government may negotiate with the local leadership of Darjeelingi, which is part of the case.
"He could solve his problem," the minister said.
The three years of prison for Emil Kučera, however, according to Mukherdzsi, it would be best to appeal to the Supreme Court.
Then you could apply for an immunity against a bail and wait freely for a judgment, explaining it.
Schwarzenberg proved that his partner expressed himself similarly during the trial.
"He proposed an appeal to the Supreme Court, then it would be possible to save him," said the chief of Czech diplomacy.
The only way to intervene in the whole case is the Czech party, the convicted "competent legal support", mentioned by the Indian Minister.
At the same time, she told me that the Indian party already provided such help.
"We have a major interest in maintaining the best relationships with India with many years of tradition.
This is also acknowledged by the Indians," said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, as he has told the ČTK, his partner emphasised that the Czech Republic is of great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We find it a serious mistake in imprisonment and prosecution of these Czech scientists," he declared.
To the question whether the Indian party promised to deal with the case, the minister avoided the answer.
"A relatively many promises," he noted.
Czech judges in the fight for the seabed
He enters the wall electronic map on which Australia and neighbouring marine areas can be seen.
But he doesn't care about the land, but it's a point that disappears in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and its neighbouring seabed.
During the area as much as the continent itself, says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to a 30-member working group on matters of the United Nations Division's ocean and maritime law.
Chief Václav Mikulka, Czech attorney, director of the division, monitors the explanation that sometimes supplements.
Working activity and enthusiasm are dominated here.
The bottom of the sea is rich in natural resources, a world that is barely known so far.
It is also available to petroleum, melt and other minerals, but also to date unknown living organisms, which could be the key to developing anti-cancer medicine.
Sea bases greater than dry land
Coastal states today are intensively proposing for areas under the new sea.
Under the United Nations Convention, they have their rights, which were agreed in 1982 in the Jamaican Montego Bay.
It is primarily the so-called continental site, which often reaches even a few hundred kilometres from the coasts of that country.
In accordance with the Convention, such a country has exclusive rights for all sources of the continental tale.
"Simplified, we hold the part of the continental surface of the seabed and the underground layer, which is the natural continuation of the under sea.
On the coastal sea borders, often over 200 sea miles, is beyond the exclusive economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The application submitted by the country concerned to the Commission designating the external borders of the Continental Platform shall be accompanied by a number of extensive scientific and technical documentation based on costly research and measurements.
This is the result of many annual preparatory work.
"Our task is legal and technical assistance to the Committee.
The Committee has so far discussed five applications: Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far only the last three countries mentioned have succeeded," adds Mikulka.
Recently, Australia's success in the world has echoed, which has first substantially expanded its underwater country.
But New Zealand has also won - the area of the seabed judged by the Committee is about 1.6 million square kilometres, i.e. six times larger in the territory of the country.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in research.
The profits from the future use of the seabed are hoped to be invaluable.
Other countries continue to submit their applications.
They can do this within ten years of ratification from the moment the "Montego Bay Convention" was ratified.
Where the continental tabernacle ends, the Convention begins with the ocean bottom area declared the common heritage of humanity.
There's no country here that has a unique situation.
The right to extraction in this area shall be issued by the international institution established by the Convention.
"The bottom of the sea, however, is not Klondike," says overwhelming the Director Mikulka by saying that "one of its territories are legally clearly surrounded and their regime is established in the contract."
Czechs in the Pacific
A part of the seabed is now also the Czech Republic.
This former east block is divided into other countries within the common "Interoceanmetal" organization.
In 1991, this organisation has received the status of the so-called "travel investor" in line with investors in some other countries.
You are entitled to produce ClarionClipperton in the Pacific Zone between Mexico, the Hawaii Islands and Kiribati.
The area examined by the investor is somewhat bigger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom of the sea is a copy of the Tatra under sea.
"A total of 75 000 square kilometres can be grown.
The area is a rich shooting place of polymethane, containing nickel, resin, cobalt and manganese," mentions another lawyer, Hindu Pakshi Rajan.
Rober Sandev, a member of the department Macedon, presents another example of a concert.
It reminds me of a potato or a little fantasy of the pergamen with the magic songs of Golem.
German special forces were present in the hostage liberation
The Egyptian government asked Germany for help in solving the hostage crisis - and the specialists came.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready, but they were not engaged.
The release of the 11 European tourists abducted in Egypt is becoming more and more detailed.
According to the data of the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Home Affairs, indirect German special forces have been involved in the rescue operation.
Accordingly, in addition to the German Federal Army specialists, GSG 9, the German Federal Police Air Force and the employees of the Federal Crime Office and the logistics experts of the German Technical Service were at the location of the release.
According to Monday night's information from the Ministry of Speakers, however, German forces were not required because hostages allowed their prisoners to run and then escaped when they recognized the signs of violent hostage rescue.
The Egyptian Government accepted the aid offered by Germany to involve it as a local support force.
"Fortunately, it was not the case," said the spokesman of the Federal Ministry of Interior.
The attackers of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian women and eight tourist groups of their Egyptian escorts were kidnapped on 19 September in the south of Egypt.
After the kidnapping of the desert in South Egypt, the hostages were dragged into the border areas of Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostages has remained unclarified until now, as well as the details of the release of the hostages or possible ransom payments.
In the meantime, the escaped arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the liberated hostages are under the protection of the German embassy.
He didn't say anything about the details of the release.
For the time being, no information has been provided in Berlin about the return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, five tourists and special forces arrive in Germany on Tuesday at the German Air Air Haderók Airbus plane.
The U.S. Assembly rejects the rescue package.
The U.S. Congress subcongress has failed with a small majority the 700 billion dollar rescue package for money markets.
The Dow Jones fell deep.
The U.S. Parliament rejected the government's rescue package by 227 votes not 206 against the financial markets.
Despite the calls from the American President George W. Bush and the leading politicians of both parties, there was no majority of the programme to control the chaos in the financial markets.
The supporters desperately attempted to convince the critics of the need for a $700 billion package in a dramatic action.
Barney Frank, he called on Members to support one of the negotiating leaders of the Democrat Party, even if the plan is still unpopular.
"We're looking to get political support to avoid something that hasn't been done" he acknowledged.
Dow Jones fell by more than 6 percent and 600 points during the vote.
The investors were concerned that the State rescue package could fail.
The index rose shortly before the end of the vote so that it would fall again after the failure to make public.
Experts account for further serious turbulences in international financial markets.
In order to enter into force of the programme, both the Parliament and the Senate should be approved.
The directors register more and more bookings.
It's a good winter for German travellers.
According to a study, the turnover of road reservations for the next months has increased significantly compared to the previous year - by more than 30 percent of the winter season.
Despite the weak conjunctural prospects, the Germans' travel enthusiasm is not in the study.
In the winter season reservations, travel agencies booked a 31 percent increase in traffic compared to the previous year's period, as described on Monday in Berlin by the German Travel Association (DRV).
According to the GfK Market Research Institute, the number of reservations for autumn months is higher.
The traffic of travel offices in October was 11 per cent higher than October 2007, reported by the DRV.
These results are based on GfK's data, which assesses the monthly booking data of 1200 German travel agency and then extrapolates it to the whole market.
The Institute took into account the travels booked until the end of August 2008.
Because of the weak dollar price, especially travels to the USA were searched - reported by the DRV.
Here the bookings increased by one third on wheels.
The Germans are particularly popular destinations, including Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as domestic landscapes.
Mostly organized roads were searched - said Klaus Laepple, President of the DRV.
As a result of increasing energy and food costs, the costs of the routes organised "for passengers can be estimated better than for individually organised journeys."
Passengers can save money with reservation discounts or all inclusive offers - added Laepple.
The booking rate of summer months was also very good, so it will be possible to book again traffic increases compared to the previous year - although another study indicates that less German tourists travelled compared to the previous year.
My first Oktober painting
Recurrent ballermann hitters, lithium beer and fashion dirndals.
Wiesnen's debuting.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I are not much like each other.
He's a blonde, TV leader, and he's wearing a sized dirndlit.
My hair is dark, I'm a student girl, and I bought my clothes in the turkey.
One thing, however, connects us: We're only three minutes away from Wiesnen, we're already run by photographers and downloading their memory cards - very flattering, and this is all on my first visit to Wiesnen.
That's how we can make friends.
Looks like the cheap dirndli is enough for your purpose.
As a Wiesn tourist from the white sausage to the north of the equilibrium, my comfort is still bound by the crowd.
But when you arrive at Theresienwies, it's not that bad.
Almost everyone wears dirndals or leather pants; no one is looking back or awkward - everything's all right.
Strange looks at the chocolatebanan stand are all my dirndli bonds.
A Munich woman draws my attention that I've made the affinity wrong: "You're free, you're in the middle of a virgin, you're on the right, you're in the back."
I'm secretly stabbing the mass from behind to left.
"That's good," say and laugh.
Others have fewer pressures around fine flirting techniques, and they wear a simple prick sheet with "I'm too drunk to dress up" signing, and they're unquestionably showing their naked back.
The young man who showed exhibits is called Bob, and he also visited Oktoberfest for the first time.
What you find is fantastic, long-standing with "aaaaa".
He tells me all of this after he got rid of the contents of his earlier drinking whisper.
Right next to one of the strikes that everyone looks like garbage.
So Bob's one of the most famous urinators.
Others aren't so lucky to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Eight o'clock at night, the ambulances go to the scene and take care of the poor couples.
Patient caregivers always appear in a team - at the same time, four carries a covert barrel from tent to tent.
This works like most Wiesn visitors: Arrival empty, leaving is packed.
Who's lying in the alcohol coffin under the barn doesn't look like it.
"These are those who are fully ready", shouting to me one of the sanitates for my question and then in the spinner.
The police have named the victim of the accident.
The police named the 63-year-old lady who was hit by a vehicle in Essex County and the hospital.
The resident of Brentwood, Chelmsford Road, Carole Paulson, had an accident at Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon, in the city.
He was transported to a hospital called the Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later he died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested suspected of uncanny driving.
He's been released against a bail.
Turkey’s broad diplomatic horizon
Before Turkey had intended to join the European Union, European powers were burned from the desire to deepen their entry into the Turkish back country.
On the eastern side of Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps from the European border, one of the greatest relics of the failed empire.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the neorenesan style.
That's what the travel books say.
The building is surrounded by the end of the perons, a torony at each front corner, and it looks like a German rural townhouse.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building's a little overwhelming.
However, in view of the inside of the store booklet, it is clear how big a business it had the most Western gates.
The station was opened by the German Consortium, Anatolia-Bagdad Corporation in August 1908.
Germany, the "short future" of the conquerors through this Damascus Bagdad to today's railway to Saudi Arabia, wanted to achieve its ambitions to take the Middle East.
The German tribes of conquer have collapsed during World War I.
His railway lines were attacked by the Arabian Lawrence and Arab parties.
Relative isolation from the surrounding regions caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War have disappeared.
The British Colombian Army has withdrawn from Egypt and has squeezed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
The Hyderpasha station wasn't so good.
In 1917, a shooting train exploded and destroyed the well-developed roof of the building.
According to Turkish sources, there was a sabotage operation.
He's been ruined slowly since then, and his history has gone a long way beyond.
However, today, as the train gates to Analytic and the entire Eastern region, at least symbolically, serve as a diplomatic horizon in Turkey.
The Party of Justice and Development in the Government - the ACP - has developed a completely new foreign policy for the country.
Relative isolation from the surrounding regions caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War have disappeared.
The new policy is a metal sign of commitment.
It is noteworthy that the Turkish government maintains good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian groups of Hamas and Fatah, Iraq, Iran, and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
I wanted to measure the parameters of the new foreign policy, so I went to the capital of Turkey, the night train in Ankara, to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the ACP, the Turkish parliamentary representative, Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, after about ten and a half hours of glimpse, the famous documentary on the old world, the "The Night Mail" rhythm, I arrived in the capital of Turkey. The new city is designed to be a symbol of the new world state, which turns back to the past there.
However, ACP is a paradigm change with well-known Islam roots in the Turkish consensus.
That was some suspicion in the West, especially in Washington.
I went with a taxi to the ACP headquarters, an ultra-modern, stone and steel, expressly designed for this purpose, which is in a developing suburban district, between half-cleaning shopping centres and coffee houses. In the latter, they meet the suited middle leaders - both men and women - that they do business early in the morning.
Suat Kiniklioglu would have introduced you to a better-centred politician in any other European country.
He wore a dress, a tie, and I'm sure he had a Blackberry.
"The political objective of the party is to help Turkey reintegrate into the direct environment.
The Cold War has ruined the order," he said.
Turkey is isolated from its back country.
He had to turn east and west at the same time today.
He couldn't choose one of the two.
He had to open both directions.
"But it's possible that you have a choice sooner or later?" I asked.
"Turkey never wanted to reach a response."
He then stressed what almost everyone I was talking to here, and it was almost machine-made: Turkey, not only the Middle East, but also the relations with the countries around the Caucasus and the Black Sea, serve the same advantage for Europe and the United States as you for Turkey.
It is like they want to send a message that, in a transposed sense, Turkey and Turkey, the whole of Europe will be able to reach Asia and the Middle East on those roads to the east.
When I was back at the Hydarpasha station, after another night, mostly awake, I thought of Herr Ritter and Herr Conura, the two German gentlemans who saw the recovery of this decorative building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised if they found out that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East are now mostly in Turkey's hands.
And as soon as I was waiting for the ferry to take you back to Bosporus, I remember that at that time Turkey was called "European sick man".
At that time, at least it was no question which part of the land should be required for this fascinating country.
Memorial lifestyles: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes like this: since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley, as music director of Guildford, led the Guildford Philharmonic Zenekart and Chorus.
On the basis of his musical plans for the part of the city, Proteus founded his wonderful youth choir next year.
Ordinarily, only 21-year-olds could have joined the singer, but when Proteus sang his final in 1979, many of us had been in the end of our 20 years, we simply refused to buy the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the name of the mythological transformer) was consistent with the choir's determination and ability to cope with any kott they put before - be a piece of the madriga or a Messiah; without a kísért, or with an ambassador.
The musical diversity of such a young chorus was often astonishing and always exciting, and we were grateful to the man whose enthusiasm for music remained unchanged over the years.
How often Tod told us, "Let's leave the music alone."
He always said, "The composer knows what he wants.
Everything's in the bag.
So sing it!"
Your conductor technique was always completely understandable and accurate, but never dictatoric or exaggerating.
Whatever the music level was, he always raised it.
John Frayn Turner wrote about it:
If he ever lived a rider who was supposed to be a knight, Vernon Handley was.
I knew him well in the two decades during which he led the Guildford Philharmonics from 1962 to 1982.
In the last 40 years, I wrote criticism about more than 100 concerts, but never, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Tod Handley had the size and the modesty, which is very rare.
He hated those drivers who, living with his words, simply "was glopped with one or two well-known battlers all over the world."
Many of us will miss it.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
According to William Woodruff (September 25), "He continued his economic history studies in Oxford in 1966, and in 1950 he became the scholarship of the Houblon-Norman Research Institute... while he continued to complete his basic diploma, master's degree and PhD title."
This is from the copyright notes of Woodruff's "Beyond Nab End", but it's wrong.
From 1946 to 1953, the economic history of the Nottingham University was trained, and during the leadership of Professor J. D. Chambers completed PhD's dissertation of the British rubber industry, which was then issued in 1958.
In 1950-51 he was actually staying in the United States with a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and in the summer of 1952 at the University of Illinois, New York and Harvard.
In 1953 he left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
You can't know why Woodruff was making up this time of his career.
J. Vicente Resino on the Branch
I recommend the exhibition "J. Vicente Resino "Flamenco and Life
The simplicity and strength of them, as well as the respect of the people in the photographs, have attracted my attention.
This exhibition can be done by emotions.
Resino was able to bring down the magical moments."
Second sale record at Honda
In November, the Honda begins to distribute the second-generation Jazz.
It is true that it has already been quite large for its predecessor, but the development of the new model in their internal fields is even more extensive.
All of this is paralleled with a refined mechanism, which makes driving more comfortable and increases fuel savings.
Evolution versus revolution.
That's how the second-generation Honda Jazz looks.
Although it was very similar to your predecessor in the sight of the new Jazz, a number of internal changes have been made.
These include, for example, innovative design, new arm series, larger sizes and new mechanisms.
But before we change to the detailed description of the new model, we have to say that the new Jazz appeared six years after the first generation was put on the market.
So, first of all, we can say that Honda has managed to renew this model in a shorter time than other producers.
In Europe, Jazz decides sales records less known, but on other markets.
Such a market, for example, in Japan, where Jazz was the most sought car mill in 2002 and this year in 2008.
For example, in Japan, nearly a million pieces of Jazz have been sold on the market since they were placed on the market.
The second market was the Old Continent with almost half a million copies sold in six years.
However, Honda and the new Jazz would like to continue to increase traffic in the region.
Thus, while the Japanese company marketed 83.000 Jazz in 2007, the estimates target the sale of 100,000 cars by 2009, leading to a 17% increase in the European market.
Honda has sold 8000 Jazzt on the Spanish market since 2002, representing 6.7% of the total turnover of Honda in Spain.
In the case of a new generation, the Spanish subsidiary’s leaders are estimated to be 2000 copies sold over a year.
In fact, the arrival of the new Jazz will greatly mitigate the decline in the turnover of Honda in Spain.
As representatives of the company predict 22,000 copies sold by the end of this year, which represents 4,000 lower than the 2007 data, i.e. 16% reduction.
Despite the conditions for sale, Honda increased its market share in Spain, which increased to 1.8% last year.
I would also like to increase this rate by 2% by 2010.
The Honda hopes that this can be achieved by introducing a new model.
This would be the Insight, a five-door and compact - 4370 mm long - hybrid, of which the Japanese company would sell 200,000 pieces a year in the world.
According to the Japanese producer, 50% of Insight's market share would be eliminated by the United States, while the remaining proportion would be divided between the old continent and Japan.
Insight trade takes place after the official valence presentation scheduled for January, which is due in the first months of the year.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has become wider in all respects.
The length is reached at 3900 mm (five inches longer), the width is 1690 mm (two inches wider) and the axle distance has increased by 5 cm, i.e. 2500 mm.
On the contrary, the height is unchanged 1520 mm.
In addition to the sizes, the passenger space has become wider.
On the one hand, the larger internal space is guaranteed by the new arm series, on the other hand by the medium fuel tank - this solution is already known from the previous Jazz.
In addition, the full warehouse of the so-called double floor container, which is currently 399 litres, is above the capacity of the first generation by 19 litres.
However, this includes that these sizes apply to the engine type 1,4, as Honda Jazz's trunk of 1.2 is 379 litres.
Some external modifications can also be detected, such as the rear laminated lamps or the selectable panorama glass ceiling and the easier accessibility of the rear seats.
In addition, the opening angle of the doors belonging to the rear seats was increased to 80 degrees, in contrast with the first opening angle of Jazz at 67 degrees.
The second-generation Jazz engines are new.
At the start of its use, this small model can be ordered with two, 1,2 and 1.4 litres of engines.
Thanks to i-VTEC technology, consumption of both resources is more favourable than its previous model and is characterised by low carbon emissions and excellent mechanical coherence, while the engine has high power in all respects.
The power of 1.2 litres is 90 horsepower at 6000 speeds and the maximum torque at 114 Nm 4900 turns.
This engine - which was 78 horsepower in the previous Jazz - consumes 5.3 litres and CO2 emissions 125 grams.
And the other engine, which produced 83 horsepowers in the previous generation, now reaches 100 horsepower.
Jazz 100 horsepower 1.4 consumes on average 5.4 litres and is 128 grams of CO2.
The collision avoidor's "memocar"
To develop accident-prevention technologies, Nissan has this time inspired a new invention of nature, quite precisely from the bees' world.
The Japanese company designed a robot that avoids accidents following the bees.
The device called Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C may be the first step to develop anti-coupling technologies.
The engineers of the Nissan Motor Co. Development Technology Centre were built in Japan in cooperation with the Developmental Science and Technology Research Centre of the University of Tokyo.
According to Kazuhhiro Doi, the Director-General for Technology PRI and Research Development, the BR23C constitutes an extension of the Nissan four-level safety bucket.
The robot makes the company's products more complete.
During the flight, all bees create their oval-shaped personal space, which is very similar to the Nissan safety bucket.
However, the role of the womb is much more important than that of its complex eyes, where it sees more than 300 degrees in each direction. Consequently, the womb can fly smoothly in its own personal territory.
To copy the complex eye function, engineers designed a so-called laser telemeter (Laser Range Finder).
The instrument identifies the obstacles within a 180-degree vision space before BR23C, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the onboard microprocessor, which is immediately transformed into an operation to avoid impact.
"As soon as the barrier occurs, the small robot will immediately change the direction of the movement of the bee by moving the wheels in a smaller or larger angle to avoid impact.
The system is most distinguished from the instruments currently available, that the avoiding manoeuvre is fully automatic in this case.
If not, the robot would not respond fast enough to avoid obstacles", explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the project chief engineer.
By way of derogation from the bees, the avoidable manoeuvre shall not be directed upwards or downwards and shall not move throughwards, only in two dimensions and only in the direction of wheel reversibility, i.e. not infinitely and in the manner as is done in the case of bees.
That is why Nissan used a rotation function in the robot outside the acceleration and slowing process to avoid impacts.
"This structure must process the data only for a few seconds and respond to them.
There is no need to store data or intuitive logic based on previous manoeuvres, so it can operate without interruption with only a few dozen CB memory.
It may sound surprising, but it's not really a gigabyte, but we're not even talking about megabyte size memory.
This is the first step to develop a technology for immediate impact prevention, which can be involved in serial cars within 10 years according to Nissan estimates.
The robot operates with lithium polymer accumulators that are easier and more durable than the lithium ion version.
In the future, the unit may be equipped with the GPS satellite navigation system to bring the car to the end by avoiding obstacles on the road.
Fear of mortgage
We have to admit that the U.S. Treasury department has a lot of cash that can be invested in, and there is no sense at all.
Since the crisis is in their necks and that the Americans do not question the issue of the 'Bad Credit Hotel', they created a fun and informative online game.
It's the "Ross Credit Hotel"... that's for the galaxies.
The accommodation and, above all, the portrayal of the reception bulldog suggests that we consider once again, twice, or even three times, whether the borrowing time has actually come.
And especially where we need credit, as this is probably the purpose of the matter.
The information available on the website is really useful, but little detailed.
It's more for teenagers than for the general public.
But what would happen if we supplemented the game?
For example, the hotel would show up in our dream room.
Actually, it's something, because we're not dreaming about buying the apartment...
Morgan Stanley opens his capital to MUFG.
Morgan Stanley announced that he had a share in his capital to Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG). The largest Japanese bank will pay $9 billion for 21% of the company's capital after the price of Morgan Stanley's shares fell on the stock market.
One week after the preliminary agreement was published, the two banks said that MUFG was buying 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's stock shares at a unit price of $25.25, i.e. a total of $3 billion.
The accepted price shall be more than 19% of the book value of securities on 31 August.
MUFG invests an additional $6 billion in buying convertible securities that provide 10% return and their exchange rate is $31.25.
According to Morgan Stanley, when implementing the global transaction, the average exchange rate of $29 is based, which is 28% higher than the current rate.
However, Morgan Stanley's stock exchange rate fell around 17:00 a.m. at 6.79% and closed at $23.07.
"This strategic alliance offers Morgan Stanley a great opportunity to accelerate its transformation into a bankholding company", explains John Mack, director of the US Company Group.
Morgan Stanley has approved the new status last week that can diversify its activities, but the Federal Reserve is under control.
The agreement with MUFG reaffirms that the current financial crisis requires even more caution from the company's years recorded on Wall Street.
The conditions notified on Monday show that the agreement has been amended in recent days: last Monday Morgan only announced that his share 20% was sold to the Japanese company for about $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, we still thought that the share was going to be a whole stock stock", explained Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of MUFG in Tokyo.
"But because of the current market and economic situation, we wanted to minimise and protect potential risks."
In view of the weighted average price, MUFG pays 7% more than the book value for Morgan Stanley shares.
As a result of the transaction, the yield for one share will fall by approximately 20%.
Under the agreement, MUFG may change half of its priority shares into stock shares in one year if the trading rate of the latter exceeds the conversion rate by more than 50% over a specified period, i.e. around $47.
Morgan Stanley will thus ensure that it is possible to use its investment opportunities, improve its balance sheet and increase its liquid resources through MAFG funds.
However, the group spokesperson did not wish to provide accurate information on the two new allies’ strategic plans.
After MUFG has been merged, Morgan Stanley is expected to increase its Tier I solvency rate by about 15%, which will be one of the best in its own sector.
Morgan said that his balance was "definitely" improved since the end of August.
For the last few weeks, the group has been facing a great challenge, as its shares have fallen to half, until the cost of insurance against non-payment risk has escaped into the sky.
This cost was moderate on Monday, but remained high at around 12%.
One of the large investor banks left the bank's bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the buy-in of Merrill Lynch. This is Goldman Sachs, who announced last week that he got 15 billion dollars: some of them came from the company group of Warren Buffet from Berkshire Hathaway.
Monday statement of Rafael Correa, Quito
Reconstruction of the Republic in the spirit of socialism in the 21st century.
This is a common plan for Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadori Rafael Correa.
Following the sample of his presidents and his friends, Correa explained his ideas about the new constitution on Sunday.
He successfully completed his mission, since 64% of the voters voted yes according to the official results of 80% of the votes.
According to this, 28% of the population voted with gender, 7% of the votes were invalid, while 0.7% of them were unfulfilled.
The draft Constitution was adopted by 50% + 1 votes.
On Sunday, both two surveys carried out at the exit of voting offices and the accounts carried out by an NGO have proven the enormous overwhelming of "yes" votes with 63% and 70%.
By the way, Rafael Correa was talking about the victory of his draft constitution on Sunday to Monday night.
"The constitution has acquired a devastating victory", and thanks to the ecuadorians in Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest from Quito, the governor's headquarters.
As the public knew, Rafael Correa congratulated Chávez, Morales and the Chairman of Chile, Michelle Bachelet.
According to the report of the United States Observatory (OAS)'s report, the vote was in a calm atmosphere, the main topic was a 444 specific text combining the principles of "new socialism" protected by the President.
The proposed constitution sets state power into the service of the economy and maintains the right to "development planning" for a country that is essentially living from oil extraction by foreign companies and from foreign exchanges by migrants.
The draft Constitution of Correa elected in 2006 will also strengthen the powers of the Head of State who may obtain mandates for up to two consecutive periods and have the right to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he intends to live with this opportunity and will compete again in February 2009.
By the way, the Constitution has also included free health services and education, and the President has already begun to introduce it in a country with 13.9 million inhabitants and half the population lives under the minimum of life.
Finally, the Constitution prohibits the presence of foreign troops in the country, which could end the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of an Ecuador facility for anti-drug measures in the US.
They released 19 hostages in Chad
Egyptian commander hit him on kidnappers who have taken a hostage of 11 tourists and eight of their escorts ten days ago.
The hostages are in Cairo now.
The eleven European tourists and eight Egyptian escorts were held in the desert for ten days from which they were shipped in the capital of Egypt on Monday afternoon.
The hostages were released by an Egyptian commander in Chad during the morning.
Apparently in good condition, a plane arrived at the Al-Maza Military Base at about half four o’clock on the afternoon, which is directly linked to the Cairo International Airport.
The hostages were banned to report to the press and immediately moved to a hospital in the outskirts of Cairo in Maad, where they were examined.
The hostages are "health", and the kidnappers were "not paid ransom" - said at the airport by the Egyptian tourist minister Zoheir Garanna.
The hostages were imprisoned on September 19th at the foot of the mountain of Ouana in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, where they took part in a field safarin.
In the group there were 11 tourists (five Italian men, five German men and a Romanian women) and eight Egyptian women: two guides, four drivers, one border guard and director of the Aegyptous travel agency organized by the Safarit.
According to an Egyptian security leader, a 30-man special commander arrived on two helicopters, where the hostages were hit directly before the river.
"There was a firefight between the troops. Half the kidnappers were killed, the rest of them escaped," said the leader asking for his name to be silent.
He also told me that a total of 150 persons were sent from the Egyptian Lightning Brigade to Sudan, where they were added to German and Italian commanders.
The Italian diplomatic leader in Belgrade, Franco Frattini, underlined the role of secret agents and special Italian action groups.
"We need to know that this result could not have been achieved without professional and effective intervention of our secret service teams" – she stated without further details.
He also denyed that the hostages would have paid a ransom.
Last day, the Sudanese Army announced that during the patrol arrested a terrain on which the kidnappers traveled, six murdered (including the Chadian leader) and two arrested.
According to the military, the hostages were connected to a Darfur rebel organisation, the Sudanese Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which was immediately disregarded by the organisation concerned.
Lettres - "most of culture"
There is currently a debate on the financing of culture at the heart of newspapers and the election campaign that is currently taking place.
It's all we're happy for.
But they're still forgetting about a part of our cultural life.
Who will raise his word to illustrate the ridiculous amounts of small museums, archives, archaeological digs and national historical monuments on the edge of hunger death?
Which politician dares remind the federal government that he does not care about his monuments and buildings that form part of the cultural heritage?
Or is there no laws in Québec or Canada that really guarantee the effective protection of our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government spent only three and a half million euros to restore the Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
And the constitution of our American neighbours states that the protection of cultural heritage is part of American culture, and that heritage must be protected in a coordinated manner by all citizens, by all elected representatives and by all government bodies.
Within the framework of the Quebec Association of Historical Societys (Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Québec), more than 40 000 volunteers from the company on cultural heritage, correspondence and genealogy are tired of researching history and preserving a large number of private archives and archaeological discoveries with a minimum budget.
Often these organizations protect our heritage with my teeth and protest with the last strength of the drowning, when real estate developers and decision-makers direct their bulldozers to our old buildings and forgotten graveyards.
When will anyone ever stand up to protect historic and cultural heritage?
Adjust some of the Fortis bank to Benelux governments
Benelux countries are involved in partial nationalisation because of the storing effect of the American credit market crisis, as the first European, has been in trouble at the Belgian-Holland bank, Fortison: the three countries support a total of 11.2 billion euros of money and insurance institutions with interest in Hungary.
The Belgian, Luxembourg and the Dutch Government agreed at the highest level at the end of the week, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission responsible for competition.
In the euro area, Fortis is the first major crisis in the waves in the context of the international financial market crisis for more than a year, so decisions on the bank can be classified as precedent in some respects.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states purchase almost half (49%) of the bank's own property there.
The bank will probably sell some of its interests, including, above all, the activities purchased from ABN Amró last year, mainly insurance.
Fortis' shares last week started a steep fall. In the second half of the week, there were serious crises at the Institute.
However, the analysts agree that the Bank's 85 thousand employees are too large to allow them to fail.
The company's papers fell down to a 14-year-old bottom on Friday only by about 12 percent.
Since January, the value of the shares decreased by more than two thirds.
In view of the current share prices, the total market capital value of the group is around EUR 14 billion, but it is not real according to corporate managers.
By the way, company management blamed overseas market uncertainties regarding the adoption of the $700 billion American package plan for the fall of Fortis stocks.
On Monday, the papers have risen slightly.
On Friday, in Filip Dierckx, a new director was appointed to the bank.
The financial institution was also looking for private buyers, but no one has ever made a real offer.
The Belgian government has already indicated that investors do not need to be worried, they do not lose their money.
There has been no panic in the bank's clients so far, the drawers have not been attacked.
In Hungary Fortis has its own branches and has purchased lease companies.
Cucumber in a chicken cow
Life and health insurers in America often refuse to enter into an insurance contract with the applicant on the basis of human drug purchase data.
Data protection professionals fear that the data market will become uncontrolled.
"There is a data protection programme which shall in all cases link the use of prescription data to the consent of the person concerned.
It must be independent in hand, or we'll trust the hencock," quotes Richard Dick, the developer of the programme to follow the prescriptions from Washington Post.
Insurers shall make insurance premiums and the amount of damages dependent on the health status of the applicant client and if they consider the risk too high, they shall not cover it.
In the past, the person was sent for medical examination and the contract was concluded only in the light of the outcome of the investigation.
Dick has found a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: from the pharmacy to the customer's identification number, he easily acquires what kind of drugs he bought for the last half of the year, and the program itself concludes what disease he suffers and what kind of health he has.
For example, if you regularly take a high dose of cholesterol control, it suggests that your blood fat levels are virtually untreated, which are immediately classified as a higher risk category.
There are also several versions of the programme on the market, some also set a risk multiplier number, so the insurance undertaking is barely going to be able to do without paperwork, although small difficulties are encountered.
The detriment is that some medicines can be used for several purposes, such as certain compounds can also be used against migraine or heat waves, which are also effective against depression.
The latter is considered to be a risk-increasing factor for business insurance, not the former.
In order to request and process the data, special companies have developed, and before obtaining the necessary information from the pharmaceuticals, they ask for the patient's contribution.
They are now obligated by the authorities, although they have not been punished for their failure to do so.
Some companies are also working on the results of the laboratory tests and also linked to the pharmaceutical consumption data, so they can provide a more accurate picture of patients' health status.
More and more companies have access to the data, and controlling the use will also become more difficult.
There is a separate health data protection law, but it covers only healthcare providers and insurance providers.
Before the Congress, there is a legislative proposal which also gives the authorities control over companies specialising in reporting.
Dick Richard understands that this is not enough: he has therefore developed its programme, which would involve the transmission of data to its express contribution.
Another question is that the person concerned may not deny the contribution or the insurance undertaking does not conclude a contract with it.
So the chickens are still referring to the goodwill of the fox.

Double-check trade between the European Union and India
As the European Union and India, each other's leading trading partners, the ninth agenda of the summit, in addition to the other, mostly global problems.
Today will also be the French-India summit, where it will be mainly about nuclear cooperation.
However, the European Union recognises that India is a rising democratic power that should be given a greater voice on international issues, but the Member States have not yet reached a common nomination, to support the permanent membership of Newdelhi in the UN Security Council.
This was not the case in Marseille last night and now at the ninth summit.
The French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as the President of the Union, and the President of the Commission of José Manuel Barroso and the High Representative of Foreign Affairs Solana Manmohan Szingh, Indian Prime Minister, agreed to double in five years, i.e. to increase trade turnover to EUR 100 billion.
In view of the increase in trade between 2000 and 2007 from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an ambitious objective.
In this respect, the twenty-six Bilateral Civil Aviation Convention with India, i.e. air traffic, could be wing in the future.
India would like to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised they'd speed up the reconciliation.
The aim is to balance the fact that while the EU's first trading partner in India, Newdelhi is only in the ninth position of its EU partners.
The summit attracted its attention to global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and terrorism - the latter were convicted of both parts in all forms and urged to convene the UN Conference.
They also called for the end of the Dohai trade round, although they both have a large part of their failure.
The EU has confirmed that, alongside its sustainable energy and climate programme, it would like to reduce emissions by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed on this, as should be done at the future climate conference, with a global agreement to reduce the production of greenhouse gases by 50% to 2050.
I would also like to prevent the rise in food prices and supported the summoning of the international meeting to review the financial crisis.
The Indian governor is going to the French capital today, where at the bilateral meeting, the nuclear power is being used peacefully.
In Paris, they trust that the French companies will receive an order of €20 billion to build Indian nuclear reactors.
According to news reports, the agreement would be 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
The Italian publishers represent themselves with a strong field at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will be present at the most important international copyright meeting at the 60th Buchmesse Fair.
This year, Frankfurt International Book Fair is waiting for 7000 exhibitors from 101 countries, 171.790 square metres, where more than 403.000 books are presented.
At the opening party of Italian Pavilion, the Italian Government is represented by Francesco Maria Giro, Deputy State Secretary of the Ministry of Culture Javas and Activities: Italy, by setting up a single Italian Pont, will take 264 square metres of exhibition.
The celebratory opening will be followed by a press conference in the Room Struktur hall of Buchmesse 5.0, where there is also an opportunity to present information, trends and views on the situation of Italian book publishing.
According to the data, the share of foreign authors in the Italian publishing market is constantly decreasing, in particular in the area of adult and youth publications.
They found a billionaire Steve Fossett's plane missing a year ago.
They found the remains of the billionaire Steve Fossett's plane, who disappeared over the Nevada desert on 3 September 2007.
It was located on a high level of 3000 metres in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, located at the border of California and Nevada, near Mammoth Lakes.
Human remains were not found inside the plane.
John Anderson, Sheriff of the county of Madera, all the remaining doubts were dissolved: "We sent a team to determine the flight situation, and we can now be sure that this is the machine that Steve Fossett flew on the day of his disappearance," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff also confirmed that no human remains were found either in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Transport Safety Office (NTSB) announced that a few hours after the discovery of the wreck, an investigative committee was asked to identify the machine and that it was actually about Bellanca 8kcab, which disappeared on 3 September 2007, on the day that Foss went on a triple-hour flight from Yerington in Nevada.
Yesterday, too, in California, near the Nevada border, a couple found some personal belongings near the Mammoth Lakes home.
Two documents for Fosset's name, issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Surveillance Authority, some cash and a sweater.
Fossett's search was given up one month after he disappeared.
The billionaire set up a number of summits to put itself in history.
In 2002, for the sixth attempt, he first managed to fly around the earth with a balloon: two weeks of lonely flight.
Three years later, he fled the land without landing.
A number of records are also included in the flight above Andok at 15.445 metres altitude, carried out by a second pilot.
GLK, astonishing advertising
An unusual, but unique and definitely shaped hobbitic with large surfaces and cleaned corners.
In a few languages, this is Mercedes-Benz's latest "compact terrain" with which the German car factory tried to bring fresh fluctuations to the market.
This is precisely the result of the other content of the Mercedes-Benz demonstration halls, from 17 October, will also be surprising and unusual for the introduction of SUV GLK.
Since the advertising campaign accompanying the presentation of the new vehicle is used by an unknown media-communication tool, including through utopic 3D blocks, which have not yet been used in Italy.
The giant placat action, consisting of three stages, will govern the central shopping street of Milan until 15 November, the Corso Como .
The first stage of this new type of media communication begins with the car spatial effect, whereby the new SUV, with special glasses distributed around Corso Como, will be visible in almost real sizes and in three-dimensional form.
The viewer's gonna feel like the car's coming out of the poster.
After that, through innovative lifemina8 technology, all the details of the new GLK become visible to form a single image.
There is no doubt that Mercedes is trying to introduce something new to the stereotype of the automotive industry with this promotion.
Can you get the interest of future customers?
We'll show you who the Italian Football Huligans are.
Triveneto young people, they're probably being excluded from the tracks.
But who is this 150-200 boy and girl who is now ashamed of all Italy? Members of the "Ultras Italia" group, who has been following the selection for years, and which, in truth, has not so far caused too much problems.
They've never hooked up with the opponent's cheerleaders.
The core of the group is right.
The main organizers are coming from Trivento.
And Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udina.
These were joined by small groups from Campania and Puglia (in fact only a few units) in Sofia.
Italian flags were stretched on which the hometown of the cheerleader was marked: on Saturday they were removed so that they could not be identified.
They're following an example of English cheerleader.
In Bulgaria, they faced a real Nazi cheerleading team with the Levski drukkers.
The Italian Football Association has given 144 tickets to Italian cheerleaders, and they were names, so it's easier to check the cheerleader team.
The Ministry of Interior has also checked all of them: there was no one to go to Sofia, no one to be banned from visiting the stadium.
Four Italian cheerleaders, who have a record of football, refused the ticket and the exit.
At the moment, the Ministry of Interior is waiting for protocols from the Capitol Police and then taking the necessary measures: those who have been arrested or identified in the event of confusion may be affected by five years of prohibition.
This is an international ban, not only for the visit of all stadiums of Italy but for all of Europe.
So our soccer huligans can't put their feet on a soccer field.
Fortunately.
However, we must fear that the Huligans will find followers, i.e. that only fifty people will join.
"But you have to suppress this fire, you shouldn't excuse someone who acts like that," said the Ministry of Interior.
So we'd better keep our eyes open, especially since the day of Wednesday's selected match is coming in Lecca.
In Puglia, there is a small cell that supports Italian ultras.
The Observatory will meet tomorrow, and the Committee on the Security of Sports events on Tuesday, which may also be counted on one of the internal security services departments, on the secret services of sponsorship.
"Duce-Duce's scanning and accelerating arm under the Italian hymn?
This was the idea, in a rather unfortunate way, of Domenico Mazzilli, appointed for a few weeks ago in the lead of the Ministry of Interior's Observatory (the position was taken by Francesco Tagliente and Felice Ferlizzi).
Before that, Mazzilli was Chief of Police of Tries, the city where since 2002, a cell supports the Ultras Italian group.
What Mazzilli says is true in Bulgaria is not forbidden to live with Duce, but that still makes the 150-200 cheerleaders feel ashamed.
I'm not a sociologist, added to the first man of the observation service, but the crimes must be judged in the country where they were committed.
So far this group hasn't caused any problems.
But let's talk a little about the Italian annihilation: it's not a crime, but if I may say that, it can't be called prosperity..."
