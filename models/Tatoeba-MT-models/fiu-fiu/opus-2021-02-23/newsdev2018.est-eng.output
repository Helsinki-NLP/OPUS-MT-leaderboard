Two powerful women share their success secrets
What's in common with Barbara Corcoran and Laila Al?
At first sight, these women come from two completely different worlds.
New York Real estate Magnet Barbara Corcoran was able to convert a thousand-dollar loan to five billion-dollar real estate firms before he applied his expertise on the television screen, participating in the ABC real life series "Shark Tank" investor panel.
Laila Ali has been following his father, becoming the most successful female fighter as a four-fold undefeated champion before the roles of the TV director, author and speaker were added to his rehabilitation.
Despite their unique career paths (or perhaps because of them), TJ Maxx recruited both women so that they could help to talk to the full-bound entrepreneurs about breaking stereotypes and achieving high-air goals.
Last year, T.J. Maxx spoke to hundreds of women in shops across the country and discovered that 80 percent of them feel that society has placed certain roles and expectations for them stereotypically.
Consequently, they came out with the project The Maxx You Project to help women break these barriers.
Corcoron and Ali know so much about it, but they might be at the top of their field by now, but the journey there wasn't smooth for either.
Corcoran received high-school and college prices mainly for Ds and had already worked at 20 jobs when he was 23 years old.
Ali entered one of the most prominent areas of men, and in addition, he faced the attempt to step out of the shadow of his father, who was the icon of the world.
These two, softly speaking, are packed through the knowledge acquired by difficulties.
That is why we sat down with these powerful women to talk about overcoming the failures, to cope with success, and to trust our feelings in business and relationships.
What will inspire you to do what you do every day?
Laila Ali: I'm inspired every day by my personal goals.
I have developed a habit to write up things I want to achieve.
And I'll look at this list.
I think I'm responsible.
Of course my children inspire me.
My ambitions inspire me.
I want to be a winner in everything I do in my life.
I understand that achieving my goals requires serious work, but I am ready to do so.
My confidence comes from preparation.
So I spend a lot of time preparing.
Barbara Corcoran: Like Lailalg, my self-confidence is too much preparation, but I do not take my inspiration for it.
In fact, I have an inspiration for curiosity.
What happens when I do it?
What will be missing if I don't do it?
This curiosity makes me get out of bed in the morning because I can't wait to see what the day brings with me.
If I don't feel that way some day, I'm just pretending to be feeling it.
Then I'm going to believe myself, and I'm gonna get another inspiration.
Talk about some obstacles in your career that made you better in the long term.
Barbara Corcoran: For me, the hardest thing was when my partner-friend left me and married my secretary.
I ended my business a year later, but this year, being a fifth wheel, it was terrible because I didn't have enough confidence to leave.
I felt defeated, there was no inspiration.
But amazing things happen.
The hardest thing is to believe in this moment when you're hit by retreats.
The year that took me to walk and the business to start again from zero - this time without a partner - was extremely difficult.
Laila Ali: I would say that in my career, it was the hardest time I was fighting, I was at the top of my career, and I decided to give up the divorce.
I didn't separate only from my husband, but also from that manager and man who taught me everything I know about fighting.
I didn't think I could handle it without him.
So I began to worry about my career for the future, and I had to find time to step back and say to myself, "You have all the necessary knowledge and experience.
You have all these experiences in the boxing circle.
You can undoubtedly do it."
So I set up a new team around me and continued my career.
In fact, it was simply necessary to achieve the right state of mind because all the rest was pushed there.
I did what I had to do, I had to face fear and find the courage to get rid of my husband and manager and continue with my career, and it all came to pass.
When did you feel really successful?
Laila Ali: I felt I'd succeeded when I won my first championship title.
It was really good, because when I started fighting, I wanted to be one of the best, invincible.
I was able to achieve this goal, and I won not the championship title for one, but four times.
Barbara Corcoran: One moment I felt I'd succeeded was my eleventh year of action.
I had finally gained.
I had earned some $42,000 worth of profits that I couldn't expect.
I went out immediately, and I bought a new car for my mom and dad, and they never had a new car, so I let them deliver the cars to Florida where they had their retirement age.
I felt like the Queen of England.
I felt so cool.
In the following years, I earned a lot more, but nothing has yet been able to give the same emotion as the opportunity to give back something to my parents and to take them with surprise.
How could you keep yourself motivated to continue working during this 11-year-old period?
Barbara Corcoran: I never measured my business on profits because it wasn't my goal.
I just wanted to see how far I could get.
I made myself a dream of being the king of real estate in New York on the first day.
And I saw myself as a pope in the spirit eye, all kissing my ring and worshiping me.
I had such a little idea in my head.
So, when I kept trying every day, every hour, I didn't actually mean to earn money.
Eventually, I made money accidentally.
But all the money that came in, I went back to business right away.
I don't even think I had a lot of frightening days in which I would think, oh, God, we don't make money.
I was just convinced something was going to work.
The worst that could have happened would have been the loss of the company and the return to the waitress.
Then I made good tips, and I was happy.
I could be happy again.
Therefore, I do not believe that money is a great effort of many people who have succeeded.
They have other motives to encourage them.
And money wasn't one of mine.
Do you have any advice for someone who has such great dreams, but who is keeping back the financial factor?
Barbara Corcoran: When I started making a lot of money, I had money to invest in real estate, but I didn't have time.
I built a company.
And that's why I found me five different partners who were not even specialists in the broker, but in different neighbourhoods everywhere in the city who knew their streets and broke them.
I approached them and said, "You know this neighborhood.
Find me the best building.
I'll give you money and you'll be my partner."
The lesson here is that if you have money, you need people to make money with your money.
And if you have a gift, you can sell it to someone who has money, and instead make money with it.
There are two aspects: gifts and money.
But if it's not both together, nothing much happens.
After all, I - and also my partners - have been very well along with all these years with the great investors I would never have had if I had no courage to find people who would like to step up.
It's always possible to get money if you believe you have talent and know your part of the world better than anyone else.
What are these two or three things you do every morning that will help you succeed?
Laila Ali: I don't know about you, but I have a lot of moments in my life when I feel uncomfortable, being a mother, a business woman, a husband... all the roles we play as women.
I got to the point in my life where I really had to set the morning routine.
I like to get up and just feel grateful.
Thanksgiving for the resurrection, your health, your children, your family.
I write up on the nights, which are my goals for the next day, and when I wake up, I'll look at this list again.
Meditating.
Sometimes I write in the diary.
I always drink a cup of coffee.
And I always do the first thing in the morning, because if I don't do it, it will not be done.
For me, it's the end of the line of priorities.
These are things that are important to me: my spirituality, focus on the universe and God, then training and putting my health first.
Because of this, everything else seems simple.
I feel like I can take over all the challenges I'm facing in the day.
Barbara Corcoran: I'm putting things in the order of importance.
I'm working on the list of tasks that are endless and ridiculous.
And I'll put in place what's most important.
What are the real priorities?
I'm trying to accept the achievement of these most important things.
What are you doing to bring yourself to the right state of mind for a big meeting?
Barbara Corcoran: I imagine I'm failing.
It's as weird as it is.
I mean, Lord, I'm failing.
I'm scared of myself, and that makes me harder.
I imagine anyone who's competing with me - I'm naturally very struggled because I'm one of ten children and we never got the attention of our parents.
I could be very competitive.
And I always come over too thoroughly prepared.
Too much preparation strengthens my confidence.
Laila Ali: It's amazing how opposed we are to this part.
We are two successful people and this shows how different things work for different people.
I like to imagine I'm successful.
I like to think about the end of the success.
I imagine it in the spirit eye, I see it actually happened.
I see a boxing circle, a fight, a belt winner, and a dressing room returning, celebrating the victory with a piece of cake, as I've always done.
The same applies to meetings.
But I always prepare myself thoroughly, and this self-confidence comes from the preparation, because there's a fear in my head that I don't go well or I don't say the right things or I don't have the necessary information.
This is where I'm getting ready for the game.
But I always enter the end result by visualizing.
You've both been very successful in your career.
How do you pass that on?
Laila Ali: I'm very excited to be part of the T.J. Maxx project Maxx You Project because I feel it's a chance to do good.
A lot of women need inspiration, encouragement to pursue their dreams and goals.
There's a champion in all of us.
It's actually about mindlessness and possession of the necessary tools, surrounding itself to the right people, people who have managed to achieve the things you are trying to achieve.
Barbara Corcoran: One thing I think I'm doing very well is inspiring people.
That's why I was very excited when they asked me to cooperate with Maxx You Project.
I am trying to trigger the flame of individuality and inspiration that we see here in the faces of all these people, and give them practical advice on how to move forward.
Many people start doing their dreams, but they tend to be mistaken at some point of the way.
So we try to help them focus on the goal.
Everything we teach is practical.
Business planning, even as simple as a lift call, everything you need to build a company.
What advice would you give to women who wish to succeed in male-centred areas?
Laila Ali: I act in one of the most man-centred areas, which is boxing.
To come after his father, who was the worldly icon and the best of all times, was quite discouraging.
For me, the core of the matter was actually finding this talent, courage, strength in itself.
The first thing I had to believe in myself is that I could go into the boxing circle and be successful.
At that moment, no one else other than me and me had been involved in this matter, except for those I had set up in my own head.
If you believe in yourself and find your passion, no one can stop you.
Barbara Corcoran: The path to find inspiration and my way of holding a attitude between the New York Real Estate King and crossing the final line is vastly long.
And in this intermediate phase, which is your career every day, there is a lot of talent.
In order to require these gifts, there is no need to act with real estate accompaniment.
I am sure that in the field of Laila too, it was necessary to decide what are the right people, the right managers, when to start, when to finish, how much money you have, which you can put in, not when hardly you are willing to work.
These are all subjective decisions.
I'm trying to make these efforts a little more supportive so that these women really feel like, "Okay, I get it now.
Let me try.
Here are my three priorities."
If they leave with three key priorities to really do things, I'll go home at night smiling in bed.
What's on your nightcategory now?
Laila Ali: Too much collar.
Journals, books, little prayer angel, my journal.
Probably a water bottle.
Barbara Corcoran: In my nightcategory, there's a small green roll-out bell, because I tried to break the habit every morning as the first thing to watch the phone.
That's why I got it.
That was cute.
But it never worked.
And still standing there.
And my phone's still in my nightcame.
What book are you reading now?
Barbara Corcoran: Eighth or ninth times "How to win friends and influence people."
It keeps me on the right road.
I think it's still the best book that has been written in this area, no matter what your dreams are, dreams cannot be achieved without other people.
And it is possible to communicate today exactly the same as in the past.
I like to read it over from time to time.
It'll help me get on the right road again.
Laila Ali: I'm studying in a dietary school, so I read the book "Withless Diet".
It's about eating cereals and how they affect our body.
I'm very interested in that.
What is your best advice to deal with successes and failures?
Barbara Corcoran: Ignore pessimists.
They meet in all different shapes.
You have to remove them from your brain vocabulary.
Stay away from the squirrels.
They'll blow you out of energy.
I'm dealing with squirrels like thieves.
They're coming in the night, drinking your wallet and leaving.
Pessimists will destroy the team in any crew situation faster than you can blink, because the people who pity themselves want others to feel bad.
They're pulling good people in the hole with them.
I can greatly avoid all negative people in the 50 km radius, because my goal is to be positive and take the life of everything that gives, and to accept everything I have to offer.
So why would I want to spend a minute on such people?
Laila Ali: It must be consistent.
We start on many occasions with confidence that we are now taking this path.
Let's do it, this and this.
But people won't follow it long enough.
Sometimes they give up just before they get over the last hill.
So I think we need to keep on the course.
If you feel passionate about something, believe in something, you have to be consistent.
And you have to do a hard job that success requires.
Barbara Corcoran: A lot of effort must be made to ensure consistency.
Do you know what it takes?
Finalisation of matters.
If you start something, stop it.
Many are skilled beginners, but not particularly skilled graduates.
In Latvia, the most non-citizens live in Daugavpils, Riga and Liepaja.
In Riga, people without Latvian citizenship live 125 344, in Daugavpils 14 266 and in Liepāja 11 909.
Outside the large city, the most unciviled people live in Jekabpils (2347) and Valmieras (1235).
At the beginning of 2017, 242 560 people lived in Latvia, who did not have Latvian citizenship.
In 2007, Latvia lived 392 816 people without citizenship in Latvia.
Jürgen Ligi recently referred to Facebook as "Citate is a poor reason".
Therefore, I will not look back and try not to remind you of what has been done to rearrange human nature in history and what results have been achieved.
I do not assess whether these tests can be considered successful or failed.
I also avoid excessive source references, although in my head I support my most important teacher Toomas Paul’s thought: all my thoughts have been borrowed from somewhere, if only remember exactly where.
The most striking activity of the present Estonia is rearing the citizen of the Republic of Estonia - a perfect person.
We don't raise him like we raise a child - in good faith that he will become a human being.
We raise him as the dominant class imagines it to himself - what kind of person must be that he can live in Estonia and speak publicly.
The censorship is perfect.
Although the local dominant class changed partly a year ago, some culture methods are as scary as the previous dominant class, now poor nobles - their brutality will not fall below the previous.
They're just different.
Latvia's beer is a brandy for the new era's fine-voting.
For public leaders 0,5 promilli
The dominant class includes not only those politicians who receive wages for their work from the state, but also those self-conscious who make policy voluntarily (loe: deliberately): write opinion tips using Mihkel Mut's shape, hanging on Facebook when the fearful people around them live in Estonia, prolonging, boicoting, juggling, sabotage.
They only agree to stay in the echo chamber (an English expression of people living in a room where only suitable opinions are available, such as their own Facebook friends, etc.), but it is not possible in conflict in Estonia.
Still, there are some fellow travellers who think or do something that is unbearable to the people of the house.
And there's a war of word and the agitators are rubbing.
We have a lot of politicians who know exactly how much a person can drink with someone to sleep with, how many children can produce how to work, get a lot of salary, when to rest, think about what to eat, how to separate his mind, when to be sick, how to die.
Very important places.
If anything else goes against their public speeches than what they themselves said, they are upset, insulted, in hysteria.
The fact that people in many European countries are driving a "full head" car, and that is lawfully permissible, they do not express their opinion.
The zero tolerance is the only tolerance allowed in each area, but the zero tolerance is not care, it is sinful evil.
Classics and racials, only the people like me can fit.
Holy politicians can only open their mouths, but never hearts.
They believe that every "measure" that makes society better is working and worth trying.
For their luck, we have the clusters, the spirit - depressed bouquets, which are jumping through every window - pain.
Therefore, it seems to us that a smart farmer opens his mouth, and he's being emotionally injured in a mansion that makes sense.
Some words that will certainly send us to the landscape are, for example, gay, refugee, woman, violence, work, and so on.
If you believe everything that self-righteous officials, activists and politicians (these are only a small part of all groups, but they can slander in such a way that all society is curious) speaks and writes, the citizen is not only disgusting, unpleasant and unpleasant, but also brain-free.
But let us not believe, do not force them to tolerate, do not forbid them to drink.
In any case, the Estonian person drinks as much as he wants, not as much as the country permits.
In any case, the Estonian person tolerates more than he is forced to tolerate.
Estonian people do not change their behaviour two months before the elections to turn back on their popularity diet and not only in the mouth, but also to force out what unpleasant brainfat kilograms will quickly restore.
Whoever does otherwise is not the right Estonian.
I don't think any people can be reared.
I think you can teach a person.
Drinking reasonably, loving your family, being working, polite, attractive not only for friends, but for society as a whole.
To teach you, you don't have to penalise, restrict, ban, make you call, make a corner, throw rotten eggs in the media idiot mail.
The teacher must be an example.
A smoked politician speaks of tobacco harm?
A police officer who crosses the speed at free time will be fine for me to overrun the speed?
And then I'm going to miss my colleague in the dynamism...
I've got such a rude idea that maybe we should try to rearrange the dominant class.
Tell them not to drink secretly.
If you drink, drink publicly: In the place of the House, under the eyes of the people.
To force the speed to cross only publicly - rulers' cars, including private cars, be all red.
If you rule, do as you rule yourself.
Maybe shame is enough if words and actions don't work together.
Or we will find out that we ourselves want these boats to rule us.
Because all of us, Estonians, are the kind we don't want to be at all.
Where to run from yourself?
According to former prosecutors, the leak of Trump transkriptes is probably a federal crime.
The one who leaked President Trump's phone calls to the press and foreign leaders probably committed a crime, claimed the former prosecutors on Thursday when the legislators put forward an invitation to investigate the accused.
"The unauthorized disclosure of these documents to the press is a crime," said former Columbia District Attorney Joe diGenova Fox News.
These different acts, including the publication of notes and their transkriptes of discussions between the President and foreign leaders, constitute a serious threat to national security.
On Thursday, on the basis of the documents that leaked, the Washington Post announced new details about the tensional talks of Trumpi at the end of January with the President of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
In the first case, Trump commanded the Head of State of Mexico to stop public preaching that his government would not pay for the border wall.
According to the newspaper, the transkriptes included notes that they were classified by the Head of State Security Council.
The Post said that they were reached by comprehensive transkriptes, which were "collected by the White House employees" and based on the records of the White House memorialists.
"There is a federal law that makes such classified information for an unauthorised person leaking a crime, a federal crime," said former New York State Prosecutor Doug Burns in a phone interview.
Although some of the individual issues of these speeches came to the public in February, the disclosure of the transkriptes points a much greater step to the White House trying to reduce leakage.
The report was published accidentally at a time when the head figures of the Trump Administration were preparing for the public to take a strong stand on Friday in order to demonstrate their commitment to the eradication of classified information leaks.
The General Prosecutor Jeff Sessions, Dan Coats, Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein, and William Evanina, head of the National Anti-Intelligence and Security Centre, are expected to inform the public at the Headquarters of the Ministry of Justice.
It is not clear whether the Ministry of Justice is investigating The Post's leak.
Burns said that, in order to take responsibility for this, "reliable elements must be clearly proven".
He said that "the subject could be a matter of choking," referring to the former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's e-mail investigation and the decision not to prosecute.
These considerations include the labelling and history of the document and its precise classification.
In the case of confidentiality, the prosecutors shall examine whether the document was leaked to an unauthorised person in a way that has a negative impact on the interests of the United States of America.
"If all this can be proven, people can undoubtedly be in a criminally unprotected situation," said Burns.
"No doubt."
When talking about Trump's phone transkriptes, DiGenova, who was the prosecutor of spy cases, said that such documents were "usually classified as a secret and higher".
The claim that these leaks jeopardize the ability of the US Government to conduct foreign policy was that DiGenova's Prime Prosecutor's request to convene a federal conspiracy to find leaks.
He also said that for the records of the The Washington Post reporters and editors' phone calls, a court order should be submitted - this is something that reporters will undoubtedly protest.
The Utah Republican Senator Mike Lee said on Thursday at Capitol Hill that there should be a criminal procedure for leaking classified information.
"Comes to find a person who leaked them - he must be punished and he must be fired," said Lee Fox News in the "America's News HQ".
"It's unacceptable and such a thing should never happen."
Lee, who worked as a lawyer before she was elected to the Senate in 2010, said that such a leak was "a crime, a very serious federal crime".
"This action should not and should not only be accompanied by fire, but also by criminal proceedings, given the inclusion of classified information," he said.
Fox News was told that, at the present stage, the Ministry of Justice may rather provide an overview of what the Ministry of Justice hopes to achieve rather than explain certain procedures.
Last week, the President criticised Sessions and exposed his anger publicly to the prosecutor, claiming that the latter had not made enough effort to find the leaks.
"I want the prosecutor to be much harder for the leaks coming from security agencies," said Trump in the rose garden on 25 July.
The sessions itself acknowledged to Fox Newsi Tucker Carlson last week that he was unsatisfactory with the efforts made to investigate the leakage that he has been repeatedly struggling to the President since his enthusiasm.
"I have not been satisfied with the previous procedures and investigations of criminal leakage," said Sessions.
Even some people with a critical view of the President have spoken to the leaks, saying that such action is detrimental to foreign policy efforts.
"The leaking of a speech transkript between the president and the foreign leader is unprecedented, shocking and dangerous," David Frum wrote on Thursday in Atlanticus.
"It is extremely important that the President can communicate confidentially - and perhaps even more importantly - that foreign leaders can understand that they can respond confidentially."
Senator Mark Warner (D-Va), the Senate Security Committee’s Head Democrat, also said to The Daily Beasti that the leak is "absolutely" worrying and the Congress should examine it.
10 advertising tricks that make the appearance of food more tempting
As many foods are difficult to photograph, the picture uses other ingredients that are deceived by people, for example, glue or potato tube instead of milk.
The Youtube Canal Top Trending makes an overview of the tricks that are quite common in the advertising world.
If someone opens a popcorn pack or takes out a hamburger from the box, a lot of fun steam will blow out of it.
In fact, the take is longer, and during the whole time, hot food is not a steam, because the steam comes from high water content, for example, with no bread products.
Therefore, cotton balloons are dissolved in the packaging or food in water, which have the ability to suck and keep their share of water in it.
In the heat exchange nearby, they sweep much longer than a burger or a popcorn and the product gets a freshly prepared appearance.
The potato pumper is a great helper for photographers because it does not melt in the light or heat and does not significantly change the consistency as many other food products.
For example, instead of filling the cream or ice-coloured ice cream, potato bubbles can be used.
Some colors and decorative elements, and the consumer has been disappointed again.
The glue replaces milk.
It's not easy to take pictures of milk, because it may not look that white on the photo.
In addition, milk-served foods will rapidly become loose inside it.
Since, for example, morning beetles or mysles must look grinding and delicious inside the milk, a glue is used instead of milk that does not pass through any flakes.
If restaurants can work hard to make meat so that the result is juvenile and mature, it will not be done by advertising.
However, the meat presented in the ad looks particularly tempting, as if coming from the barbecue.
Often, however, it will be cooked on the pan or made in the oven and pulled onto the meat with a shoewash.
It's as difficult to work with a vacuum, as it tends to melt.
Fortunately there is a product that is almost identical from the appearance of foam cream - a beard curd.
So it can be advertised on cake or berries or inside the milk coke.
Even the top of the fruits sold in the store may have a thin wax layer that makes their appearance shining.
However, it is not enough for the photo, and a deodorant is sprayed on it to add the shield to the fruit.
The sauces are also not very photogenous as they become more liquid or, for example, release water in time.
However, there will be help in the wax with bright colors and more permanent textures to make a tempting appendix.
Whale is likely to be used also in pictures where a chocolate that flows on the cake or ice cream.
If you notice an ideal cut of cake, where the ratio of biskvite and filler is perfect, there are probably some additional layers or pieces of paper there.
This is because when you cut the cake, you can disperse and ruin the picture in full.
After cutting, if you push in the cake and spray them with fillings, it will visually make a much more beautiful impression.
The priest and the button needles are also used inside the hamburger to place all the ingredients there exactly so that they can stay still.
That's why the burger on the table doesn't look like the ad.
Paper full-top chicken.
The advertising looks like weed and full, but it may not even be cooked.
In order to add a complete impression, a chicken-full paper will be stretched, if necessary with the potato bubble before the mentioned potato bubble, and then the chicken will then be sprayed over the brown colour.
Pancakes are particularly poured in American advertisements with foam syrup, as this picture creates large pancakes in humans.
In fact, the cakes quickly suck into their syrup and the flowing syrup will quickly disappear from the face of the photographer.
Therefore, each pancake is sprayed over with a cleaning device intended for couch, which helps to avoid rapid absorption.
There is often no help from it, and therefore the gold brown engine oil is taken, which is poured on warm pancakes and presented as syrup.
Former soldier was sentenced to the murder of a suspected pensioner in sexual abuse
The former soldier was sentenced to at least 17 years for the murder of a man he suspected of being abused by his familiar wife.
Richard Cassidy (70) was sentenced to the Glasgow Supreme Court in June for the murder of David Farish (75) at his home in Tweedbank Roxburghshire in February 2016.
The judge, Lord Summers, called the murder "scratchy" because the victim had 14 stab wounds in the body.
The defense attorney Brian McConnachie said that killing resulted in "the moment of madness," but he described the facts as "special".
Cassidy heard that Farish had sexually abused a woman over a long time.
His lawyer said he went home and "friended" with him, hoping to hear a confession, not a plan to kill him.
Lord Summers claimed that Cassidy was demonstrating signs of intention on the day of the attack, and pointing out the social work report that the defendant had undergone special force training in the military on how to infiltrate the groups by engaging in friendship.
No charges were filed for Farish.
The court announced that after the murder, Cassidy himself contacted the police and surrendered.
McConnachie said that most people have "hard to understand" that Cassidy is capable of murder.
The defendant said, "He has never had any problems before this incident.
He lived a full-value life until this crazy moment in February 2016.
Cassidy's health is allegedly poor and has been captured by a heart attack and a stroke.
According to Lord Summers, he took a minimum of 17 years of imprisonment into account that Cassidy had no previous convictions, and what he was supposed to have been told about Farish.
The Scottish police described the case as "happy old man's particularly horrific murder at his own home".
Detective David Pinkney said, "Although this punishment doesn't disobey his cruel act, I hope it will offer David's family some sort of solution."
On Monday, the last chance was to offer out a nice name for the garlic born early in June.

It is worth knowing how to calculate how much sugar is in the milk product?
"The EU Food Labelling Standards provide that the packaging can produce the quantity of carbohydrates and the quantity of sugars, which is not equal to the quantity of white, so-called table sugar," confirmed Valio Estonian Marketing Director Krista Kalbin.
According to him, milk products actually contain three types of sugars: milk lactose, natural milk sugar, fruit glucose and fructose, and added sugar, or sucrose.
However, if you remember a few simple basic truths, Kalbin said that the calculation of the amount of added sugars contained in the product should not cause difficulties.
Firstly, it must be made clear whether it is a milk or oxidised milk product.
The normal milk and milk drinks contain approximately 5 grams of natural milk sugar or lactose per 100 grams of product.
Oxidated milk products have consumed part of lactose during the acidification process by yogurt or boiling bark, resulting in an average of 3,5 g/100g of lactose in milk products.
"To calculate the amount of added sugar, the lactose must be calculated first," said Kalbin.
Fructose and glucose from berries and fruits must now be calculated from the quantity of sugars.
"In general, in the milk product flavoured with fructose and glucose, 3-4% of normal fruit content is approximately 0.3 grams, and in products with a fruit content of approximately 15% per 100 grams of fruit, particularly in fruit content up to 1,5 grams", Kalbin said.
According to him, this simple calculation indicates that the added sugar proportion may be up to twice as much as the percentage of the sugars indicated on the packaging.
In the case of lactose-free products, the situation differs slightly because the sugar content depends on the production technology.
Comparison of the best spa packages: out of the nightclub tickets to the sauna rituals
The poster's consumer delivery compared the most favourable packages offered in spades to one person by one night on 11-12 August.
"Spaachettes are different levels and service choices, so one comparison on the basis of only price is very difficult to do," said OÜ Spa Tours sales manager Mario Sau.
Compared to spa-optimal accommodations, it appears that the prices of the most favourable packages vary several times and there are options for both more demanding customers and more modest holidays.
For example, if a traveler alone is able to spend time at Värska Spa's single room in the house of the water center with a buffet-night and breakfast and an unlimited use of the water park, the gym and the saunas, then the accompanying Suns' mansion in Muhumaa will cost a package of EUR 287.
It contains accommodation in the double Deluxe category room, breakfast restaurant Alexander in the winter garden and a half-day spa package.
Selecting and comparing different packages, it should be taken into account that to obtain the most favourable price, holidays should take place with a friend or partner, because staying in two rooms will be more favourable than taking a single room.
However, if there is a desire to rest alone, the visitor will be offered special single-human rooms, as well as two-digit rooms, respectively.
If a traveller who is not a partner is generally required to pay just a couple of decades of additional fees for being alone in a two-digit room, it will also be possible to find more favourable options when compromised.
For example, Fra Mare Thalasso Spas in Haapsalus pays EUR 86 per night in a single room, but if you wish, there is also a more favourable opportunity to stay in a double room, provided that in the case of space deprivation, you will be accommodationd in advance by informing the customer of someone else.
In this case, the package will be charged at EUR 58.
It's good to be flexible to get the best deal.
The prices of the packages are dynamic, or depending on the day and fulfillment of the week.
"In the case of a more favourable package, prices may vary from 112 to 248 euros," explained the sales and marketing policy of V SpaaHotel in Tartu in Triinu Steel.
He also pointed out that the price in their hotels is variable, depending on the performance, and added that the customer would normally receive the most favourable price, booking directly from their website or asking for the offer itself.
As the summer season is the fastest for spas, it is worth planning a vacation in time to avoid the situation where the desired place has been sold.
For example, Pärnu Hedon Spas and Strand Spa have been selected on 11 August at the time of comparison with the packages, and only sviits have been sold in the conference hotel, as well as the Villa Mall operating in Lahemaa.
You don't have to look far for opportunities for relaxing holidays: you can find one or more spas from every larger city in Estonia.
However, it is worth studying before buying the package, and at the same time there will be no major events in the vicinity, as it will immediately increase prices.
For example, from 11 to 13 August, the events of the White Dam will be held in Haapsala.
During this time, Haapsalus has a lot of tourists, demand for accommodations, and we have the prices of major events at this time.
"We do not have any accommodation at that time at a preferential price or favourable packages," commented the Director of Laine, Irene Field.
The Chinese company that came to Estonia made 100 million euros of turnover immediately
Agritera, the Chinese owner of Agritera, which started its activity only last year, has reached almost EUR 100 million.
The profit was earned by nearly EUR 2 million, written by business day.
The company’s annual report shows that Agritera OÜ’s sales revenue for buying and wholesale agricultural production amounted to EUR 100,6 million in 2016.
The profit was EUR 1.91 million.
A year earlier, there was no economic activity in the company.
On average, there were 3 people in the company, and in 2015 there were no employees.
Turnover per employee amounted to EUR 33.6 million, the average gross premium amounted to EUR 316 per month.
Jüri Kolk: rest for the whole year, so you don't need a vacation.
Of course, I was guilty of not resting this vacation.
I may have been somewhat necessary employee, but I think the only person who thought he was irreplaceable.
It's your fault the stupid sense of duty in my chest blew.
The quote from the beginning of this column is nice for the fact that it is fully true.
So it was -- the new agency I started in March of the same year demanding a part of my work, but something was so much better suited to me that I recovered to a completely new life in three months.
It's summer, it's vacation time.
It's time to give New Year's Promises, review what's happened in life, and what direction does this whole thing fall.
"For this, Christmas and a year's shift!" now a decent citizen calls me badly.
Maybe it is, but we all know from our experience that Christmas doesn't fit to think about life and set goals.
All right, all I'm talking about is myself - I can't make any changes during the weekend.
It's too hard for me.
Of course, in Christmastime there is happiness and joy in the ceilings: I like knowing the race of the beginning light, love Christmas profits, and Jesus was a very sympathetic, revolutionically remembered guy.
Despite this, I am mostly very tired in Christmas and sometimes stressed - already because of this poor darkness.
Yeah, I'm doing a lot of work living a vacation-free life, maybe more than doing a fucking slaughterhouse, and I'm constantly resting.
Most of the time I run like a squirrel bike - gifts, at least four Christmas parties, a little more burden at work ...
In view of the persistent social pressure to feel unconditional joy and peace in the heart, Christmas times are obvious.
But a despair and a tired person can't make good decisions, long ago to improve their plan.
Such things must still be done with a more or less clear head.
A tired person may throw up an empty and sound promise that helps to store the future foundation as much as buying a lottery ticket.
The promise that is intended to change something should be thought over slowly, it should be useful, it should be a plan.
The plan, in so different from the promise, includes the purpose of the direction of action and does not break down after a few small relapses.
That's why I'm saying it's the best time to open promises in the summer.
You just need to relax and figure out why it's as big as your fatigue (if you are).
If you do not oblige yourself in the way a calf escaped from the table during the holiday, it will be enough for a couple of weeks to find a hook in your life that deserves straightening, and to figure out how exactly it can be done.
I think it's important to live as much as possible so that I don't even need a vacation so that I rest on the run, not once a year.
So the holiday would be an extra sign, not a box stop for survival, during which the loads are loaded so much that they can resist in the next year.
I suggest at least one simple promise for everyone in the summer - if you have to get up the next morning at a certain time, then get some sleep in the evening.
I believe that if every tenth Postman reader listened to my recommendation, life in Estonia would be much better.
I'm going to follow my advice.
We already have a Thursday working week, but not the way we're waiting.
Photo: Scanpix, PantherMedia / Wavebreakmedia ltd
Many Estonians already have their unidentified Thursday working week.
But not like they wait, business day writes.
This has been created by modern workplace planning, or by an open office.
In the unsealed office, the famous management magazine Harvard Business Review requires workers to spend almost 1.5 hours a day, or almost the entire working day a week empty.
However, if the Thursday week of work means four days of work and three days of rest, such a forced solution will be worse than that.
1.5 hours have been taken from working time with family and hobbies or holidays in place of rehabilitation, distraction of work, increasing irritation and anxiety, and absorption of work.
The third festival day of the week sends a strong wind.
That's how one of the illusion photographer's cameras caught up in a troubled chaos trying to fly in the wind.
As a result of the wind, many festival visitors say that the mouth and eyes are full of sand.
How a man built a theme park that paid $51 million to his daughter
A father living in Texas discovered that there were no thematic parks where his disabled daughter could play.
So he decided to build one himself.
Gordon Hartman had just come out of the pool on his family vacation when his 12 - year - old daughter Morgan approached other children playing in the water.
He tried to make friends with them, but they quickly left the pool.
Hartman thinks they're frightened because they don't know how to treat a disabled person - Morgan has a five-year-old cognitive understanding and a certain form of autism.
That incident stayed haunted by him.
"The body is a lovely young girl.
A meeting with him always brings a smile to the mouth, and he certainly wants to hug.
But there have been many times where we haven't been able to take him to different places," he says.
Hartman and his husband Maggie asked other parents where they could take their daughter to a place where they would feel comfortable, and others would feel good when they were talking to him.
"We concluded that there is no such inclusive place," says Hartman.
So he decided to build it in 2007.
The former real estate developer sold its homebuilding companies in 2005 to establish The Gordon Hartman Family Foundation - a non-profit association that helps disabled people.
Then he started creating the "the first theme park of the world that was extremely accessible".
"We wanted to create a theme park where everyone can do everything that can play with special needs and without special needs," says Hartman.
He convened doctors, therapists, parents, and others with disabilities and disabilities to consult with the facility.
They were set up in ten hectares of abandoned careers in San Antonio, Texas.
Park named Morgan's Wonderland paid $34 million (£26 million) and opened in 2010.
The attractions include a fully accessible track, an adventure field and a mini-train.
Visitors often tell Hartman that they were only able to experience such attractions for the first time.
There is also a carousel specially designed for wheelchairs moving up and down next to the animals.
However, Hartman states that Morgan was at first afraid of the ride.
"When we opened, he wouldn't dare go on it.
He didn't understand why it was going around and why the animals were moving up and down," says Hartman.
It took me three years before Morgan agreed to go to the carousel.
"He was just standing close to it, then he sat on the animal, but we didn't start the ride.
It was a slow process, but now he loves to drive it.
Getting over something that frightened him meant a lot to him.
Playing the little things that have been done makes a big difference."
Since it was opened, more than a million people have visited Morgan's Wonderland from 67 countries and all of the 50 American states.
A third of the staff is disabled and entry is free of charge for all who have a condition.
"I realized that Morgan was one of the happy ones because he had many things needed for him.
I didn't want the price to be an obstacle to other people with special needs," says Hartman.
"We open every year, knowing that we're going to be in loss of at least a million dollars (£750 000), and we have to earn it back with the help of collectors and partners."
This year the theme park was extended by opening up Morgan's Inspiration Island, a fully accessible water park.
"July, fewer people visited the park because the wheelchairs became too hot.
So we decided to set up a water park," says Hartman.
In some parts of the island, warm water has been used to help visitors with muscle problems.
Water-resistant motorised wheelchairs operating with air, not batteries are available.
It's also possible to ride a boat on the river.
The water park cost a total of $17 million (£13 million).
"One man came to me yesterday at Inspiration Island and just kept my hand," says Hartman.
"He pointed to his son who had serious special needs and started crying.
He said his son hadn't been able to play in the water before."
According to Hartman, three of the four visitors in the park have no trees and the park has the effect that he hoped.
"This helps people to understand that although we are different in certain ways, we are actually exactly the same," he says.
"I saw a girl in a wheelchair go to another girl without special needs and they started playing together.
That was really awesome."
Hartman has not planned to open more parks, even though he has received hundreds of letters by mail from people who would like to park in his neighborhood.
Instead, he focuses on the provision of educational facilities for young people with special needs in San Antonio.
"I know there are many different organisations trying to build something similar to Morgan's Wonderland, and we will continue working with them," he adds.
He's still taking Morgan to play the theme park - Morgan's a celebrity now.
"If he comes here, he's like a rock star!
Many people want to talk to him and take a picture with him, he's gonna do it well," says Hartman.
Morgan, who's 23 now, can do things better and better.
"He now speaks more and most of his physical problems have resolved with numerous operations.
We're so proud he's gotten so far."
When Morgan visits the park, he likes to play the most on squirrels and sand, without knowing how much he has helped others.
"Morgan knows that the park has been named after him, but I don't think he understands what it actually represents and how it has changed lives," says Hartman.
"He doesn't understand how he's dealt with things in his life has made him a real source of inspiration."
U18 convenience head coach Vaido Rego: play-off game may decide one-two shots
In the Estonian U18 class basketball unit, Poland 68:63, the main instructor Vaido Rego said it was a real play-off meeting.
The game was crazily.
Both teams had done their homework, the points came hard.
The game comes with a situation with better nerves.
Play-off could be one-two whiskey game," Rego discussed.
You can win, but the coach's still looking for something to fix.
She'll always be nursing.
Some of our mistakes were unreasonable, and the opponent received light shots and lived on them.
This has happened before - if you go to protect yourself aggressively, there is a risk of overreacting.
Let's make our conclusions," said Rego.
He used nine players today, because of the injury of some meeting, Robin Kivi still stayed tight.
These decisions are made on the current stage.
The stone did the morning training and the warmth before the game, but it wasn't ready for a hundred percent," explained the instructor.
Tomorrow at 18.15 meets the Estonian semi-final with Britain, who defeated Bulgaria today 76:73.
The winner of this game will raise its country's U18 age class for the next summer to EM A division.
Video: Vassiljev already created another penal for the new club
In the game that was held in the home field from Pia to the nineth minute of Wroclawi Slaski, he was able to delay 20 minutes later.
Vassiljevil was an excellent opportunity to secure the first victory of the season for the Piast.
Four minutes before the normal time was fulfilled, the half-guard hit the penal.
Mach ended with 1:1 sign.
Two points have been gathered from Pia in four rounds and are located in the liiga table in the final or 15th position.
How to keep sex exciting if you try to have a baby?
Thus, it is very important to keep the shrine floating even if you try to create a new life.
A woman First gives advice on how to do things so that sex doesn't seem annoying commitment.
Don't take it as a duty
This could happen to any couple trying to get pregnant.
Sometimes pregnancy can take years.
After the orders, having sex takes away spontaneity and romance.
Try to be spontaneous!
Women often feel that they can't enjoy "normal" sex at the end of the cycle when they know that there is no positive result.
This causes tensions in relation, which leads to a decline in sex, and less sex, of course, means a even greater chance not to become pregnant.
But men feel that they have to be able to "preserve," if they are required.
If you know your fruitful days, it can be for you to plan something romantic with your dearest.
Have a special dinner or just spending time together - enjoy each other!
Take the fruitful period into account.
From the point of view of reproduction, there is no point in having sex when ovulation has taken place, but in order for your relationship to be fair, try to have sex in days of non-fertility.
Although there is no evidence that pregnancy would occur more firmly than a woman is getting an orgasm, do not forget it!
Remember, each couple is different.
Everyone can handle the baby-made stress differently.
Some men want to be familiar with a woman's cycle, but others prefer not to know that they do not feel pressure on demand.
No one knows the best you've ever had.
Find your solution!
Studies have shown that a higher success can be found in couples who have sex every few days, but not every couple can hold such a density.
The most important thing is to find a pattern that suits you as a couple best.
The IAAF warns that frauds are being monitored sharply at the London World Championships
On Friday, World Championships of the Light Force begin in London, and athletes are more in the light of the doping channels than ever.
These world championships are the first to guard the new body, Athletics Integrity Unit (AAU), which also monitors corruption, gambling and the fake of results.
"It cannot be ruled out that human nature does not allow such things to happen.
We can say, however, that we have the best practice and the best antidoping program that can be at all based on information and data collection, and we will see the result after the event," said David Howman, the AU representative.
AU has promised 19 athletes about 190 Russian athletes who have been caught by drones to compete as neutral athletes.
Observable: Levadia destroyed the Paide City Team on the homefield
Levadia has put himself in a difficult position, because in the previous round, the foreigner was suddenly lost to the future of Viljandi, and the table leader Flora used the offer, sliding from seven points away.
Behind the back, the same stick with Levadia has reached the Nõmme Rock.
Paide, a member of the summer transition window, continues to miss the captain and the central exterior of Andre Frolov.
Of the last seven games, only two points have been picked, the eighth place in the liigatable - from Tartu Tammekas four points down and the future in turn four points ahead.
Levadiale Paide lost in the first game 0:7 and 2:5.
"My watch died, but I didn't," shined actress Raivo E. Tamme in the final of Ironman 70.3 wide smile.
True, in the whole half-piece trialon, the smile didn't squeeze Raivo.
And more, running 21,1 kilometers, he got into a conversation: "I talked to a person during the run, one man ran by and wondered, "Lord, you can talk more!"
On a runway dance, Raivo, who was spreading energy to talk, went over to the speedwalk a few times.
Coach suggestion.
"Ain-Alar Juhanson said that you can walk up the hill, that there is no point in pushing a run, because there are such risings here, and there is no difference in time whether you run or the way to a quick walk," an actor says that you took the triatleed guiding words of the triatleed instructor.
He could also breathe the times of walking, and he was able to share interviews without breathing on the left and right after crossing the finish line.
As if there were no 1,9 kilometers behind the back, 90 kilometers on the bike and 21,1 kilometers on the run.
"I think my training isn't the same way to enjoy this competition," admits in January that you've started training and that you've lost 16 kilos of your weight for today in the satisfactories of Raivo.
And as far as the interviews are concerned, it was my wish that I could do the final interviews.
After every race, I've been able to give interviews, and I was hoping it would be nice to do it after Otepää Ironman.
I thought it would be all right if I weren't after Ironman on the ground." In contrast to the savage ground-of-people state, Raivo's final line crossed another picture: his hands were winning towards the sky and in the face, lighting a sincere victorious yard.
There was also a reason: Raivol spent 46 minutes and 24 seconds to swim 1.9 kilometers, 90 kilometers to drive 3 hours and 32 minutes and 2 hours and 18 minutes to run 21,1 kilometers.
"My heart has now been given to the triatlon," confirms Raivo, who already called in finiś, that he gave a finger to sport and took the ring backwards.
I already registered on August 20th to Gran Fondo - 230 kilometers from Tallinn to Tartu with a bike!
So tomorrow we'll rehearse again!
Disney's long-term advisor and leader Marty Sklar died at the age of 83
On 27 July, Sklar, who died at his home in the neighborhood of Hollywood Hills in Los Angeles, maintained links with the company after he retired in 2009, which was precisely scheduled for the 54th anniversary of Disneyland opening.
Last year, he became the only member of the trumpet on the day of the opening of Shanghai Disney in China (so the company invites his employees) who has participated in the opening of all 12 Disney Parks around the world.
And less than two weeks before he died, he attended a Disney fan assembly of D23, sharing memories about Disneyland.
His death was reported by Disney Company, not to mention the cause.
He was 83 years old.
Sklar’s post as editor of the newspaper The Disneyland News was temporary, but he returned to Disneyland after U.C.L.A. graduated in 1956 to work in its advertising department.
He soon became Walt Disney's main shadow author for the writing of advertising materials, commitment, souvenir leaders, speeches, celebrations, presentations, and short films, such as a piece of letters that helped the company to obtain approval for the construction of Walt Disney World and Epcot in Central Florida.
He also cooperated with Walt and his brother Roy on Disney's annual reports.
"They were quite head-to-head times for a person who approached his 30th birthday and had only six or seven years of graduation," Sklar wrote in his autobiography "Dream It! Do It: My Half-Century Creating Disney's Magic Kingdom" (2013).
However, despite the fact that Walt Disney trusted Sklar in the writing work, he appointed Sklar in the New York World Fair of Ford in 1964, where Disney Company designed exhibitions and attractions.
Sklar wrote a story to Walt Disney for the Ford Pavilion attraction of Magic Skyway, where it could have seen animathronic dinosaurs and cave people, which was their main link to the large corporate sponsors.
It was the beginning of the second look at Sklar in the company.
As a growing member and leader of Imagineers, he was increasingly associated with Walt Disney's legacy, who died at the end of 1966 a while before Walt Disney World was opened in 1971 and Epcot opened in 1982.
After Walt Disney died 65 years of lung cancer, Sklar was swollen back in the writing world when he was told that the company's managers had not prepared a public speech, although "that was not a secret that Walt was dying" as he wrote in his autobiography.
Sklar felt frustrating that he had to write a statement to which Roy Disney signed, but he realized that the failure of planning was a sign that Walt Disney's death was paralyzed by the company's leaders.
"In reality, they were all scared to death," wrote Sklar.
Martin Adrian Sklar was born in February in New Brunswick, New Jersey.
His father Leon was a teacher and his mother, Lilyn Fuchs, working at Johnson & Johnson, before the family moved to Long Beach when Marty was 12.
After high school, he had a number of temporary jobs, such as working in Douglas Aircraft, as a ice-cleaner drive-in in hamburger restoran as well as as a postal packing.
But in May 1955, when his third year in U.C.L.A. was over, Sklar received a message to call the marketing and advertising director E. Cardon Walker.
At that time Sklar U.C.L.A. was a new editor of the The Daily Bruin.
Walker asked him to come to a work interview for the author and editor of the newspaper The Disneyland News.
Walker said the theme park will be opened soon.
And it needs him.
Walker hired him after 20 minutes of interview.
Sklar had to prove to Walt Disney that he knew what he was doing.
"I had been working there for two weeks and I had to present the concept of the page to Walt Disney," he recalled at the pocket broadcast on the Disney Avenue website.
"If Walt didn't like it, he would have thrown me out the door and hired a professional.
But fortunately, Walt liked it.
I was 21.
That was scary.
I had never worked professionally."
Sklar formed the lessons of Walt Disney (and also some other people) at one point as a manifest for the Board of the Thematic Park.
Commands include, for example, the following: know your target group.
Try to "return to visitors' shoes" to experience a attraction like them.
Tell me one story at a time for every attraction.
The theme entertainment expert Bob Rogers called Sklar once as a "debt student boy" - the role Miki-Hiir played in Disney's film "Fantasy" (1940) - because he had transmitted Disney's philosophy to three generations of designers.
His wife, Leah Gerber, daughter Leslie Sklar, son Howard, and four grandchildren.
Sklar was Disney's dedicated leader.
He regularly carried three clocks of Miki-Hire (which showed him a time in Los Angeles, Paris and Tokyo) and Miki-Hire gold ring.
And he never forgot anything that Walt Disney had taught him.
When Disney Company developed the childhood of the California Adventure Park, Sklar reminded planners that they added the activities that parents and children could jointly do, as Walt Disney had demanded.
"I reminded everyone that Disneyland existed at all because Walt used to take his daughters to drive Diane i and Sharon to Griffith Park with carousel," he said to the magazine The Los Angeles Times in 2002, "and the father had to sit on the parkping and eat peanuts and popcorns while the children were riding alone."
Police drove over 200 people to the station during the week.
Over 20 crimes were registered in the city of Pärnu during the festival days.
About half of them have reason to be associated with the music party, a large number of drug possessions and two drunken management were registered alongside the use of violence.
A hundred of the offence proceedings initiated were mainly related to the use or possession of alcohol-containing minors or prohibited substances.
A letter was received by a robbery and a breach of public order.
For various reasons, the officers brought over 200 people to the police station.
About half a hundred of them were minors, and predominantly the cause of the transportation of alcoholic beverages in the police department.
I had more than half the minors brought to the station.
Also, half a hundred people were taken — as much as last year.
Andres, the Head of Pärnu Police Department, Sinimer, says, are expected, given the great crowd, of the figures mentioned above.
As in previous years, we had been thoroughly prepared for this weekend.
We were involved with additional forces from prefectures, police officers and assistant police officers to ensure that we were prepared to respond quickly.
Most of the situations were resolved with word and sufficient communication between regularists to citizens.
"Of course, there were some bad things missing because the police were seeing and knowing a lot in the city," said the Sinimer.
His opinion was extremely positive that the minors who consumed alcohol were apparently fewer and young people proved that they could celebrate even.
He commended the top-level team of the security company who took care of security at the festival hall.
I thank all the festival visitors who kept themselves well up and celebrated safely.
"Thank the local people who, with their understanding attitude, contributed to the success of the big festival," said the policeman.
At the Pärnu police station, the owners are waiting for items found in town and the festival hall on the weekend.
According to Annika Pärna, the head of the Pärnu service responsible for returning the findings at the Festival Hall, this year there were fewer items lost than in the soil.
In the police axis of the festival area, over half of the findings were returned to the owners.
The highest number of bank cards, identity documents, mobile phones and keys were lost in three days.
"There are 13 other mobile phones, three wallets, a laptop, a crying clock and several car keys waiting for the owner at the station," Pärna listed.
A 101-year-old man jumped off the plane.
The second World War veteran Verdun Hayes recently received a military award to celebrate the parachute jump that broke his world record.
In fact, a man was 101 years old and 38 days old, making it the oldest person in the world who jumped parachute.
The Group urges the government to agree on the transitional conditions for Brexit.
One of the largest groups of business lobbyists in Britain encourages the government to stop dancing around the Brexit perimeters.
The Institute of Directors (IoD) asked the government to go out with a "transitional agreement" to make progress with Brexit smooth.
It is desirable that the government overlooks the "Brexit salmon" bridge between leaving the EU and setting up new trade agreements.
The group warned that, without such a contract, business activities would have a short-term chaotic fluctuation on the rock edge.
They criticised the government for involving "overcoming in all possible speculative disputes".
During the last few weeks, members of the government have expressed contradictory views on how long the transitional period will last and what it will bring with them.
The IoD report on the silence of the Brexit gap - opportunities for the transition - states: " Instead of dealing with the problem far from far away, the government must reintroduce the strategic debate on this issue.
This could minimise ever-growing confusion and uncertainty in this area."
Gerard Lyons, an economic scientist and a group of Economists for Brexit's leader figure, described this week the concern about Brexit as "the story of panic performers", which reminds us of the fear of Y2K's computer error in the millennium exchange.
Early Chancellor Philip Hammond warned in June: "There are a lot of business investments that are delayed until companies can see more clearly what is likely to result in these discussions."
Allie Renison, head of the EU and trade policy, said: "The Chancellor has the right to worry about the delay of business investments.
This is one of the most frequent changes to be observed alongside the relocation of operations in the EU, which must be dealt with in relation to Brexit.
The latter applies in particular to IoD members in Northern Ireland who are currently considering a joint location or relocation."
The IoD proposes a number of options, including the following: Extension of Article 50 to March 2019
Accession to the European Economic Area
Conciliation to remain in the EU Legislative Government
Establishment of a Transitional Customs Agreement similar to that of the EU Customs Union
Renison said: "IoD offered these options out in connection with the transition, hoping that it would trigger an appropriate debate on how best to complete Brexit.
Priorisation of interim arrangements and thereby mitigation of risks of exit from the EU means that short-term chaotic cliff variations do not reduce future opportunities."
The Russian railway explores the possibility of launching a St. Petersburg-Kaliningrad-Berlin Travel Train
Russia's railway is investigating the possibility of entering the Berlin-Peterbur train line through Kaliningrad, announced Viktor Golomolzin Interfax Severo-Zapad.
The monitoring of passenger traffic reports that from an economic point of view, the re-routing of Kaliningradi-Berliini trains is hardly possible.
And we offer you a route to Berlin-Kaliningrad-Peterburi.
There are technical possibilities for this in terms of both infrastructure and rolling stock," said Golomolzin.
Golomolzin also noted that there are already Russian trains that can exchange track width and continue to move on to the European rail width.
Golomolzin considers that this direction is prospective, because now the inhabitants of St. Petersburg and the entire northwest of Russia must travel to Germany through Moscow and Brest.
As a possible option, the route will be discussed through Latvia, confirmed to Latvia Delfi, Māris Ozols, a press representative of the Latvian railway (Latvijas Dzelzceļš), who said that there is no specific decision at the moment, but the option is in the debate.
The Latvian railways, together with partners, including the Russian railway, are looking for an opportunity to increase the competitiveness of passenger flows in order to compete with road transport.
Pakistan's prices in India do not find asylum
70 years after the largest population migration in the history of the two countries' separation, prices continue to move from Pakistan to India.
In the camps at the border of two countries, tens of thousands of people are waiting for them, who are not even legally entitled to work in India.
Thus, many of them have no choice but to squeeze illegally near temporary habitats by breaking stones - the Indian authorities on the other hand monitor the movements of the aliens of the border very sharply.
Most of the arrivals from Pakistan can't expect such reception.
No work, no house, no money, no food.
That's where we worked in the fields. We were peasants.
This is where people like us are forced to break stones to earn a living," said 81-year-old at the Law.
For us, the breakdown is not over.
The prices are still trying to return to their country.
And when they come here, they have nothing," added an elderly man living in the field camp near Jodhpur City.
After India’s independence, over 15 million people lost their home in 1947 under British colonial power.
Separation caused a months of violence that lost at least a million people because of religious hatred.
In the middle of the chaos of blood, the prices and the sikhs just formed from Pakistan, while the Muslims moved in the opposite direction.
Despite migration, prices are still one of the more numerous minorities groups in Pakistan.
In different estimates, they account for about 1.6 per cent of the 200-million population in the country.
Many of them complain about continuous discrimination and fear robbery, rape and forced marriage.
"The persecution began soon after the resignation," said Jogdas, whose family moved only a few months before the two countries were divide from the drought to the current Pakistan area.
It wasn't a day since we could have lived in peace.
I wanted to come back to live in my prices among the brothers.
The National Government of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Mod has said that he wants to make it easier for religious reasons to find asylum in India.
Last year, the government began to allow immigrants to apply for citizenship in their place of residence, and in the past, the whole business was carried out through the central government.
Prices relocated from Pakistan to India will open up the possibility of rapid citizenship after seven years of residence.
However, due to bureaucratic delays, this process is often much more time-consuming.
The 64-year-old Khanaramji left Pakistan in 1997 and became Indian citizenship in 2005.
However, according to him, many have abandoned and returned to Pakistan because they see that in India they do not expect a good life.
The government does not provide any support.
We're like livestock without the owner.
We're just trying to survive on our own," said Khanaramji.
But even worse than poverty is the skepticity of authorities.
Those who do not have citizenship must suffer from the harassment of intelligence agencies.
They're always treated as suspects and Pakistanian agents," he explained.
Singh Sodhal, based on a charity organization committed to helping prices from Jodhpur, Pakistan, had great expectations of Mod, who had come to power in 2014, but had to be disappointed by now.
During the Mod Government, the tensions between India and Pakistan have increased, and this is why the most migrants suffer.
"They're going to be hell," said Sodhal.
For many, however, such treatment is better than life in Pakistan.
Horoji and his two adult sons fled to India two years ago because they had begun to get murder threats from their Pakistani neighbours.
"To save our lives, we had to flee to India," said 65-year-old Horoji, whose grandparents were from the current Indian areas, but found themselves in the wrong side of the border when the country broke down.
My grandfather moved to the other side of the job.
But he told us we'd move to India at the right time because he knew that the future could become dangerous to the prices.
I think we've been doing pretty well.
We've done our work and work well," says Pärnu policeman Andres Sinimeri, how the first two days of the Weeken have taken place for them.
Sinimer says today there are patrol officers and Rapid Reagents on the streets and also communicate with people - perhaps they have questions and also want to know how to become a Rapid Reagent.
In two days, the police have had to deal with some fights and drugs.
"There have also been a few large quantities of drug treatments, but we will do summaries when the Weekend is over," says Sinimer.
About a hundred people have been in Pärnu police stations in two days.
Fortunately, the police didn't have to solve extremities.
By the way, Sinimer says that if the sky comes out sharply and horizontally to rain, they don't have much work.
A Haapsalu police executive has never said rain is like an extra patrol.
Pärnu's police have also made a station in the Weeken, where things found can be taken and the same can be required.
By the way, the police even lost one of their necessary widgets that good people brought to the point of invention.
Look at the video Andres told me about the Sinimer Evening Paper.
A number of Emmy's nominations from the scener and producer Neal Baer paid $4.35 million for a home in Hollywood Hills West, whose roots are atom era.
In 1945, Josef Van der Kar, the modernist style of this century, called it Albert and Roberta Wohlstetter, according to its original owners, nuclear strategies.
The 255 square metres of the gate-limited entrance house has a wide range of glass slides that open to the garden, the terrace and the inner courtyard.
In the living room and dining room there are floor coverings from the cap, chambers and displaceable panels that open into the kitchen.
The main part of the house consists of three bedrooms and three bathrooms.
There is also a separate guest house on the property, where the view of the giant fish stretch and the sleeping breeze is open.
There is also a separate building with a bathroom and an additional storage room.
Albert Wohlstetter was a powerful nuclearist during the cold war.
The investigation committee also quoted Roberta Wohlsteter's analysis of intelligence misconducts before the Pearl Harbor attack.
The Wohlsters have advised the Presidential administrations of the Republicans and Democrats, including John F. Kennedy during the missile crisis in Cuba.
In 1985, Ronald Reagan got the president's liberty medal.
Baer is the most famous TV drama for his work, "Scientific Hospital" and "In the name of the Law: Sexual Crime Investigation Unit".
Real estate brokers were Mike Deasy and Sara Clephane from Deasy/Penner and Partners.
The purchaser was represented by Hattie Ramirez from Keller Williams Realty.
The plane drew a perfect picture of himself above the United States.
The pilot took a journey to a siksacic state flight above the United States and could even have some fun on the route.
Aircraft’s real-time flight data indicated that it was not just a straight line or arc, it was a series of airways that formed the image of the aeroplane interconnected.
The flight BOE004 left real-time Flightradar 24 according to Boeing Field Airport Seattle is local time around 15.40 a.m. on Wednesday.
Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner took the direction east over Montana, North Dakota and Minnesota, before he suddenly changed the course and flew southwest.
When viewed from the map, the odd route of the aircraft represents a two-engine passenger aeroplane.
Boeing says the flight is part of the 18-hour "resistant test".
" Instead of flying with an arbitrary pattern, the test team allowed his imagination to go on the route, from which the 22 states were set up at 787-8 connections," said Boeing Company's representative to the RT.com portal.
"Dreamliner's nose refers to the Puget Sound area where Boeing Commercial Airplanes is home.
The wings extend from North Michigan near Canada's border to South Texas.
The tail concerns Huntsville i Alabama," he added.
Boeing's 787-8 Dreamliner remote airplane was introduced in 2009.
The plane holds up to 242 passengers and can fly more than 13 600 kilometres.
Since the pilot used the radar as a personal lõuend, the flight online was infinitely interested among aircraft trackers.
Some suspected it was a test flight, others once again offered that it might be a strange coincidence.
Multifilms affecting the dressing style of Estonian children
If children in Europe and America often develop what the children of royal families or celebrities are wearing, Estonian parents choose clothes for their fame instead on the basis of kinolina.
The British little prince, Georgi, is becoming a true moeguur, under the example of Duchess Cahterine.
Like his mother, the prince can trigger a true purchase in people with their clothes, which has even been understood by the effect of Prince George.
The last such an affair took place a few weeks ago at the royal family visit in Poland, where George carried a Spanish brand in Tizza 10 euros of blue-red-setribe strides that the crazy parents bought in the brand e-commerce in 24 hours.
There was probably not much among them from Estonia because the lates of the royal children are supposed to leave our parents completely cold.
Commercial Manager Anna Ansmitt acknowledges that the children of the star pairs and foreign fashion coaches generally do not affect the purchases of our parents to their musicians.
In Estonia, children's affairs are the largest indicator of films, multiculturals and Youtube channels.
So the most popular products in recent years are fingers, games, dolls, clothes, dancing dogs or cats, peeling penguins and so on."
At the same time, he confirms that, if you wish, your children in Estonia can be dressed like European princess or princess.
The environment is not recommended by the Savisaare Preparatory Association
The leaders of the environment regions across Estonia made a referral to the public and political partners, calling to vote in favour of the Environment, not the Election Associations.
In particular, this message is intended for those who consider the Electoral Union of Edgar Savisaare and the Environment.
How Princess Diana used her makeup as a weapon
When I think of Princess Diana's makeup, the first thing is the eyeliner.
A younger girl's blue.
Later, the fat black wave line of his Martin Bashir's "Panorama" interview, whose effect was devastating when he looked through thick rinses up, bringing to the hearing the immortal phrase: "We were in that marriage three, so it was a little too crowded."
The large and wet eyes surrounded by his thinness, the pale face with a thick black line, made him look like a wounded animal.
That's exactly what he was trying to do.
But Princess Diana never wore makeup outside the public, at least not according to modern standards.
It wasn't just that he didn't need it - he was beautiful, of course - but he saw an uncomfortable obligation in it, something related to work rather than pleasure.
In front of the public, he could have been wearing a thick makeup layer.
Once, he arrived in the office of Conde Nast, Vogue publishers, wearing a thick, almost orange coat.
He apologized, saying that his skin has to shine like sunshine, because if he went out "usually", then the fabulous photographers would take his picture and then put all the charges on him to look like "lous", "lous" and "tired".
That's why Diana went to a solarium three times a week using the machine at his home.
Today, of course, such a course would be bad for health reasons, but for Diana, this was a useful goal, which allowed him to show the world his sunshine, even though his innerness was filled with black clouds and flashes.
One of the most likely mistakes in the royal family were to think that if they commended him as Charles’s husband, they would receive a little beautiful tribe with only sugary waffles in their brains.
However, the reality was the opposite.
He didn't use class to be the best in school, but when it touched the creation of an image, he was a five-year-old student.
For Diana, the importance of hair and makeup was that they could be used to convey moods or hours.
Otherwise, they didn't give him any interest.
His friend Rosa Monckton - Diana was his youngest child's godmother - remembers that the makeup was nothing they used to talk about.
"I only remember it," he said, "How much relief he felt at those times when we went to rest together and he didn't have to makeup."
Today, we tend to think of makeup as something that improves the appearance of a woman, but when we look back at Diana's life cycle, it is clear that she used it as a tool for powerful relations.
The moments when he felt the most freely was his own most, are the moments when he was also the most natural, wearing very little makeup.
In 1993, with his two young sons at the Thorpe Park at the Loggers Leap attraction, he was wet and laughed with his heart, lashed with his eyes like any other mother who spends the day with his children.
Four months after he and Charles were informed of his resignation, he finally looked incredibly uncomfortable and "normal".
Or in later years, by pulling out of the gym, hair set behind, shaped legs in bicycle pants, face red, health and vitality exploding from every of his poors.
To the end of his life, when he began to pay his independence and his confidence grew, we saw more and more such Diana.
He joined Halo Trust and walked through the Angola minefield in January 1997.
At that point, at 35 years of age, hair soft and natural, face almost completely makeup-free, he probably looked the most beautiful than ever, remembering this bright and hopeful young girl who laughed at a 15-year-old engagement photo.
Diana was just about to reach her best years.
In the early days, a young Diana Spencer had a dream of Raffael-preliminary nature.
But it didn't take long until the "principalization" began - the process that was mainly managed by the press and palace to make Diana a refined young lady who would be worth his new status.
Partly included Clayton Howard, a veteran makeup artist who was often used by Lord Snowdon for photo sessions, handwork.
Howard met a carnal Diana for the first time at Snowdon's Kensington City Hall to record a official engagement picture for the Vogue magazine.
At that point, at the end of the 1980s, Diana was just an empty jaw.
His finest beauty products were from The Body Shop, such as Elderflower's eye gel.
Howard used the Max Factor's shining cream with Sheer Genius toon Honey Touch and Max Factor's cheeks with Frosted Coral.
In his eyelids, Elizabeth Arden’s toone Rice and Timberland carried a white bulb of dust.
Elizabeth Arden's blue garlic and blue garbage liaison improved the appearance.
And we know all this because Howard created a face plan for him.
"Diana's eyes are so marvelous color that I wanted to emphasise their sparkling blueness," he later wrote.
But the end result is not very flattering for such a young girl - she looks like a 18-year-old who is getting 50.
His eyebrows are too oppressive and too much boring brown on their eyes.
But the most frustrating thing here is the famous eyewitness in the inside edge of the eyewitness in the blue tone of the dusty Disney Princess.
Fantasy to the fantasy brown.
No wonder Diana's looking at us a little bit insecure.
One source of Diana’s excitement was the fact that he never knew where the public person would end and begins to be private.
It was the beginning of this process.
The person who probably influenced Diana’s appearance most was Mary Greenwell, who still plays an important role in today’s makeup world.
A makeup artist, who is now an ambassador of Chanel among others, is still one of the icons of the makeup world.
"Dianal had incredibly beautiful skin and long limbs," he recalls.
"He was just beautiful.
The men adored him.
He was sexy without trying to."
Mary met Diana for the first time in 1991, when Anna Harvey of Vogue's tone chief minister asked him to make Diana a makeup before December's photo session with Patrick Demarchelier, one of the most precious photographers in a magazine.
The team was also a hairdresser, Sam McKnight.
This happened when Diana and Charles had the biggest marriage problems and the division began in the name of public support.
"They didn't tell us who it was, although we knew it was someone very famous," said Greenwell.
"When we got there, Diana just stood beautifully there, was warm and friendly and extremely excited to be on Vogue's front cover."
This cover picture - in Diana's simple black sweater, a jaw twisting on his hands, his blue eyes bright, a nail elegant French manicure, hair short cut - was fractured.
It radiated positiveness, individuality and elegance.
First of all, it was modern, giving forward the clustered minimalistic aesthetics of the early nineties and creating a strong contrast between Diana and the royal family who stood in front of the "dose horribilis", as the Queen later called it.
"Diana was very tense for his makeup.
He just wanted to look fresh and different," said Greenwell.
During time, he taught Diana himself to makeup - cream, shining cream, concealing stick for eye lifting, garbage chef - and stressed a healthy skin care routine, encouraging him to take good care of himself and follow the mantra "inner beauty".
Diana "do everything moderately," says Greenwell.
He slept enough and reduced alcohol consumption, which is very important for the skin with fresh appearance.
The princess preferd Guerlain's hair cream, Clarins' lipsticks and Wild Rose's cheeks.
But the greatest favor Mary made to Diana was his retreat from the blue eyeliner.
"It just made him so much older," he said.
Instead, he used the combination of soft browns and neutral tones with the brown pencil line on the pendant boundary that were melted together so that all the edges were beautifully soft.
Often, he simply used a grain of cream and a bit of sunshine to emphasise Diana’s healthful shine.
"Diana used to call me and invite me to myself to discuss the products I liked to do," said Greenwell.
"I think it was relaxing for him; a chance to take a few moments for himself."
His favorite was the luxury mark Clarins.
Diana allegedly used their skin-sensitive day and night cream and their Alp herb cleaning milk and toone.
He also visited the cosmetic Janet Filderman in the beautiful lounge of Central London on a regular basis.
Diana was a famously beautiful skin, but sometimes she had rosary, moderate cheeking, often caused by stress.
To mitigate it, he used natural reassuring oils, including bitter vine oil.
"Dianal had an amazing bone structure," said Greenwell.
The only part of his appearance for which he wasn't very confident was his nose.
Anna Harvey recalls: "One time when the newspapers wrote that she had been on a nose-blowing beauty operation, she turned to me and said, "Oh, honestly, if I had let my nose operate, would you think I would have chosen that?"
When Mary Greenwell and Sam McKnight's advice began to capture, Diana felt more confident about his new appearance.
One of his most remarkable public steps - a copy of Christina Stambolian’s famous "payment dress" in London in 1994, where he was wearing a famous "payment dress", an exquisite, naked strawberry figure, shows that the signature style of his life began to develop.
Diana is simultaneously sexy and dynamic, his short hair behind the ears, and his short hair in a sharp contrast with a very stretching black silk dress.
His makeup is perfect - flattering, but at the same time modest, a black eyeliner stressing the blueness of his eyes.
Without fear of bright colors, especially red, he wore a shiny, fiery, cylinder, quite likely Revlon Red, which then became a trademark in some ways.
A few months later, he lightened his elegant red manicure in the rearing of the child loss fund in the Royal Death College.
The princess was a reference to health and self-esteem.
And finally, he had complete control.
In the day and shape, his makeup in errorless, he forwards exactly what he wants the viewers to think: here is a woman who seems to have a sense of self and purpose in life and who, finally, has become 36, found his place.
It's really sorry he couldn't prove it to himself.
Edela-Japan prepares for the arrival of Taifuun Noru
The vast majority of south-eastern Japan, including the areas that were ruined by rainfalls last month, is preparing for more rain on Friday than the taifun Noru, which was one of the most powerful storms in the world this year, moved ever closer to the main islands of the country.
According to the Meteorological Authority, strong winds and numerous rainfalls on Friday’s southern island of Kyushu and about 1350 km away from Tokyo are hitting a bit south of the southern island of Amam, and it is possible for up to 800 mm rains over the next 48 hours.
The representative of the Meteorological Agency said that Noru, which marks a certain type of deer in Korean, would then probably turn north and flood the rain to Kyushu, although the northern parts of the island, which were caught last month by rainwalls and floods that killed 36 people and left four disappeared, are likely to escape the worst.
"This is an extremely slow storm," he added, stating that therefore there is a greater flood risk, because in one region there is plenty of rain in a long time.
The Noru, which was at one point a category of taifun 5 and is a typically long-term storm, formed first two weeks ago and swiped the round round across the north of the Pacific, before headed to the north, taking the aim of Japan and weakening its approach path.
The representative added that, depending on the changes in the course, Noru may move directly across Kyushu and then across the Japanese island of Honshu, but it is still difficult to identify the long-term journey.
The landscape has places where, if necessary, conventional vehicles do not have the best will.
There's the solution to ATV.
The ATVs that are used in the military field gave an overview of the Defense Home!
There is nothing new in military structures when using such lightweight and well-transparent vehicles.
The need for them emerged already during World War II, but more attention was paid to them later.
Simpleness and Strength
As early as 1956, M-274, known as the Mechanical Name, was rolled out of Willys Overland’s factories, from a vehicle designed to evacuate wounded during the final years of World War II.
It is a little odd to mention the further development of a mechanical mule.
It's hard to imagine a more sketchy vehicle.
Wheeled platform, seat and wheel: everything, all luxury.
It's as if the construction of the engineer's desk were too hard to hit and the production started shortly.
But in the war there is much more convenience than convenience.
There was no opponent in Vietnam's jungles in this category.
A mild, less than five hundred kilograms weighing machine could hardly escape in places where Willyse Jeep, with his supertransformation, had to show his subdued brake lights.
A large number of vehicles with a load of approximately 500 kg were used for transport, both moon and live force transportation.
On the other hand, lighter anti-tank weapons were installed on the mule's back.
However, such a truck came under fire, and it still happened, the driver was able to move the steering system forward in the last trouble and let it down so much that the vehicle could be driven to the stomach in the ground.
The musicians were produced up to 1970, together with 11 240 of them and were used in the army until 1980, when they replaced the race against HMMWVs.
The following two decades had a marginal meaning in the military circles.
They came back to the picture after the dust twins in New York and the US soldiers found themselves devastating on Iraq and Afghanistan desert landscapes.
Right there was born with knowledge and understanding that there was something that needed to fill the void between Humwee and the foot soldier.
As the ATVs generally do not provide protection, they are not the best choice directly to carry out battle tasks.
However, fast and light machines are suitable for performing special tasks.
For example, intel and rescue operations.
Today, there are thousands of ATVs and UTVs in the American army.
Most of them, such as XUV550d, acquired by the Defence Union, are essentially similar to those who are in civilian business but supplemented according to the needs of the Army.
The trade marks which have been received on the back of the kamuflazi have been represented by names such as Kawasaki from Mule, Hondalt Rancher and Foreman, Yamahalt Rhino and Arctic Cat, and an ever-extending selection of the models of the leading military-ATV producer in Polaris.
In 2013 Polari concluded a five-year agreement with the American Special Forces Centre (SOCOM) for the supply of two-chair MRZR2 and MRZR4 and a separate five-year agreement on monopoly Polaris Sportsman based MV850 with both infrared and black-out lights and innovative bee-gun tyres, which will also ensure mobility after the 50-caliber weapon hit.
Before MV850 was placed on the market, Polari was able to deliver MV700 and MV800 vehicles to the military.
In the case of MV700, Polaris 700cc Twin Sportsman has been armed for civil use, with pre- and back wires, a two-piece fuel tank to cross larger distances, a reinforced frame and a core, and some other military equipment to which farmers or just in the woods do not have more than one.
As well as the John Deere M-Gators used successfully in Iraq and Afghanistan alongside the Polaris ATVs, it is equipped with gunfire, luggage-resistant capot and some other elements that are useless in the ranch but necessary in the battle zone.
A car weighing 750 kilograms can almost carry out its body weight, namely, 570 kilograms of stuff.
The power of the engine is also sufficient to carry lighter tracks and large pieces.
The rear part of the box with variable shapes, with sides removed, allows to drive the luggage of A point B, which is greater than that small but than the whipped insect.
Later the supplemented versions of M-Gator A1, which are 20 horsepowers more powerful than the original 20 horsepower M-Gator, followed by a reinforced A2, which is even better for the transport and towing of difficulties, and A3, combined with the positive characteristics of A1 and A2.
The Tulerists actually received M-Gators already in 1997 and 1998 in Bosnia, where medical brigades used them to evacuate the wounded.
At the same time, they also reduced the burden of soldiers moving on their feet by carrying instead the stuff that would otherwise have to be carried on the turkey.
If most of the ATVs in force structures are the modifications of civil vehicles, there are also some exceptions.
The most prominent of these are the war cruises produced in Phoenix International, the Prowler's name, which have been successfully used throughout the world in all potential battle, intelligence and rescue missions.
According to the manufacturer, for the first 10 years ago, the narrow locations that have been introduced and transferred for special operations are characterised by conventional ATVs and those which are necessary for the army to be modified, both in the light of leadership, resilience and safety.
However, being constructed and externally similar to normal ATV, Prowler is completely different from its structure and capacity.
He is faster, more stable, able to carry and carry bigger difficulties than other similar vehicles.
For example, if in the case of normal ATV, the driver has to play continuously with his body position to maintain the balance of the vehicle and use both hands for manoeuvring, acceleration and braking, Prowler is more like driving.
However, it does not matter whether Prowler, Gator, MV850 or any other concept of ATV or UTV and the area of use are all similar.
And it is clear that in the circumstances where the cost of defence is reduced by a large scale, and rather than a wide-scale conventional war there is a smaller scale, target-oriented whispering exercise, lightweight and fast small vehicles have joined the army in order to remain in service.
As a result of the department's prohmac, sensitive data were published on the child concerned.
As a result of a worrying breach of information, a child’s mother was misleading personal data, including information on whether they are sexually active.
The mother was sent an e-mail table containing the names, dates of birth, locations, and places of particular concern and attention to all children caring for the large service providers in Victoria’s city.
The e-mail revealed the place where each child lived.
The list states that a 13-year-old boy has been released against the bail, and in his case sexual behaviour is manifested, that a 15-year-old girl with problems with self-injury, abuse and running certain substances is "out with a boy-friend" and "no return tonight" and that a 14-year-old boy needs help with " care for himself" and is verbally aggressive and physically threatening.
The table appears to be a transfer document intended to be sent to the overnight exchange supervisor.
The document shall contain notes on the time when a child is expected home, or whether they can contact the staff for follow-up.
A number of children have been reported with concern.
For a 15-year-old boy, it has been written with caution: "If the staff contacts to obtain permission for searching the room and/or reviewing the laptop/USB device due to doubts about inappropriate sexual material, this authorisation must be granted."
The document also announces that a 17-year-old girl who gets only after three months of age 18 and is released from the care centre is such a risk of suicidal attempts that staff must call the emergency line immediately if he escapes.
For a 16-year-old parole boy, it was noted that he was out and "contacted with the staff later to follow him."
Although only the name of the accommodation unit, where children are kept, and not their addresses, has been mentioned in the listed locations, there are still enough details to be found.
The 2015 data leak came out when the mother shared experience with Fairfax Media in communication with the Ministry of Health, Service and Child Protection four years ago since his daughter was taken care of.
He agreed to share his concerns now that his daughter had become 18 and left the system.
A heartbreaking decision to give his daughter over to child protection was made after a violent incident at home. This case is one of the more and more complaints about family violence, the parents against their children.
For example, within six months after his departure, his daughter was able to receive seven criminal charges, he was moved to a place of home and to a place of hundreds of miles away, where he seemed to be successful, but then he was moved back without informing his parents, in addition to accepting and facilitating the relationship between his daughter and the older man.
The relationship with the first of the boyfriends, the 17-year-old, with whom the guardians allowed a woman’s 15-year-old daughter to stay regularly at the local hotel, ended when a young man was submitted a few days after the age of 18 for this relationship with the child in sexual relations.
"Why did he get out of the system in a worse situation than when he got in?" asks mom.
"And does that happen to all the children of care?"
It strongly supports the establishment of an institution that would allow the Ministry of Health and Services to monitor children within the first few weeks after taking their care before they are moved to their homes.
This would enable them to understand better how children communicate with others and what are their risks and their needs, especially in education.
The state government is looking for new ways to reduce the need to place children in home care, inter alia by trying to better support their parents.
A solid-oriented package of assistance financed by USD 62 million over the four years aims at helping children to move their children to situations with better organisation from home care.
In addition, a $5.6 million two-year experiment, which was published last October, allows professional caregivers to at least 28 children to help them get out of custody or avoid getting involved.
According to the representative of the department, the information leakage was not officially reported when it occurred, although the mother claims to inform the two staff members of the department within a few months of the incident.
The department is now working with the service provider to analyse the case.
"Every alleged private data leakage is taken very seriously, and we work to ensure that it has not affected the young people concerned negatively."
Last July, Jenny, Minister of Family and Children, Mikako, commissioned an independent survey of the sample of child protection individuals during the five-year period.
The section agreed with seven recommendations as a result and has subsequently updated the child protection instructions to ensure that the staff clearly understands their role and privacy activities, changed IT systems to prohibit the automatic redundancies of certain personal data and officially reviewed the activities of the department's privacy.
The Australian Bank of Commonwealth Bank is accused of large-scale money laundering violations
On Thursday, the Australian Government charged Commonwealth Bank against the largest mortgage in the country with regard to widespread violations of the rules against money laundering and terrorist financing.
The financial intelligence agency AUSTRAC announced that they have initiated a civil sanctions procedure in the Federal Court of Commbank due to the "serious and systematic non-compliance" of the largest case in Australia and in the first case in which a large bank is accused.
"CommBank's behaviour in this area has left the Australian society unprotected for serious and lasting financial crime," said AUSTRAC in the case-law document.
Commonwealth Bank said in his statement that they will examine the charges more closely and respond to "if time is right".
Australia's largest lender against the mortgage did not know "in the right time or at all" about the suspicious circumstances "what deals in total over $77 million Australian dollars (61 million U.S. dollars)", reported AUSTRAC.
According to the Agency, the Bank has committed an infringement of 53 700 acts against money laundering and terrorist financing, in particular with regard to "intelligible payment machines".
The last case of this type was related to the most popular intermediary in Australia this year, Tabcorp Holdings, who had only 108 alleged infringements.
Tabcorp paid fines of $45 million in Australia and is the biggest civil punishment in the corporate history of Australia.
The representative of AUSTRAC refused to comment on the possible penalty of Commbank or on whether there may be other banks on the Agency's fireline.
The maximum punishment of the law against money laundering and terrorist financing is $18 million for the infringement.
Intelligent payment machines are a certain type of banking machines that receive payments in cash and in the form of a check and facilitate anonymous cash contributions.
According to AUSTRAC, the use of the Commbank ITS after their deployment has increased significantly in May 2012.
The cash contributions amounted to USD 5,8 billion in the six months preceding June 2016 compared to USD 89 million in Australia in the first six months following the introduction of the Commbank machines.
AUSTRAC argues in the case-law that cash contributions were made under fake names, so that revenue received for drug importing syndicates.
"Even after the attention of the Commbank was paid to suspected money laundering or "smurfing" in Commbank's accounts, the Commbank did not start to monitor its clients in order to make it difficult and manage money laundering and terrorist financing," the legal documents show.
AUSTRAC added that the Commbank accounts were also used for "breaking of gear". It is a form of money laundering, which includes transfers between countries without actually crossing international borders.
Nordea and DNB joint bank becomes reality at the end of the year
Joining DNB and the Luminor name of Nordea Baltic entities will only take place in the last quarter of this year, written by Business Day.
Opening doors in a common legal body has continued to delay.
Following the publication of the merger plans in summer, the banks indicated that the completion of the transaction could remain in the second quarter.
In April, however, DNB's communication director said that it would be pushing to the third quarter.
In particular, the Swedish financial inspection provided additional instructions to Luminor in order to fulfil the regional importance of the single bank.
Trump called New Hampshire it "narkourka" by pissing on state politicians
"The President is wrong," said Chris Sununu, the Republican Governor of New Hampshire.
It disappoints that his misdescription of epidemics ignores all the excellent things the state has to offer.
Senator Maggie Hassan, the New Hampshire Democrat, referred to the comments as "screaming" and said in Twitter that his state was nothing different than anyone else who struggled with the misuse of broad opioids.
Senator Jeanne Shaheen, as well as the Democrat, agreed.
"It is totally unacceptable that the president speaks of NH in this way," he wrote in Twitter.
It's an NH and an epidemic completely false delusion.
Opioid dependence - the category of drugs that belongs to heroin and fentanyl - is the most fatal drug epidemic in the history of America.
In 2016, the overdose of drug users killed more people than guns or car accidents - based on the data analysed by The New York Times - and is now the main cause of death of Americans under the age of 50.
In 2015, more than 97 million people in the United States recipeed painkillers, reported by the U.S.A., as reported by the drug abuse and mental health agency.
It is estimated that 12 million of these people did what had not been appointed by the doctor.
New Hampshire has received a hard hook and its inhabitants have repeatedly raised the problem to the presidential candidates during the 2016 campaign.
New Hampshire was estimated to be 470 deaths due to overdose in 2016 compared to 439 cases in 2015.
In 2012, they were found in 163 of the Health and Service Department of New Hampshire.
On Thursday, Sununu described the opioid epidemic in us as "one of the worst health crisis ever faced by the state".
He said that the government has doubled the resources devoted to prevention, treatment and recovery.
In his view, the State has also spent millions of dollars on child prevention programmes, on law enforcement to end drug trafficking and on initiatives aimed at making naloxone available for the treatment of overdose.
An invitation to find drivers related to the two rape of a girl in Witton
Police are trying to find two drivers in the investigation of the rape of a 14-year-old girl.
The teen was attacked in the Witton region of Birmingham on 26 July at about 02:00 (BST).
Before this attack, he was raped at Witton Station.
With regard to the first case, one man has been charged.
British transport police would like to talk to two drivers as part of the investigation.
According to the police, the first car is a bright color sedan.
Inspector-inspector Tony Fitzpatrick said: "We have reason to believe that the driver at the station spoke to the victim before another person picked him up and then raped him in the car.
We want to know what was said during this conversation, and the leader may also know important details that would help us investigate."
According to the descriptions of the other driver, the red VW Sharan, the police said that the victim probably took home after the second time he was raped.

Why are dogs choking?
Sometimes they think that the dog eats medicine when he doesn't feel well and he wants to throw up.
In fact, most of the dogs eating grass are completely healthy.
Less than 10 percent of the dogs who chew the grass because of some disease.
One reason why the dog may suddenly start eating a lawn may be a food table for nutrients.
Dogs with worms can also become more interested in chewing a lawn.
Thus, if a dog who has never chewed a lawn has suddenly developed according to the appetite lawn and often eats it, it is worth taking care of a doctor in case, for example, to find a possible problem of gastrointestinal organs quickly.
It's worth mentioning that the dog can also eat the lawn because he likes its taste or he's just boring.
If the health problem is excluded, it would be useful to make sure that the family’s favorite is still sufficiently developing and moody.
From the west, lightning clouds come to Estonia.
In northern Estonia, many parts of the world have already heard the sounding and the individual shrinks.
This afternoon, the weather service also gave a shiny warning.
Today, mostly in northern Estonia, there are many sides of the shiny.
Thunder clouds are moving fast from the west east.
"The outbreaks of the wind reach inland until 15 islands and coasts, but the flash can be accompanied by stronger windfalls," it is on the weather service website.
However, a vast increase in thunderstorm is in south-eastern Finland and in Russia east of St. Petersburg.
Fortunately, however, in Estonia the winds blow from the west and the southwest, so at least there is no risk of major storms turning to Estonia at first.
Sylvester Stallone is stepping up the guest voice in the second season of our life.
On Thursday, the leading producer Dan Fogelman announced in the Television Critics Association press forum that in the second season of the popular NBC drama series Sylvester Stallone will take place.
As an actress, Kevin (Justin Hartley) plays the role of the co-chair of the movies at the beginning of the season.
"Kevin plays in a big movie and we needed a big co-star," said Fogelman.
At the end of the last season, Kevin was hired to play a very important role in the film that was framed by Ron Howard.
During this season, we see how a character participates in the project and warms up relations with his mistake played by Alexandra Breckenridge.
According to my bet, Stallone plays in "the movie in which Kevin participates in the Isafiguuri".
"Our life" star Milo Ventimiglia, who plays a series in the past pictures of Hartley's father, played a coincidence in the 2006 film "Rocky Balboa" Stallone's son.
Fogelman said that the still flourishing friendship with Stallone was likely to help the show attract a great star as a guest actress.
"We have a great scenario for him.
I believe it will be really exciting," said Fogelman.
"Our life" returns to the television screens on September 26.
Two employees of elite schools were arrested in the United States after national hunting.
42-year-old professor of Northwestern Wyndham Lathem gave himself to the police in California after the police had been looking for him.
A 56-year-old Oxford University employee Andrew Warren got the police in San Francisco.
Guys are suspected of 26-year-old Trenton Cornell-Duranleau's cruel stabbing.
He was found dead in Lathem's apartment in Chicago at the end of the month.
A few days later, the suspects made a great donation to one library in cash under the name of the dead.
Latham, according to a Chicago police officer, sent a video to friends and family members telling about the biggest mistake of life.
CNN didn't see the video, and the police wouldn't publish it.
According to the police, it was a cruel murder, and his body was transformed by wounds.
Warren had recently arrived from Britain to Chicago, but so far the investigators have not identified whether and how he was familiar with the victim.
Both suspects escaped the state before they were arrested.
Elise Christie talks about how he got over the horrors and cyber chastise of Soch to swim again in the name of gold
Compared to this fragile young woman who recently considered to say goodbye to the Uzbekistan forever, 26-year-old Christie has changed to the unknown.
The wicked insults smashed her legs, especially because she was also glorified when she was a child in West Lothian school.
He now packs up his self - confidence and believes that the challenge can come back to the beginning point, bringing with him at least one gold in Pyeongchang.
"I want to go out as an Olympic winner," he says, without fear of specifying the purpose.
"I know I'm both physically and spiritually at the right point to deal with it."
He used to dream of a fabulous career until the aesthetic elements began to reduce this interest.
"I was a very skilled jumper, but I had difficulties with the side of art seeking," he said laughing.
"I wasn't very good in elegance, regularity.
It was a sensible choice, because short-rafting is best suited to my personality."
The woman walks on foot around the globe: my daily budget is $5!
By giving true honor, I have also had such experience, truely 40 days where I decided to live the life of "hullness" in southern France to just be free and live a day at once.
It was found in the tent, in the woods, in small town stations, etc.
The second week I joined one of the French "home", the 44-year-old man was...
Oh, don't think that some faggots or other things: We just stayed at the same park in Menton and became friends, although he was 15 years older, he was a good companion.
Turns out he's a good family, Paris, former French Navy officer.
You don't consume, you don't do things, you don't have a good person, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you don't have a good start, you don't have a good time, you don't have a good time, you know?
In a word, I joined him, and the next three weeks we roamed together, from town to town, and about 5€ a day of lunch.
The money's still coming, so much for you to live.
The man taught me how to offer help in closed hotels and restaurants on the terraces and on the road.
We did the job exactly so much, that it would be for the next two to three days, and then then...
At some point, I got a fever, and I decided I couldn't...
I took a flight to Helsinki, home..
And by the way, I'm sorry.
These 40 days must have been the best in my life.
In Indonesia, a man who stole three sound capacities from mosque was burned alive by the Hungarian news agency MTI.
The thirty-year-old thief sneaked out of the mosque of Bekas, near the capital city of Jakarta, on August 1, but the saint guard noticed him and shouted, "Take the thief!"
They came to help, and they started tracking the thief.
The motorcycle ran away and even swim across the river.
Refusal lasted a few kilometers, then one of the stalkers hit the back of the rock, causing a serious injury.
The wrathful chariot caught a thief and beat him up.
A stalker shook a thief over with gasoline and set him on fire.
The innocent died of burn wounds at the scene.
The body was transported to the Ida-Jakarta police hospital.
The police took hold of both the dead motorcycle and the stolen sound capabilities.
In the local press, reports initially appeared, as if it weren't a thief, but it was an electric engineer who thought he wanted to repair the sound capabilities.
But the police dissolved these claims decisively.
The incinerators reported that they did not make a statement on what happened.
According to the dpa of the German news agency, this step is due to the fact that individuals do not trust the police or judicial bodies in particular.
Indonesia is the world's largest Islamic state.
Of 255 million people, Muslims are 87.2%.
Australian kitchen: fingerslaughter to the school garden.
Inflictedly, the aborigins have recently inherited the Australian cuisine of fingerlam and känguru meat.
The British roots have also had a lot of influence on the food table there - for example, the Bedgers, a dark brown salty beer yeast, which is sprinkled with butter on the bread or cream, reminds the British Marmite.
The meat in the pie, or in the leafy, is also from the British potatoes and sauces offered.
Also, BBQ Snags, or raw sausages from the United Kingdom, are cooked by the Austrians at the barbecue, but the British are rather in the oven.
One of the local desserts is Pavlova beseetort, although they also call it their invention by neighbouring landscape.
Sweets still love the creamy Anzac cookies with coconut and oats, and the coconut-coconut-cocoke-coke-coke-coke-coke-coke-coke-coke-coke-coke-coke-coke-coke-coke-cook-cook-coke-cook-coke-bags for lamington.
Honey Joys, or the sword's pleasures, are called bee-corn balls.

Stephanie celebrates his 77th birthday this fall.
His father was a state official and his mother Mary loved very much food.
Stephanie studied a library at the university, and as Australian youths did, he went to discover Europe after learning.
In France, Stephanie’s food love was only a complacent and evolved.
In London, however, he met his first husband, Monty, with the roots of Jamaica, with whom they returned to Australia in 1964 opened a simple meal in Melbourne, The Jamaican House.
Ten years later the marriage broke down and the restaurant closed the doors.
In 1976 he opened a little more prosperous restaurant at Stephanie's Restaurant, which was the next 21 years one of Melbourne's most valued restaurants.
An important restaurant is still mentioned as the first fine dining meal in Melbourne, which was really able to value fresh raw materials and offered seasonal food - the fact that seems to be an auxiliary truth, but at the end of the last century it was not yet.
After returning from the restaurant in 1997, Stephanie has focused on writing coke books, they have appeared in her feast 15.
There are even more productive food writers in Estonia, but in his case no book was simply a recipe.
For Australia's home cooks, different Stephanie Alexander coke books have been inexecutable.
For her life work, however, the lady holds the fifth Coke Book, the supermenu "The Cook's Companion", which is now at least half a million in Australia's home.
The book appeared for the first time in 1996, the supplemented edition 2004 and the latest version in 2014.
In my bookpiece, this edition of 2004 takes quite a lot of space, because the impansive book contains about a thousand recipes on page 1126!
However, the latest option is even greater.

This is a true coke clip where, in addition to recipes, the purchase and storage of different raw materials will be subject to presentation of food manufacturing technologies and recommendations for the purchase of kitchen supplies.
Food is in the alphabetical order, and there are many cross-references in the work - obviously the education of the library did not run by the food writer.
Stephanie himself stresses that this book changed his life and gave future action a new direction.
As a result of the popularity of the book, he has something to give to people, led to the next big, kitchen garden project that is comparable to school gardens in our circumstances.
The fourth person in Estonia became a heart in Finland.
The post-operative period of the post-operative period has been expected, according to doctors of North Estonia (PERH), cardiocular surgeon Günter Taal and cardioloog Pentti Põdra, who participated in the surgery with Finnish nurses.
"It's hard to say how long the patient could have lived without a new heart," said the Boss.
The doctors confirm that the world has now lived with a heart pump for up to eight years.
The man itself will recover and will not be ready to talk about this.
He had heart failure diagnosed for the first two years ago, and the disease had already reached the end stage, causing ischaemic heart failure.
"For that disease, transplantation was the only option," added Taal.
Cardiocular surgeon said that there are no accumulators or wires on the side of the heart pump after transplantation.
She's only got her scar and her immunity-depressing pills.
The patient can make sports and generally live as a normal person," he said.
First year is the most dangerous.
The buckle added that it would take three to six months to complete recovery.
Both doctors say that the patient should be closely monitored for medication at regular intervals, while the medicinal products also have side effects.
In addition, the patient should be monitored to prevent the rejection of the donor organ.
The most dangerous is the first year, but according to the ISHLT, the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, 50 percent of patients already live over 10 years.
On a scale, the results in Helsinki were better and the longer they had been transplanted for 25 years.
The cardiac surgeon explained that because of the disease, the patient’s blood circulation was poor, a heart pump was put on him a year ago that helped to recover for surgery.
When the man's pulmonary artery pressure fell, he became a suitable candidate for transplantation.
The transplantation operation is not considered to be a very complex surgery: correct timing is very important.
"It took a lot more time to get the pump and then get the heart when you put a new heart in it," he said.
In addition, the cardiac surgeon produced a complex part of the surgery to come out of the bloodstream of the body.
Rather, according to him, heart transplantation may be considered a series of times, as the Estonians need the least.
Significantly more kidney, liver and lung transplants are performed.
But we've been practicing this job for many years.
Learning self and his nervous system is one of the arts at this agency," added Taal.
The body needs four more people.
According to the patient, the heart was acquired because one of the other patients living in Scandiatransplants in the Community did not fit.
Scandiatransplant is an organisation of organisational exchanges with members of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Estonia.
There are now four more people on the heart transplant list in Estonia.
"They're still counted patients," emphasised the Põder.
Taali said that large men with a 0-positive blood group are waiting for the last time.
"In Finland there's a number for it for about half a year," he said.
There's also a sense of condition to get a heart.
"The heart of a woman is not normally suitable for a man, the heart of a great man for a small and so forth," listed the cardiac surgeon.
How to finance company vehicles?
In the changing consumption society, the possibilities for the financing of vehicles of the companies have been enlarged - more and more companies are also using full-service leasing or, rather, a more commitment-free long-term car rental.
Vehicle leasing and leasing are two clearly different financial transactions, which include various obligations and expectations, but often cause confusion.
According to the Estonian sales and marketing director of the International Car Rental Company, the Villi Translation estimates that companies are increasingly moving towards full-service leasing and that the possibility of long-term leasing is increasingly used.
The interpreter raised the main questions to which it is possible to choose the appropriate way of using the vehicle when looking for answers.
How long is the vehicle used?
The largest difference in the rental and leasing of the car is the time of use.
"It is worth preferring to use a longer-term vehicle if the company has a plan to introduce commercial vehicles for a longer period," the Tõnd explained, adding that it is worth deciding for the normal lease if the vehicle is to be owned, full-service lease or long-term lease, if the vehicle is intended to be used as a service, i.e. daily use of the car, but leaving maintenance obligations to the service provider, and so by giving up ownership.
"The passenger car has a much shorter period of use than the lease period, but many larger car rental companies also offer a long-term car rental where car rental takes place without complex contracts and free retirement", the Tõnd presented various options for renting a car.
Who will be the owner of the vehicle?
At the end of the normal lease, the renter will be the owner of the car.
"In the case of full-time leasing, it is possible to continue with leasing payments under the same or better conditions, instead of a new vehicle corresponding to the needs of the company," he pointed out, stressing that since the consumer society is moving more and more to service-centred consumption, vehicle ownership is an additional responsibility for the company.
In addition, in the case of full service lease, there is also the possibility of buying a car on the basis of the desire and agreed conditions.
However, there is no possibility for rent and only pay for the period of use.
Car leasing is usually carried out in car companies' representations and car rental from the rental office of the rental companies.
Car company representations are primarily involved in the sale of vehicles, but they also offer the possibility of leasing and, in some cases, car rental.
But renting companies have the only objective of renting cars.
The Tõnd said that the reasons for the use of the rental service are different - many companies rent occupational vehicles, in addition, the service is convenient to use in order or on vacation or when their car is in repair.
"In the case of cars, a full service lease is increasing, offering the customer the transparency of costs, the time-consuming of vehicles in the purchasing, use and recovery process and greater comfort", the sales and marketing manager presented an increasing lease lease rental.
Every year more and more companies use full-service leasing for their car parks, thus optimising their costs and focusing on their main business.
What is the coverage of service-based insurance?
In the case of leased cars, where it is mandatory for cosmetic and road insurance, the rental car is mostly covered by basic insurance and it is also necessary to decide whether to add, for example, accident insurance,ft insurance or full insurance. "When compared the normal lease with the full service lease, the customer will receive more at the same hotness, as in addition to the vehicle and insurance, the hot car maintenance, day care, tyre exchanges and other agreed services will also be covered by hot car maintenance, day care and other services", the Tõnd explained.
"If any new vehicle can be taken into normal leasing, the service provider will be able to choose a vehicle corresponding to the company's wishes and needs, which will also take into account the functions of use," he compared with the emphasis that the full service leasing will certainly help optimise the costs of the company's car parks.
"The choice of passenger vehicles, however, depends on the rental car park of the service provider - the various rental companies offer a small and economical vehicle in their own vehicle park for use in urban traffic as well as luxury business meetings to date," the interpreter described.
Of course, during a short lease period, the desired car has already been rented, but early booking of the desired vehicle helps.
Selecting between leasing or leasing should first be made clear to its objectives - how long is the wish to use the vehicle and which are long-term plans for the car.
It will certainly also be worth studying carefully the various conditions and obligations of services.
At the press conference yesterday, Olga Ivanova, a member of the Riigikogu acceding to the Electoral Union of Edgar Savisaare, said that the Savisaare Electoral Union will offer the Environment in the autumn elections to Tallinn a whole competition.
How likely, however, Edgar Savisaar will assess cooperation with Urmas Sõõrumaa Election Union "Tegus Tallinn"?
The United States Navy veteran was commanded to remove the envelope representing the American flag from the mailbox
The difference between the United States veterans and the Union of home owners of Florida is at the heart of the dispute with the American flag.
The Erus American Navy Officer John Ackert says that he received a letter from the Union of the Southwood House of Tallahassee last week asking him to remove or face punishment in a envelope representing the state flag from the mailbox.
He told the toiletTV he was not going to give up without a fight and has filed an appeal.
"I talk to you honestly as a temptation," said Ackert.
And I think people should fight the temptation of any form, especially that.
According to Ackert, the Union of homeowners argues that its mailbox is not in line with the aesthetic values of Southwood.
The U.S. Navy veteran John Ackert said that he was ordered to remove his mailbox in a envelope representing the American flag.
"We ask you to remove from the mailbox in a envelope representing the American flag, because of the end of the holiday season," the letter was forwarded.
Beauty may be out 30 days before and should be withdrawn within 15 days at the latest.
He said he's been out in the envelope for four years.
It got put in there 30 days after I moved to the house.
The messages to the Southwood Residency Union did not receive an immediate response on Thursday morning.
Some of the neighbors of Ackert told WCTV that the letter was a little harsh and were not surprised by the activities of the Union of homeowners.
"They do things like this all the time," Mike Stephenson said.
I think it's ridiculous.
Why shouldn't you be a patriot in your country?
Mike Patel said, "It's a veteran who served our country.
It's just a ticket from the mailbox.
I don't think it's right.
He owns the house, at least we could afford it.
It is stated by the Union of homeowners that Ackert has 15 days to remove the envelope, otherwise he is entitled to a fine.
He hasn't received an answer to his appeal.
Vietnam "repentant" for German kidnapping
Vietnam said on Thursday that it regrets the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs' comments that accuse Vietnam's intelligence service for the kidnapping of the former Vietnamese petroleum company, which is pursued in the home country due to acquisition charges.
The German authorities believe that Trinh Xuan Thanh was involved in Berlin, leaving Vietnam's intelligence assistants on Wednesday 48 hours to leave the country.
Chanh is facing prosecutions of acquisition, which are accompanied by a death penalty in case of conviction.
He searched for an asyl from Germany, but his statement had not yet been able to work out when the Vietnam authorities requested his issue.
Le Thi Thu Hang, a representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Vietnam, told the reporters that these comments were "very regrettable" and Chanh himself in Vietnam himself on 31 July.
"Vietnam always considers it important and wishes to develop strategic relations with Germany," he said without going into detail.
Thanh, 51, disappeared in July last year after he was originally charged with unfair management of the national oil and gas gas gas gas in PetroVietnam’s subsidiary, which resulted in some USD 150 million losses.
The Vietnam police issued an arrest warrant in September.
In March, the police initiated an investigation to examine the acquisition of his alleged participation in the real estate development project.
The President of PetroVietnam Construction Joint Stock Corporation was appointed in the Government to several senior posts, including the Deputy Chairman of Hau Giang Province in Mekong Delta, south.
He was elected to the National Assembly in May 2016 but was released from the communists’ overweight legislative body before its first meeting.
He was also thrown out of communist paroles.
The ambassador of Vietnam in Germany was invited to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Tuesday, and it was informed that Germany requested the return of Khanh to ensure that the procedures for asylum and extradition can be implemented correctly.
The bus driver saved eight puppies on the side of the road, not knowing that dogs actually own the owner.
"Where I put these eight puppies, a woman would have thrown me out of the apartment with the dogs," said bus driver Oleg, who saved dog puppies who had been spying on the road without guard, giving them over to the asylum employee.
Soon, however, the owner of the dogs who were unconscious of why the puppies were taken away from his home.
Oleg of the Harjumaa bus driver said that he has worked as a bus driver since the beginning of the 1990s, but this case has not come before during his career."I drove the number 146 on my normal route.
I noticed near Harju-Rist that there was something running around on the road.
I thought it was a chef, but it turned out to be four puppies," remembered the bus driver.
He had a heart blurred, and he stopped the passengers full of bus to pick up the puppies.
"The cars would have crossed them, and the dogs would have crushed them," said Oleg.
He added that passengers were reasonable and that soft dog children also enjoyed great joy.
At first, the puppies were a little scared, but then they got fun.
Kids on board, the bus driver went to the new circle because the schedule needed to follow.
When he traveled over the place of the puppies again, he saw four other little dogs there.
It was a German sheep dog with puppies.
They were so rushing, and they were immediately seen that they were taken care of.
The dogs were beautiful, even stunning.
The first thought was, of course, that someone wanted to get rid of them for some reason," said the bus driver that for that reason he decided to carry the puppies on the bus.
"I also picked up the four puppies and called the police," recalled Oleg.
Corracians contacted the Tallinn shelter of animals, whose employee came after the Baltic Station to the puppies.
But wasn't the bus driver tempted to take hairballs?
That's the idea.
A dog boy was so beautiful and calm.
Sitting pretty like an adult dog," said Oleg.
But where do I put these eight puppies?
She would have thrown me out of the apartment with the dogs.
We've got a little kid, too.
It's too early to take another dog," he added.
The head of Tallinn's Animal Asylum, Eve Tobias, confirmed that 8 German sheep dogs, who are two and a half months old, were actually brought into asylum.
But on the same day, the owner came after the puppy family.
"We didn't even shape these puppies in and gave them back," he noted.
"The owner of the dogs wasn't very upset, but he said they had the only house in sight and the bus driver could have asked if the puppies belonged to them," said Tobias.
However, the head of the shelter added that it is good that the bus driver picked up the buckets that were hanging at the end of the road, and that was why there was no accident.
Actually, it was very good from the bus driver that he reacted!
The Jordanian court enforced a life sentence for the killing of three American soldiers.
The Jordanian Military Appeal Court imposed a lifetime penalty on the Jordanian soldier last year for the shooting of three American military trainers.
Last month, the military tribunal appointed Sergeant Marik al-Tuwayha at the entrance of the South Jordan Air Base for killing Americans with lifetime prison punishment with hard work.
Al-Tuwayha opened fire on the American caravan, claiming he was afraid of the base attack.
After the decision, the security camera video showed that he continued to shoot even when the two Americans were hiding and holding hands to stop the shooting.
The newsletter of Hala Akhbar, related to the Jordanian army, announced on Thursday that the Military Appeal Court of 5 Judges confirmed the penalty of al-Tuwayha.
James Harrison spends about $300,000 a year to keep his body in a game form.
Each NFL player depends on his body to earn a living.
Therefore, many other athletes also invest abundantly in the maintenance and rehabilitation of the body to remain in the top form.
Jeremy Fowler from the ESPN.com portal studied further how far some veterans are ready to go to extend their careers.
However, none of the cases are as extreme as the player of the 39-year-old James Harrison, the 14th season of Pittsburgh Steelers' back defense line.
According to Fowler, Harrison spends $300 000 a year on needle therapy, massage therapy, chiropractics, and putting cups.
Most of the costs are related to travel across the country to meet specialists.
"I don't have to keep an account of these things," said Harrison.
"If you compare the earned amounts to my expenses, the payments are worth it, given how I feel."
Mike Mitchell, Harrison's training partner and teammate at Steelers, estimated $200,000 to take care of his body.
The 30-year-old Mitchell has tested the body’s relaxation (in English "body tempering"), which Fowler described as "55 kilos of metal used as a massage roller".
"Besides rolling on it, it's going to be rolled on you," said Mitchell.
"If you have a tense place on your feet and they're gonna move this thing around, it's kind of hurting.
But when you get up, the tension's gone.
It's just going to kick out the tension."
They're ready to make extra efforts, but former NFL players Barry Cofield and Ryan Harris spend $50,000 a year on average to recover.
Cofield, who played 10 seasons in New York Giants and Washington Redskins rows, has expressed regret that he didn't spend any more.
"If I could go back, I'd invest even more," told Cofield Fowler.
"I'd probably try at least twice as much.
I was very good at my career for the first eight years.
To the end, perhaps more procedures would have helped."
Ryan Shazier, a 24-year-old player of the back line of defense, expressed his readiness to enter his veterans in the tracks of the Steelers teammates.
"If you pay 100 000 dollars and earn extra three million by playing, this decision is quite simple," said Shazier.
With regard to the long-term career, investing players in recovery is much smarter than spending money on cars and villas.
The average NFL player is lucky if he can play longer than 30 years of age, the more Harrison's success should convince his colleagues to focus their costs on another.
But maybe they can just find some local specialists.
Weekend Festival Balticu boss Gunnar Viese tells the Evening Page that the festival came from Finland years ago, and its owners went to expand to see the beach strip on the side of Riga, while on the way back he stopped in Pärnu, and so the festival was sold to Estonia.
Gunnar says that they have targeted 25,000 visitors a day, but chicks are only considered when the festival is over.
Preparation for this year's party started in September.
"We had the information from the city that the last platch starts building, there comes a hotel," says Gunnar, the change they had to face this year.
Right now, there's nothing there, but guess if the bag didn't go to the ground this year, it's next.
So maybe we should have moved out of there sometime," he explains why the festival has moved this year.
The festival arrangement is going to take over the year.
People work in the Weeken between a thousand and a half thousand - police officers, management team, volunteers, dealers, security team and so on.
According to Vies, the most difficult was to get a duot of the Chainsmokers to perform to the Weekent.
Men are now an undeniable number of pop music worlds.
Why The Chainsmokers is difficult to get to the Weeken was and how Gunnar commented on the fact that two artists canceled their performances, look at the video.
Bike to Ansip: We have done so much for Estonia's success.
The European Commission's Vice-President Andrus Ansip said to the Chronics that he was sad to look at Estonia's daily policy because the Jüri Ratas government has turned the head of the simple and predictable tax system.
In the Chronics magazine, you used the opportunity to ask me what I have done for Estonia's success and what I can be proud of.
I am glad that we have made many important decisions in the government as a good team and in the months of reading, many of which have been expected in Estonia for more than ten years," wrote Ratas today in the social media.
According to the Ratas, these decisions are, for example, income tax reform for people, pension reform for older people to ensure a decent pension age, municipal reform for Estonia to balance development, the increase in agricultural subsidies for rural recovery and, of course, the provision of a health reform for accessibility and quality medical care.
"I want you to have a good vacation!" wrote the Railway in return to Anip.
Talent on Pärnu Weekend: A drunk man climbed into a car to a dream
Last night at three o'clock, the cops got a little bit of a challenge.
In fact, one of the owners of the Audience reported that there was a foreign man climbing into his car and falling asleep at the tankhouse at Port Artur.
An event-responsive patrol found a man who frightened himself when the officers arrived.
The man was tired of his journey for a while and found a place in the back of a foreign man's car.
"After the wake of regulars, the man rerouted his foot on his way home," the West Prefecture describes in Facebook.
That's good, that's good!

The stupidest questions to ask the bartender.
Huffington Post deals with the bachelors' ears that they'd rather not hear.
What kind of drink do you do best?
Indeed, there are more ingredients in some drinks than in the other, but they need the same skills and fruit.
Barservers often interpret this question as "What is the easiest/fast to prepare now?", which signals them that the customer has whatever he drinks, make it difficult for the barman or not.
What kind of drink do you like most?
This question is interpreted in the same way as which cocktail would be the easiest way to reach the barn right now.
It's not the bar service thing to say, it's the client's decision to make by the thickness of his wallet.
Rather, the Barmen would ask if there were any special offers at the moment.
What's the good thing here?
Perhaps it is a purely sympathetic desire to know if the bar is different from any other offers, but it could be asked differently.
Also, the bartender can't predict what the client might prefer at all.
Can I have a drink that's not very sweet?
It applies, like the previous rule, that the barmen is not familiar with your taste and preferences, and which is sweet for one, may not be it for others.
However, he is willing to listen to what flavors the recommended cocktail could contain.
Does this drink make me headache/pohmell?
The bartender's not a medic or a predictor to know how to afford it to the client, hand it to the heart.
In the cold summer, Estonians have made travel abroad so much that package trips are not only expensive but sold, regardless of the price.
Also, cheap flight tickets and last-minute tickets should not be hoped; it would be wiser to think about schedules for the next year.
The man hostaged the model with the plan to sell him in the dark water.
The Polish citizen took a hostage of the British model in Italy.
The man was planning a 20-year-old woman in a dark, encrypted online auction, announced Guardian.
According to the police, a woman was attracted to Milan by 11 July with a promise that she would be able to work on a photo session.
Instead, he was drugged and taken to a villa near Turin.
Accordingly, the prisoners tried to sell a woman in the dark water for 230,000 pounds and submitted a ransom claim to his model agency.
On 17 July, however, the woman inmate took her to the British consulate.
The police confirm that the suspected Polish citizen, Lukasz Herba, lives in Britain.
According to Corriere della Sera, the man discovered that the kidnapped woman had a child and didn't want to sell her as a sex slave.
Such experiments are adhering to people.
It would be good if we had a hard time thinking about it and making conclusions.
It is obvious that the recommendation to be a friend of the desired background to spend a little more time.
In general, however, everyone could have a strategy that it shares in the social media.
At national level, however, it is necessary to ask whether officials and politicians are sufficiently aware of the threats to the social media.
The lifetime of the werewolfs created under controlled conditions ended with summer school, but certainly not the real wicked.
Sometimes you still have to go to the woods for whatever reason.
But if cool between the skin, it's time to make a hot tea drink.
There are sufficient resources in the forest.
Defense Home!
We are talking about tea drink because coffee and real tea contain caffeine, which is a certain amount of stimulating effect, but is not the best for our health.
Use of plants in free nature should always be prepared for testing, as both recipes and tastes differ.
Some plants do not need to be cooked for long, only for hot water to be flushed, while others must be left to be drawn for hours.
Of course, it must also be careful that water and plants are clean enough.
It also depends on the season and place of collection.
Let us now look at how to prepare some simple tea drinks and what the impact they can have on us.
Pineck catastrophe
The pine coat can drink slowly around the year.
If a day is good to drink 2 litres of water, then it fits well to satisfy also the need for vitamin C and after-commerce to give some extra energy.
As for all plants, it is also possible to obtain useful elements using alternative methods, for example by crushing them - it does not have to cook long, it will be enough for hot water to uproot and leave them for a few hours.
For half a litre of water, 0,4 litres of hoses are required to be boiled for 15 minutes.
The result is a drink containing approximately 25 mg vitamin C, a lot of potassium and zinc.
In addition, the drink contains about 1.5 sugar cubes, i.e. about 20 kcal sugars.
Citron and honey can always be added to the pine coat to improve the flavour.
And when the drink became ugly, it could be diluted with water like a syrup.
Preparation of the mooncategory goes the same way, but the drink itself tastes a little differently.
The vacuum beverage is great, and it helps to deal with a lot of troubles, from the rheumatoid artillery.
Raspberry helps to overcome fatigue, is painfully affected, and helps to alleviate both the cough and the fever in case of cold diseases.
Consequently, it should not be drinked more than half a litre per day.
The vacuum drink also makes you sweat, so in winter you should find a more peaceful moment to enjoy it.
In winter, use leaves, lemons or berries during summertime.
For a drink of half litres, we need a small bite of ox, which must be boiled until the water acquires a red tone.
A image can also be made from carpets.
To do that, break the stalks and keep them in warm water for a few hours.
Longer and more intensive treatment will also make the drink stronger.
Prepared vacuum beverages may also be added to the pine coat.
Black peas
The black peach is a hip that looks like a piece of black burned wood in nature.
It is mostly found in the cakes, but also elsewhere.
The area of use of fungus is very wide - as a hot drink, for lighting fire, instead of flowers, etc.
Ash can also be very well washed.
Black peasants are a kind of super drink that can be used to treat a lot of diseases, even cancer or mitigation, tone increase, tone reduction, stress increase, lifetime prolongation.
Mushroom contains a number of unique compounds and many vitamins of B, as well as antioxidants and a bit of minerals and protein.
Tea made from fungi can be drunk every day, there is no risk of overtaking.
It is enough to drink about 3 x 3 cm of fungal piece, which must be boiled in water of 2-3 litres of 5 to 15 minutes.
Prime Minister Jüri Ratas visited Estonia’s fourth island Vorms today as part of the small island circulating trip, where he met local government leaders and residents to discuss the current topics of the island life.
The cruiser of the Vorms Island began from the port of Sviby, where the Prime Minister of Ratas welcomed Tanel Viks of Vorms and Ivo Sarapuu, chairman of the municipal council.
The first visit was made to the historic Church of Saint Olavi and the next-looking cemetery, which is unique in Estonia for its goat and sandstone rings.
A visit to the Vorms Childreneaed-Pohjois School was followed, where director Age Hälvin talked to the Prime Minister about the state of school life and the organisation of study, according to which the students are part of the school in distance.
The Prime Minister opened a new and contemporary joint operational service building in 2015, in addition to meeting the island people.
The debate addressed important issues for the population, such as the development of shipping and airlines between small islands and continent.
The country has undertaken to ensure a regular transport connection in small islands with stable stability, but, for example, the increase in traffic during the summer period also makes it more difficult for local residents to drive importantly.
These are places where the country is already able to take local wishes and needs into account in the planning process," said the Prime Minister.
In addition, the issues of the construction of the port of small ships, interest education, safety of the island and rescue capacity were discussed.
Today's visit to Vorms was the last part of the visit of the Prime Minister's small islands to explore the environment of the islands and to discuss the issues that were expected to be resolved by local residents and local government leaders.
In July, Ratas Ratas Saaremaad, Kihnu, Ruhnu, Abruka and Vilsand Islands and Manilaidu have visited Naissaart, Prangl and Aegna in August.
For the first time, the Environment will go to the elections without a party founder and a ideological cornerstone.
So far, we said the Environment and thought about Savisaar or vice versa.
Now the Environment has to find a way without him.
In this regard, they must also be lavished between the party's colorful, sometimes criminal and embarrassing past, the supporters of the Savisaare party and the electorate's expectations.
The departure of the Savisaare makes the environment the most difficult situation in the ideological plan.
On the basis of current policy practice and ideology, it can be said that they are definitely overplayed by an old horn.
A number of cards that used to act as trumpets may not be realised this time.
The Population Card does not work for the Environment, because Savisaar can always allow more than the Prime Minister's Party.
Playing on the Russian map is difficult due to the position of the Environment in the government and also because we see here the so-called Savinova electoral union presses the bottom of the gas.
The bearer's card is already in the Savisaare's pocket due to the ongoing trial.
For the environment, the map of the People's Front and the Poor People's Insults has also disappeared.
The first of them is low value without this creator, and the second is prevented by coalition partners in the government.
But one card may be even more weighted.
All the last elections have confirmed that the political parties are successful who can formulate and then implement the main conflict of elections.
The main conflict has always been circulating around the Savi island.
If some political parties have to come up with the idea of a well-functioning contradiction in life, another drumper is missing from the Central District card package.
So what's left for the Environment?
They have a strong party machine and a significant resource.
Even the tape cuts will be enough before the election.
The self-recommendation made by the taxpayer's money of four years ago is most hopefully reimbursed to the Tallinians.
The Tallinn city media is still present, but there is a little less of the cultivation of political gerinalist journalism.
Besides, the party has voice magnets.
Their role remains this time the extraction of casings from fire, because the image of the power force is not sufficient to motivate the voters considerably.
In the ideal plan, Jüri Ratas must find its own way, as the journey with the savisarism ended this week.
In Australia's waters, three US Marines were lost in an air accident.
The U.S. Navy and Navy graduated from a search operation, announced Camp Butler's Navy Base in Japan in a statement, in principle confirming that the Army is not expected to find the missing people alive.
There was an accident with a marine plane of Osprey MV-22, starting USS Bonhomme on Richard.
There were 26 people on board, 23 of whom managed to find and save.
A plane crashed last month attended joint studies in the United States and Australia in Shoalwater Bay in Queensland.
Australian Minister of Defence Marise Payne said that a Saturday incident occurred near the Shoalwater Bay coast.
The woman found a foreign wedding ring in the washing machine... who could it be?
"I started to take the wash out of the machine when the light washing machine between the rubber wires in my eye," says the woman, how she found a foreign marriage ring in her washing machine.
In fact, at the door of the washing machine at first, Karin did not pay attention to the shin.
I put the machine on again.
"Beside the two little children, this lubricated wash will occur immediately," she's moaning.
When the other washing order went through and I started to take out the washing, the light washing machine left my eye and found the ring from there.
The name of the man who married 14 years ago has been engraved for the golden marriage ring, Tom.
Since someone in the family with this name is a man or a woman who might be married to some Tom, I don't know, the ring is a total mystery.
Karin investigated from the parent’s child that he may have found a ring in his yard, put it in his pocket, and the ring has entered the washing machine there, but the child confirmed that he had not brought the ring home.
Karin has lived a year in the apartment of the Madala street in Tallinn with his partner.
They used to rent it out, and the washing machine comes from that time.
But if the ring had anything to do with the tenants, how did it get into the machine?
"Now I'm demanding and I can't understand the way the ring was going to land in the washing machine," she laughs.
Since the lifetime next to the two little children is pretty fast, you'll find your home on the closet at the very beginning.
"The last time there have been posts looking for the owner of the marriage ring, and now it seemed that it was the last time to look for the owner of the ring you found," Karin refers to the case that was circulating in the social media where the married ring found in Tallinn last week was found happily by the owner.
"When Facebook is found and searched for different things, then I thought first to try luck there," says Karin, whose posts have already been distributed by nearly 4000 people.
"The post has received all kinds of feedback and not everything is not good," sighs the woman, referring to the first comments that he was recommended to take his husband to the lease.
Well, then it felt like I needed this shit now.
That my husband has become the biggest cheater that has been heard of.
Honestly, it made me worry at first, but later, when you came to comment, that maybe I've been smashing myself with the owner of the ring, it already made me laugh.
The commentators also suggested that the ring may have reached the woman in the pocket of a different round of clothes.
"Well, the last six months ago, a second round of pants purchased for work came into a washing machine without a more thorough investigation, but is it true?"
All right, well, we agreed with the partner that we already have to find the owner of the ring for the principle now.
Whatever the reason for that ring's disappearance.
Divorce, family or whatever.
I think it's the only thing that's right, because if I ever had a wedding ring to disappear, I know I'd be very grateful to someone who would try to find me and return me a valuable property.
Karin has also contacted the family office to get help in finding the owner.
However, I received a reply that in Estonia, on such a date, and in such a name, the gentleman has not been married.
One ring has found the owner.
Recently, a marriage ring found in Pelguranna on July 21, Tallinn, the owner was hailed to assume that it belonged to an elderly woman.
"I walked in the morning with dogs and noticed behind the 53th house of Puhetus, inside the embedded track, the golden ring," says Gerli, that the graveling promised to assume that it belonged to an elderly woman.
Gerli posted a photo of the ring (picture) on his Facebook page and in the group "Marged in Tallinn", sharing information with the northern part of Tallinn and the North Prefecture.
Two weeks later, the police contacted Gerli and announced that the ringman was identified.
"I got a contact with the owner's daughter, and on Monday night, you found her." The ring was lost because the old lady had hurt her hand and put the ring on another finger, where it had slipped.
"He lost it the same day I walked with his dog," says Gerli.
Although media attention has been paid mainly to Pärnu and the Weeken there, it is not the only music festival this weekend.
There are also loyal fans at the Inci Kurmu festival in Põlvamaa.
For example, one of them writes on Twitter: "I sold the Weeken ticket so I could go to Inci Kurm."
And why not.
In addition to domestic artists, performers from America, Finland, Lithuania, Hungary, England and elsewhere will also enter.
The festival in the magical forest is surprising the artists that are also present there because of a charming location.
One of them, Lucy Rose, couldn't be surprised at Twitter early this morning, how beautiful the place is in Estonia.
But visitors have not been goats in sharing great things.
To get a part of the Inci Kurmu festival magic, look at the galleries!
In Estonia's U18 consortium, the semi-final acknowledged the Great Britain's better and the A division was not available
Mach started extremely fast, and during the first quarter of which the British won by five points (18:23), many baskets were thrown.
During the second quarter, the difference increased further, and to rest for me in the nine-point success of guests (31:40).
Estonia was able to win the third columner, but only one point.
The Estonians lost eight point (46:54) before the last ten minutes.
During the fourth quarter, Estonia’s game was completely broken, and ultimately the loss of 61:75 had to be accepted.
Loss crushed the hopes of the Estonians to reach the A division because only two of the best convents can get there.
In tomorrow's third-point game, Estonia will respond to the loser of the game between Croatia and Israel.
Police are searching for Estonia's spot by postcard
Europol is after the Tallinn nightclub stab.
The Russian citizen, Ernest Gammer, who smashed a foreign man at the Tallinn nightclub in 2010 and caused serious health damage, has received a list of the most desirable people in Europe.
Australian leagues stand on the crossroads
Professional sports are standing on the crossroads in Australia: some areas have travelled on a corporate road so far that they are too business-oriented to classify sport;
Others return to the world of amateurs, which is too central to think of it as a business.
This confusion is evidenced by the tortured delays with players in reaching a wage agreement, the indecision of the Australian ragbile (ARU) team, the uprising of the Australian football Federation (FFA) stakeholders, the ragbile difficulties at the meeting of the independent Commission, and the unacceptable efforts of Australian football (AFL) to be the flag of social justice among the people.
The Investment Banker and the Australian Sports Commission Chairman John Wylie have tried to lead the Olympic Sports to the same road actively as professional leagues, placing business men in leading positions with no elite experience in sport.
The mining guarantor Rio Tintot, who has the reputation of using trade union tactics, was seen as a collin in the problems of the Australian Cricket Players Union (ACA) agreement.
David Peever, Chairman of the CA, is the former executive director of Rio Tinto Australia, and he hired the CA to assist Rio Tinto's leader and advisor for wage negotiations.
However, it would be wrong to believe that the elite men whose approach is unpleasant in communicating with the cricket players do not love this sport.
Peever, for example, was a regular visitor to Storm's home games until he moved to another state.
Nevertheless, strict negotiations between CA and ACA and extremely high wages have impressed that Australia's summer favorite time reference now belongs to more business than to sport.
On the contrary, the unskilled leader of the ARU, former CEO of NAB, Cameron Clyne's inability to pick out the Australian Super Rugby team has pushed too much back to its roots.
The people of the Ragbilite now prefer to hang onto the suburban stadium to watch the game between the amateur teams, whiping at the same time a beer and bruising a hot dog.
Ragbi Union praises the fact that they have the most qualified and versatile board in Australia, but too many failures in meeting international partners' requirements show that this is still too much of a sport to be a business.
Both ragbili and football have problems with governance, as stakeholders require more power.
Both too many presidents, John Grant of ARLC and Steven Lowy of FFA, have shown that their business skills are not sufficient to achieve corporate stability.
Grant, former Kangaroo, led a successful IT company, but he was 20 years completely out of the game.
It became a value when the newly formed ARLC needed an independent chairman.
Too much stakeholders who did not trust each other decided that no one can participate in the Commission's work in the last three years in any way except as a passive fan.
But the pendel moved too far to the business side, and too much fans have been looking for a savior since then - someone who would have a famous past in sport.
Lowy, Westfield's foreign investment executive, is a real FFA president from his father, Frank, one of Australia's richest people.
The A-Liga clubs want to be better represented at the Board of Governors congress.
Their owners lose money, but they believe they're as worthy as Manchester United.
Ironically, FIFA will send out a network of sports and business ethics to complete the civil war in sport.
AFL has recently retired with Rio Tinto through the financial director of the mining guarantor, Mike Fitzpatrick and AFL's former Commissioner Chris Lynchi.
The role of the national leader in promoting gender equality, activities related to natives and refugees and gay rights is too proud.
Some candles could suggest that this is being done with government support.
Richard Goyder, President of the AFL, said as Fitzpatrick, "the AFL is more than business, given how it helps all these communities."
Goyder is soon an executive director of Wesfarmers and the first president of AFL who has not played the game at the elite level.
Former President of the Wesfarmers Bob Every is active in Cricket Australia's board.
The predetermination of members of the Management Board of Professional Sports is often the importance of independence in the face of competence.
They have forgotten something that might be called affection and passion for sport.
Moreover, many corporate heavyweights are not used to the intensive and sometimes critical follow-up of the media to their personal level.
Something that works in a corporate world may not be transferred to the sports sector.
Flynn submitted an improved disclosure report showing additional payments
Michael Flynn, who served for a short time as a consultant of President Trumpi's national security, submitted a report on the improved federal financial information on Thursday containing new details of Flynn's contracts regarding the transfer of Trumpi to the President's Office, the company involved in Iranian-American businessman and the parent company of the information company that worked for Trump's campaign.
In a letter sent by Flynn with corrective information, Flynn noted that its original disclosure reports were submitted in urgent circumstances without the usual consultation and inspection offered by the White House's lawyers and the Government's ethics office.
According to the letter, Flynn was not part of the attention granted to others because he was no longer a White House employee at that time.
Flynn abandoned his post only 24 days after his appointment in the middle of the hearing that he had given Vice President Pence misleading information on his post-election ties with the Russian Ambassador in the United States.
Flynn also criticised the external payments made to him during the private sector in 2014 following the resignation of the Director of the Defence Research Agency.
In the information published to the researchers of the Chamber of Representatives, Flynn announced that in 2015, it received approximately $68,000 fees and payments from the entities involved in Russia.
In addition to the income related to Russia, the information submitted on Thursday revealed that Flynn received at least $5,000 for the consultancy service for the construction of nuclear power stations in the Middle East.
Flynn's work on the project was already made public, but it was not known that he was paid for it.
The updated information also confirms that Flynn had agreed to cooperate with the SCL Group, at that time with the British parent company Cambridge Analytica, which was hired by Donald Trumpi under the campaign.
Cambridge's one of the main donors is the risk fund magnate Robert L. Mercer, whose daughter Rebekah is an effective financial supporter of the conservatives.
Washington Post announced in February that Flynn was hired as a consultant of the SCL Group.
According to the persons who know his role, Flynn was aimed at helping the US subsidiary of SCL to win new public contracts with the United States.
At the same time, SCL hired one of Flynn's former Head of National Intel of the Flynn as the leader of the attempts to conclude public contracts.
Flynn did not receive any compensation from the SCL, allegedly known to the person concerned, nor did he actually work.
The new information revealed that Flynn received about $28,000 in connection with the transfer of Trumpi to the Presidential Office.
The largest published source of revenue is $140,000 for Flynn's work as a consultant and consultant for NJK Holding Corp in Minneapolis. This company is run by Nasser Kazeminy, a businessman born in Iran and currently living in the United States.
The Associated Press announced on Thursday evening the NJK statement that "flynn NJK Holdings gave advice on the interest of investing in the company's securities".
The NJK finances the technology company GreenZone Systems, whose vice-president is Flynn.
GreenZone i is headed by Bijan Kian, Flynn's business partner in Flynn Intel, currently under investigation, due to its role in lobbying in the name of a company operating in the Netherlands, which is linked to the Turkish Government.
Earlier on Thursday Elijah E. Cummings (Md.), in the Committee on Monitoring and Government Reform of the Board of Governors, asked Kian to provide information on Flynn's foreign business contacts and travels.
During the previous security check by Flynn, Kian told military investigators that his partner had several foreign business contacts.
Cummings said Flynn didn't say anything to the same detectives about such contacts.
According to a person who was familiar with the situation, Flynn then passed security checks.
On the stage, the singer was moved to Tallinn with an ambulance.
Ivan got to the end of the set when he was hit by a health defect.
This place was called for an ambulance that massaged his heart for thirty minutes," says the organiser Indrek Ditmann Life24.
"There was a delay in the plan, but the festival goes on," he says and adds, "The public has been informed, of course they also saw everything that happened on the stage."
At the moment Ivan is on his way to Tallinn with an ambulance and it is not known whether he will survive or not.
Of course we hope the best," says Ditmann for the ending.
The eyewitness told the West that the health defects hit Denisenko during the performance.
First, the man stopped singing, then he started playing the pill game, and he fell on the floor.
Jan Newfound came to the stage and asked if there was a doctor among the audience.
A little later, he asked me to pray for Denisenko.
Ivan Denisenko / Augustibluus
Ivan Denisenko or Ivan Blues is a well-known Ukrainian artist and cultural character.
The musicians of Ivan began parallel to art studies in the National Academy of Arts and Architecture in Ukraine.
His incredibly deep bass was immediately enthusiastic at the University and invited to sing a nationally known folk-chore Golden Gate.
She was friends with the people who introduced her to the bluus and later became her bandmates.
The first concert of the Ivan Blues & Friends band was held on 31 December 2007 at a bar called Rag-Time.
From there, the band has been acting regularly, performing clubs, concerts and schools across Ukraine.
English author publishes the book in the backlog
"A Helping Hand" is Michaels, BBC's former editor, and two children's mother's first book.
It took three years to finish the book, and it is dedicated to his filippinian assistants, Maricon Espiritule and Ginalyn Naragi, who assisted in the maintenance of food preparation and of his son, four-year-old Joseph, and daughter, eight-year-old Florence.
Assistants he described as "family members" helped test recipes during the writing of the book. This is the first such book in Singapore, which is published in both English and backlog.
The "A Helping Hand" is available in bookshops all over Singapore at 39.90 SGD and also in exile centres abroad, including Hong Kong, Dubai, Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines.
He thought his colleague had a stomach virus.
But why were his symptoms so different?
At the trauma point, he was given a high dose of acetaminophene to reduce his fever.
During the rest of the day, he was continued to be interviewed, poured, sorghumed, and studied.
No test showed anything, but they didn't want to send him home.
He understood why.
For the last two years, he had taken a medicine called etanercept to treat Sjögren’s syndrome.
This medicine reduces the ability of the immune system and restricts its ability to fight infections.
Sjögren is an autoimmune disorder - quite mysterious disease in which the body's white blood cells attack normal tissue, as if it were an intact organism that sowned chaos in the case of the given case in both glands that produce tears and spits, as well as in some joints.
The weekly etanercept injections had been helpful by reducing joint pain.
However, he knew that he was quite helpless in the event of a serious infection because of this medicine.
When acetaminophen started working, the patient felt much better.
The doctors at the trauma point decided to leave him at the hospital for the night.
If it's a virus, like the doctors suspected, he'll be fine the next day, and he'll be released home.
When Girard first heard of his new patient, he became aware of the infections that people taking etanercept are susceptible.
It was a long list.
The viruses cannot be treated prior to diagnosis, so they focused on bacterial infections.
One bacteria that attacks people with immune insufficiency is a food-transmitted listing act.
It is often found in unpasterated milk and cheese and causes terrible nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea that he did not experience.
Legion disease is another infection that is common among the users of this medicine but did not experience cough or shortness of breath.
Even more common bacteria Staphylococcus aureus may cause joint infections, but again, he had no joint complaints.
Nonetheless, the doctor planned to start a wide range of antibiotic therapy that would cover all these risks.
However, when meeting a patient, it seemed that she could be infected with a serious infection.
The doctors at the trauma point had not given him antibiotics.
The doctor had the opportunity to delay the administration of antibiotics and to monitor and expect, but if one of the infections that he had read had occurred, the postponement to death could have ended even for a few hours.
The situation made it even more difficult for the patient to think that he was allergic to penicillin, although he did not remember what happened when he took it.
It created the risk and the benefits of the relationship.
The decision to start antibiotic therapy normally with low contributions will change if its consequences may be so dangerous.
He asked a colleague, a second resident, to evaluate the patient.
Girard didn't tell my colleague that he was planning antibiotic treatment, and he simply asked the patient to review and recommend it.
The colleague met the patient and agreed.
Although she looked good, if she was infected, she would be practically unprotected.
Your doctor should give the patient antibiotics.
Since penicillin allergy has occurred in a patient, Girard should be allowed to test him to check whether he tolerates a medicine that is not penicillin but a close relative.
Girard asked to give a test dose.
If he had had a serious reaction to the medicine, he would have had rash or his blood pressure would have been reduced.
None of them happened.
That's why he was given a whole dose.
A few hours later, Girard received a call.
The patient's body temperature had risen to 39 degrees.
He was rushing to see the patient.
The patient's face shined from a thin sweat layer and his cheeks were pink.
Although she seemed uncomfortable, her heart and blood pressure were fine.
The doctor thanked himself for having given the patient antibiotics.
He asked to give another dose of Tylenol, and when his patient came over again for the last time, he slept deep.
The fever was retarded.
The sweaty gum and pink cheeks were gone.
The next night, when Girard returned to the hospital for the night, he visited this patient as the first thing.
He had also accepted five other patients, but Girard was most concerned about this patient at home after transferring to his daily team.
During the hours he didn't see him, his body of blood had grown in the lab.
It was too early to tell you exactly what it was.
It was clear, however, that it is a bacterial that is strong enough to allow Petri to grow rapidly and that it is not a Staphylococcus aureus or a legion business disease.
The list of other options was long, and none of them actually saw fit.
It took two more days to finally identify the bacteria.
It was a listing act.
Girard, as were everyone who took care of the patient, was surprised.
As a doctor, there's a picture of diseases in your head.
For Girard, the disease was listed as a disease derived from unpasterated milk and soft cheese, causing nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
He worked on this unusual infection further through material and found that, although people with a normal immune system may experience these symptoms, they usually recover quickly as a patient’s colleague.
However, in pregnant women, older than 65 years of age and affected immune systems, infection may be triggered outside the gastrointestinal tract - sometimes without normal symptoms - and enter the circulation.
It can spread across the body like a fire.
This type of infection called invasive listeriosis may result in death in up to 30% of patients with this disease.
Indeed, although it is not as common as botulism, the listerosis may be as lethal.
Early antibiotic treatment can save life.
When it comes to a disease with food transmission, what food did it carry?
Although the patient and his colleague had not consumed unpasterated milk or soft cheeses on the trip, this summer the internet search identified a listing contract in Scotland related to smoked beef.
Neither of them had eaten smoked beef, but they ate a bit of smoked salmon.
The one where they picked up the bacteria was a secret.
When the doctors had found out what was wrong with the patient, they could adjust antibiotics.
Her three-week treatment ended in July.
The doctors suggested to relax until the end of the summer, but now he feels quite well and has returned to the museum and to his beloved work.
He was praised for preventing the global cyber attack.
And then he was arrested.
In 2014, when the malware of Krono was first advertised in the Russian floor platforms, the price of $7000 in question suggested that the sale of malware is a profitable business.
The Kronost was advertised as a hacker tool capable of obtaining data, including usernames and passwords, PINs for cash machines, and personal information that is useful in breaking security issues.
Motherboard announced on Thursday that Hutchins was held at Las Vegas Airport after a week of security conferences at Black Hat and Defcon visits.
He was planning to fly back to his home in Britain.
The Turbe community responded to the arrest of its valued star with admiration and skepticism.
Some warned that demands against Hutchins could damage the relationship between "white" hackers - investigators looking for weaknesses of the software to identify and solve problems, not to commit crimes or to sow chaos - and law enforcement bodies.
Others hesitated that Hutchins could have set up such a software to attack.
In July 2014, he asked in Twitter, and no one has a model of Kronos, which is apparently a strange request when he was the author of malware himself.
Although the exact details of Hutchins Kronos’ malware relationship are not clear, security researchers often ignored legal problems by searching for vulnerable sites from the computer code.
In recent years, large technical companies have put out "maintenance of errors" to formalise the process of reporting and replacing the problems for researchers.
The Defcon Conference, in the unrestricted gathering of security experts from all over the world, has also had a tension with law enforcement bodies.
In 2002, the FBI, for example, arrested a Russian cryptical surgeon in Las Vegas hotel room after publishing a software that could have undermined the security of certain types of e-books.
The Digital Rights Organisation Electronic Frontier Foundation stated in his statement that he is concerned about the arrest of Hutchins and will examine it more closely.
WannaCry's ransom was infected by computers working on Microsoft Windows's older versions.
After spread, the software encrypted computers and locked users' files, folders and disks.
When the infected device was connected to the network, other devices on the network could also be infected.
The attackers demanded that the victims pay hundreds of dollars to bitcoin's address.
Hutchins became a random hero.
The Guardian interview in May told Hutchins that he registered the web domain after he discovered that a bad-to-face software tries to connect to it.
By registering the domain for $10.69, he started the so-called killing switch, which stopped the distribution of the software.
His original intention was not to stop the attack, but to monitor its spread.
Hutchins, who works in a cybersecurity firm in Los Angeles, Kryptos Logic, said the interview that he did not go to college and has learned to write software himself.
The company did not comment.
Hutchins tried to remain anonymous by communicating with the media we held through MalwareTech, but the British tabloids revealed his identity.
He was praised in the cybersecurity community for this achievement and he received a special recognition at the event of the SC Awards Europe industry.
Senate confirmed Woody Johnson as the ambassador of New York Jets in Britain.
During the presidential campaign, Johnson was the largest financial supporter of Trump and was appointed as the financial director of his Inauguration Committee in November.
Long-term Republican donor Johnson also helped collect money for George W. Bush, John McCain and Mitt Romney when they were party candidates.
During the 2016 campaign, he acted earlier as a financial leader in Jeb Bush.
Johnson's grandfather set the foundation for a company producing medical supplies, Johnson & Johnson.
He used to be an ambassador of the United States in Britain, Matthew Barzun.
Barzuni appointed Barack Obama in 2013 and resigned from his post in January of that year before Trump was appointed.
Belgian officials already knew about egg contamination in June
"We already knew the potential problems with the insect poison fipronil at the beginning of June," said Katrien Stragier, the press representative of the Belgian Food Safety Agency, in the VRT religion of the TV channel.
We started the investigation immediately, and we also talked about it to the prosecutor because it might have been a fraud.
From there, the investigation became a secret.
We understand that people have health issues and we are trying to answer them," Stagier added.
In recent days, the news agency AFP tried to obtain information from the prosecutor involved, but did not say anything, because the investigator banned the publication of the information.
The cannabis in Belgium have been removed as a precautionary measure until the results of the analyses are found.
Millions of eggs withdrawn from sales in the Netherlands and Germany.
The German Minister for Agriculture, Christian Schmidt, has called on the Dutch and Belgian officials to make clear.
"Someone has obviously polluted eggs in a criminally banned product," said Schmidt to the German newspaper Bild.
According to the Estonian Veterinary and Food Agency (VTA), eggs contaminated with pesticides produced in the Netherlands are probably not in Estonia.
"We know there are no Dutch eggs in Estonia," said VTA press representative Martin Altraja BNS.
He added that there are also no other products produced from Dutch eggs in Estonia.
According to Statistics Finland, eggs have not been imported from the Netherlands in the last 10 years.
Lastly, eggs were brought from the Netherlands to Estonia in 2006.
The Dutch authorities suspect that the pesticide fipronil reached the channels as a result of the attempt by the Dutch company Chickfriend to cure the chickens affected by it.
The Dutch and Belgian media reports that the substance containing pesticide reached Chickfriendin through the Belgian company are still uncertainable.
In larger quantities, fipronil is moderately dangerous, as the World Health Organisation reports, and may have a negative impact on human, especially children, kidneys, liver and thyroid.
Is there finally a solution to avoid annoying robotic calls?
For Michael Rizzo, answering the phone is often a waste of time.
His Sports City Pizza Pub in Buffalo, New York, depends on customers calling and ordering chicken wings, pizza and potato pizza.
But most of the time is about automatic messages trying to push fraud through.
"It's getting to the point that it won't allow other callers to reach us," said the 24-year-old bar owner.
Help is on the way, though slow.
Over the last year, the government has added new tools to prevent unwanted "robot calls".
The Federal Communications Commission has proposed to allow telephone companies to block more garbage calls and hopes to scare frauds with great fines.
According to experts, these steps are not a final solution, but they are a good start.
The federal and state non-speaking numbers should protect people from undesirable calls from remote distributors.
But cheaters don't care that they're breaking the law.
Traitors reach people cheap and easy, using "automatic electors" that automatically make many calls at a time.
It's estimated that Americans get tens of millions of robot calls a day.
Of course, not all of them are fraudulent.
Pharmaceuticals, for example, send automated messages about the recipes.
But too often, the situation is as follows: you owe the tax administration money; Microsoft calls to fix your computer; you are offered a free cruise!
In addition, junk beamers use a twisted technology that shows a local or important number, such as the tax administration, as a telephone caller.
In the case of the numbers intended for "industry", the appropriate measures would make fraud difficult and help consumers in the United States to hold millions of dollars, as the FCC group of state prosecutors claimed in the FCC document.
Telephone companies and independent applications can screen or block undesirable calls compared to the databases of known problem numbers and analyses suspicious behaviour, such as a number calling many people on non-record-lists.
Non-conducted service providers also have tools to add warnings such as "Probably fraud" to incoming calls, but they are not available on all phones or on many prepaid card customers.
Verizon and Sprint can order them for a fee.
Some Android phones, including Google Pixel, are screening garbage calls for free.
The multimedia producer Jen Vargas (39) from Orlando, Florida said that his AT&T application marks and blocks certain fraud rings on his mobile phone, but has abandoned its phone lines.
"I rarely accept calls from numbers I don't know," Vargas said.
Applications such as YouMail and Nomorobo offer home phones free but limited relief.
In the case of YouMail, the operator must authorise the "conditional call direction" that will forward calls if the line is not answered or is busy.
Nomorobo is not available for all home telephone service providers and does not work with parents, copper-based telephone lines.
It is also possible to buy widgets, some of them quite grassy, blocking calls on home phones.
Verizon also tests the display of warnings on suspicious calls on home phone number.
Phone companies are already able to block certain calls that are fraudulent.
The FCC has proposed rules for formalising such practice and permitting the blocking of other calls suspected in fraud.
This means that Verizon can block a tax-free number that accepts calls for a fee, but never initiates one.
Operators would also be able to block calls where they know that they are not legal, e.g. 911 direction numbers.
These rules still need to be finalised.
Maureen Mahoney, a public policy assistant in the non-profit consumer Union, said that these developments are "reliable" but do not protect consumers from all unwanted calls.
Firstly, no lists are applied to certain types of callers, such as debt collectors and political campaigns.
In addition, the FCC rules, Mahoney said, would cover only fake numbers.
All robot calls aren't meant to be cheating.
The Consumer Union wants telephone companies to make calls blocking tools available free of charge to all consumers.
In the longer term, the FCC industry supports its efforts to confirm that the caller is indeed the person he claims to be.
Perhaps one day you can see a green bird on your smartphone screen when the caller is legal.
U.S. Telecom says that it could take several years to introduce it, but it would be a powerful tool against robots.
The FCC also looks for ways to stop following annoying calls to consumers who exchange numbers.
If you are currently registering yourself in a non-sheling list, but get a new number later, the distributor may not know it and may start to disturb the new line.
"Robots don't disappear anywhere," said Aaron Foss Nomobist, which is a service for blocking calls for mobile and home phones.
"They're criminals and find a new way to go past any system.
But our job is to make it as complicated as possible for them."
There are a number of logical measures that consumers should take.
Don't answer the phone unless you know the number.
Yes, unfortunately, it's not practical for business phone lines like Sports City.
Stop unwanted calls.
Don't talk back or press any buttons.
If you're in touch with them, they can mark you to anyone who responds and bury you with more calls.
If possible, block the number after the call.
Use calls blocking applications.
If you have concerns about your privacy, check the application rules to see if it shares your voice or contact data with distributors.
Do not submit personal information to the callers, such as bank account or social security number.
Rasmus Mountain: Preparation hasn't been the way I saw in the spirit eye
"It hasn't been as much as I saw in the spirit eye," she said about the trainings preceding the mountain MM.
On Friday-Saturday, there are important mothers that show how the body is.
And the competition shows what we're going to analyse here anyway.
Today, I believe that my preparation has been quality in both this year and previous years, so that it is possible to run normally.
There is nothing special about Sunday, according to Estonia's time, 13.05 starting the pre-run mountain after homemade championships.
In the last few weeks, training is often too much.
I should have the freshness, and it might be very useful that the last week before the MMi was a little easier.
The days left from the physical side go to the launch like this: yesterday, the blocking run and the rest, today is a warming practice.
But for his spiritual preparation, he does not want to be very culminated: "I have not developed my routines for a long time.
There's a lot of silence and peace and no rock music I won't let my ears.
I don't need to watch any motivating videos or read self-help students, but to be here, and at this point, to assess that athletes all over the world have come together to compare their abilities in one place.
It already creates speciality in itself.
Of course, the MM is the year's top event for each light-powered man, and Mägi has taken the contests of each previous start, including the theme, as a test - tried some technical nozzle, compared to a few competitors.
There's no more chance of experimenting at the title contests.
"It's just a goal to run quickly," says Mägi, but adds that if the pre-run and potentially half-final succeeds, either a percentage or a couple of energy supplies, they will certainly benefit from the next run.
Finns had a dance party for their men.
When the first men's dance was held in Rakvere 11 years ago, the organisers probably couldn't dream that the northern neighbours would take the example of a small town in Estonia.
Today, however, the first Finnish men's dance party is held in Finland.
"The representatives of the town of Lapua were so excited about the last dance party of men in Rakvere, that they wanted to organize something similar," said Kairit Pihlak, Deputy mayor Rakvere.
"That's how 2 Man-Tance Festivals are held today in the Lapland Baseball Adion in Finland in the 100 festivals of Finland, where there are 100 men from Virumaa," said Pihlak.
According to Pihlaku, this is an excellent example of good cooperation between two friendly cities.
It also celebrates the Jubilee years of the Estonian and Finnish Republic.
Among the hundred dancingmen, Rakett 69 is also the winner of the over-time season in Karl Reinkubja.
"I have the honour to be one of the hundred men who, with their participation in Finland, show what Viru's men are capable of," he said.
"When the men dancing in Rakvere have prepared for the dance of Finnish men, all their members have set up their work to show a proper level at the northern neighbours," commented Ain Suurkaev, a member of Rakvere City Government.
The performance of the Virumaa men has been set up by the whole dance hall Tarvanpää’s artistic leader Tiiu Poison with the well-known shell leader Elo Üleoja.
Estonian coreography is based on Estonian Choir Music.
The first Estonian men's dance party was held in 2006, while the last one in Rakvere was held in 2015.
In the expectation of the evening's disk emissions final: does Gerd Kanter make the history of MWhat?
The current MM is eight for the Kanter, and none of his competitors in London has reached such a achievement.
In addition, Kanter is the only disk launcher through history who has won full set medals (kuld, two silver and two bronze) from MMi.
In today's (5 August 2017), Kanter is 38 years old and 92 days old.
If the Estonian makes himself a double world champion, he becomes the oldest disk-writer who has won the gold medal on the MM.
Pjotr Malachowski (34 years and 60 days old) has the same possibility.
More exciting facts:
The world champion of chain emissions has become more than one athletes of two countries.
There are nine gold medals in Germany, Lithuania two.
World Championship record belongs to Virgilijus Alekna, which is thrown in Helsinki (2005) 70.17.
The lowest result that has been won on the title is 66.20 - that Riedel managed in 1991.
The results of the investigation show that primates also distribute seeds
Like birds and mammals, primate seeds are spreading.
These insects are mainly known as degraders, helping to dismantle the substances that are falling under the forest.
Prussians, however, also help to disperse the seed.
Japanese scientists found that primates play an important role in the distribution of seeds of the forest type Monotropistatrum humile.
It's an unusual plant.
It does not contain chlorophylline and is therefore not capable of photosynthesis.
Instead, the species will receive its nutrients from mushrooms growing underground.
The plant stores small odourless and pale white fruits on the ground.
The fruits have very little taste or lack of taste, and Japanese scientists found that bird and mammal species were not interested in them as a source of food.
Only a handful of backbones in tarbis of fruitmeat and forest broccoli Blattella nipponica was the only species that regularly visited the fruit.
Investigators checked the broccoli faeces in order to determine whether these insects help to distribute the seeds of the plant.
Scientists found that the fecal tomb produced after each of the fruits was medium to three seeds.
Further tests confirmed that most of the digested seeds were viable.
Scientists assume that this unique plant species is likely to learn to use the ability to distribute primate seeds in the course of evolution.
The fruits of the plants hang close to the ground, and they prepare at the same time as the cockroaches leave their vases.
Researchers published their findings this week in the Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society.
"In view of the fact that around 4600 prasse species have been identified so far, the dissemination of seeds via the cockroaches may have a much wider and simply unreasonable mechanism, not only the unique ability of a certain plant species to use the cockroaches," said the press release of Naoto Sugiura, a co-professor at Kumamoto University.
"It is hoped that the published findings encourage people to pay greater attention to the relationships between plants and primates and to further look for examples of how the primate seeds are distributed."
The princess of Cambridge should have had the right to die.
Her mother said she should have allowed her life to end with a childhood friend who has a fatal illness in the Duchess of Cambridge.
Isobel Kennerley, who was a member of the Duchess Gaid group, begged him after three years of fight with a brain tumor that caused him "extending pain, suffering, and loss of dignity" to allow him to die.
In a 34-year-old cerebraal paralysis woman, a brain tumour was diagnosed in 2014, but her mother said she suffered terriblely before she finally died in May.
Christine Eeley, 65, Newbury Berks, has called for a change in the law that would allow people with a fatal disease and mentally competent to control their deaths "to control the way and timing".
He said that the tortured death of his daughter caused him a serious trauma, and he wanted the law to allow him to set up a plan that would allow his daughter to die decently when his condition got worse.
Chinese online sensors play a complicated cat and mouse game
According to experts, a shift that can affect numerous users from researchers to companies suggests that China is increasingly concerned about the Internet's influence.
"It turns out that restrictions are becoming increasingly intensive, but at the same time the internet is more powerful than ever," said Emily Parker, who has written the book "Now I Know Who My Comrades Are" about the Internet influence in China, Cuba and Russia.
The restrictions imposed on the Beijing Internet are proportionate to the power of the Internet in China.
According to experts, the Chinese control has not yet been maximised and in many cases the cat and mouse game continues.
One day after Apple's visit last week, people began spreading in the Chinese social media a way to get access to the tools that are so easy that it can even be a technical stranger.
This included the registration of a store of personal applications in another country where VPN applications are still available.
Nevertheless, a Thursday test shows that China wants to turn the game into a cat.
On Thursday, several Chinese online service providers said on their social media accounts, websites or e-mails that Chinese security officials test a new way to find online addresses for services that host or use illegal content.
If they are found, the authorities of these companies are asking for Internet service providers to call on their customers to terminate such activities.
If customers continue, the service providers and Chinese officials shall interrupt their contact minutes.
The Ministry of Public Security did not respond to the faxed request to comment on the matter.
Studies suggest that in China, tens of millions and hundreds of millions of people use VPN and other types of software to get past the Great Firewall.
Although many people are distracted by blocking foreign television and pornography, they present only small challenges to the large online community of online users in China.
The Chinese President Xi Jinping has been responsible for the new control elements of the Internet over the years, but has also highlighted technology and the Internet as critical factors in the future economic development of China.
Since the cyberspace has started to play a central role throughout China, the government's control elements have developed.
It is difficult to identify the scope of new efforts, as many users and companies do not discuss them publicly, fearing to become part of the badship of the Chinese Government.
However, some common users have said that constraints are becoming more difficult.
One student who learns in the United States and returned to China to spend summer vacations said that his local VPN was blocked.
According to her, she took this period as a certain kind of meditation away from the social media and left a message on Facebook to her friends to explain why she was just falling underground.
The student at a University of China's Environmental Technology PhD said that without Google's Italian, research has become more difficult, although the university has found alternative publications that students would not always need the Internet.
According to his claim, he has now found a new way to go past the Great Wall without letting out what it was about.
According to observers of the Chinese Internet, some VPNs are still working, and China would be able to do much more to intensify the restrictions.
"We believe that if the government had decided to do so, it would have stopped the use of VPN by now much more," said VPNDAda, a web site created in 2015, which helps Chinese users to find VPN, a representative.
"If the government had sent out more cats, it would be much more complicated in the mice," said the representative who refused to name himself because of the delicateness of the group's work in China.
"Of course, they didn't do it because they had to leave a little breathing room for people or businesses."
The Chinese web-based restrictions are often cyclical.
The present atmosphere is partly due to the closest meeting of the Communist Party of China, which is the 19th Congress in the autumn.
Five years ago, VPN was hit by unforeseen interruptions at that time before the similar meeting.
As with economic policy or external issues, the censorship in China is part of a complex and often deficient political process.
According to analysts, government ministries feel pressure before the party congress to show that they are effective and capable of intervening in the event of a problem.
"This is certainly not the apocalypse of VPNs," said Paul Triolo, head of the Eurasia Group's global technology department.
"In order to navigate more complex environment for users and new opportunities and approaches, China can easily turn out certain parts of the VPN use better at the time and place selected in Beijing," he said.
The Chinese population learns to cope with these problems at the age of the past.
Earlier this summer, the Chinese Internet Giant Tencent began to limit the time during which younger than 18 people are allowed to play a popular online game of "Honor of Kings", allowing it to do it an hour a day for those who are younger than 12, and two hours for those who are 12-18 years old.
Therefore, young people in China have begun to use an ancient solution - fake documents.
Is your "Honor of Kings" playing time restricted?
Are you interested in obtaining a document that shows you are older than 18?" asked a recent advertisement in the Chinese social media.
"No problem.
Contact me to get a cheap document."
The agricultural museum evaluates Estonian heavy transport horses tomorrow
This Saturday, August 5, will be held at the Estonian Agricultural Museum of Heavy Vehicles Day of Estonia.
Estonia's heavy-duty horse is one of the three Estonian horse breeds next to the Estonian horse and cake horse.
The day of heavy transport horses will take place 23 times this year and a total of 17 heavy horses will arrive across Estonia.
On that day young Estonian heavy transport horses, tacks and wets will be compared and evaluated.
In addition, the work done by the best breeders will be recognised.
The protected breed is a total of more than 350 heavy-trailer horses in Estonia.
The preservation of the breed and the use of horses will also be introduced at the Ülenurm.
On the same day you can visit the exhibitions of the Estonian Agricultural Museum, visit the EV100 cereals and ruminant fields and participate in thematic workshops.
The activities will be found by visitors of all ages.
For children, exciting games, the opportunity is to ride a pony or horse, to participate in a drawing contest and to visit the Three Pork Science Theatres.
It also takes place in the summer, where Estonian food and craft goods are offered.
The Estonian Rare Horse Day is organised jointly with the Estonian Horse Farmers' Society, the Estonian Hard Horse Horse Farmers' Branch Society and the Estonian Agricultural Museum.
The Estonian Tõulooma Education Union supports breeders.
The cat Genie was named a year's cat.
A saved cat, supported by its owner during the treatment of bone cancer, was called a state year cat.
Genie was recognised because he comforted his owner, Evie Henderson (11), from Lincoln, for six chemistry sessions.
Evie was diagnosed with bone cancer in March 2016 and Genie’s company said that she was able to cope with several painful surgery and long time spent in the hospital.
The cat recognized the cat charity organization Cats Protection at the ceremony in London.
The picture: Evie said the cat was for him when he lost his long brown hair due to chemotherapy.
"I think he's the best.
He deserves it.
He's always been there for me," said Evie.
"He came to my plaster with my leg and sat next to my legs.
He sniffed the chip and then jumped on the couch to touch my knees.
When I was too sick to visit friends or go out, and I had to sit at home, he came to me, and it made me much more happy, providing great comfort."
Evie said that she had a special connection with her pet, which was a huge support for her when she lost her hair due to exhausting treatment.
"It really upset me because I had long brown hair.
But since it was spring, Genie had the same hair and that I lost my hair, and Genie lost his own hair, she relieved the whole shock a little bit."
Evie's father Chris Henderson said that the cat has been a "great distractor" and described how Evie used to watch his favorite videos in the hospital bed.
"Evie was in the hospital for over 300 days, so we spent a lot of time there, and it offered her something to wait for her to get home for a few valuable days."
11-year-old said, "I missed him every day when I was in the hospital, and my family said he missed me too.
He's my best friend, and I really don't know what I would do without him."
Report: Mueller convened the jury in the Russian investigation
The Wall Street Journal announced on Thursday that the Special Prosecutor in charge of the presidential campaign of Russia and Donald Trump has called a conspiracy assembly.
The paper states that the jury is a new and significant progress in the investigation activities of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller with regard to whether Trump or his main advisors held a secret advisory for the promotion of the Republican presidential campaign with Moscow in 2016.
NBC News has previously announced that before Mueller, the former director of the FBI, who now runs this critical investigation, the Prosecutors of State Prosecutors, former national security advisor, Michael Flynn and Trumpi, were used by the conspirators as part of the investigation of Paul Manafort.
One of the president's private lawyers told the NBC News that he was not aware that Mueller had started using the entire jury.
"We've been working with Bob Mueller and his team since 1 June because we want to get to one side of this thing," he said.
"We have no reason to believe that President Trump is under investigation on the basis of the whole convening news of the federal jury."
NBC News has not independently verified the Journal data.
The entire use of the jury is a normal part of a complex investigation and it is not a tool designed to listen only to the certificates, but also to obtain information and to obtain data from individuals or businesses.
This is a powerful tool that the prosecutors can use to apply for charges and appeals, and this can indicate that Mueller's work has not yet been done.
Trump has denied that he or any of his team members held a plan with Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign.
Moscow officials have also refused to play the role of Trumpi’s surprising victory in November last year.
Special Advisor Ty Cobb said that he was not aware that Mr. Mueller had started using the new conspirators.
"The body of the elders is usually secret," said Cobb in his statement.
The White House is in favour of everything that accelerates the fair completion of his work.
The White House is fully committed to working with Mueller.
Former FBI director Jim Comey has said three times that the president is not under investigation, and we have no reason to believe that things have changed."
"The Flying American" under the black sail
Of course I've heard of "flying" ships.
Who wouldn't be?
The tiburs are going to be between Tallinn and Helsinki several times a day.
It's nothing special.
The Swiss company Supramar brought the first "foiliva" boat, Freccia d'Oro or Golden Noole on the market in 1952.
The technology had already existed before, but now the wind-powered vessel is standing in front of me.
Yes, I am, but it's sailboat.
What kind of formula is that supposed to blow up?
But let us save ourselves the wrong (it is not difficult to find) and give us a simple view of the concept of "foiling".
Why are the planes in the air?
The shape of the wing is that when the aeroplane continues at high speed, the air flowing under the wing and above causes the difference between pressures, the aerodynamic lifting force, at one point the mass of the aeroplane exceeds the mass and lifts the air of the entire machine.
In essence, the same process takes place in water.
The wing with the right shape creates lifting power at a high speed and, in turn, lifts the "dividual" base out of the water.
It's simple, right?
It's gonna be complicated when we get to the numbers.
The plane needs an hourly speed of at least 150-250 kilometres to get off, and the world record of sailboats is now "but" 121.1 km/h.
But let's not go into high school physics!
Today I've come to see the "flying" catamaran, which is called NACRAF20 Carbon FCS.
NACRA is composed of the premixtures of the name North-American Catamaran Racing Association.
FCS is a shortage of the Flight Control System.
This is a system that allows the crew to configure the base also in the middle of the "flight", and 20 shows the length of the sailboat in the legs.
As soon as the catamaranes are released from the covers, it is clear that this is not the Holy Day of the gentleman.
Dr. Monokkel and Captain Sametve have fallen off today.
The wings and the glasses weren't on board.
It's hardcore.
It's the Speed in the Cube.
"It's carbon door?" I'll ask you when you point to the sailing.
Yeah, it's all carbon doors.
"The whole bite then?" I don't really understand.
"No, the whole boat," sounds like a bad answer.
170 pounds -- the three of us going on board will certainly weigh more than 170 pounds.
I'm comparing everything from the washing plant to the evening cars, and it's not gonna be around here - NACRA F20 is like an inappropriate bra for the street ride.
Damn Zonda R or Ferrari FXX.
Designed for one specific purpose - to drive well and very quickly under controlled conditions.
A lover of hobby sailboat would also scare the number of security equipment that must be strangled before the sea goes.
Waterproof suit, intermediate socks, special-hauling bats, sail gloves, rays, special rescue vest, helmet.
In the battle equipment, it feels that oxygen balloon is more than well and as well as on the sea could go colonizing Mars.
"So is there a great chance to go around?" I'm asking for a joke tone.
"Yes," sounds like a short answer.
"You've been around a lot?" I'm still stalking the surface.
Okay, this can't be a joke.
I mean, I'm fixing the seat belt.
The fact that Nacra F20 FCS needs assistance boats and minimum two crew members to reach the sea is also underlined.
Maximum three, so there's not much room.
It begins to dawn why it's not a Sunday cruiser.

As a matter of office, I am now inevitably aware of any land improvement work, whether in the woods or in the field.
Machines and quality of work have improved considerably and everything will be done more efficiently than in its own time.
At the moment, mostly some of the sites that have ever been reconstructed, mistakes and blockages are being sought and corrected.
More stringent environmental requirements have been added to which no attention has been paid many decades ago.
Building materials have been renewed, for example, for the construction of drums instead of past iron concrete pipes, now used to secure plastic tubes and curtain shoulders in addition to stones, such as geotextiles.
In the past, the mouths and truffles were secured with concrete plates (MP, VKP) and pineapples.
For the protection of the environment, pre-determined waters (land drenes, cranes) shall be dug to natural streams or rivers, which should be cleansed from the residues of the potential crops and poisons of the water.
The bottom of the new sediment pools or wings is often planted with wolves or they start to grow themselves from the seeds flying there.
The wolves have a characteristic of filtering toxic substances from the water.
The image was dug up last year, and this week the surface of the wing was smoothed, and a concrete mine was built to take the fire water.
And that some machine wouldn't smash into the shovel, so big stone noises were transported on the side of the platch.
In addition to the cleaning of crops, there is also an improvement in forest roads.
The cross-forest road in the picture should be part of the single road, which also receives additional crochets.
The right remains a state forest, which will be reconstructed immediately from the fishermen to the right and which will soon be ready.
Vasema has a private forest.
The Vallatee is progressing, and there is also a process of renewing crops and roads and improving the dehydration errors that have emerged.
