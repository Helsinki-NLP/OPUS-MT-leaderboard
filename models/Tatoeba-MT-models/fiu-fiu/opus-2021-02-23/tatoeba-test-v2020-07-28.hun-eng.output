I don't think they love me.
Tomi was very excited about the inside.
From the start, I didn't intend to live in the big city.
Tom has rabbits.
Tom always leaves his bike dirty.
I can't just leave.
You seem to have thought about everything.
That day my life changed.
People are part of nature?
You have to be careful.
You know I don't like eggs.
I wish I had a car.
Tomi couldn't help Mari.
Anybody know Tom's family name?
I tried to suppress the burglary cry.
My wife's family is very rich.
Tell Tomi I'll be back.
Get out of here!
Someone broke the glass.
Tom, your slice's open!
The boy kept a mouse in his hands holding his tail.
I want to go there.
I would like to thank you for your great work.
Let's hope not.
Your French language skills have improved a lot.
Tom won't believe a word you say to him.
Tomi got five on the exam.
Tomi's word is against Mari's word.
I don't have time to talk.
Have you ever been to Mexico?
They're having coffee at home.
Respect can't be purchased.
Tom smiled.
Tom scared me.
You shouldn't have gone early.
This book is used in Spanish.
Health is more important than wealth.
That's exactly what Tom told me.
I'm hungry.
I'm not talking to Tom.
I think every fat man should die.
What should we do first?
I don't know, I'll call him and ask him.
Can you suggest another time?
I gave up too early.
What are you gonna do there?
It's totally normal.
What else?
Let me go first.
Tomi left about thirty minutes ago.
All right.
Let's try it.
Tom insisted on paying for dinner.
Take a piece of cake.
I need a scissors.
Samuel hadar.
I like to travel alone.
That's not what we want.
My guitar's in the car trunk.
We sat there.
The bottle fell and broke.
Everyone's scared.
That's a good sentence.
I don't have a computer.
Tom's not drowning.
The former tenants left the place in rudeness.
Kiss me.
His theory is completely distant from reality.
Some people look down on others just because they have less money.
The witch cursed the poor girl.
Tom didn't show me much interest.
Your job's done.
I want to pay for it now.
I'd like to ask you something.
I answered the question.
Mary solved the mystery.
Do you have water?
How can I stop Tom?
Tom just got here.
I usually eat at home with my family.
You shouldn't have done that.
We can't prove anything.
You can ski on that hill.
Tom was drunk, so Mary took him home with a car.
I don't speak English.
The Tom's party was a huge success.
Tom was naked.
We saw a castle before ourselves.
Have you seen Tom when he's crazy?
Tomi also seemed surprised.
I'm going to swim in the river often.
Don't worry about them, just a bunch of idiots.
I regretted visiting Australia.
They're doing the same thing I've done as a child.
That's great.
I fell off the ladder.
Mary went to the gym class.
The report was prepared in a hurry, and there were some errors in spelling.
Tom's not rich or famous either.
Everyone's inexperienced.
Tom's in the criminal records.
I'm coming to Boston tomorrow night.
He personally invited me.
I have to go out.
I'm looking for some food.
He can't stop it.
I learned so much about Tom.
I need a job right away.
Everyone's still sleeping.
Dog crawling.
Tom decided to go home early.
That was our biggest problem.
You're very kind.
I'm deaf too.
I'm so proud of my team.
Sit down.
I don't know where I am.
Tom wasn't doing anything.
He's very proud of his talent.
Have you ever lived in a remote relationship?
All passengers were shipped from the plane.
I need a red pen.
He didn't know what to do with the problem.
Now I'm thirsty.
My dad's going to work with a bike.
Where's Tomi?
Don't be so emotional.
I run eight miles a day.
I never understood Tom.
We had to be there.
Tom made breakfast.
He's the smartest student in the class without question.
You should've called the cops.
I'll keep it secret.
Tom hasn't flew in a broom before.
You spilled your coffee.
I couldn't have done it better myself.
Tom's been a member of this club three years ago.
In my watch, it's so small that I can't change it.
Go home fast.
I'm not crazy.

I thought it was Tom coming.
Anyone who loves flowers can't be a bad person.

I have to let the steam out.
I like occitan.
I see what you're thinking.
There's something to do.
Tell him you love him before it's too late.
Can you borrow the book for me once you're done with it?
I already told you that.
It would be a disaster in the workplace.
What do you think of my theory?
Give me some time to figure out what's wrong.
Tom's not afraid of death.
We don't have enough information.
My home's far away.
The bus is on the way.
There's the biggest lake in Turkey.
The radio's broken.
There are no houses on the other side of the road.
Anyway, you have to wait for the line...
I can't speak Turkish.
Tom looked at his pockets.
The rain has become even hotter.
Tom does that to everyone.
Are you in?
We'll change this soon.
I don't want to talk about the weather.
My request was rejected.
We were surprised at the news.
Don't underestimate yourselves.
I'm Antonio.
I met my friend here.
I traveled all over Russia.
I like to make Tom upset.
Tomi is our son.
He's an alien.
You can't know the truth.
Tomi's a bit of a critical remark.
Believe it or not, it's the truth.
I went without him.
He loves his brother.
Where else would we go?
If you don't like it, you can go.
Tom's gonna pay.
I see.
Tom was just bored.
I don't want to see him.
Serve yourself if you want something to eat.
Dad's still in bed.
Do you have to work every Sunday?
We got divorced with a good feeling.
We haven't had a problem so far.
What color are your hair?
In the chair you were in yesterday, I sat there.
You're not benevolent.
I hope Tomi understands.
Do you believe in ghosts?
I thought I could trust you.
The noise woke me up.
The sympathy is for the paralytics.
In one night, the snow swept the whole city into it.
I'll explain later.
Honestly, I don't really care.
The autumn is the best trip season.
Tom's gone?
They called the veterinarian because there was no other doctor in the village.
I know what I want.
Don't let him swim!
Trust yourself.
Do you work on Monday?
What's your reward?
The dean was shaking his hand with the graduate students.
I live in Milan.
Tom can come anytime.
I think time will solve this problem.
Why did your T-shirt go together?
I'd rather stay home and watch TV.
Tom Christian?
Ask Tamás to explain it.
You broke it.
I slept in the open window because of the heat.
The sun is saved.
He lost his umbrella again.
Let's go to the movies.
I want to fight!
A Nazi killed a Jew.
We don't know exactly.
If you want to get out of here alive, listen to me.
Instead of German, we learned French.
Wonderful.
Is that what everyone wants?
Are you breaking up with me?
You can't believe any of his words.
I love Spanish!
I'm going for a walk to blow my head out.
A little work won't hurt anyone.
A chain is as strong as its weakest eyes.

I'm trying to keep telling you.
Tom said Mary was Canadian.
My father traveled to Greece.
My berber knowledge is pretty ramaty.
The king has destroyed his enemies.
You're talking!
I want Mary to leave Tomi, let him finish.
I'm exhausted.
We have a big problem.
You're too drunk to drive.
Her eyes were red from crying.
You're going there without me.
Tom's gonna be hungry.
It's not a secret.
I was wrong about that.
Buy me, please.
We'll do it together.
Can you help me, please?
He saw Mary smile.
He's in a hurry to get to the 8-hour train.
He was considered a hero because he saved his friend's life.
Your father would be proud of you.
I just need a few seconds.
I don't understand why I love Tom so much.
Tomi's vision is sharp.
He promised me he'd be here by four.
I don't want to lose this game.
The education system is transforming.
There they are.
Hey.
Tom ate a bowl of blueberries.
I don't feel like getting up.
Tamás thought Mary had financial problems.
When I hear the news, I'm going to be a butterfly.
He couldn't resist temptation.
Why should we deal with what happens after we die?
We need to help each other.
My dream will come true sometime.
He spent all the money I gave him.
We used to be neighbors.
Do you think I should tell Tom?
What's that worth to you?
Do you know how to do this?
My father's a doctor.
How old is your tattoo?
I don't have a nickname.
Who loves Tom?
Kill Tom!
I think I'm dying.
What's it made of?
Tom's got a claw on his forehead.
We're cool.
You're smarter than you think.
Did you see my camera?
Tom did a lot of great things.
I was really busy.
Everything has a limit.
Don't be a smart guy.
You're gonna pay for this!
It would be good if we had a collection of the last words of famous people.
I'm a social worker.
The ceremony was fascinating.
I believe your words.
It's different?
Tom has as many servants as he needs.
Tom wants to be successful.
Nothing happened.
You were in the library last afternoon?
I like you better than him.
He wrote ten books, but he didn't report any of them.
Tom's home with his parents.
I don't really want to eat right now.
Tom's happy with his success.
No one's been hit.
You can do this for you.
It won't take much time.
I hate lawyers.
Tom said you hated dancing.
If you have time, why don't you look into his gallery?
At first, I was nervous, but then I gradually calmed down.
I don't want to buy this kind of couch.
You have to ask Tom first.
Explain to me.
I'm aware of the difficulties.
I'm not sick.
Where are you from, Karen?
It's frozen somewhere in the mountains.
Tom went that way.
Tom poured milk into his cat's bowl.
I feel like something terrible will happen.
This one?
Tom's not married.
No one's there.
We were hostiles.
Tom frightened Mari.
I had no idea you didn't speak French.
I had two dogs.
They're totally different from me.
We can't save everyone.
Tom's sitting down.
Where's the moon when it's not up in the sky?
It's one of the best places in the city.
I just need directions.
Tom was supposed to be an actor.
I ignored it.
The dam broke, and the water drained the valley.
You look really pale.
Bring him in.
I'll help Tamás.
I've earned a lot of money in an auxiliary position.
I'm gonna tell Tom what to say to Mari.
I haven't eaten yet.
I accept your terms.
I'm a good cook.
It's an accident.
Can I open my eyes now?
The car's blue.
I've been sick and stayed home all day.
Tom was born in Boston.
Can you hold on for a second?
Spiders have eight legs.
I'm still a kid.
Tom's looking down on women.
This is ugly.
I work as a bus driver.
I think you know him.
That's enough.
We didn't have dinner.
I finally caught you.
I'm gonna give the message to Tomi.
Mari was too insulted to admit her feelings.
Tom should have done a lot better.
Which songs were they singing?
I'm going home to Boston.
No more or not yet?
Mr. Harrison was sitting in his sleeve in his thumb with a lugassal zone, and he was sucking his evening pipe.
I don't want to study French today.
Tom is very messed up.
Go, but without me!
I was crazy about trusting Tomi.
What kind of beer do you have?
That was a secret.
I trust him.
You're lucky to see a dead star.
Japan has diplomatic relations with China.
My parents aren't alive anymore.
Not all black and white.
You have no right to judge these people.
It clearly freaked me out.

That's what we're discussing.
Would you like to come shopping with me?
Bathwater isn't healthy.
Can you break an egg with a hand?
Tom has a twin brother.
He's here to protect you.
Tom seemed very worried.
Tomi's got blood in his stove.
There's a book on the table.
It is important that we propagate our language in any way possible.
When's the next train going?
Sometimes I don't understand him.
You can ask me anything at any time.
I love you.
It's not your hat, is it?
Tom doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to.
You can go home now.
It's just an empty threat.
There's two old gest trees in front of our house.
They're screaming.
The snowflakes fell on the long blonde hair.
I don't recognize anyone in the picture.
I hope we don't make you uncomfortable.
Let's discuss this outside.
He's studying chemistry in Tamás.
He keeps his word.
I don't count on any special treatment.
His old friends turned him away.
Tom didn't make enough sugar in my coffee.
I'm sure I'm not going through tomorrow's exam.
The sentence is fine.
The new furniture arrived today.
Horse!
I've never seen this before in my life.
I'll call Tom right now.
I broke up with my girlfriend.
Hopefully things will be fine.
Paul's clockwork is accurate.
He replaced butter with Margarin.
It was popular in the '90s.
Everyone did.
People are like goldfish in the aquarium?
I live in a little house, not too far from here.
Tom risked it.
Excuse me, can I help you?
The text that the teacher asked Sarah to read was not interesting.
Tomi and Mari both are good teachers.
Tom gave Mari his number.
He lives against Rod John.

There's no money for this to be for sale.
Tom would have walked.
Tell Tom to meet us at the station.
It's a professional survivor.
It's good to see you again.
Tom was a good worker.
Everyone has the right to be stupid, some of them abuse this right.
I just need some encouragement.

I don't understand anything.
What's the price for this hat?
I'm from Trondheim.
Tom doesn't know.
I need more places.
Tom taught me the most about what I know in French.
Shall we have a drink?
He keeps his money in the bank.
I don't care if you believe me.
What do you think they are?
It's hard for everyone to think about.
There's a solution.
How much do you think Tom's making?
Well, it's not like that.
This world is controlled by evil forces.
She laughed to conceal her fear.
I'm in line.
Can I have a pound of boned tuna, please?
Don't be noisy.
The story was real.
The wounded was shouting from pain after the anaesthetic effect has passed.
That's what I need.
How much money do you have?
Concentrate.
They don't talk at all.
Fire out!
He's always asking for your opinions.
We use margarine instead of butter.
I'm very pleased with this.
When the two of you do the same, it's not the same anymore.
I'm not the one Tom has a problem with.
How much money will Tom get?
Is it true Tom committed suicide?
Serbia is bordered with Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Bosnia and Montenegro.
You can follow his advice.

I don't expect this to happen again.
It's yours, Tom!
Get me another beer.
My shoe cord is stuck in the motion stairs.
What's the taste of the ice cream?
Tamás speaks French.
I'm sleeping.
He doesn't understand you.
I'll explain.
Tom retired a few years ago.
We're all safe.
It was a hurry.
Calm down.
They had two bottles of wine.
Come tomorrow.
Can we try this?
The table is green.
Tom should have won the race.
I need it to be signed.
I'm not going there yet to give up.
I don't want to know either.
Destiny often gives us what we don't expect.
What's the recipe?
We're competitors.
Give me a painkiller, please.
You're totally insane.

Something's not right.
They'll negotiate tomorrow.

Open it.
You understand English?
It was early to see the sun rise.
Tom was involved in a web-inarium.
Do I feel a sarcastic?
It's hard to steal a thief.

I need tools.
I'll count to three.
Don't talk.

We have less than three hours.

I'm not coming.
I thank you.
Let's get a pine tree.
It's not drinking water.
Did you know them personally?
Tom doesn't look too happy, does he?
Please say it louder.
You have to keep your eyes open.
Tomi has a black cat.
Boldness produces heroes, and trusting friendships.
He repeatedly brought me up with the old story.
Tom bought Mary a box of chocolates.
My fate is in your hands.
Let's talk about something else.
The light's asleep, and we stayed in the dark.
I'm planning on cleaning my room.
The horse stopped, and he refused to go on.
He accused them of stealing.
I think you're the only one who needs help.
I've decided to join volunteer firefighters.
Tom got up, but then he sat again.

What did you do last night?
Let's eat a donut.
Tom's intentions weren't clear.
Do you have my book?
Please think about it.
Tom did what he wanted to do.
I can see the light.
I'm just as guilty as anyone else.
You're worse than me.
Don't talk to me around here.
There's nothing urgent.
Tom won't hurt me.
It's a green store.
You can't always win.
It's a silver coin.
I can't help myself.
Goodbye.
I'm flattered.
It's ten o'clock tonight.
The road is full of tubs.
What do the newspapers say?
You were lucky.
Can I go home?
If it's time, let's go picnic.

This happened when he was out.
Tom painted the door green.
Just start working.
I'm sure I'm hallucinating.
Tom cleaned Mary's car.
Let's take a look.
You're the most important thing in my life.
But the proposed changes contradicted each other.
I planted this tree.
Tom let me go.
Can I have your full name?
Boring!
I care what he says.
I told you this wouldn't work.
Tom gave Mary chocolate.
Don't complain, don't explain.
Here's your boarding card.
I saw one.
What's your profession?
Tom Mary's boss.
It's small, or there's no chance that the real conspirators will be found.
They let Tom down.
Too bad I'm late.
Tomi disagreed with Mari.
I want to smile on your lips.
Is this a bird?
I was satisfied with Tom and Mary.

You seem nervous.
We have to stand for him now.
Do you really believe in magic?
I don't know exactly where I was born.
I'm afraid of Tomi.
I'm glad we agree on something.
And then the bear ran to the garbage, threw off her bear and touched her with the witch's witch's gave her. In a moment, the skin turned into a beautiful, moonlight-woven ballroom, and the talicska turned into a garbage that two dancing couples pulled.
Don't make mistakes.
Aren't you busy right now?
It's giving you time for books.
Is he tall?
I'll wait for Tom.

Is there anything I can do for you?
You know the whole town.
Someone put me in.

I don't like surprises like this.
He was an uncircumcised man.
It's an opportunity.
This is Tom's house.
I know you can help us.

Would you just excuse us for a second, please?
What's your beer?

We're very busy.
Boris asked me to give you this.
We're all crazy.

Let's have a beer.
What would you do if your child were like this?
My kids don't lie to me.
I'm not proud of my daughter.
This will never end.
They both laugh.
I wish you didn't do that right now.
I tried to help Tomi.
Your soul is ruined to hell.
I'm a fever and my head hurts.
I'm getting ready.
Take this off.

He missed a class.
Can you give me that cup?
In my opinion, Twitter is just a waste of time.
Come on, touch it.

The moon belongs to no one.
We were born for a reason in this world.

Tom went back to the hotel.
Do you have a TV?
What do I do with Tom?
I feel better every day.

We're home today.
I saw Tom dancing with another girl.
No one was in the room.

Why are you upset?
I'm sorry, but I didn't fully understand what you said.
There was a fire near us last night.
We better go, Tom.
You could all probably use a little sleep.
I'm pretty sure Tom won't eat this.
It's only a matter of time before Tom gets back in trouble.
I got on the plane.
Are you home?
Clouds are surrounded by the mountain.
That's my problem.
How can I understand you?
He's in the kitchen.
I should have done that to you.
Maybe I don't want to eat the same thing again today.
I assume Tamás was right.
Here's my membership card.
I'm the only one who got Tamás to help.
Tom stayed outside.
One of my wheels is defected.
I don't usually have lunch with Tama.

You should get some sleep.
Tom and Mary don't live in the same state.
Look.
Don't keep your bike in the barn.
Sometimes I go to the movies.
Tamás never lived in Boston.
Don't criticize me.
He was looking for something in the dark.
I'm not gonna throw Tom out.
Tom pulled a $20 out of his pocket.
I didn't want to tell you that.

Why are you a lawyer?
I decided.
You shouldn't be waiting long.
Tom looks like he's enjoying the party.
Why doesn't Tom want to come with us?
What a mess!
How annoying!
Tom packed the boxes on each other next to the wall.
It's known that the bear loves honey.

I just don't want to die today.
Tom's ready to come home.
It was like a father to me.
You're gonna regret it.
Help's on the way.
Do they speak French in Canada?
I wish I could do it.
Keep listening.
I hope you don't mind if I leave early.
Come on, you're all right.
