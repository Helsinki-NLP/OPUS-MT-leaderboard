Found a 9-year-old boy on the escape routes in Tampere
The police have had a search mission for a 9-year-old boy's escape trip to Tampere on Tuesday night.
The report on the disappearance of a son leaving from West Tampere with his friend has spread in social media.
According to the police station, the boy has been contacted, and he has no danger of life and health.
The son's father told her about the night after midnight that the boy was found.
He's all right, and now we're going to start examining him.
The boy was found in the neighborhood of the home. Dad told me.
Ronaldo again as a wreck - rip the paint difference to Mess
Cristiano Ronaldo hit five paints in the Spanish league this weekend and continued his factory in the Master League.
The battle between Lionel Mess and Cristiano Ronaldo on the goal of the Master's League turned to the latter for at least a moment.
Real Madrid's Ronaldo went to the top of all time's painting statistics when he shot a visitor in Shahtar Donetski's network two hits from the punishment kicks and one of the game situations.
Ronaldo lifted his paint balance to 80, while before Tuesday, there were 77 hits on the Barcelona Mess.
Real won the game 4-0.
Juventus has been combing the Italian football league in Serie A since the early season, but in the D block of the Master's League, it strongly started from Manchester City with 2-1 guest wins.
The winning paint was made by more than ten minutes before the end of Juventus Alvaro Morata.
The city's attack bored the absence of Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, who was injured in the weekly volleyball game, came to the field only with the last ten minutes.
The second association of Manchester, United, also, experienced a hard time in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven, having suffered a loss of 1-2.
ManU's 20-year-old civilian, Luke Shaw's visitor only lasts 15 minutes.
Hector Moreno's dangerous-looking slides hit a paint against the ManU bag so bad that Shaw's leg bone is likely to break.
Shaw lay on the lawn of Eindhoven home stadium for a decade of minutes before the medical staff went to the hospital.
Memphis Depay took the guests in 41 minutes to 1-0 leadership, but ManU's joy lasted just a few minutes.
Moreno fixed it before the break with an extra time.
Luciano Narsingh made the PSV victory painting in the second half.
In the Mester League of the Earth's season, Paris Saint-Germain started the A block.
This was the exchange of the Manchester United shirt to the PSG-fucking Angel Di Maria of Argentine.
Di Maria broke through the right and lifted the ball over the back corner of Malmo's goal watchman Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani made a 2-0 for the second half-time PSG.
PSG has been betten among the successors of the season.
The presumption is not wrong, but Malmö belongs to the league's small euros is not the best possible benchmark.
Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the Stargate of PSG, first encountered Malmö FF in his career.
Ibrahimovic started his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played for 90 minutes when his team in Moscow lost in the B block in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
The opposition party called for a divorce immediately - the President had the wrong speech.
The President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, gave the same speech he had spoken a month ago.
The President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, has repeatedly spoken in the House of the country at the end of last month.
Mugabe, during his 25-minute speech, apparently realized that the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether the 91-year-old Mugabe was fully alive.
The main opposition party MDC asked Mugabe to resign because this is too old to rule.
Assistants of Mugabe rushed to say that the confusion had taken place only in the Mugabe presidency and that the President had not done anything wrong.
Mugaben's speech discussed earlier and now the impact of China on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria want an extra summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have presented an extra summit of EU leaders for the next week because of the refugee crisis.
Donald Tusk, President of the European Council leading to the summit meetings, assessed the request.
According to the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Heads of State should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how to be more efficiently registered in Europe.
Negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers, according to Mr Merkel, are on the table of the Home Ministers.
The teacher admits he shot his girlfriend during the emergency call.
Just a little colored university teacher Shannon Lamb tells the police during the emergency call that he shot his girlfriend and that the police need to come to their house.
Lamb stressed that his "Dear Dog" was alive and probably shocked, and said that the contact details of the dead woman's relatives are found on this phone.
Within the house, the police found the body of Amy Prentiss and the enemy's handwritten message: "I am so sorry that I could cancel this loved Amy and he's the only woman who ever loved me", said in a letter that according to experts, Lamb has signed.
Nothing suggested that Lamb, who taught two online courses at the Delta State University of Minnesota, had already traveled nearly 500 kilometers to the school campus where the police believes he shot and killed the teacher of history, Ethan Schmidt, at this office.
Lynn Buford, Delta State University police chief, told the university staff about the shooting at 10 a.m.
She said Lamb's been calling a fateful emergency call for a while afterwards.
By the end of the day, the number of the dead increased one more: Lamb committed suicide when he was surrounded by a police officer.
The authorities were still trying to find out Lamb’s motive for the day after students and staff had to hide behind locked doors due to school shooting.
Scientists on both sides of the state have published information that students and staff described Lamb as a talented teacher, who may have had problems.
Students told me they were waiting for her hours.
The Prentiss Deadtown, Gautier, police, says that Lamb had no violent history or criminal records.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in the book he wrote in which he thanked the "great people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both were taught by an institution of social science and history with a total of 17 staff members, and many of the students participated in both men’s courses.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
The student named Brandon Beavers praised Lamb, but he also seemed nervous and uncomfortable, "as if something was wrong."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him that he had a lot of stress at the end of the year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked for a sick leave at Delta State University, saying that he had some kind of health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's recruitment principles meant that although Lamb had worked hard for his doctoral value, it did not provide him with automatic career development and assistant professor's office.
University principal William LaForge said that there was no contradiction between Lamb and Schmidt to know, but that "a clear thing in Lamb's mind was something".
She can't answer these questions anymore.
After Lamb escaped from campus, the police got to him when he moved back to Mississippi from the state of Arkansas.
Before being arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents' house in the suburbs of Mississippi Greenville, Methel Johnson, the death scanner of Washington County.
Lamb's car was still on the yard.
It wasn't very clear why Lamb just went to this house, even though Johnson said he believed that Lamb knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the university in 2009 and taught the field and education science. There are 3500 students at the University and is located in a city with about 12 000 inhabitants.
Lamb performed a doctorate in education in the spring.
One of Lamb’s old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and fun.
Carla Hairston told me he was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through friends.
Hairston and his friends were in high school, and Lamb was a funny, older friend who tried to teach Hairston to play guitar for many years.
He was quite a charming man at that time.
All the girls were melting wax when he was there, now told me about the 40-year-old Hairston, who lives in Jackson's precinct in Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were probably dating for a while.
At the emergency call, Lamb told me he killed his wife, but there is no evidence of their marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them at the rivershore brick house in Gautier.
The police told me the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband Shawn O'Steen told them they broke up 15 years ago, but remained friends, and now they have a daughter of 19 years.
"He's really upset," O'Steen described his daughter.
She was her mother's best friend.
O'Steen told me she hadn't met Lamb, but she had heard from her daughter Abigail that she was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail both appeared on the summer market three years ago.
Later, they called together at some kind of work.
O'Steen told me his daughter was doing and singing his own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several online companies.
A disgraceful bar near Gautier, The Julep Room bartender and a timely entertainment systemist Mike Shaffer tells us that he saw Lamb and Prentiss last night until September 5, when Lamb had stopped his guitar and lipstick performance for a rare audience.
Nothing seemed to be wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were messing around and throwing whispers to each other.
So they were both pretty clever.
Dead teacher Schmidt led the first year of students' seminar program and was specialized in Indians and colonial history, told the school English teacher Don Allan Mitchell.
Schmidt was married and had three little children.
He studied the Emporia of Kansas at State University and was the president of his fraternity and student government.
On Tuesday night at the Campus of Delta State, Cleveland held a candle training involving approximately 900 people, including education and other staff, students and members of the community.
Schmidt’s wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the honeymoon, during which the choir of the university sang the songs of Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Learning continues on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," said LaForge.
The crisis is over.
It's time to recover.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report on Mississippi's Cleveland.
Emily Wagster, the Associated Press writer of Mississippi, Greenville, and Rebecca Santana of New Orleans, participated in the report.
The case has been corrected according to the fact that the police are now saying that Lamb called an emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and that even though Lamb referred to her as Prentiss' wife during the call, there is no evidence that they were married.
Toys R Us plans to hire less workers for a holiday period
Toys R Us says that it does not hire as many workers for holiday periods as last year, but the dealer of toys and baby products says that current permanent and seasonal workers are given the opportunity to do more hours.
According to the company, it plans to hire 40 000 people to work in movements and distribution centres across the country, with 45 000 paid during the 2014 holiday period.
Most of the work is part-time.
The company said that the interviews by applicants will begin this month, and the number of staff will rise from October to December.
Although there are months of holiday, the Christmas season is approaching, and companies are prepared to hire temporary workers to help occupy shops and sell, shipping and delivery of products.
Michael J. Fox is joking about her date with Princess Diana.
Back to the future, the first night of the film was a professionally important moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the royal arrival, and I realized that the seat next to me was empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana's place was next to me," he said a future documentary film in Back in Time's trailer.
The movie starts and I think I'm just a little bit away from the date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary Back to the future, an interview with Foxi, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and CEO Steven Spielberg.
Back to the future was first night 30 years ago.
Spielberg told me, "To me, it's undeniably the finest time travel movie ever."
Back in Time is available as order video, DVD and in some movie theatres in October.
The United Nations Director says that the situation in Syria is not solved armedly.
The Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's answer that Russia will increase military support for Syria is that this almost five-year conflict will not be solved armedly, and the additional weapons will only exacerbate violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The UN Director again urged all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to join and support any non-discriminatory negotiations to find a political solution.
At the Wednesday press conference, Ban told me that he was going to meet the five permanent Member States - the US, Russia, China, Britain and France - with foreign ministers during the general meeting's ministerial week later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the division of the Council, the Syrian people and the regional forces "is made impossible to resolve the situation."
Ban called on five permanent Member States to demonstrate solidarity and consensus in dealing with the Syrian crisis, as they showed in agreement with Iran's nuclear programme.
8 support surveys that show that Donald Trump is serious
Some have tried to mark him as a wind virus.
Others just think he's a joke.
Some are waiting for a crash.
Although some Republicans have tried to slow Donald Trum away from the top of the support surveys, it has not succeeded.
Among the last 11 national surveys, Donald Trump has been in charge of the 10th century, and some have started to consider seriously what this means for the appointment of the king of real estate.
Of course, the election season is only in the early stage.
These results do not yet mean that Trump is likely to become a candidate for the Republicans.
The commentators point out that at this stage in 2011 Rick Perry was losing control over Herman Cain, both of whom did not receive any state in the appointment process.
There are also many reasons why he would have problems in general elections.
However, external groups, such as Jeb Bushin Super PAC and the Conservative Economic Organisation for Growth, have noted Trump's persistence and have started to use its funds to defeat him.
The following recent support survey results indicate that the property king is not just a transient phase:
Trump's popularity figures have made a full translation.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidate in mid-June, Monmouth University's support questions showed that only two Republicans from 10 were positive about the real estate king.
By mid July, the figure was 40 per cent.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52 per cent.
At present, six of the 10 Republicans welcome Donald Trump.
About three out of ten says they're negative.
These figures are also true in the first pre-election states.
Last week, 60% of the Republicans in Iowa, the Quinn Market University, said that they were positive about Trump.
Two thirds of the Republican voters would be pleased if Trump became a candidate.
In the CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 percent of the Republicans said that they would either be "inspired" or "happy" if Trump were a candidate.
Only two out of ten said they'd be "aggravated" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson produces the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% "inspired" vs. Trump 40%).
Next, the most inspiring?
Marco Rubio's only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47% of the Republican voters would be "happy" or "harmed" if Jeb Bush became the candidate of the most popular rulers.
The nature of Trump's fire is not a problem for most Republicans.
Although Donald Trumpia has been widely criticised for his magnificent speeches and offences, Monday ABC News/Washington Post survey indicates that 52% of the voters on the Republicans at national level think that the property king has a proper quality for the President.
Last week's survey of the Quinn market shows that in the state of Iowa, the first party meeting, the figure is the same: 52% of the Republicans think that Trumpi has the appropriate quality of character for the leader.
However, according to the ABC/Post survey, 44 per cent thinks that his nature does not fit as President, and almost six out of ten feels that his nature does not belong to the White House.
The Republican voters get used to the idea.
When Republican speakers think like commentators, they think that Trump is a real option.
According to the CNN/ORC survey, four of the ten considered Trump as the most likely option in asking who is most likely to be appointed as the candidate of the Republicans.
At the end of July, four out of 10 supported Jeb Bush.
Publication of information: The Republican electorates have not always had the brightest possible crystal ball.
During the last election period, four of the ten Republicans were of the opinion that Rick Perry was appointed as candidate, and only 28 per cent supported the final candidate Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that most of the Republican voters consider Trump's campaign to be credible.
Even though the Republicans would set up to support another candidate, Trump would still win almost everyone.
Some commentators have pointed out that the slice field is likely to have promoted Trump's leadership, since the support against Trump is divided among many other candidates.
However, the survey carried out by Monmouth University at the beginning of September showed that in a hypothetical bilateral race between Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, Trump receives the majority of support in almost all cases.
He leads Carly Fiorina at 13 points, Marco Rubiota at 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jeb Bush at 19 points, as well as Rand Paul, John Kasichi and Chris Christie at all 33 points.
He's at a level with Ted Cruz.
The only one who won Trump?
If they were to be set up against them, Ben Carson would win businessman Trump's big 18-point difference.
Just and just the majority of Donald Trump's supporters have told me that they have made a decision.
The new questionnaire from CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that only a little over half of the voters in favour of Trump have decided who their vote is going to go.
Of course, the situation can change, and no one can say completely certain that he will never change his mind.
46 per cent said they might be able to switch candidates.
In any case, Trump's biggest competitor is currently another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but those voters who said they made a decision are twice more likely on Trump's side.
Six of the ten Republicans say they agree with Trump about immigration.
Since Donald Trump two months ago called Mexican immigrants "rascals" in his campaign reduction speech, immigration has been in the middle of the 2016 debate.
Some are concerned that Trump's magnificentness drives Latin voters away from the Republican Party and damages rebranding companies.
According to the new ABC/Post survey published on Monday, six of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the center of things, Donald Trump is also.
The discomfort to the government has risen to a new peak.
The support of Donald Trump and Ben Carson now covers about half of the Republican voters, largely due to their role outside politics.
Six of the 10 Republicans said in Monday's ABC/Post question that they would prefer to choose a non-political person rather than a person with government experience.
They're also angry with the federal government.
Two weeks ago, a survey in Des Moines Register/Bloomberg on Iowa showed that three of the four Republicans in Iowa have been frustrated with the Republicans in Congress: 54% are "unhappy" and 21% "problem".
Jeremy Corbyn's first interview at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Corbyn's first visit to Question Time has been eagerly expected since his choice
The new leader of the Labour Party Jeremy Corby meets David Cameron for the first time at the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corby rises to ask about her first six questions just after midday, and it is likely that both the media and the Labour Party's representatives will be careful to keep up with her performance.
Corby has called for this weekly show "small theater and more facts".
He has also said that some of the occasions could be left to be handled by his colleagues.
This meeting is the first parliamentary test for Corbyn's leadership since he was appointed to the shadow government and spoke at the annual meeting of the Central Organisation of Professional Associations on Tuesday.
At the same time, the decision of the Head of the Workers' Party to stand quietly during the national song during Tuesday’s Memorial Service, held on the 75th anniversary of the British World War, has led to criticism of the Conservative Party’s representatives, and has been present in several front pages.
Corbyn’s decision not to sing a national song has attracted attention
Corbyn's representative said, "Stand still with respect," and that he acknowledges the bravery of the Royal Air Forces in the British Air War."
A member of Corbyn's shadow government, Owen Smith, stated to the BBC Two's Newsnight programme that he would have called on the head of the Workers' Party to sing a national song despite his opinion that the King's Room should be terminated.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to be involved in Corbyn's internal circles, appealing to disputes in economic, defence and external matters, and initially less than sixth of the Parliament's party supported him as the leader.
BBC policy correspondent Robin Brant says that the lineusers concerned the role of the party in the European Union and the government's support ceiling have become "fall-down" also within the Workers' Party after Corbyn was appointed.
At the meeting of the Central Organisation of Trade Associations, Corby said that the Labour Party would present a change that would remove the entire roof.
Hours later, the secretary of the shadow government, Smith, said that the party was "preliminaryly clear" in relation to the fact that they only oppose the government's plans to lower the ceiling from £26,000 to £23,000.
Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Labour Party David Cameron's encounter during the last decade, when he has been the leader of the Conservative Party.
The Head of the Labour Party has promised a new approach to politics and now tells us that he has "computed" ideas for questions to the Prime Minister and has received over 30 000 proposals.
Corby, the representative of Islington North, has said that the nature of the prime minister's Question Times is too contradictory and that he intends to refrain from both clever vocabulary and blurbing, and instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequalities and the challenges of young people.
Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the economic secretary of the shadow government, will be his substitute for questioning hours when Corby isn't involved, for example, when Cameron is abroad.
Corby also suggested that other colleagues, too, may occasionally be allowed to speak, and has said that he has approached the chairman of the subroom, John Bercowi, from the teams of the matter.
When Cameron got in charge of 2005, he said he wanted to move away from a political theater that often connects to the Prime Minister's Question Times, but later he had to admit that he failed.
Since they started television in 1990, the Prime Minister's Question Time has been an important meter in assessing the manager's discretion, his sub-room management, and his position with other representatives, even though critics have criticised the questioning lessons that they have become just a miserable, demanding far-reaching reforms.
Photographed in Joburg: Homeless Youth is trained as photographers
Johnburg Center is a difficult place to be homeless.

'I was shot in Joburg' is a non-profit studio where homeless young people are taught how to take pictures of their neighborhood and get a profit.
BBC News met one of the young people graduated from the first project.

The value of the GBP will rise as the UK wage growth is rising
The value of the pound jumped upwards after the figures showed an increase in the UK wage growth, while at the same time the FTSE 100 index rose with SABMiller.
During the period between May and July, UK wages, with the exception of bonuses, rose by 2.9 per cent compared to the same period last year.
The growth rate was the fastest after 2009, and it was considered to be accompanied by estimates of the increase in rates.
The GBP rose against over a percentage of dollars to USD 1,5505 and EUR 0.84 per cent against EUR 1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at an increase of 1.49% to 6229.21.
SABMiller was the most diversified market share and rose by 20 % after the competitor AB InBev approached it with the offer.
The agreement would combine two of the largest brewery in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's share rose by 0.9 per cent after receiving encouraging news from the competing luxury group of Richmont.
Richemont's latest sales figures were better than expected, and they also showed that sales in China - which is the key market in Burberry - had started to grow again.
Glencore's shares rose by 5 per cent after the mining waste told me that it had collected $2.5 billion by dropping stocks as part of its debt surgery strategy.
Packaging and paper group Mondi shares were 4.3 per cent of the major calculators of the index after Goldman Sachs changed his recommendation from the company to the "sales".
JD Sports rose by 3.1 per cent following the publication of information on its return of six months before taxes: 83 per cent increase to 46.6 million pounds.
According to the director of JD Sports, higher wages can damage enlargement
Peter Cowgill, director of JD Sports, says that if the minimum wages for employees are raised in Britain, it may mean that "the buying power of potential consumers will increase".
However, this purchasing power is unlikely to exceed higher labour costs for the company, Cowgill notes.
Costs could be targeted at the company's enlargement plans, he added, which would mean less jobs.
Metcash begins a grassroot campaign against intrusion in Aldi
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA business from the attack on Aldi in South and West Austria.
The wholesale food dealer Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to defend the market share of IGA dealers in South and West Austria before the attack of $700 million Aldi.
At the same time, the Metcash and the IGA supermarkets will strengthen their relations with local food dealers and build the IGA brand through the marketing of mainstream and social media, as well as through the exhibition of events such as Adelaide show.
The traders and purchasers of the IGA have jumped along, and brands such as the ice-cream manufacturer from Dunsborough Simmo's offer tastes in the IGA stores, and trade owners sell discounted tickets for Australian football matches to their stock customers.
Metcash is expected to reveal further details of its defence strategy on 29 September when this wholesale of food, alcohol and iron goods will organise the annual strategy date for investors.
There is a great deal in the game, since South and West Austria represents almost 30% of the IGA of Metcashi, which has higher profit margins than the IGA network of the Eastern States.
In the purchases of South and West Austria, visitors are well known to be corners, and the IGA resellers have a much higher market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: more than 30% in the south and 24% in the west compared to 14% in the Eastern States.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi catches about 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first movements.
In this week's report, Morgan Stanley's analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA dealers can lose $360 million a year in sales and Metcash can lose $ 250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open up in the south of 25 next year and in the west 30 movements, which will generate the turnover of $500 and $600 million in these regions.
Loss of food and food sales and quantities at Metcash's high fixed cost base can cost Metcash about 13 million dollars of operating losses before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash loses its market share in the Eastern States, mainly to Ald and Coles, although the recent study of Roy Morgan found that the IGA customers were the most loyal of all.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food and food sales will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016; 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, so that its market share will fall from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent in 2020.
Last week, the manager of the investment fund and the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, Hamish Douglass, said at business lunch in Melbourne, that Metcash could "probably lose in decades".
Metcash has refused to respond publicly to Douglass' comments.
However, it has been understood that a member of the Metcash Government would have contacted Douglass last week.
The market share of the IGA has fallen from 18 % to 14 % since 2010 and revenues from Metcash’s food and food business, which transmits products to around 1200 IGA resale have fallen by 43 % after 2012, reflecting the reduction of the debt financing of operations when the sales and margins are subject to pressure.
However, the wholesale vendor holds half and has invested annually more than 150 million dollars in the calculation of the prices of hundreds of products to the same level as Coles and Woolworths, while helping the IGA resales to rebuild the shops by increasing the growth of fresh foods, as well as by bringing a better range of products of private labels on the market.
Metcashi, Director General Ian Morrice, says that the calculation of prices and the improvement of shops has increased attractiveness, and he hopes that the wholesale salesman will return to the road of growth in profits in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Steve Healy, President of the Australian tennis Union, supports Thanasi Kokkinakis
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more respect than criticism about his conduct
Thanasi Kokkinakis has had to suffer as a sidelines in a recent storm that has been flogging around his friend Nick Kyrgios. He deserves more respect than criticism of his own conduct, says Steve Healy, chairman of the Australian tennis union.
"Special Ks" - called a talented two-year-old member, Kokkinakis, unwillingly, became public in the case where Kyrgios annoyed Stan Wawrink at the Montreal Masters competition.
Shortly after that, in a compulsive quarrel at Cincinnat, the judge had to separate the Cockman and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice when Harrison declared, "Wawrinka should have beaten by Kyrgios, and I should beat that kid."
Even though the last one saw the cooknakis break down his mail after the cramp ruined his potential victory from Richard Gasquet in the US Open, Healy has been the unrestricted defender of the Cooknakis.
Right now, the young man is in Glasgow competing with Sam Groth from another place in a double party with Bernard Tomic in Davis Cup's semifinal against Britain.
"I think quite strongly that Thanasi has only been dragged into the blast," Healy said.
He broke his mail when he lost a cramp in the US Open, but he's not the first player to break his mail when he frustrated, and I know Thanas well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But he has been acting very well, including quite provocational situations in the US Open with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves praise.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little hard.
He's very mature for the age of 19, he works hard, fits in the team and so on, and he's never had any problems with other players. He's being appreciated in the dressing room, he's practised firmly, is in good condition and is quite calm and mature young man, and I think he should be evaluated according to his merits.
Healy has also supported the decision not to include Cyprus in the important games starting on Friday, describing this "common decision" as a good solution to all, but still supporting the return of the Canberran to the team's stability.
"We want the team to be fully focused on games and not all polemics around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And Nick has risen very quickly, as Federer and Murray have pointed out, and he grows up in the public, and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he has received. However, we are trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I believe that it is best for both the team and for him if he spends some time out of the public to consider these consequences.
European immigration crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes borders, arrests immigrants
Hungary declared the state of emergency and closed its southern borders against Serbia, arresting those who tried to enter the country illegally, aiming to bring down the flow of migrants coming into the country.
At the border there was chaos following the gathering of hundreds of migrants in a neutral area, and the Serbian authorities reacted with shock.
People who escaped violence in their home countries have now set up their tent and set up for an unspecified period between inspection stations in two countries.
However, frustration grew.
As the cop helicopter stayed above them, immigrants hovered "Open the border" and shouted offences to the Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water to protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister declared that it would be "unacceptable" to the return of migrants from Hungary when more and more arrives from Macedonia and Greece at all times.
"(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not causing damage to civilians.
The debate must take place in the next few days with other countries and Brussels," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The confusion of the border between Hungary and Serbia occurred after the 28 nationality group failed to create a common immigration policy at a disputed meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed on the allocation of responsibilities for 40 000 people seeking asylum, who now have taken over Italy and Greece, and ministers hopefully spoke about reaching the final agreement - next month or at the end of next year - which EU countries take 120,000 extra refugees, including some of Hungary.
The German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested an additional EU summit for next week on Tuesday, discussing the continent's immigration crisis.
However, Hungary does not hope that its neighbours or Brussels will function in the near future.
On Tuesday, the emergency situation in two southern regions gave the authorities greater powers to take action in the crisis and enabled you to be closed and to speed up asylum cases.
At the same time, Hungary's Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that now that the aid at the Serbian border is ready, the country will also set up its border against Romania to stop the flood of immigrants through the country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners had been recruited to finish the wire garden between Hungary and Serbia.
During recent months, Hungary has become the largest bottleneck and a place of entry into the European Union for refugees, many of whom are in war in the fleeing Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Orban has argued that most of the arrivals are economic refugees looking for a better life, and not those who escape under the war who are entitled to protection - this view is strongly inconsistent with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force in Hungary in midnight, now define a crime involving an attempt to exceed or damage a 4 metre (13 metres) pile wire fence, built by the government to the southern border against Serbia, and include longer prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
"The Hungarian Government declares an emergency because of the situation caused by mass immigration," told the reporter Zoltan Kovacs to journalists in the south of Szeged.
We are very clear: crossing the illegal border is a crime.
Parliament must continue to formally accept the military position expected for next week, but the suppliers of Associated Press on the border have seen heavy armed military personnel with vehicles and dogs for days.
Orban’s domestic security advisor Gyorgy Bakondi said that the authorities had captured 45 people in their attempts to cross the border, and 15 more farther to the country.
They got over by hurting the fence, now being imprisoned by the police, and they are accused of the new laws of violations.
The authorities will correct the fence quickly.
On Tuesday morning, Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven crossing points from the border against Serbia after sending a train wagon covered by a wire trawl to close one of these places.
The main border crossing place near Roske of Hungary was covered in chaos when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for handling people, and the crowds snapped in.
About 20 people got in, but thousands left out.
A group of immigrants blocked the main engines between Serbia and Hungary, saying that they refuse food and drink until they are allowed to come to Hungary.
2016 elections: According to the National survey, Hillary Clinton's leadership in Bernie Sanders has narrowed sides
Former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton continues in two-digit leadership at the democrats' nomination contest, but Senator Bernie Sanders is imprisoning him.
Clinton now supports 47% of the democrat voters (calculated from 58%) and the second Sanders supports 27% (up to 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he is going to the presidential contest, but he is in favour of 15% of the democrat voters.
More than five months before the beginning of the pre-election, the majority of the democrats observe that it is still too early to say that they would have decided who to vote.
However, Clinton's supporters stand behind their own choice more stringent than the supporters of other candidates.
Clinton's popularity has declined in several population groups since last month's CBS News Poll survey, while Sanders has risen somewhat.
Clinton is strongly in charge of women and moderates, but his lead is narrowed.
His popularity with men has fallen considerably, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton's advance in the democrats under the age of 50 has disappeared, and he's now at the level with Sanders.
However, Clinton clearly leads with older voters.
Last month, Clinton led Sanders in a double-digit century with Liberals, but now Sanders runs this group by five percentage units.
About half of the country's democratic voters say they will be eager to support Clinton if he becomes a party candidate.
The fourth says that he supports him with certain reservations, and 15% would only support him because he is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support him at all.
It is not surprising that Clinton's present supporters are very likely to be eager to support him.
The idealities are more confused with those who are not in favour of Clinton at the moment, only a quarter would be eager to support him.
In which 48 percent of the democrat voters say that they would intensively support Clinton, the one of the Republicans, Donald Trump, says the lesser Republican voter (35%).
When Clinton's supporters were asked in an open question why they wanted him to be candidate, the most popular answer was that he had the right experience (16%). Then the most popular responses were that it is now time for the female presidency (13%) and that he is the best candidate for the task (10%).
Clinton’s supporters also mentioned his link with Bill Clinton (9%).
The same opinions and the possibility of being elected were also mentioned.
Since the Vice-President affects the possible presidency candidate, 57% of the democratic voters would like to see him already in the race - even if the third disagrees.
When asking democrats who they would choose for the second party, Biden is the most popular choice.
Over half of Clinton's supporters say they'd choose Biden, who's much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to pursue democratic candidates, Hilary Clinton's leadership from Sanders will grow, and if Biden leaves, the lead will be 20 percentage points, but if he fails, the number will be 30.
55% of the democratic voters believe that Clinton has the best chance to win the presidential elections, but this figure has fallen from 78% last month.
By this standard, Biden will remain far away, but the proportion of those who consider him to be the most voted for has grown.
However, when the democratic voters were asked what is most important in the candidate, they raised their opinions before voting.
Neither last month, no democratic candidates or potential candidates were regarded as impossible candidates for these voters.
Democrat candidates or potential candidates will be able to do well in certain key areas among the voters of their party.
Most people consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest, reliable and strong leaders.
Biden's best off with the triangle in honesty, while Clinton's strength is the leadership.
30% of the democratic voters say that Clinton is not honest and reliable, which is twice more than Sanders (15%), but 27% says that they do not have an opinion on Sanders.
Democrat voters also generally believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden agree on an ideal basis.
When we look at all these things, about a quarter of the democrats say they don't have an opinion on Sanders.
Although the use of Hillary Clinton’s personal e-mail address and server while he is Minister for Foreign Affairs continues to raise questions, most of the democrats are satisfied with his explanation of the matter and says that the matter did not affect their general opinion on him.
But it's different when you see America as a whole.
Half the Americans are now unhappy with his explanation, and only about a third is satisfied.
The public's opinions were divided in March shortly after the daylight.
Most of the Americans say that the e-mail polism did not affect their overall opinion on Clinton, although 36 percent say that their opinion on Clinton has deteriorated.
More than six of ten Republicans say that their opinion on Clinton has become worse.
Even though Clinton’s own party voters consider him to be honest and reliable, this is still a problem for him with all the voters registered, only 32% of them consider him to be honest and reliable, and this figure has reduced by 8 percentage points from last month and 15 percentage points after May.
62% of the voters registered say that Clinton is not regarded as honest and reliable.
At the same time, 55% of the voters registered throughout the country do not regard Trump as being honest and reliable.
But both Clinton and Trumpia are regarded as good leaders.
Six of the candidates Biden, Carson and Bush involved in the study are considered to be more honest.
Sanders are generally considered honest, but many have no opinion of him, just like Carson did.
The margin of error in the study, involving 351 democrat speakers, is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson approaching Donald Trump in a national survey
Ben Carson comes near Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times survey
In the new survey, two candidates gathered half of all the votes, leaving others to fight for the footsteps.
The Republican voters across the country are still in favour of Trump, whose support has risen before the last month's Fox News electoral claim, from 23 % of the questionnaire published on Tuesday to 27 %.
At the same time, however, Carson increased from 6% to 23%.
The survey also showed that Carson is doing well with various demographic groups and is displaced among the Republican speakers of Trump’s higher education.
The rest of the field has been left behind, except for Carly Fiorina and Ohio's governor John Kasich. The greatest support of Wisconsin's governor, Scott Walker, has fallen from 10% last month to 2% today.
Former Florida governor Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, and senator of Florida, Marco Rubio, are at the level of the third position of 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of this latest questionnaire in September of 376 Republican voters is +/- 6 per cent.
The latest CNN/ORC survey published last week showed Carson's rise in the surveys: he has 19% support for the Republicans, and Trump is 32% ahead of him.
According to also the latest ABC News/Washington Post survey, Trump was significantly above Carson.
Carson's popularity gained last week, Trump criticised the retired neurosurgery in vain, even though Carso apologized for the question of Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday at his campaign visit in Iowa.
Five members of the fraternity are accused of the death of the first year of Baruch College student
Almost two years after the student died in the Pennsylvania Pocono Mountains, the murder charge has been raised against five people.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood of the Baruch College in New York City attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during the membership dispute in September 2013, and then delayed his hospital, thereby contributing to his death, the police said.
The authorities say that Deng's eyes were tied and his back was loaded with more than 13 kilos of sand full of bags, and then he was repeatedly tagged to the ground when he tried to walk through the ice field towards the goal.
Finally, Deng complained that he was hurting his head, and then he lost consciousness.
The members of the Brotherhood didn't call 911 when Deng fainted, but the accusations suggest that they waited an hour before they brought him to the hospital, the police say.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, to search for information on his symptoms, and to contact the National Chairman of the Brotherhood, Andy Meng, asking for advice on this, the chief police officer Chris Wagner told me at the press conference.
"This is where the members began to hide their ritual equipment and thus practically put the prosperity of the brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng," said the police chief Wagner.
Deng couldn't be refreshed, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy protocol, Deng had repeated dull object attacks on the head, body and thigh.
"There are too many families who have had to suffer from a brotherhood imprisonment when at least one student has died annually from 1970 onwards," said Doug Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, in his opinion.
Brotherhoods and their members must be accountable, and this is an important step of the authorities.
The great jury of the Monroe County argued that the first five members would be charged with a third-degree murder.
32 other members of the brotherhood, including Meng, are also accused of violent smoothing and criminal ploting.
"We do not want to be accountable only for individuals, but if there is an organisation behind what happened that has accepted the situation either officially or in an informal manner, they must also be held accountable," Wagner said at the press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College forbidden the brotherhood and the national brotherhood to dismantle their contact with the local department.
This happens when the US Central Bank raises the interest rate
There will be a rise in interest rates, and the market in rising rates will fall, the income of bonds will rise and the economy will have to decline.
We know this.
What we don't know is how long this will take or how long it will take.
The past does not provide much help with timing, which comes specifically to the economy.
The income of the recession has lasted only 11 months after the first increase, and sometimes it has taken as long as 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the US Central Bank's interest rate increase has often been, although not always, a factor to determine how the financial and financial assets react.
Therefore, the US Central Bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on it because interest rates are being raised, but mainly on the development cycle of the time that the situation is normalised.
Indeed, there are a number of variables in the equation.
However, at the end of the year, market participants can find that all interest gains have been overpaid.
"The first increase of the Central Bank following the global economic crisis is inevitably interpreted in some circles to end the age of 'favourable money'," said Capital Economics, in the message of Julian Jessop, the main economic expert on global matters to customers.
Instead, we do not expect the gradual return of the US interest rates to the normal, although still low, to the level is a revolutionary shock that many seem to be afraid.
However, this does not mean that it has no effect.
There is an overview of how some economic sectors will react on the basis of previous developments:
As has been seen on the market in the last approximately one month, the expectation of an increase in interest can make the situation unstable.
As the increase becomes a reality, the effect is not quite that dramatic.
“It seems that the return on capital tends to stop for 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy,” said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after the increase of the central bank.
In particular, over the last 35 years, the market is generally strong, around 14% increases when it is approaching, 250 days afterwards, the situation is relatively steady (average increase of 2.6%), and the normal state has been achieved after 500 days with average output of 14.4% in the last six cycles, reports the recent analysis of the leading capital strategy of the Nuveen Asset Management Bob Doll, which was published in Barron's magazine.
According to Deutche Bank, the impact on shares is generally more clear at the later stage of the increase cycle when the income begins to decrease.
Returns are part of economic life, but interest payments often contribute to their income.
In the current situation, the central bank faces certain challenges that have not been before and which can speed up the recession.
This is particularly the gross national product, which will be the nearest to its lowest level of all time before the central bank's increase.
According to Deutsche Bank, in the 118 increases made since 1950, the nominal annual GDP has only twice been less than 4.5%.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 per cent, few believe that it will remain after the third quarter has progressed by 1.5 per cent, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta reports.
The increase in interest rates in this fragile economic regulation may be risky and raise the question of whether this is different, Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants are reserved for the increase of the central bank throughout the year and all are waiting for the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which ends on Thursday.
Although many strategics and economic experts believe that the Committee can accept the increase at this meeting, the future trade expects only 25% of the probability.
"Our research shows that since 1950, all the increase cycles have so far occurred in the super-cycles of increasing leverage effect, where GDP has passed its peak very quickly before the recession," says the report.
On the other hand, there has been an exceptionally slow recovery from the recession that has been the worst during the observation period.
In the current cycle, the central bank has expected the most far away from the end of the last recession: the record has been 35 months, and now it is already in progress for 74 months.
Fixed return has also been unstable when the market is expected to increase, and the model reflects some of the capital observations.
The main difference is that when the central bank changes its line, its effects are seen faster in debt instruments than in shares.
The trend of debt returns appears to change immediately in the case of the first increase/operation of the cycle.
At the end of the interest rate cycle, the return on debts will fall immediately," said Deutche Bank.
The Charles Schwab Strates believe that the increase in interest rates leads to a convergence of the return on long-term and short-term debt instruments, thus evenling the return curve.
High-profit bonds often produce better in such a situation, although "we are still cautious about finding profits," said Schwab's solid return analyst Kathy Jones in an analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market has already adapted to the central bank's policy expectations.
"In addition to the decline in the strength and inflation expectations of Dollar, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the outlook of tighter monetary policy," he wrote.
The short-term interest rates are high, the return curve is evener, the credit margins have increased and the instability has increased - all these are specific to the market when the central bank has tightened its line.
Generally speaking, firms whose business is mostly located in the United States will win when interest rates are rising and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a lot of debt are doing worse when the increase in the value of the dollar makes their products more expensive on the world market and their debts become more expensive than they have to finance.
"History shows that "quality" shares are generally more profitable in the three months following the first interest rate", the Goldman Sachs analysts stated in their report to customers.
Companies with strong turnover missed poor turnover by five percentage points after increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high return on capital and low volatile shares were better performing than low-quality companies. Firstly, the average was 4 (percentage units) and the latter 3 (percentage units).
The debt will be a big problem.
Those companies with a lot of variable interest debts are losing the most, said Goldman.
In addition to the discretion, consumers will also have the opportunity to benefit from the increase in the value of the dollar.
Saviors can also gain profit with higher profits, even though experts disagree on how fast they feel about the impact.
BBC Radio is a copy of the Classic FM, Ms. Andrew Bingham says
Conservative Chancellor Andrew Bingham is accusing the channel of "nationalism"
He claims that it will become increasingly difficult to separate it from a commercial competitor.
In addition, he took the BBC Music Awards, saying that they were merely imitating the British Awards
The Voice was criticised by the Colleague of Nations, Damien Collins, saying that it is not original either.
BBC Radio 3 is becoming Classic FM, claiming the leading representative of the production company's pressure to prove that it is doing something that commercial production companies do not.
Conservative Chairman Andrew Bingham also said to the leaders of BBC that the public service radio channel had an impact on its "national awareness" content and that it is increasingly difficult to separate from a commercial competitor.
"I don't want to use the term "national sense" to turn into Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards Awards, which was launched last December.
"The last year, the BBC Music Awards appears to be just a British Awards under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different, here are the two examples that I have just remembered when you actually just copied something that already exists on the market," said Bingham.
The Director General of BBC challenged the charges claiming that BBC Radio 3 is much ahead of his commercial competitor as regards live music and sharing information to citizens.
Radio 3 teaches things about classical music that I can't learn from anywhere else.
Its commitment to live music and music is actually the first class.
"In addition, I think it is very important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and ordering new works," he said.
Earlier this year, the head of BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, claimed that the channel needs to work more than before to reach the audience, because the British know less about classical music.
Radio 3 was, however, not the only part of the BBC's offer, criticised for entering the toes of commercial competitors during the consultation of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Damien Collins, the Conservative Tory People's Representative, criticised The Voice, the music competition that BBC bought from the Dutch production company Talpa Media, estimated at 22 million pounds.
Do you understand why this programme is often discussed because it is not original, and it is not self-speaking?
Lord Hall claimed that this program of the BBC1 channel, in which Paloma Faith and Boy George as star judges, was produced in particular by "BBC style".
He added that he wanted the production company to "recover success within his own house" for the next time it starts the entertainment series.
However, he did not agree to prevent the production of future The Voice periods, or to order that the money of the authors would be used for other forms of entertainment.
Online sales rose so far at least in August, Black Friday may be the reason for
Online sales rose by 7 per cent in the first three months of 2015
The increase last month was low after the beginning of statistics in 2000
Three years ago, online sales confirmed the use of mobile devices for shopping
Experts believe that November Black Friday may control consumption
For over a decade, virtual purchases have grown dramatically and have turned many of the British shopping skates into ghost cities.
However, experts say that there are signs of a level playing field in the air when the latest figures showed only a rise of 7% to the first quarter of 2015.
The total August consumption grew at least after the beginning of statistics in 2000: only 5 per cent of the increase in last year.
Experts say that there are signs of a level playing field in the air when the latest figures showed only a rise of 7% for the first quarter of 2015.
"If you look at the growth levels of the previous years and return to 2000, it was clear that the situation would be rationalised over time," Andy Mulcahy, the JMRG sales index supplier, told Guardian.
He explained that three years ago, online sales were strengthened when buyers started using their mobile phones for shopping.
This meant that more people were shopping online and that they could be made in different environments, such as the couch.
But now it balances, and (growth) can count.
The Black Friday phenomenon from America has been considered one of the reasons behind the slowing shops.
Experts believe that consumers will control shopping before the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times more buyers roamed on their computers to pick up shops, pouring down many traders' websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which has caused buyers to argue about findings, can control the purchases.
The investigation published by the British Retail Consortium found that only about one pound of five were used online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are now made online.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes from the net instead of using fashion chains for shopping.
Muslims bury the deaths of Meka in a lifting calamity, Bin Laden’s family with penalties
The Muslims carried 29 dead bodies across the streets during the first funeral in Meka
Saudi Arabia has partly been accused of a collapse of the building waste Saudi Binladin Group
The Ministry of Health told me that 394 people were also injured when the lifting curve collapsed
29 dead were carried in the air through the streets, when hundreds of Muslims were gathered to bury them. The victims died, when the lift was collapsed in the great mosque of Meka.
In the main case, white-dressed grievers filled the route to honor the first dead who made their last journey to the graveyard of Al-Moaissem.
The sad passage passed the holy place, where only a few days ago, the lifter fell through the mosque roof and shred the worshipers.
The bodies were released to be buried when the King of Saudi Arabia confirmed Bin Laden’s family’s construction group guilty of a disaster where 394 people were also injured.
29 bodies were carried through the streets of the worshipers of the great mosque of the meka lifting trap.
Among the deaths, the father of four children was Qasim Akram from Bolton from Manchester, with his first pilgrim when the lifting curve collapsed.
Akram had been in a big mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hajj-Photo.
The Saudi authorities have already sworn that the Haji Mekka will continue as thousands of continually arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman stated that the Binlad Group should not have left the crane up when it was not in use.
The Arabic version of the decision published by the Saudi Press Agency, which was led by the State, stated that the Binlad Group was partly responsible for the collapse.
The English service of the news agency did not mention this detail, but it said that the company’s leaders were prohibited from traveling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salma swore to find out what caused the fall of the lifting curves to the yard of the great mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had been gathered later before this month’s rumor holiday.
The Binlad Group has not published any communications on the collapse of misery and has not been caught to comment.
The royal decision also accused the group that it did not use up-to-date protective measures and did not cooperate with the meteorological authorities.
There are dozens of lifts around the Meka's big mosque, which are part of a huge building robbery led by Binlad's Group.
Binladin’s family has been close to the Saudi Arabia ruler family for decades, leading large construction projects.
Al-Qaida's late leader Osama bin Laden was a rebel son whose family refused in the 1990s.
The collapse occurred in wind and rainy weather only days before millions of people arrive in the Kingdom for a pilgrim that each capable Muslim must do at least once in their lives.
The authorities say that 158 people are still in the hospital.
The authorities charged a million rials (174 000 GBP) to the families of the dead and to those who were permanently injured.
The rest of the injured will receive half of this amount.
Boss B & Q says the Eastern Europeans are behind popularity.
The British increasingly use assistant services, Veronique Laury says
The number of professionals coming from Eastern Europe is behind the rise
The result of Screwfix trades for professionals is 200 more
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B & Q stores around the country
Writer Rupert Steiner, City chief correspondent to Daily Mail
It is said that the British would give up their hammers and paints and rather hire skilled Eastern European workers to do homework
Looks like if you're a clever hammer or you're painting the walls, you're in a minority now.
You see, the British are increasingly hiring assistants to do tea-se-se-work in their homes, tells the boss of the company behind B&Q.
The new President of Kingfisher, owned by the home renovation trading chain, Veronique Laury said that the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is behind the popularity and that they offer their services at a price of ridicule.
This leads to the planning of Kingfisher to open up 200 new Screwfix trades for employees and to close 60 B&Q sales.
Laury said that he would like more women to work in B&Q shops because eight of the purchase decisions made in ten trades were made by a more beautiful sex.
Today, most of the staff are men.
He said that changes in the population need to be taken into account: today there are more economies of one woman in which more homework are being done than before.
Laury said, "The most part of our shops' staff is still men.
We have to get a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women and 80% of the purchase decisions are made by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process."
Laury is one of the only five women leading the main companies of the UK FTSE100 index, rebuilding their management team so that it has equally the number of men and females.
Kingfisher is almost the only company with 50% of women in the group, including its Director-General and the Financial Director.
Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - the differentiation is important here.
It's not hard to find good women in the leadership group."
Kingfisher reported the invoice in both six months of production and sales after the group took on board the costs of closing shops.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher owned Screwfix and B&Q stores is opening 200 new moves
The government of three aces decided to rely on forceful legislation to save the economy of the country.
The apparent effects were gained pretty quickly.
The sharp head of the SAK and other recipient centre organisations began to force the country to stand on Friday due to the widespread demonstration of workers.
A lot of people then think that there is also reason.
Let's ask if it's worth strikes when it's going bad anyway.
Even a resistance movement has been set up.
More than 50,000 people have already gone to the Internet to announce that they are not going to participate in the demonstration, but they are going to work.
In an old good time of consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no Internet where to protest, but openly speaking as a wealthy would have been a political suicide for a small person.
Millions of trade unions a few tens of thousands of people's protests do not delay much, but it gives us the subject of thinking.
The position of the trade union movement is no longer as obvious as it has been a couple of decades ago.
Not everyone knows the goal of the movement, values have changed
From the point of view of the interest of the Ay movement, the government's strong solutions can also be seen as a direct gift of heaven.
Once things have seemed to be rolling on their own weight for years, the unions are finally getting involved, i.e. the workers' rights to defend, be visible and properly.
This is how the government may want to imprison the role of the ay movement, when the membership of the trade union may be considered more necessary than before.
Being whatever you think about the activities of the organizations, it's nuts that the Friday demonstration would somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial production has declined for 31 months consecutively.
Gross domestic product will continue to decline and unemployment will rise.
These things would think they'd force everyone's head.
Hard savings for Lappeenranta University: Objective 8.5 million savings, staff cut by 130
The University of Lappeenranda will start a savings rate with a view to obtaining a cost reduction of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the savings, the university will start the YT negotiations for all staff, with a savings target of 6.5 million per year.
In practice, it means reducing around 130 employees.
The rest of the action is also intended to save two million.
In the light of the YT negotiations, the 2016 budget is expected to be 8.5 million deficits.
It is also affected by the government's budget cuts.
During this financial year, the university will result in some 2.6 million deficits.
Costs will grow slightly next year, but the funding from the Ministry will be reduced by EUR 2 million and other EUR 3.2 million.
The total budget of the university is around EUR 85 million, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The interaction between operations of massive teaching and research, as well as the reduction in corporate financing, is very important for our university, says Principal Anneli Pauli at the University's Newsletter.
Before the summer, the impact of the operations seemed even more moderate, but now the reduction in the additional funding appears to be in new proportions.
Negotiations with the trustees will be initiated on Tuesday next week and will last for the six weeks prescribed by the law.
Yle: Onnibus wants for Finnish railroads
The owner of the cheap bus company Onnibus, the British Sir Brian Souter, tells Yle that the company is also targeting rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in joining Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest rail transport companies in Britain, Souter tells me.
Rail transport is to be opened gradually to competition.
The first is the near transport of the capital region in 2017-2018.
There's a long-distance traffic after close traffic.
Souter says he's already approached the Ministry of Transport.
According to Yle, at the Ministry of Transport, Onnibus's plans are welcome.
At least Transdev (former Veolia) has announced interest in other international companies in rail transport, which also has bus traffic in Finland and rail transport in other parts of Europe.
The US Central Bank must take decisions on interest rates
The rest of the world follows from the side when the United States Central Bank meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time for almost a decade.
When Reuters asked 80 economic scientists a little more than half of those who still believed the central bank to raise interest rates last week, they now believe that the situation is not yet resolved and that interest rates are kept at the current level of 0-0.25%.
This is an historic event, as the central bank has cut interest rates at zero is seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching the situation where the central central bank has the opportunity to get out of the zero level and start normalising interest rates," said Angel Ubide, Peterson Institue for International Economics.
The US economy has worked relatively well and the recovery has brought billions of dollars to balance and created a little inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore less rose global visions.
It has warned the market that they should be ready for lifting, but the signs show that they also believe that the probability is against the increase.
The decision will be published on Thursday at 10 a.m. (CET).
Delta State University shooter left an apology message.
After shooting her girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning before she shot her colleague later on the same day, Shannon Lamb wrote a message saying she was "should" about the first murder and hoped that she could cancel it", the authorities said on Tuesday.
Mississippi Gautier's police told me that Delta State University's geographic and social science teacher Lamb called the emergency number about 10 a.m.
Monday and told me that he's shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the defendant that the police had to send officers to his house.
He said, "He killed his wife last night" and also mentioned that there was a "blooded dog" in the house that was "no interference with anyone," but he's probably shocked.
The police asked the caller the name of this, but he didn't say it.
Lamb didn't explain the shooting.
When the police arrived, there was a 41-year-old Amy Prentiss' body and a 45-year-old Lamb's hand-written message that read: "I'm so sorry I could cancel it.
I loved Amy and she was the only person who ever loved me."
After writing the message, Lamb drove almost 500 kilometers to Delta State, where he killed historic teacher Ethan Schmidt, before he finally killed himself late on Monday when he surrounded the police.
University principal William LaForge said that there was no contradiction between Lamb and Schmidt to know, but that "a clear thing in Lamb's mind was something".
On Tuesday, the authorities said that despite the claims published on Monday that Lamb believed that Prentiss had been in relation to Schmidt, there was no "information or evidence" of any "three-double-double-double-double-double-double-double-double-double-double-double-double-double-double-double-double-double-double-double-double-double-double-double-double-double-double-double-double-double-double-double-double-double-double.
Shawn O'Steen told me she was married to Prentiss for about seven years and described her as "good man".
A couple of them broke up 15 years ago, but they stayed friends.
O'Steen told me that she and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who's been "aggregated".
O'Steen told me that Prentiss and his daughter were "the best friends of all."
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss worked at home by hand online. According to Sun Herald, Knowles was a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles told me that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"He always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
The police told me that Lamb called his relatives somewhere on Monday to tell them that he's not going to prison.
When the police reached Lamb highway 1 later near Greenville the same night, Lamb stopped his car off the road, left it there and ran into the woods where he shot himself.
Lamb argued about education science Delta States in spring 2015, reports the CV on the University’s website.
Stars who lost their charming power
The actor (in the left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), has been tough in recent years.
In 2001 he suffered from leukaemia, and in 2009 his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
According to the rumors, he has also had problems with drugs, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
Everything like this really requires its taxes.
Manchester United Luke Shaw is out for months due to double fracture
Luke Shaw had a double fracture in his right leg when Manchester United lost to PSV Eindhoven in the Mestaries League.
Even if the defender stays tears and is out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw will be able to play this season.
Injury was caused by Hector Moreno's severity in 15 minutes after the 20-year-old Shaw had fallen into the PSV area.
She was treated for nine minutes on the field, and she had to be given oxygen before taking her to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double fracture in his leg, and he's in the hospital now."
They'll move him tomorrow or maybe a day after that, and then they'll cut him in Manchester.
This is terrible, the boy comes to Manchester United when he's 18 years old, suffers from trouble and then plays great, and this is what happens.
When I was in the dressing room, he was wearing an oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double fracture takes at least six months, and he doesn't play in the block phase.
I hope he can play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky to have a red card and a punishment shot.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish a Mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian operative was mistaken.
You can judge the situation when I say it became a punishment shot and a red card.
It was a really bad two-foot stretch.
Shaw tweeted as follows: "Thank you all for your messages, the words are not enough to tell me how disappointed I am, my recovery begins now, I come back stronger."
Subject: Manchester United suffers from Luke Shaw's case and loses to PSV
The English defender has an additional incentive to recover in the next June European championship competitions in France.
PSV Coach Phillip Cocu said, "It's a really bad injury."
If a player gets out of this kind of injury, everyone's very sad.
Our players are never meant to hurt the opponent.
Morenon's foot broke when he played in the Mexican team against the Van Gaali Holland at the 2014 MM races.
"Moreno takes this hardly because the purpose is not to hurt the opponent, and when you hear that the injury is really bad, it's bad," Cocu said.
I didn't see him in that situation.
The only thing I saw was the ball that was going in a different direction, so it seemed like [Moreno] would have touched it, but I did not see Luke's tack.
Moreno said to SBS6: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult this can be.
I feel terrible about this, I'm so sorry."
Andrés Guardado of PSV was also taken to the hospital after Chris Smalling challenged him.
David Cameron knows Lorax better than this, right?
Each parent will soon learn one thing: If your child loves a book, it will not last long until it is learned almost outside.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When the service to provide children care for holidays asked the Prime Minister for his favorite children's book, he chose Dr. Seuss The Lorax, an environmental story published in 1971.
The choice was difficult, Cameron writes a message published on the SuperCamps website and continues: "Happy, moving, creative, and contains a strong message. I enjoy reading this book to my children, because it always seems to have a picture or a message that we have never seen before."
All this is true, but the following paragraph, where Cameron is supposed to describe the design of the book, is a summary of the 2012 film version, where new characters and details were added to fill in a fairly short original text.
"In the city inside the walls of Tarville, where all nature has disappeared and even air is traded, Ted boy hopes to win the girl of his dreams on his side by filling Audrey's desire to see the right tree", the text says and describes the love story, which Dr Seuss, who died in 1991, did not write from the right name Theodor Seuss Geisel.
If this is not suspicious enough, Cameron's text sounds in place as if it was taken from the Lorax film on the Internet Movie Database web page, which begins as follows: "Inside Tarville, where everything is artificial and even air is traded, Ted's boy hopes to win his dreams on the side of the heart of the Audrey girl."
Given that Cameron is a publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he would be so inexpensive that the book was drinking. In that young, anonymous son hears how the local nature has destroyed the greed, the wooden beating and the need, without giving the story of the short, wise creature Lorax, who is "cleaning for the trees".
Such a relatively invisible PR task is probably outlined to an assistant who apparently has never read the book 20 times consecutively for a child.
The Prime Minister's report said that the text must have come from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's staff, but did not comment on it at the moment.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of staying out of the British team, but it was still a tough place.
Playing against Pakistan in the Arab Emirates is a tough task, but when you see what kind of team England has chosen for the tour, I do not believe that the recurrence of the last 3-0 series loss is likely.
I wouldn't even close a guest victory out of the bills.
The half of Alastair Cook may be less experienced than the three-year-old team, but there are good circles and the team's thinking is strong: they do not have scars from 2012, only the young positive.
Moeen Ali develops in its rotational feeding process and Adil Rashid is an alternative to attacking, although there is an unknown factor at this level.
Subject: Adam Lyth fell from the English cricket team, he replaced Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth on the team must understandably be difficult to analyse for me because I'm his principal coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been in challenging circumstances against good attackers, and the simple but cruel truth is that cricket players are criticized on the basis of their results.
For example, the choice of Joe Root had no uncertainty before the announcement, because, as I have said before, players are the best factors for choice.
About 100 points more, and Lyth's season in the team could have continued, but he was responsible for his own destiny.
I hope if he gets more runs for Yorkshire, another chance will come forward.
The English chief coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised Lyth's attitude even when he did not perform as well as he could, and it does not surprise me.
It's hard to answer the question how long the hitner gets to leave a trail.
Lyth was elected seven times in the country team, like Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was elected nine times.
Only Compton had the opportunity to play both at home and in visitors.
The only subject of complaint is that England chose Jonathan Trott first for Caribbean when Lyth was in the top condition, but that lost opportunity now is the past.
Alex Hales will come with you, and there's a hitter I appreciate.
He's a cricket player of something we saw in Yorkshire early this time when he made 236 points against us on the Trent Bridge field.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as others before him, but, of course, this depends on the composition of the team in the United Arab Emirates.
There's been an idea of Moeen in a hit-and-run report next to Cook, where an extra feeder could be found, but there could be four quick ones, and I'm not against this.
I don't understand why the hitter couldn't hit it there, and this left hand has already shown himself to be a pretty cricket player.
Moeen did not necessarily do his job in his county in Worcestershire, but he is a third to them and there is little difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played the first 38 games when he fell to the first delay before he went to the opening in 2001.
He did three hundred points right now, and he didn't remember the past.
Zafar Ansari comes into the team as a thief, and, as little as I've been dealing with him, he seems to be a very impressive young man.
People can look at his unpleasant statistics, hitting the average of 31, with the ball of 35, and think it's a gambling game, but there's not too much feeders and the electors picked young people.
He's learning a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have a few hard additions to the coach.
The appointment of the Sri Lankan hitter M chain Jayawarde as a consultant for games can prove to be a genius.
He is one of the most comfortable friends in the game, and he brings a huge amount of experience because he has done everything in all situations and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes with the white ball games and brings with him both energy and unpleasant degradation.
I have always thought that he was born to be involved in international crickets, whether playing or coaching, and he has the same use as Mahela.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room can refresh the team even if their message is the same as they used to be.
Colly's team coach from Durham, Ben Stokes, is rested in one day, and Root was given a similar pause against Australia, and at least I have no problem with this.
Although not everyone agrees, coachs and chosen ones do not make schedules.
And you have to remember, just like the players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions will never be made on light grounds.
If the economy is in difficulty in 2017, those who support the EU (Brexit) can take the profit.
David Cameron's half-wined renegotiation strategies for maintaining Britain in the EU will face increasingly problems day by day, even if it does not even take into account the hearty Jeremy "As yes or no?" Corbyn's choice for the leadership of the Labour Party or the anger of the Central Organisation of Professional Associations for Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigns also have their own Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomatic partner recently explained that because the EU is so deeply in a variety of crises, of which not all of them are due, some Member States have been tired of the British self-determined agenda, full of consensus and disruptive contractual changes that these countries mostly do not want.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the Central Organisation of Trade Associations decided that it would not want them either if they were shaking social protection.
We could call it Dave and George's selfie agent.
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are late for summits or bilateral meetings held in foreign capitals, taking a picture of themselves in front of a famous local memorial, either with or without a local memorial, and then coming home to win the supporters for reforms.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to look outwards inside the British EU tent - "Do not leave us alone with France", is told in Berlin - suggests that the shortest-looking ministers and officials in certain capitals are now at a point that they don't care if we leave.
Germany's cautious and moderate Chancellor Angela Merkel is a federal member, but he has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave his work before it ruins the same way as it happened to Toocher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France François Hollande is facing re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's a disappearing power, too.
Poland will soon have a national right government, a left-handed government in Spain.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrificing on behalf of the selfiebrits when their energy would rather be directed to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom - they do not want it because of the same kind of separatist trends.
So, my friend suggests that some of these ministers may even be consciously designed to make useless comments in the style of the Scottish National Party during the 2017 National Voting campaign in Great Britain to accelerate the Brexit process.
"The renegotiation had been held" and "the renegotiation had nothing to do with Britain."
The Europeans have experienced how greedy Fleet Street newspapers can be and how the EU-sceptical press's solitary powers are, not at the time of the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, when our membership started in 1973 was confirmed in the ratio 2:1.
They can undoubtedly remember Boris Johnson, the largest Euroopportunist, who made a name for himself by writing "the EU's direct bananas" as the correspondent in Brussels at the beginning of the '90s."
Ed Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They included a number of tax-friendly strangers, foreign people hacking phones, and persons whose home is nominally elsewhere, who own most of our big newspapers.
Tony Blair actually thought the same thing about them, but he realized that if you're in a cage with a creepy gorilla, you're gonna have to give up bananas because of a blur, unless you want to be on that gorilla's lunch list and later on dinner.
In fact, the Miliband was blairier than Blair himself, as it comes to opposing Cameron's renegotiation, and Bair had accepted the principle behind the EU's abandoned constitution, which was rejected by French and Dutch electorates in 2005, thus giving Blair access to the situation.
The press never forgived him for that.
But nice Jeremy Corby, who kindly killed me on the back of the Westminster House on Monday (I said to him that he had no time to spend on me), seems to be in danger of reintroducing Neil Kinnock's 80th-century boicocating the Murdoch strategy, which was a mistake both then and now.
Although it may take time, however, he has to develop a coherent strategy to keep in touch with the media, not me, but no doubt Andrew Marri, whose BBC-shovel Corby left on Sunday.
The official role of Corbyn in Europe is, beautifully speaking, evolving.
He says that he would like us to remain in a renewed EU.
Well, most of the people outside the United Kingdom's Independence Party, the Ukip's war intrusion and the most brutal nationalists of the Conservative Party, can certainly stand behind this opinion.
Hilary "Benn, but not Benn fan" Benn said this both on radio and on TV this week when his internal patrol officer wanted to admit that Corbyn's choice to appoint Karski John McDonnell as the Secretary of Finance was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the '70s when his father's priest was hanging on TV trying to be unfaithful to his government colleagues of the Labour Party without going so far to lose his seat.
Hilary's couplings were more attractive.
But the fight to remain in the "wherever the situation" - the Ben's charm - was not what McDonnell said, and not all of what Corby told the heads and representatives at the private meeting on Monday night.
Whatever it is, it is a hierarchical, emotional and personal image that Corbyn wants to care (remember that he even touched me), communication discipline is important during the period of 24 hours of television, and in particular in the eclipses of social media that is an acceptable growth platform for paranoids and frauds.
As McDonnell has said, it is only fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe by allowing him to support the Workers' Party in the referendum campaign to be self-evident.
At least Simon Jenkins thinks that way.
But the basic cycle between McDonnell and Corbyn on EU membership (and in line with their Benn-sensitive regulated economy and anti-capitalistic past) is no longer just a difficult debate with left-wing thinkers who are the narcissism of small differences in dogmous schools.
As far as his two-dividual relationship with NATO (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby does not campaign to give up) is concerned, foreign diplomats must only try to explain it to their superiors.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital (they also have suspicious voters) granted to Britain when it can be completely unnecessary?
The United States has already disappointed the weak military performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even when the Conservative Government cuts costs, as I was reminded by the initiative of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticise the electric tobacco evaluation of Public Health England
Scientists have said that the State-funded agency's claim of 95% less detrimental than the traditional, started with a meeting of 12 people, some of which had links to the tobacco industry.
The experts who wrote to the British Medical Journal (BMJ) affirmed the evidence used by the Public Health England (PHE) criticisms in Lancet in his report on electricity tobacco.
PHE published this "sleeve" report last month, describing it as a "sleep review of the evidence".
However, several researchers have questioned the sustainability of the data and have referred to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
The medical magazine publication Lancet published last month a headline attacking the PHE's headline decision on the "special hood".
Two other scientists in BMJ have been wondering whether the claims are "built on rock or sand."
Professor Martin McKee of the European Public Health Professor of the School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine at London School and Professor Simon Capewell of the University of Liverpool’s clinical epidemiology say: "The main principle of public health is that action must be based on proven efficiency."
They say that the public expects that PHE's claim "by the best estimate in the current year, the electricity stoves are approximately 95% less harmful than traditional tobacco" is based on the detailed assessment and modeling of the evidence.
In fact, it comes from one meeting of 12 people, which developed a multi-criteria decision-making model (MCDA) to synthesize their opinion on the disadvantages associated with various products containing nicotine, and the results of this meeting were summarised in the study.
McKee and Capewell say that one of the sponsors of the meeting was the company called EuroSwiss Health, which was reported to have previously received funding from Bristish American Tobacco for independent research.
He also supported the public health competences of BAT in the sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 people announced that they received funding from the electric tobacco manufacturer, but not the funding he was previously found to have received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they add.
The criteria for the selection of members of the Panel are not specified, but the panel includes a number of well-known supporters of electric tobacco, some of which also indicate that the investigation has received funding from the sector.
Others are not well-known for their expertise under tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the Director of the PHE tobacco.
The study produced by the group "to admit a lot of the fact that there is a lack of "controversial evidence concerning harm in most of the products and most of the criteria", McKee and Capewell write.
However, none of these links or restrictions is mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell say that "the 12th is no evidence that the electric tobacco operates as a route for smoking on children or non-smoking persons" is premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, head of PHE's health and well-being, says that the claims made in BMJ have been answered earlier.
He says, "The nuts are much less harmful than burning."
Half the smokers of their lifetime will die of their addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks caused by electric tobacco are relatively small, but we must continue to examine the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public of what evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when there is so much public inconsistency compared to tobacco.
Approximately 80 000 people die annually for smoking-related illness and 2 billion GBP per year for smoking to NHS.
By explaining the current evidence, i.e. even though the electric ducks are not risky, their disadvantages are just a fraction of the detriment of traditional tobacco, we are fulfilling our national responsibility.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former Chairman of Channel 4
Former President of Channel 4 Luke Johnson has said that BBC should stop sending programmes such as EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial competitors would "do whatever" about the hits like this soap series in Albert Square, for example.
Johnson said that licence fees should only be used to perform programmes that other British broadcasters do not.
He criticised BBC for putting public-service programmes that are likely to have a smaller public, difficult broadcasting times against the most viewed programmes of competitors and channels like BBC4.
After the BBC Director Tony Hall said that the company would want to cooperate more with other organisations, Johnson said that he started having a relationship with BBC for six years, in vain.
"I do not understand the idea that BBC produces and sends programmes that would clearly agree to unsubstantiated competitors," Johnson pointed out to the communication committee in the upper room as part of its study on the future of BBC.
If the licence fee is respected - and I am not sure it would be a good idea for this message or for the long term - it should at least limit its production to programmes that are not and are not produced by others.
The Voicea will be sent to the main shipping time, because it will be desired to gather as much support as possible for the future.
The idea that no one else would show the program is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's obviously nonsense.
Johnson said: "I do not understand why a regressive tax should be financed by programmes that could also be financed without State aid.
The Voice is one such and the EastEnders second, without prejudice to the inside of the house.
To be honest, the other channels would give anything about it.
I don't understand how it's about sending a public service.
I don't think that would weaken the BBC at all."
Channel 4 in 2004-2010 leading serial entrepreneur Johnson said that BBC is guilty of the hunting of the number of viewers "for the purposes of the people working there, and because they believe that it is the best way to achieve long-term support."
He used his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh to suggest that BBC sell the series like EastEnders.
Johnson said that BBC's smaller public service programmes "go to BBC4, where there is often no way to measure the number of viewers, but BBC thus fulfils its responsibility and then, in defending the 4 billion Pounds of permits, can hypocritically say, "Okay, we do all these unknown programs that no one sees".
They're gonna put them on a shipment site where no one's ever gonna look at them.
With regard to the permit fee, Johnson said to the Committee, "I will seek you to find a more regressive system in the one who will receive the highest value of it.
Of course, you all think, we all think that at 150 pounds a year, you get a lot of value, but I don't know if it's true for people who have a huge amount of 150 pounds because they don't use a lot of BBC.
The former leader of Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who also proved to the Committee on Tuesday, said that BBC should re-evaluate its temporal mission to "inform, train and entertain".
He said that only a small part of BBC's production is now classified as education - he said the figures are 1 % of TV production and 0.1 % of the radio - and that it should take the model from Australia and Canada's broadcasts and change the role as "information, enlightening and entertaining".
As far as partnership issues are concerned, Elstein said that BBC should focus more on events such as Proms concerts, which he says are only shown on television, and join commercial companies so that they can all be viewed online.
Sound genetics enable the control of brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how shuttles change direction as soon as the sound pulse hits them.
Researchers have grown worms with genetically modified nerve systems to control them by sound wavelengths.
The small-small shuttles change direction as soon as they hit a sound pulse that is too high to hear the human ears.
Impulses operate by switching on genetically modified motion nerve cells with ultrasonic reactive film channels.
Subject: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
Scientists said that worms show the functionality of a new, sound genetic method, which can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
The Guardian, a researcher at the Salk Institute in California, Sreekanth Chalasani, told the Guardian, that one day the method could replace deep brain stimulation. It is an invasive measure in which people's brains are driven by electrical impulses to treat Parkinson’s disease.
The shuttleworms did not normally respond to the ultrasound, but Chalasani found that when they were surrounded by the liquid with microscopic small bubbles, the situation changed.
He noticed that the bubbles confirmed ultrasonic waves, which then pass through the worms.
Strengthened ultrasonic waves affect the TRP-4-ionic structures that are present in some worm cell films.
The sound waves make these ion channels open and activate the cells attached to them, reports the report published in the Nature Communications.
Chalasani generated worms in order to prepare ultra-sound shutters, so that part of their motion nerve cells is the TRP-4-ion channels.
When Chalasani used the ultrasound to customized worms, the microspheres reinforced the sound waves and transmitted them to the worms in which they switched on the modified nerve cells.
The method has the same characteristics as optogenetics, a career-driven tool that allows scientists to switch on and off the nerve cells using light impulses.
However, Chalasani says that sonogenetics may have some advantages compared to optogenetics.
Unlike the light that has to send optical fibre along the desired position within the brain, low-speed ultrasound waves can pass through the tissue unacceptablely, so they can be sent to the brain from the head of the skull.
"We believe that using gene therapy and therapeutic virus may be possible to promptly respond to the targeted human nerve cells to the ultrasonic signal in certain neurologic treatments in a clinical environment," said Chalasani.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture equipment delivered to your home!
Advertising will disgrace the British arms trade
Look at the video against Amnesty International Armed Fairs.
Horrible killing machines!
Fibre-breaking legguns!
grape bombs!
And electronic stunning pillows that cause painful pain but do not leave traces!
The happy voice and the image language of comic images leaves no doubt that this commercial of the world's largest arms fair is a sharp barode produced by Amnesty International in order to emphasise the willingness of the British government to trade weapons for repressive governments at the festival held in the London Shipyard area of the ExCeL Centre of Defence and Security Equipment International.
Subject: DSEI arms fairs: authoritarian governments arrive in London
As a result of a separate campaign, many posters appeared on bus stops and metro trains that require more accurate information.
" Important information, are you traveling on the DLR route from 15 to 18 September?" together, you are asked using the London underground font and brand, as the DLR track turns into a tank image.
In this September, a pack of arms dealers arrive at the DLR route, and customers are asked to help stop the arms fair.
These 300 posters are made by artists whose work was presented in the Museum of Banksy Dismaland of Cruel Designs (the Museum of Public Plans).
A collector named Special Patrol Group helped disseminate posters all over London using "Ad Space Hack Packs" packages. This includes six-pound packing of six-pound keys, which, according to the collective, "will access to a third of the space for the entire planet's bus stops."
Transport for London has not had any pleasure with this unauthorized "Publicism".
One of the parodia commercials produced by a Special Patrol Group.
According to the Cruel Designs curator and the University of Essex journalist, Gavin Grindon, artists increasingly question and want to take political work to outside the gallery.
Many artists have started working with activists at the resistance front when they realize that they must go to the outside world if they want their art to influence society.
Another poster against the arms trade greets the work travellers in the metro.
Amnesty's video has been viewed over the last 24 hours by more than 100,000 times. It was created by VCCP for free, and also by the graphic designer and background detector worked for free.
The creative director of VCCP, Matt Lever, found that the arms fairs were not advertised at all - and there was also an empty point on the ExCeL's calendar - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with the idea of a more realistic ad for a blurred corporation, but "was more stopping to emphasise it with bright colors and animation."
"They have done a fantastic job to help us raise questions about the illegal torture equipment sold at the fairs," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
Now the UK Government must take action and ensure that torture instruments are not illegally sold near our own home.
Perhaps the most creative art in connection with the arms fair comes from the inside of ExCeL when exhibiters trade fantasticly decorated products.
In his press release, he revealed that he had received a order from the U.S. Army, "AT4CS RS launching from the shoulder."
This includes "an exclusive type of pneumatic pneumatic cable that provides excellent effects behind the armor inside the target".
Whatever it does, it's not pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in a student dwelling
It's been 11 years since I moved to a student's apartment when I was 19 years old, and then I still believed in barettes and moral relativism, but only now I remember the human smiles and many, many, long complaints from others.
A large part of what I learned can be summarised in eight simple rules.
Moving into the dormitory can be anything from being completely frightening about the nerves.
It's tempting to spoil: tell me where you're from, did you like an interim year and where you're thinking about Corbyn, and why "I really don't love or hate Marmite because it's really just a yeast to find me in my room."
Take a breath.
And help others to breathe... ask questions and show interest.
It directs the conversation and helps you find those people you like, and not those you don't want to talk to, even if your eyelashes are on fire and they share the extinguishers.
Give people some space.
People’s rooms are often turned into cocktail invitations, celebrations and luxury entertainment places, but they are also places where people dress and repair their underwear.
Subject: Don't even imagine starting a university when you're in a relationship
University is a hard place for introverts.
Your room should be a resting place, but many dwellings are formed from the room to the culture of walking, which is friendly, social, and causes lifelong friendships.
It can mean hell to someone who's trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture gives you permission to say, "I like you and I want to be a friend with you, but you have to leave now that I can collect back the energy I spent talking to you."
Try to sense when a student mate is tired of socializing, and maybe send a text message instead of knocking the door.
When we talk about knocking, knock.
One guy in my student's apartment thought that if the door wasn't locked, he was called in.
He saw some pretty things.
Friendship through baking.
Because you're starting the university in the top season of the baking trend, knocking people in the doors with a chocolate bakery plate and showing yourself seems to somewhat less strange, less "hello in the neighbourhood, I baked you something, now smile when I ask you personal questions" -50s.
It's a great way to make friends to offer self-made delicious things.
Your resident partners feel obliged to talk, and they may be able to link your face to a delicious surprise.
This, of course, depends on how you know how to bake.
Badly mixed flour-sugar-fat nuts are likely to only make people pretend to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student housing.
Obviously, taking a chicken is stealing, but what if you just take a drop of milk for your tea?
Ask and check the owner of the milk.
It's possible they'll give you permission even though they're boiling inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and you're gonna get my sympathy, but try to take it adulter than my flatmate, who messed with his milk to punish those who stole it.
He's in jail now.
You don't have to noise so that people can't sleep or study.
Not only to be a decent person, but because you're like that roar of proverb creeping the roof.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbor if they could play their drum and bass music slowly, because it was three in the morning and she had a exam in the morning.
The answer was to increase the volume.
When they finally slowed down at 5:00 in the morning, the girl kindly let them sleep two hours before he put their music on, locked their doors and left for a three-hour test.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse would happen to move to the same apartment with you?
Or reversely, it would not be incredibly awkward if you thought of a cottage partner as your future spouse, beat yourself together, divorced, and then you would see him every day and possibly lose all your friends.
Of course, the heart wants what he wants, but if the hot cottage partner is definitely not your future spouse, you could even try to make sense on your bottom.
In that delightful moment when you notice that someone has left his keys in an unlocked room, the border between the trick and the temptation is thinner than it seems.
Good trick is fun, but it's gonna be cancelable in a moment.
You can give me a useful and fun lesson for safety by hiding something, but never mess up someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and drop the keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer, but don't attach their property to the ceiling on the blue barn like twice.
Racist attack at the foreign students' lounge in Kite - The house envisaged as a reception center was strangled in Salo
A racist attack in Kite, North Karelia was held on Saturday night at the foreign students' lounge.
Unlike the police used to say, this is not the accommodation of underage asylum seekers, but the sleep spaces of foreign students who have already been in Finland, says Heidi Luukkainen, the teacher of the Christian Church of Kite.
The windows and walls of the National University were swept with racist signs, such as racists, and the metal object was thrown through one window of the accommodation, says the Eastern Finland police.
According to Luukkainen, the youth-guarantee training in the National University, it was estimated that ten people were in the vicious building at the time of the attack.
"It was a weekend and adult people are free to move, and some could be elsewhere," says Luukkainen.
The university has accommodation for people from 12 different nationalities.
They are already students who have been in Finland for some time, as well as newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
All those who were in a messed-up building have a status.
Some students study in adult primary schools, part of professional studies and part of Finnish studies," says Luukkainen.
The A status is a so-called ‘continuous residence permit’, which can be granted for four years at a time for a foreigner who has already been in Finland for some time.
The Eastern Finland police are investigating the attack as a damage and a breach of home peace.
According to a large number of students, the event was held to students on Monday, where there were also the necessary interpretations.
There's no panic here, and no one has ever wanted to leave.
We've had students from abroad for another decade, and this is the first time something like this happens," says Luukkainen.
According to a lot of people, the messes have already been cleaned out of the walls.
There were at least three men suspected to be killers, and they had been moving on a light passenger car.
I think it's the end of the juvenile weekend when this topic has been on the surface.
Nothing more serious", Luukkainen says.
Salo has also been struggled by a hospital with a reception centre.
The case happened last week.
MTV told me about it on his website Tuesday night.
The hospital wall was drawn by a hakaristi and written in English "You are not welcome".
This case has been filed for a criminal report to the police.
Description of 15 September at 16.02 Repaired by the police of incorrect information on the age and status of people living in the building.
The State will put an end to the Y-train to Karja, the passengers in their chews, "of course, idiots."
The Y-train from Helsinki to Karja of Raasepor stops passing in March.
The news insisted on the passengers coming to the beginning of the train at the Helsinki main railway station.
In particular, the subway strikes the Siuntians, said Torbjörn Bengtström.
It is idiotic because the population is growing all the time and working needs a rapid and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can't be tied to anything but political will or lack of it.
Bengtström says with HSTV's interview video, he'll come to the capital with a tractor.
Train changes are also taking place elsewhere in Newland.
The H and R trains on the main track will be combined as a new R line.
Purola's station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna Tuusula are out of use.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on the routes to which the Ministry will buy train transport during the next contract period.
The contract period will change in the year-to-year period and the routes to be ceased are in the whole country.
The new four-year agreement to be finalised in autumn will later be approved by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
Siuntian Bengtström believes that the State train cutter is a short-sighted operation.
Same mistakes have been made before and repeated in a very systematic way.
Then there will be repentance.
The Y train is also used by non-raceporians and Siuntians because it is fast and passes several stations.
The Espooan Annina Table was harmed by the fate of those traveling farther from the city area.
"It's especially bad for those who have to redesign their journey," he said when he hurts his Y train.
A little relief is promised.
A new train connection is coming to the coastline, which will replace the Y train in the Helsinki Region's transport (HSL) area, i.e. exports to Kirkkonumme.
This will increase costs for HSL, i.e. practically for municipalities and their taxpayers.
"We are now starting to explore different options and their impact on service levels and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of the HSL.
It is still impossible to accurately assess the costs.
Rihtniemi states that, based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid about a million dollars a year for the Y train, of course the Ministry has paid much more than that.
The R line on the main track leaves two positions behind.
On the other hand, the number of trains in Ainola and Sauna Kallio doubles.
The whole country ceases to have 28 small stations and numerous routes.
The Ministry no longer buys train transport from routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The Pieksämäki-Joensuu route will be shortened to Pieksämäki-Varistus.
Train shifts decrease on routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka port and Kajaani-Oulu.
Over half a million trips a year will be made on displaced shifts, with a total of nine million trips in transport purchased by the ministry.
The new agreement is intended to bring the State the annual savings of 12.3 million.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
The Sixten Korkman wrote in the chapter on the topic of capital: "You should learn about Marx."
The crisis in the world economy has raised the surface Karl Marx (1818-1883) and its final work in 1867-1894, published in the book on Marx's capital, known as former President of the GDP, writes the topic of the book published today by Yrjö Hakane.
"He is now being taken more serious than for a long time", Hakanen writes in his premiere.
Marx's estimates of the development of the capitalist economy, the internationalisation and the invasion of all the areas of life, the concentration of capital and the growing role of monetary capital and imaginary capital have proved to be astonishingly far-reaching.
The author list of the book based on the capital seminars organised by Hakase also contains the professor of Aalto University, a highly respected economicist, Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes Marx's current "family and forever."
But isn't the former CEO of the Business Institute and of the Economics Delegation Marxian?
Not at all.
On the phone, Korkman says that he does not consider Marx as a modern economic thinker, but rather as an interesting social theoretical.
Today, social sciences are differentiated and specialised, but Marx was a philosopher, historic, sociologist, economic scientist, journalist, political agitator and literacy lessons.
"The fact is that the history is telling about the wrong opinions of the dead men," Korkman begins.
The truth is, Marx's prophecies went badly.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew the conclusions of the early age of capitalism too far, Korkman is considering.
But Korkman sees the value of Marx's radical installation.
"The more thoughtful thing in Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
Now again, we are discussing Marx's interests, such as the distribution of wealth.
"Marx may be able to give inspiration to someone who wants to understand the big picture, the changing world as a result of a technical confusing," Korkman analyses.
But what the government's supposed to decide tomorrow isn't helpful for Marx.
He thought capitalism was a hopeless case, which should just stop.
And yet, I think it's worth getting to Marx, and Korkman thinks he's gonna get to know him.
"In the '70s, Marx couldn't read," says Korkman.
"The Mayans, the Trotsk and the other sects hated all capitalism, but more and more each other."
Today the debate is more versatile, and Marxia can also be approached without the ideal and political pressure load of the backdrops.
"Every societal scientist should get to know Marx's thought world, like other classics," Korkman says.
The UN calls for war criminals in Sri Lanka
The UN calls for the establishment of a special court to investigate the war crimes committed in Sri Lanka's Civil War, reports AFP.
The UN report on civil war in 1983-2009 appeared on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report is accused of war crimes both of Sri Lanka's armed forces and of the rebels known as Tamilitigers.
In Sri Lankan civil war, it is estimated that at least 100,000 people have died.
There's no accurate information on the number of victims.
In particular, the major attack of the armed forces in the last months of the long war in 2009 should be investigated properly, the UN report requires.
The Sri Lankan Armed Forces report is accused of torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, which was as likely as men as women.
According to the report, the rebels have been guilty of forced by siders and children to fight.
According to the report, both parties have committed murders.
Sri Lanka replied on Wednesday that it intends to conduct the investigation itself, but it does not allow the establishment of the UN Court of Justice because of foreign judges.
In the yo test of England, you had to punter social media.
In the autumn student writings, on Wednesday, there was a long foreign language, mostly English.
More than 16,000 experiments tested their English skills.
In the experiment, it could be written from social media.
Based on our own experience, we had to consider whether social media would make us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the 150 to 250 word written in English could show the online magazine’s consultant.
The title was Aunt Dear Agony.
Aunt Agony is in charge of Finnish Leelia's resting chair.
He had to ask for advice on how parents could look at things for young people as well.
The subjects of the substance were four, of which one had to be selected.
"It was the hardest of them", assessing the third topic of Porvoo Swedish high school writer Mia Lybeck.
The third issue was only a citate from the former President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso.
The fourth subject, Lybeck said, was really nice.
It was supposed to write a fire speech why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least our school has been practicing writing speeches," Lybeck says and estimates the whole test "what's normal."
In Finnish - or in Swedish - the English experiment, it was possible to answer the questions of texts, such as the adaptation of summer champagne to climate change and the processing of large data masses.
On Wednesday, some long Russian (168 pupils), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written.
The autumn articles continue on Friday, when another domestic or Swedish or Finnish test is in turn.
In high schools, the test is normally conducted, i.e. the demonstration of employees does not affect it.
The Higher Education Panel urges the pilots to seek appropriate access to the trial event on time.
You can also have more time if you can show that the delay was not due to your own carelessness.
In Oulu, the shop was robbed with a gun in danger.
In Oulu, a shop was robbed on Wednesday morning in Kello.
According to the police, the robber had dressed in dark clothes, and his face was covered in a commandopipopo.
He's a normal body. He's about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened his staff with a handgun and received a small amount of money.
They're investigating it as a brutal robbery.
The police are waiting for ten-century demonstrators to arrive in Helsinki - support teams from elsewhere in Finland
The demonstration against government surgery decisions will be blocked by the Helsinki Centre on Friday, predicting the police.
According to preliminary information, even tens of thousands of people can arrive.
The members of the SAK, the Programme and the STTK associations will meet at the Railway Market at 11 a.m.
Police are also believed to be involved in the demonstration.
On the other hand, the task of the police in work is not only to carry out alarm and other police activities but also to ensure the smoothing of the giant expression.
The roads leading to the railway track shall be closed from motor vehicles for a period from 9.30 to 14.
Only alarm vehicles will be released to the area.
From the direction of Hakanieme, traffic is cut off from the road circle of Kaisanieme, west from the Mannerheim.
Is there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Captain Seppo Kujala?
For now, at least, it looks like it's enough.
I'm not taking a position on the police's work fight.
As a result of the demonstration, there are support teams from elsewhere in Finland, according to Kujala.
The exact patrol officer, the police won't tell me.
"Something's coming, but basically we'll be fine on our own," Kujala says.
The police are calling to avoid private cargo at the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
The Kujala estimates that the worst transport tube extends from the level of Hakaniemi to its core centre.
Stand-up traffic is expected from the morning to the beginning of the night.
Along with demonstrators from elsewhere in Finland, many order buses are also coming to Helsinki.
They won't be released to the Railway.
The buses are on the basis of time.
The rest of the journey must then walk to the demonstration place," Kujala tells.
The expression also stops the Helsinki public transport.
From a police point of view, there's a positive side.
The problem of the smoothness of public transport, which is normally in the hands of these large people gatherings, will now be dealt with in part by itself.
The organisers of the statement have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of the government's economic policy may come to Helsinki.
The police are waiting for the demonstration to go peacefully.
There are people who are usually working or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
The Finns are rational and peaceful people," Kujala says.
Local demonstrations are also held across Finland on Friday.
Friday's demonstration is exceptional in many ways, do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The great demonstration organised by trade unions on Friday is in many ways interesting and exceptional.
For example, there is no very good reference in Finnish political history, says the professor of the University of Jyväskylä, Emeritus Martti Siisiäinen.
It's not a miracle for the Ay movement to protest.
If it weren't, it'd put your hands up in front of the government, then that's what Siisiäinen says.
The very right-wing government has attacked the Finnish Corporatism tradition on the core points, and also on the points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's hard shots are lacking in contract law.
There are a lot of features here that the Ay movement is really trying to get on its knees.
The Ay Movement also has a place to look in the mirror.
For example, the mirror is needed because the Ay movement does not have all employees' support for Friday's demonstrations.
The new is now the steep division that the demonstration of the ay movement would like to take part in the demonstration.
The unemployed across Finland showed their minds at the Parliamentary House in November 1993.
If you are looking for a reference point for Friday's demonstration, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed, the Murrostorstai, written in 1993, says.
In the middle of the deepest lama arranged Murrostorstai gathered 20,000 unemployed.
The Esko Ahon (Central) government stumbled from the labour market crisis.
It was said that Finland’s government and employees’ organisations had never been as bad as Aho’s civilian government.
Now, the government and the Ay movement may be even worse than in the time of Murrostorst.
Besides, there is now a great government in Finland ever, Siisilainen says.
The present government coalition is still interesting in the way that it is so tight right, despite the speeches of the Finnishs.
At the time of the blunt, there were certain elements of the old workforce.
A number of thousands of demonstrators are expected on Friday.
The expression also stops public transport and possibly closes day care and schools.
Even if the demonstration does not receive undistributed support for employees, it can become the largest for years.
About 300 demonstrations have been held in Helsinki in recent years.
There's a lot of them.
Traditionally, the demonstrations of the Finnish ay movement have been quite calm, even though the practices have been hardened in recent years.
Traditionally, the Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, be lawful.
Contesters are trying to avoid damage or destruction of property, Siisiäinen says.
The end of the 1990s, however, brought new winds.
The culture of demonstration changed.
The EU membership annoyed farmers to throw eggs and the police prepared to get on pig shit.
The firemen strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also visible strikes, including pilots and air traffic controllers.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Metal and electrical strikes of the 1970s
In the 1970s the most significant strikes were the metal strike in 1971 and the power plant and electrical strike in 1977.
There were 70 000 metal men involved in the metal strike.
The strike was suspended at the Reconciliation Board's presentation after seven weeks of strike.
Metal men received a 16% raise.
The spring 1977 electricity strike lasted 49 days and caused electricity cuts all over the country.
Murrostorstai in 1993
On 4 November 1993, around 20 000 people, many of whom were unemployed, met to show their opinion on behalf of the work.
Firemen strike three months in 1998
The strike of firemen was one of the longest in the 1990s, unless the longest national strike.
Farmers opposed the EU 1994 and 1999
In 1994, the police were exposed to chicken eggs in protests against the EU by farmers.
Siberia teaches, the EU stops, was one of the slogans.
Espalle's farmers smashed a ton of snow.
In 1999, the Helsinki EU Summit also led farmers to protest and burn haypales in front of the meeting.
Nurses striked in 1983 and 1995
The nurses striked for about a month in 1995.
For the last time, they had been in strike in 1983.
A few deaths during the strike were coloured by the 1995 strike.
Teaching threatens to strike and the death of nurses in 2007.
Finally, the threat of decommissioning was accelerating the outcome of the negotiations.
Doctors striked 2001
"The doctors at the strike - from the escape," was the attack of the strikeing doctors in 2001.
The strike of local health centres and hospital doctors lasted five months and led to an intense debate on how strikes could endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised the doctors' salaries.
Students on the move in 2013
Approximately 5 000 students marched on behalf of study support in Helsinki from Senate to Parliamentary House in 2013.
Central Criminal Police will find out the backgrounds of the Finnish truck full of refugees to the Austrian police
The Austrian police have asked the Central Crime Police to help identify the backgrounds of the refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, Austrian police stopped a truck with 42 refugees on board near the German border in Aisterheim.
There's no way to know if the truck was on its way to Finland.
All those people on the cold truck were in good shape.
We've had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and the principal responsibility are at the scene in Austria, reports Chief Inspector Tero Haapala.
At the end of August, refugees travelling in a truck in Austria became more fatal.
At that time, all 71 passengers on board apparently died by suffocating.
According to the General Radio, the truck belongs to the Finnish shareholder company, which was first informed of its cooperation with the Austrian police.
The company is engaged in restaurant activities, among other things, and its CEO is a foreign man, about 40 years old.
In Austria, two Irish people have been arrested for human smuggling.
Captain of the refugees, former drug abuser and junkie businessman, the story of five smugglers
Upporic smuggler king, a violent boat driver, a stylish missionary and a good guy who thinks he's a taxi driver.
For example, such people carry human smuggling into the European Union.
Criminologist Andrea Di Nicola and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci at Trento University have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "companies" and their written book Death Travel Office will appear in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present smugglers of human smuggling, make proposals for solutions and present smugglers from different stages of business.
The HS presents five of them.
I'm gonna beat them up right now.
There are no attractions of foreign tourists on the eastern coast of Tunisia, but many Tunisians are headed for the summer holiday.
For their location, islands also fit for smuggling, as the trip to the island of Lampedusa to Italy is only 120 kilometres.
For the purpose of comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 km.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives in Emir, a chain of burning captain and the father of six children.
The gathering islands are famous for their shrimp, but the fishermen are more profitable to transport people.
That's what Emir has done with a blue, ten - metre wooden boat for hundreds of times.
If the boat's full, it'll fit 40 people.
From one trip, Emir will make some EUR 8 000 afterwards.
Emir has five assistants looking for her customers around Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the arabic period a vast number of Tunisians wanted to escape the restlessness.
After that, the situation calmed down until it revived as a result of the refugee crisis.
Customers arrive from the continent to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir's staying in empty houses for as long as he sees good.
The food is given so that the customers are just and just staying alive.
Accommodation costs about EUR 75 per night, and if the customer stops the money, it's their problem.
We're going to go to the water at midnight with the lights out.
The first night you drive away from the island, then you stop, wait a day, and the next night you drive to Lampedus.
Sometimes seagoing is hard, and in waves of 20 metres passengers weep and vomit.
At the destination, the human cargo has been unloaded in half an hour and Emir is leaving for a return trip.
Emir wants to be afraid of him.
That's why he's beating his clients, and at least he's saying he's gonna beat the musicians to death.
He says in the book that once he was taken by the police, he threw all his passengers across the river and told them to swim on the nearest island.
"I picked up customers by one and threw them across the back," says Emir in the book.
The most peaceful passengers are coming south of Sahara.
I hear his countrymen have to assault him for this.
I'm gonna beat them up right now.
We need to show them immediately who's in charge.
It's the usual cab driver.
Goran is an ordinary taximan in Bogovaša in Serbia.
His taxi isn't very good. The starter engine's on its last, and by the way, it's seen the best days.
However, the most important thing for Goran's customers is that the taxi moves at all, and that it moves towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaša is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometres from Belgrade to southwest.
The centre for asylum seekers is located next to the village, where families are mostly allowed.
In the forests surrounding the center, without their family, men will stay in tents, lavas and abandoned cars, which now anyone has managed to find or build.
In the forest, families who have not submitted asylum applications in Serbia for reasons or other are also living in the forest.
Some also stay in private dwellings, but it is a public secret.
Among the foresters, Gora finds most of his clients.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans the route requires a large number of crossings and weekly walking trips in a difficult countryside, often in mountainous areas and in the dark.
When finally arrives in Bogovaša's region, in a large area of human smuggling, people are fatigue.
Goran’s riders are mainly Syrian, Afghanistan, Pakistani, Iraqi, and Kurds.
The best clients are Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say their affairs once and that's enough," says Gora.
He says the Africans are trying to do something.
That's not what Goran likes.
She's a fool all the way.
At first, for example, 300 euros will be agreed, then they will drop it to 200 and eventually offer 150.
Goran underlines being a nice and good-hearted man.
I don't care about money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," he says in the book.
Goran tells us that he works cheaper than others, and he's only paying EUR 50 per person to the Hungarian border.
There's a hundred miles on the road, most of which is comfortable on the motorway.
I hear colleagues are asking for a three or four-fold price.
Goran deserves about EUR 50 000 a year.
It is not a large amount for the smuggler, but in Serbia it is quite a nice annual income.
Serbia has ordered that taxi should not be transported 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Gora doesn't care: he knows the roads and the shortcuts and takes his rides a mile away from the border.
Then he'll show his clients the right direction and squeeze them away.
In the Work of Mercy
A 35-year-old congo man is called Ambassador, and it's not just a nickname.
He really has a Protestant Church in the capital of Uganda in Kampala, where there are many refugees from Congo, as well as a small centre to help the congo children refugees.
In addition to preaching, ambassador runs a smuggling business where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He looks at doing the work of mercy.
It's important for the ambassador to look good.
He polishs his shoes several times a day and ensures that the white underwear of the low belt of the jeans is stylishly stirred.
Ambassador is proud of his new Mercedes, his landlord car and three motorcycles.
When the missionaries do not preach, he organises people from Congo to Uganda and forward to Europe.
At first, the customer calls to one of the five phone numbers of the consignor.
He advises that you should come to the border in the morning, hide the money viciously, and smash it in amongst traders crossing the border.
In order to obtain an asylum seeker or a refugee status to the Uganda authorities, it is necessary to inform the Uganda authorities that there are, for example, war areas in North Kivu, and that they have been forced to flee violence in their homes.
Often it's true, but if not, the consignor will arrange a new identity for the client.
An old identity certificate will be destroyed and another will be acquired.
It helps the congressman's contacts in Uganda's police.
Then the customer will be directed to the same place where the right asylum seekers go: asylum seek procedures, NGOs, eventually to UNHCR.
Ambassador knows bureaucracy because he himself has become a refugee in Uganda.
He bills separately for each gate: submitting an application to the Uganda police costs about EUR 100, managing documents to the humanitarian organisation around 150 and moving process, for example, EUR 4 500-7 000 in Europe.
Foliota and ice burns
Tom's a start-up smuggler, an ex-drug.
A 4th-century Irish watches the French coast in Calais, where his job is to load people in the trucks on their way to Britain.
He has an Afghan, a French taxi driver in London, and a dozen truck drivers who may not even know he's in a human traffic business.
At night, Tom and the taxi driver picked up their clients, usually 2-3 people, somewhere near the Calais Center.
They're driving motorway A26 and trying to avoid the police.
If the police were to stop the car on the motorway, Tom and the driver would be put in prison for organising illegal immigration.
That's what Tom doesn't want. He's been sitting for seven years for drugs.
The cab stops, Tom runs over his clients' motorway to a resting place where the drivers sleep before they go across the channel to Britt.
Tom picks the right truck to make sure that it's on his way to England, not even Holland, and cuts across the protective coat.
We need to do it quietly so you don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver is involved, but then it's more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his client in a aluminium foil, the same as in the kitchen, wrapped around the paste or the oven potato.
It's supposed to stop the police's heat scanner from finding a hiding person.
Some use iced bedroom bags for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in a truck, and he leaves the place, hoping that the driver doesn't have a sudden flash travellers before Britain.
King of Smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the most famous human smugglers in the world.
The Upporian Turkish has been called the champion of marketing and the undeniable king of the Mediterranean's illegal increases in landscape, which controls sea routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been operating since the 1990s and has continuously developed new smuggling methods.
He also has a competitive advantage in relation to other entrepreneurs: he only demands money.
One of the new methods is a luxurious shipping fraud: Turkish ports are rented for a couple of days’ tourist trips to the United States or European families.
In fact, ships will be loaded in full by Syrian, Iraqi, Kurdea and Afghanistan, who will be transported against the payment of EUR 5 000-7 000 from Istanbul first to some port and from there to Europe.
Customers are stored in human storage, such as in old industrial halls until it is time for them to leave.
People are storing into minibuss and driving somewhere in the coast.
They are told to hide amongst plants and wait for the sign.
When it's given, we need to get on board quickly.
Passengers must hide under the deck all the way.
The Marine Guard can only monitor the depth of the ship's swimming, for there are no other signs of the crowd.
Food and drink are given, but the less the passengers stool and vomit, the better.
Küçük receives approximately EUR 53 000 for one luxury shipping trip after the costs.
He does not do practical things himself, but hire captains, recruiters, guards, accommodations and other smaller factors to do the work for himself.
During the summer period, shipments are organised at least hundreds and Küçük makes millions.
He believes to have purchased undercover companies through the country, the pharmaceutical company and more than 100 apartments he rents.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same time as the representative of the Turkish Democratic Party and an entrepreneur in the pharmaceutical sector.
After that, apparently, he's gone.
Corrigendum 16.9.2015 at 15.10: The Death Travel Office book will be published this week, not next week.
The American Olympic Advertising Officer tells in his book about his illness and becoming a prostitute
Three times the Olympics competing at the 1 500 metres of Suzy Favor Hamilton's new book has attracted attention to the United States.
Favor Hamilton, in his book called Fast Girl, tells me about stopping his career and becoming a prostitute.
The Sports Illustrated magazine published fragments from the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career at Sydney's Olympics.
He came to the races in top order and ran in the cluster for the second best time.
But in the final, he panicked.
At the beginning, he ran to the top and defended his lead on the earthly run.
But before the goal was 150 meters, his strength ran out.
He collapsed into the surface of the track, and other competitors passed him one after another.
I felt like an idiot and thought I'd never run again.
But I forced myself over the goal line, Favor Hamilton says in his book.
Later, Favor Hamilton suffered bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before Sydney’s races, and he himself felt tremendous pressures on success.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when he became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no economic problems, but the idea of getting money for having sex with strangers was fascinating.
He also oversounded his husband to accept his action.
Favor Hamilton's taxi was EUR 450 per hour.
He says he used the money for a luxury life.
One of Favor Hamilton's explanations for prostitute was also that he needed similar adrenaline defects as he had been competing in general sports.
Later, Favor Hamilton found out that he had bipolar disorder.
The double life of the former star drinker came out at the end of 2012 when Smoking Gun published a article on him.
Favor-Hamilton attended the Olympics in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was 1500 metres of the world's statistical community at 3.57.40, but he remained last in Sydney's Olympic Final.
The world champion rejoiced when the covenant reigned the Norwegian skiing squad:
The skiing king of Norway Petter Northug has crossed the boundaries for at least one of its colleagues.
Northug and the skiing union of Norway have been twisted throughout the summer and in the autumn, in the last year's athletes agreement.
Even though the union has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been suitable for a multiplying world champion and the Olympic winner.
The result of the contractual dispute was the Norwegian skiing union decided to exclude Northug from the future seasonal world cup.
The decision was given thanks to the double world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he's happy that the union has strangled the skiing pile.
"Thank you for showing me the spine," Jacobsen wrote in his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the Union's sponsor," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Skiing Union and Northug is about money.
It seems that Northug would like to be a part of the seasonal country team so that he can advertise his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said that he was happy to represent a union that also carries for future generations, and that one athlete would not give on the solos.
At the same time, he recalled that the alliance has given Northug both economic and other privileges for several years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb doesn't accept that one athlete has completely different rules than just because he's the best.
On Tuesday, Northug published his own announcement in which he assured himself that he would like to be in the brave Norwegian colors for the next season in the World Cup as well as afterwards in the MM races and the Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won six MM medals in his career, two of which were golden.
He was involved last winter in a team that won a messenger in Falun.
The shield of the spillers is also spent in the Nordic country
On shielding day 25.9., tricks are organised in various restaurants and shops that have been granted the Paist translation shield.
The aim of the day is to emphasise the high level of food expertise in Finland and to lower the threshold of departure to the restaurant and to raise awareness of the importance of the balloon as part of high quality.
At the same time, we would like to remind you that not all high-level restaurants have focused on the capital region, but the top restaurants that have been checked and classified by an objective operator are located around Finland.
The international attention received is an indication of the significance of the event as part of the increased awareness of shield foods and organisations.
In the Nordic country, the day will be arranged for a restaurant in Vaasa in Fondiks and Kantarellis.
In Kokkola, the shield day is a part of the Old Town restaurant.
The event has also received significant international attention.
The event has therefore been decided to be one of the most important international events of the organization, which will be held in different parts of the world during the same day.
Finland remains the host country of the event.
Kauhajoki-lehti: Chancellor of Justice for the establishment of a Disastrous reception centre
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are in collaboration with the establishment of the Refugee reception centre in the premises currently owned by LSK Business Park Ltd.
According to the complaint, the region still has a critical crisis-time infrastructure, which is used by the defence forces and its partner, namely the Finnish Special Networks Ltd.
The Kauhajoki magazine says that the private person believes that the establishment of the reception centre in the same building would constitute a significant risk of safety which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the Defence Forces may have interest in the area and airport of the former Air War School, which is not affected by the study as well as when preparing the reception centre, written the paper.
The case states that, for the last two years, negotiations have been on the organisation of flight training and on the outcome of a possible foreign operator at the airport.
This has been discussed, among other things, with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (ps.) and Head of State of the Ministry of Defence Arto Rädy.
A private person notes to the Ombudsman that the complaint is not a question of the principle of objection of the reception centre, but of the fact that the planned place in the former armed area is wrong.
The horror city government dealt with the reception centre issue last Monday.
Niche: the situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
The administration means that there are the necessary conditions for immigrants and those here, Niecstö commented to journalists in the evening after meeting the chairmans of all parliamentary parties in his office in Mäntyniemi.
According to the President, the concern for the management of the refugee situation was combined with all participants.
He considers it valuable for the government and opposition parties in Finland to be able to discuss the fundamental issues confidentially.
Especially in these times when we face major challenges
According to Nizza, the situation in Syria and the activities of Russia and the United States in the region may also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, in the Baltic Sea region.
Society is a hope for the development of the dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. the United States and Russia are capable, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and on the still tension of the situation in the Baltic Sea.
According to Nisture, the NATO issue was also ignored in the discussions.
The president did not take a position on the labour market situation.

Only alarm vehicles will be released to the area.
Metro and rat drivers throughout Friday's demonstration
Metro and tram drivers participate in Friday's demonstration from the morning to the end of night traffic.
The Association of Ratio and Metro staff told the STT this evening.
Most of the Alks close for two hours, including posts closed

The Early Education Agency will allow you to report further on changes in operations tomorrow.
Media Researcher: Sipe take a big risk
According to Sipila, the communication requires diverse channels, and the Prime Minister's TV and radio calls are one channel among others.
This kind of direct speech will also be needed in the future.
This is not going to be the last time, Siple said to journalists in Parliament.
Siple has not yet wanted to assess how often the practice of the Prime Minister's television and radio calls becomes.
According to the Siple, speeches may not always be transmitted in the Yle channels.
If other channels are registered as channels, then let's see.
Now, this channel is used tonight, sire said.
According to Siple, the Finnish economy is so severe that it requires that television and radio talks be kept to the public.
This file, which is now being discussed, is quite complex and requires a longer explanation.
That's why we ended up in this channel.
The speech will be sent at 21.05-21.20 in TV1 and Radio in Finland.
You can also look at it in Yle Arena.
Squirrel's taking a big risk
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä’s television talk is not about the more general government turns in.
Is it an attempt to take the right of a public debate more strictly into its own hands and to refuse to discuss questions at the University of Stockholm, Professor Anu Koivunen.
It reminds me of the recent comment by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Timo) Soin that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to define himself.
In the name of a democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these things do not relate to each other.
The man understands that commercial media is upset about the announcement of Sipilä.
It would be strange if the media field didn't react.
The communication styles of political decision-makers are not communication issues in democracy.
Definitely it is for media representatives to endeavour to avoid being taken by politicians.
According to Koivus, TV talk is a big risk for Sparky.
In his speech, Sipeh should bring something new and special into the table so that the exceptionally high expectations for the speech are fulfilled.
Is there more to offer today what we have already heard?
Or is he able to speak in a different way, differently, or differently, or say something new?
The manor says that if there is only more old, we need to wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it an extraordinary time.
In this sense, it is the case that it is not a particular situation, it is a routine speech among others.
The risk is that Yle is stamped as a messenger of politicians or parliaments and governments, which is certainly not in line with the interests of Yle or the general line.
A squirrel bet from the squirrel
In the forthcoming speech of Sipila, it is also important that what the Prime Minister fails to say, the media researcher stresses.
Tonight, we need to look carefully at where Siply missing and where not, says research coordinator at Jyväskylä University, Heikki Kuutti.
The cube says the TV is a clever bet from Siple, because this makes it so that it can bring its own view out without the sora noise.
In this way, the public will receive a message without a journalist filter, unlike the information conference where suppliers can ask critical questions.
The shrimp passes the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, it is a risk that the media interprets something wrong about the speech, because the precise questions are not allowed to be raised.
The cube says it's very important how Siple plays on TV, the sweat, the shaking hands.
He compares Siply to a father who now tells the people what to do.
If Sparky knows how to play it well, it can work.
The situation is different from that if the government were to inform about something, because this person here seems to be speaking directly to another person.
This (United States President Barack) Obama and partners are regularly engaged.
It's really extraordinary.
Political researcher Erkka Railo considers the speech of the Prime Minister to be very exceptional to the citizens.
According to him, there has been no such thing that in decades, the Prime Minister has spoken directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires extraordinary means, Railo says.
The investigator believes that the Prime Minister would like to congratulate Finns on the extortions ahead.
On Friday, wagers' organisations organise demonstration and strikes against government action.
In Twitter, the President of the Left League, Paavo Arhinmäki says that Sipilä could speak about the state of the nation in the Parliament as a statement by the Prime Minister, which would also allow the speech to be discussed.
The President of the SDP, Antti Rinne (sd.), once again, announces its challenge for the Sipila dialogue.
We don't have time for monologs.
It's almost six months from the elections.
You can't hide forever, Rinne writes on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy on a runaway has been found in Tampere
At the time the boy was found, he was fine.
The boy's father updated his Facebook page.
The Internal Finland Police Department will also confirm this for the evening.
The boy left to play out at four o'clock this afternoon.
Later in the evening, he was no longer contacted.
My father thanks everyone who helped me look for him.
Thank you for the ten contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed closer to 15,000 times which is an incredible balance in such short time
The Finnish UFC star was disappointed in the violent wildness of young people: You can cause anger
Makwan Amirkhani, a Kurditaist free fighter, published a video on Facebook, in particular inviting immigrants to young people.
Makwan Amirkhani gave a heavy speech against the street fights of young people.
Amirkhani, born in Iran and arrived in Finland with his family at five years of age, has so far won both their professional fight in the most respected UFC series.
Amirkhani tells me he got a message that asked me to look at one of the Instagram accounts.
Videos have been downloaded on the account, where young people fight with extreme violence.
Amircani says he's disappointed in the wilderness of young people.
26-year-old Amirkhan has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
Guys kick the rest of the country, sit on the other side, and beat the eyelessly without thinking of any of these consequences that this will result when you do these videos, Amircani updates.
It's hard to defend anymore
Some of the young people displayed on videos are immigrant backgrounds.
According to the Helsinki Police Officer Jarmo Heinosen, both immigrants and Finnish young people have downloaded fight videos to social media.
That's exactly what you're fighting at the top of the street.
You make the life of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, Turku Amircani reminds me.
Amirkhani reminds us that there are websites in Finland looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become very brutal.
It's a little hard, boys, to defend you anymore.
You should remember that you're still in a foreign country and you're going to be quite long guests here.
That's a different way to thank you for being here, Amircani says.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever get targeted by someone's racism, you'll be charged with it.
Now, think a few times before you go with me, guys.
Amirkhani says that violent action is a contribution to racism.
You'll make me feel anger that I don't like myself.
You've got things going pretty bad anyway, and you won't cure them at all, Amircani decides.
SAK puts its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
On Twitter, the President of the SAK, Lauri Lyly, says that the recipient organization will consider its position on Monday on the alternative list of savings from the STTK.
Lauri Lyly commented on the STTK's proposal on Twitter.
The STTK previously informed the Government of its own proposal to achieve the 5% productivity cut required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (keski) on Wednesday.
Sture Fjäder, the President of the Programme, believes that the Government will accept the proposal if the SAK, the STTK and the Opening Plan are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require the largest payee organisation to soften its previous position.
The SAK President, Lauri Lyly, on the other hand, commented in a few words on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will deal with it on Monday.
According to Lyly, the SAK is looking for solutions to "open the labour market lock" and that agreements on the position of forced laws are required by active parties.
Lyly recalls that the Prime Minister Sipilä's Government's proposal for a social agreement did not qualify for the SAK.
In the past, Siple broke the negotiations on the social agreement, when the SAK refused to commit to the objective of the 5% productivity slot.
Comment: The big-minded imagination threatens to shrink, "I know it feels a little funny to puke a fist."
It feels a little funny to put a fist in the pocket if there's a reconciliation paper in the pocket, writing Pekka Tiinane.
The tunnels vary in the payer camps.
Are you supposed to call the government for refusal, or do you want to agree with it?
On Monday, SAK's allied leaders gave up sacred hatred against the Government of the Republic.
The whole of Finland was threatened to get caught.
The threat spread to the charms, too.
The OAJ threatened to close schools and daycare homes.
On Tuesday, the OAJ canceled: no schools or daycares are completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd), Chairman of the STTK Staff Organisation, appeared in agreement.
He said that he had kept in touch with the government and was preparing an alternative presentation required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (kesk) as a 5% productivity scene.
Mr Sture Fjäder (kok), the President of the Programme, quickly reported that his reconciliation paper was already ready.
At first, the SAK office didn't come up with any rifles.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is difficult to agree when the federal leaders just told the country to stand on Friday.
However, at the end of the day, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau would meet next Monday to deal with the situation and that the SAK would seek solutions to "open the labour market lock".
In order to bring about a joint proposal by the employees, the SAK should tend to accept a 5 % productivity gap as a target.
No wonder the STTK of Palolan has relations with the Sipilan Government.
The right hand of the fire, Jukka Ihanus, Head of the STTK Social Contributor, was formerly the Special Assistant of the Central Prime Ministers, Matti Vanhasen and Mari Kivinieme.
The fire described the fact that the government's ay competence has been improved all the time.
It happened or not, but the exit of the fire took a bit off the Finnish standers, whose bowling picture is made up by Marko Piirainen of the ACP (sd).
It feels a little funny to wear a fist if you already have a reconciliation paper in your pocket.
Modified at 18:00: Added information about Lyly's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: "This must not happen again"
The Russian Duma President, Sergei Naryshkin, criticised the OSCE meeting in Helsinki.
The Russian Duma President, Sergei Naryshkin, believes that Mongolia is a better OSCE host than Finland.
At the capital of Mongolia, Ulan Bator, the OSCE Parliamentary General Assembly has begun to take place in which Naryshkin gave extensive comments on the July Helsinki Conference.
At that time Finland did not allow the presence of Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, who were forced to force the European Union, to come to the meeting - a matter from which the President held a reminder of journalists.
Our estimate was that it was against the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, Naryshkin stressed the news office according to Interfax.
In addition to Finland and the EU, Naryshkin's criticism was directed at the United States, where its access was also blocked.
Sanctions are political suicide from the EU, declared by Naryshk.
To Mongolia, the Russian delegation was able to become complicated, so Naryshkin continued to blink Finland by praising and thanking Mongolia for the "parallel organization".
I am sure that the Parliamentary General Assembly will proceed with constructive and positive results - unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that there are no obstacles to parliamentary dialogues.
Naryshkin has met in Ula Bator, the Ilkka Kanerva (kok), who has already discussed the Russian media with the Russian delegaation.
The lock meets the real playoff troll: "You paint tight"
Killpara and Lukko will continue the bull days in the Hakamets today when both of them are on fire on the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti anticipated that today in the Hakamets there is no real goal party.
Last night, the killer went to Kuopio to scratch the 3-2 continuation wins from Kalpa.
The rise was male because the last season's silver group was the worst of the two goals of the defeat position.
Tuesday, the lock was more brilliant.
As a guest of Blues, the Rauma people's catch was round zero points, and the loss figures were also 2-3.
Hard game, paints tight, if any of you play the same game as last year, Lukko winner Janne Lahti anticipated positions on the company's pages.
The killer has become quite a playoff nightmare for the Rabbits.
In fact, during the two previous periods, the killer has just dropped out of the lock's final series.
Both layers require a decisive seventh fight.
During the last season, the Lock took the show off in the fourth game, but Tappara rose to the next three sides and ends.
There are no major changes in group compositions except for goalkeepers.
The cats who rejected both yesterday will have a slide shift today.
With the goal of the killing, Mika Noronen will make room for Tomi Karhuse, and between the Lukko dolls, Rasmus Rinne will replace Ryan Zapolski.
View angle: In the Ace, there's a terrible play going on
Athletic director Hopela handwritten a non-compliant follow-up to the main coach of Rautakallio, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976 Sylvester Stallone handwritten a Rocky movie where he himself played the main part.
The subconsistent sent a sensational campaign for the heavy series of world champions Apollo Creed.
Rocky got a lot of sympathy, even though he eventually lost a title fight.
Thirty years after Rocky's first night, Mika Hopela manuscripted the unrestless Tuhkimo story in Pori.
An anonymous and wood-handed batteries went to the SM-finals in 2006 as a surprise for all.
The team was full of people like Rocky's anonymous, but struggling counterparts.
There was white Indian, Porin Matt and Pele Pelto.
In the fall game, players colored their heads red and cut the irocesis.
Hope became a blonde.
A great TV speaker, JP Jalo, called the coach Neumann.
The ace took the winning silver.
Hope was one of the heroes.
The manuscript Hopela believes that this season's news works work in the same way as ten years ago.
A man working as a sports director has built a pasture for the evil boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been smashing guys in a hole like Rocky pig carcass at the slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäen, Mikko Viitasen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparise are in some other than a biological game.
Hope has forgotten that in Rocky VI, the main part of the Pekka Rautatallio plays.
Karri Kivi has crossed the Rautamalky Sean Connery.
Rautatalio is as clumsy as Connery would have been in the 1976 original collection of Rocky, which was handwritten by Hopela.
There's nothing more than Rocky's nickname in the Iron Rocky Rocky.
The game philosophy of Rautatallion does not include assaulting and sneaking.
He appreciates a hard game, but it's different from playing hard than a pig.
In the last season, the Essien Garret Stafford took a Tapparan Jere Karjala to the head.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but Rautatallio put a man in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We're the only ones who deserve to play.
I don't accept a game like that, and it's not part of the ace hockey, and Rautatallio went hot after the game to the people of Satakunta.
This season of the mothers' team has been oddly built.
There are trains, veterans, cops, and squanders.
There are virtually no key men in the best game age.
No wonder the chief coach has complained about the lack of skill.
How much have you been able to influence the players' procurement, Pekka Rautatallio?
The events of the last season affect the acquisitions, and unfortunately the situation on the market was quite limited, Rataclio responded diplomaticly.
Underneath the surface.
The year 1953 Rautatallio is known to be interested in moving to Hopela's place as a sports bomb.
Men's contracts end in the spring.
The balance of the mothers in the three leagues of the season has the same number of losses on the goal difference 1-6.
I don't think I should have handwritten a part of the future.
Olga Temonen plays the mother of Sipe Santa
Olga Temonen reveals that if he had met his husband Tuuka as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen plays for the first time in the direction of his husband.
Yeah, I'm playing my husband's friend's mother in the movie.
In a way, it feels crazy, an actor, and the producer Olga Temonen laughs.
He has been married to Assistant's ex-basist and director Tuukka Temose since 2008.
The couple has worked a lot together before, but this is the first time Olga plays in Tuuka's direction.
The role of Olga in the early years of Assistant You made us a beautiful film is a drummer Sipe Santapuk's mother, Sirkka.
Sirkka seeks and supports his son, even though this father of Risto (to be presented by Lorenz Backmann) is trying to be a sound of sense.
The more I have come to know my true example of Sirka, the easier it seems to be.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuuka for trusting me in the role.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but then the two have become a great deal of convergence.
They've met, spoken on the phone and communicated.
The circus has helped so much.
We've been through a lot of different corners of their history.
It is also a good thing to understand that the drama is a drama and the truth may have to be a little coloured.
Olga stresses that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Assistant would become the largest band in Finland.
In the '90s, it was lame, and it was really rude.
There was quite a small probability that someone actually succeeded, but Sirka had some kind of intuition, and he was right.
Olga tells me that he had heard from Tuuka a lot about this youth before the movie plans.
However, parents' stories have been a little different sometimes.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how many parents really know what you're doing.
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different than the ill - famous Tuuka of Heinola.
Olga was an ark and a nice girl who had nothing to do with the movie Tuuka.
At the highest level, he could have been secretly in love.
According to Olga, he has worked so much with Tuuka over the past 10 years that the big joint project does not scare.
Everything's always been super good.
Now the whole production group will go to Heinola for a month.
Of course, a couple in Iiti is often planning to drive home for their young children, because the distance is not too long.
We'll take over the whole Heinola month.
They have received us very warmly, asking only what streets and when to be empty.
Iron Sky 2 became the most expensive play movie in Finland
Timo Vuorensola's Iron Sky: The Coming Race budget is EUR 17 million.
The descriptions begin in October in Belgium.
The director Timo Vuorensola starts filming the Iron Sky 2 film in Belgium in October.
The Scifi movie, Iron Sky, The Coming Race, will become the most expensive play movie in Finland in its budget of EUR 17 million.
In the past, the title of the most expensive film in Finland has been on the Big Game of Jalmari Helander.
The Angry Birds animated in progress will also rise after the completion of Iron Sky 2, as the budget for the film is more than EUR 100 million.
The film from Timo Vuorensola and Tero Kaukoma will begin in October near the AED Studios facilities near Antwerp and last for eight weeks.
The director Timo Vuorensola goes to Belgium for the next week.
The garbage budget isn't scaring.
I've been so sick and relaxed!
I have such a relaxed script because I know exactly what a movie should be like.
Everyone in the working group seems to realize that we're doing something unprecedented.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though time is tight, there's no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to show this movie to the audience, she's gonna tell the evening.
The initial budget for the film was 8-10 million, but the budget also increased as the manuscript developed.
It's a big budget, but it's a big stoor.
However, 100 million would be involved in the film because each angle and efficiency are so expensive.
Now it's all so tight that there's no loose.
The film production company Iron Sky Universe launched today on Wednesday a mass funding campaign and a bond of 4-8% annual interest.
The final interest rate will be determined by demand and supply during the campaign.
At the latest two years, the company will repay the loan.
In the action film, Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov are acting.
What's the matter with you? A giant or cool?
Big logos return to shirts
Trendsettes' breasts have recently decorated large logos.
A while ago, a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and large logos like Crocs in the console.
The commercialisation of a hood or a t-shirt was somewhat seen as a jerk.
It's time changing.
Sports has become a real fashion megatrend, and so are old, familiar sports fashion characters such as Adidas and Nike have risen to the wavehard of coolness.
And as often before, the silly and trendy boundaries are creepy: if something is already a jerk, it starts to become ironic and cool.
First came a standard core trend, i.e. a tavis fashion, where trendizers surprised by favouring as boring basic clothes as possible as a way to separate themselves from the mass.
Now, instead of a grey basic college, it's already buried on the bottom of the closet with the manufacturer's logo.
The bigger and the more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logs, for example, the tracks identified by Adidas, the favorite team's shirts and the New York Yankees tickets have made a return to the street fashion.
The bottom of the jeans begins to mock the Calvin Klein logos are now a cool detail.
Trendi seems to be moving into sports tires, too, to the luxury brands.
For example, the breast of Versace's systeria makes it clear what a sign of clothing is.
Would you be ready to introduce logos in your dress?
The Russian policeman published evidence: I didn't get into the tunnels of the tank!
According to the claims, a special incident would have taken place in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo 2015.
In recent days, the Russian media has spread colorful claims that the Ministry of Emergency had to remove large sizes of Zotovia from the tank lock for five hours.
Zotov has been doing everything he can to deny the information.
He even published a picture on his own public Facebook page, where he seems to squeeze the armored vehicle in a very good mood, and, on the basis of these images, it is not about catching or madness.
That's bullshit.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go into the battle tank, but it was a collision tank BMP-3.
I'm an ex-military, Colonel, I've served at Ural.
I went in there, looked around, and I came out in peace, and Zotov said the Comodomolskaya Pravda.
I didn't get stuck and I certainly didn't spend five hours in that position, he said.
On the Russian military TV channel, Zotov explained his enthusiasm to the exhibition of a new Russian technology because he himself is a former professional soldier.
That's why I was curious about what's inside the wagons, and I excited our techniques.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And in the next exhibition, I will definitely visit all the tanks and all the collision tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the writer's reporter a fool.
One stupid man wrote it, and everyone else repeated it.
There wasn't anything like that.
I went in, and I came out.
I'm long and rotting, but nothing like I'm stuck in a tank somewhere, didn't happen, he said to Russkaja sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotovi's words are supported by the fact that no photograph of the alleged congestion has been published, even though over a few days there were a total of 50,000 people in the arms exhibition.
The claim of Zotov's stuck-up started on the Bloknot.ru site, where Zotovin was told about his rims out of the tank lock and threatened to finally shoot everyone around, unless he gets out of the surface.
Later, the Bloknot site published a follow-up story where the exhibition organisers reported their views on what happened.
Everyone's just used to the fact that soldiers jump quickly out of armed vehicles.
But the representative Zotov, due to his great size, simply delayed when he came out.
But in no name he was sitting there for five hours, said the exhibition coordinator Aleksandr Pisarevski Bloknot.

There has been a leak at the Kittilän mine of Agnico Eagle Finland, the Canadian mining company.
The purified process water of the gold mine has leaked from the so-called enrichment sand to its stream.
According to the company, measures to correct the bleeding have been initiated.
The pool has neutralised enrichment sand and purified process water.
Usually, the water is pumped either again as process water or transferred to the environment through the surface area, as authorised.
The bleeding was estimated to be about 300 cubic metres per hour when it was observed.
According to the company, the quality of the flood water complies with the current permit conditions.
That's all the material went into the environment.
The bleeding was observed in the inspection round Monday morning.
The leak has not been shown to cause structural damage to the underground retention structures.
The company reports that it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent workers.
Dansken Kuopamäki: IMF warns you not to cut too much
The Finnish country report published by the International Monetary Fund today follows largely the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organization embedded in structural reforms covering Finland in order to overcome economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime allowances and paid holidays would support Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the whole contract system and unemployment security.
According to Mr Pasi Kuopimäe, the main economic owner of Danske Bank agrees with the structural reforms, but there are also small differences.
The IMF estimates a great deal of communication to the government's activities, but on the other hand, there are also the words of the warning that should not be cut too much.
These include, for example, infrastructure investments, Kuopamäki says to the Economic Reports.
The IMF also believes that growth projects should be implemented in the fastest possible timeframe to support weak economic growth.
The IMF expects Finland to grow by 0.4% for this year, which will rise to 0.9% next year.
Danske expects this year to be zero in its new projection of economic growth.
The IMF is a little more optimistic this year.
They may have had the most recent observations on the ground.
During this morning, Statistics Finland reported that the total production was in small growth in the summer, Kuopamäki notes.
The weakened trust in industry or other so-called softer meters could have been given less attention.
However, there is only a few decimals.
Nintendo, who recovered from death, appointed a new leader.
In July, Satoru Iwata, who died of cancer, started work on Wednesday, Nintendo told me on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and he was popular and charistant face in the game sector.
Iwata, for example, responded to the successful Wii-Consoli reunion.
The choice of a 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names raised as potential followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to monitor Iwata's footprints, assessing Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
The task of Kimishima is to see Nintendo being strongly involved in mobile games, but so that it does not eat the company’s bread on the side of traditional game consoles.
More and more minor asylum seekers arrive alone in Finland
In February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Agency acknowledged that even hundreds of children who have arrived in the country will disappear annually.
According to the Swedish Immigration Agency, the SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter have reported a number of minor applicants disappear annually.
Juha Kannelmaa, the Immigration Office superinspector, tells us what the situation in Finland is and how it has changed.
Is there the same situation in Finland?
How much of the applicants disappear in a year?- A total of 156 applications for asylum received alone were made in Finland in 2013.
They're missing nine.
In 2014, the corresponding applications were made 196 and they disappeared 11, Kannelmaa says.
The fact that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may have been found to be full-aged there may be the background of the disappearance.
In this case, the applicant may be more attractive to disappear than to continue processing the matter in Finland and to be returned to the country responsible for processing the application.
Similarly, some of the missing people will be found later when they apply for asylum in another Member State.
In 2014 there were 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of which 134 applications were withdrawn because the applicant had probably moved away from Finland, so adult asylum seekers disappeared over the last 123 years, he says.
Is there a growth rate?
By 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 requests for asylum for a minor who has become alone.
There is no total statistics on missing minor asylum seekers this year, but the number of minor applicants is therefore known and has increased clearly, which is likely to affect the number of missing people.
What happens to those who have received a reverse decision?
They also disappear, for example, to the "sötét labour market"?
This is difficult to assess from the Immigration Agency, as the police responsible for implementing the reverse decisions, Kannelmaa emphasises.
Petteri Orpo (kok) Minister for the Interior has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered seekers.
He has taken action on the matter.
At the EU Interior Ministerial Conference on Refugees, Orpo reported on Monday practical measures to manage the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to Northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A.'s studio online, see the pictures of the devices.
Because of disease attacks, Timo T.A. Mikkose's equipment for TV and radio production has now been sold.
Mikkosen's spouse, Nina Mikkonen, sells Huuto.net equipment that were the most advanced professional equipment in its field.
The Internet announcement was the first to tell me the website of Iltamacasin.
Today, most of the devices have remained in the footsteps of technological development.
In the digital media world, television programs are no longer embossed on Betacam tapes.
Nina Mikkonen is still confident that interested ones are found.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date in that way, but they are also needed as long as there is an old generation of material that needs to be digitalised.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of enthusiasms - collectors and builders of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen is thinking about IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkoset is trying to move away from the current Storm House.
We can't take all the supplies with us.
I've been beginning to invent and see where the goods are abandoned.
This is where I started, Nina Mikkonen says.
There is no use for television and radio equipment anymore.
It's clear from the rear acute acute infarction that a man who has worked long careers is not going back to work.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now only goods and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkosen's real life work was archived in summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to pick up films and other materials from Storm.
Traffic threatens to break up worse than thought: Metro and trams can stop all Friday
Metro and tram drivers today decide whether to expand their forces in connection with Friday's demonstration.
The original plan was to stop metro and tram traffic only during the demonstration on Friday.
During the afternoon, it'll be clear if the traffic stops all day.
Chief Confidential Pekka Hirvonen says the threat is large on the field.
Night and shift cuts are badly stirred by drivers, so the government's plans to cut the allowances are annoying resistance.
Hirvonen wonders, however, that stopping traffic all day is a dilemma.
If the metro and tram wagons stand by Friday, public transport in the capital area is virtually almost completely stopped.
According to the VR, trains do not travel between 6:00 and 6:00 a.m. on Friday.
Fridays aren't moving in close or remote.
The trains that left before 6 a.m. will be driven to destinations.
According to the HSL data, most of the buses are left on the curtain.
ACP members will be gone from work on Friday morning to Saturday morning at 3:00 a.m.
It is likely that a small number of buses can be driven, driven by the supervisor, Pirkko Repo, the HSL reporter.
Repo says HSL can't say exactly what bus shifts are going on Friday.
The wagers' organizations organise a major demonstration at the Helsinki Railway Market on Friday from 11 to 13 a.m.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tears against refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place at the border of Hungary and Serbia, where many refugees are trying to move forward to Europe, reports the news office AP.
According to Sky News, the refugees have tried to break through the border fence.
The refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in panic.
According to local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water pumps against people.
The Muslim boy was arrested at school in Texas, the teacher thought it was a bomb on his own.
In Texas, in the United States, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested after the teacher considered his own watch as a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News he only wanted to introduce himself to the output of his electronics.
But one of the teachers thought the watch was like a bomb.
The police were called, and the situation ended in the end of the boy's handcuffs being taken to the juvenile arrest cell.
Mohamed has not been found at any point to claim anything but that he had made the watch.
Still, it's still possible that the boy is accused of making a false bomb.
According to Mohamed, the police had said the watch looked like a movie bomb.
The clock is in custody of the police, but it was made up of a circuit board and a digital display that had leads between them.
The case occurred last Monday, and Mohamedia was punished for three days of forced leave from school.
His father is angry about the case, and the American-Islamic Council in the country wonders whether the case is another sign of Islamophobia in the United States.
British Head of Labour refused to sing a national song
The song asks God to protect the queen, but Corby is the opponent of the monarchy.
Corbyn’s own Labour Party representatives have also joined the criticism of the press which is a great deal of justice.
This has insulted the people, thought that the workman was a representative of Kate Green's broadcaster in the BBC radio interview.
Green thinks Corbyn should have joined the song.
Last night the Memorial respected the fight against Luftwaffe, Germany, the British Air Force pilots, in 1940.
The Labour Party defends Corbyn in its official opinion and stresses his respect for the pilots by taking part in the event.
We are all in a tremendous debt of gratitude for the heroism of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood respectfully silent during the national song, highlighted in the opinion.
Corbyn's choice to be a party leader has divided the lines of work.
In particular, there are those who fear he will expel moderate voters with their radical views.
Corby is in favour of unilateral disarmament, ending savings and increasing public expenditure.
Corbyn is to be present today for the first time in the House as a party president at the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corby has asked the public for proposals on what we should ask Prime Minister David Cameron.
Cameron was hanging on Twitter on weekends to choose Corbyn as a party leader.
The Labour Party threatens our national security, economic security and the security of our families, the Prime Minister referred to it on his own account.
The cause of Minnesota's family death is still unclear - the father of the family was waiting for a trial.
South Lake Minnetonka police have been investigating the family death of Minnesota Greenwood for a week.
The five-family family was found dead in their homes on September 10, and a few days later, the police confirmed that the shooter was the father of the family Brian Scott Short, 45.
After shooting at the shotgun, his wife and three children, Brian Short killed himself in the garage.
Days already dead
The family was found after the school was concerned about the absence of children.
According to this report, the police went to the house for inspections and found a huge house on all sides of Short's family dead.
According to StarTribune, it's possible that the victims had been dead for days.
Million House and a successful company
The investigation of the South Lake Minnetonka police chief Michael Sitar case is still underway.
The motive for blood works is still unclear.
The shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his property for nurses on the social media site of AllNurses.com.
In 2014, the StarTribune interview Short reported that there were four million visitors on the site every week.
I've been awarded 50 purchases in the last ten years.
I've abandoned them all.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
The success was seen, among other things, by buying the Short family from Greenwood in 2011 for two million dollars.
The property is advertised as a dream of a car collector in Zillow: there are not only 12 rooms in the house, but also eight car garages.
We're on trial.
According to StarTribune, however, the father of the family was waiting for a case.
Achieve Test Prep had challenged him for comments on the AllNurses.com website.
According to Achieve Test Prepin, the short site had not been deleted from the preppari courses, and they had therefore lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the trial had had a significant impact on Short business.

It's great, Loiri commented on his charming table.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned EUR 100 000.
The artist legend Loiri was still confused about Fabrice Duo's success in the great competition.
I still don't think it has happened.
According to Loir, the coach of successshevose will be able to work with the horse for full work.
Pekka decides where the horse is taken to compete.
And I'm gonna shut up, Loiri crawled.
"The greatest athlete of all time."
Montreal Canadiens' superstar P. K. Subban has given 10 million dollars (approximately EUR 6.7 million) to the hospital of the children of Montreal.
According to the medical report, this is the single donation made by the largest athlete in all the time in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban has committed itself to assist the hospital in another fund collection for the next seven years.
Subban made an agreement with Canadiens a year ago worth eight years and 72 million dollars.
Subban’s contribution is therefore significantly higher than his nine million dollars’ annual contribution.
For the award of his donation, Subban will receive a subway space carrying his name from the hospital.
The players in the Canadiens have used to help local hospitals considerably.
A year ago, long-term Captain Jean Beliveau gathered millions of dollars, including the same child hospital, and Saku Koivu collected a huge amount of money for another city's large hospital to get to the hospital a PET scanner for cancer studies.
You can order a wife from a Japanese cafe for the evening, serves a meal with only bikini and a shower on your head.
The thematic cafes are a tough thing in Japan.
There's already a goat cafe, a chicken cafe, a vampire cafe, a halikahvila, and now a wife cafe.
It hits lonely, social and hunger.
Metro's on the news.
From the Tokyo Ore no Yome coffee store (in my wife), you can order yourself a wife or a husband for the evening.
It's a waiter who pretends to be a client's spouse.
"Poliso" is selected from the list before the coffee shop comes and he prepares and serves food.

It will soon be 150 million vehicles connected to the network: Attacks against the security of cars started to be equipped
In addition, the Board of Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) supports technological developments and innovations in the sector, reports the Intel publication.
The panel is composed of top security experts from all over the world.
ASRB researchers will carry out continuous safety tests and inspections aimed at standardising best practices and design recommendations for advanced cyber safety solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel published the first version of best practices for cybersecurity.
The company will continue to update the report on the basis of ASRB's research results.
The International ICT Research and Consultation Company Gartner estimates that by 2020 some 150 million vehicles in transport have been connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share online data.
We can and must improve the cyber security of cars, Chris Young says.
ASRB allows Intel to establish the best safety practices and support the view that cyber safety is an important ingredient in each network-connected car design.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB Board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovatives in the processing of data.
Ford Focus RS will pay about EUR 52 000 in Finland!
Fordin Focus RS has been expected for years as the six rises.
Finally, the car begins to be in the perspective of Finland.
Ford released RS data now that the car world's eyes are in Frankfurt's car show.
Ford's new four-wheel RS is accelerated by its 350-wheel engine, which has 2,3 litres, and has a peak speed of 4.7 seconds to 100 and 266 kilometres per hour.
The price is also interesting in Finnish, and it is reported to be EUR 52 000.
The car is already available, although when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford will not tell you when it comes to Finland.
The favourite brand Kia presented two news in the Frankfurt car exhibition - such as the new Sportage and Optima
The new fourth-generation Sportage, where Kia intends to capture the ever-growing streetstorm market, is certainly more important than two in Finland.
The new European design director, created by Gregory Guillaume, is more rounded up than before.
There's another cent in the axle range and outskirts here, and the car breaks the air more efficiently.
The engine selection is mainly unchanged, but 1,6 litre turbo with 177 horsepower.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption are reported closer to sales.
We're gonna have to wait a little longer, because we're gonna have a new Sportage in the spring of 2016.
Even before the change of the year, the new Kia Optims got to our country.
Quickly, the news doesn't seem to change, but it's a new car.
Kia intends to conquer the hearts of higher middle-class buyers with better driving properties, lower noise levels and higher-level equipment.
Optims with 1,7 litres turbodiesel and 2,0 litres petrol engines are provided at the start.
Next summer, the pace accelerates when the Optima GT with a 2,0 litre turbo engine comes along.
At the same time, with that income, the sale of the Optima farmer begins.
Chisu returned to the stages... blew up in a brave shaft.
The singer Chisu is involved in the Life for the child concert with other domestic stars.
The electrical blue pants have a visible, open neck hole.
The apartment is beautifully presenting the singer's sleeve of the siro.
The total crown is golden metal belt and red lipstick.
During the three-year break, the mother-in-law singer has been cured by mild exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter will soon be a year.
The singer published his first single on a new album in August.
Back to the stage, and getting ahead of the general public after a long break, I'm not really excited.
I've missed everything to do with music, the singer tells me.
Chisu will publish in a few weeks a new album called Polaris.
The new situation in life has inspired us to make new songs.
At this point, I'm wondering if people find my new album, Chisu wonders.
Kim Kardashian's maternity style is resentful.
The true TV beauty of Kim Kardashian is giving the subject to each other.
He presents his pregnancy swabs and chest equipment with sexy clothes, last night at a time in America, when he left his sister's Kourtney Kardashian's husband Kanye West's job.
The black maternity dress is transparent at the breasts.
It reveals the skin-colored breasts underneath the lightning lights.
Last time Kardashian dressed for an amateur motherhood, she visited her friend at a dinner party in New York just a few days ago.
The black boots of the knees highlighted the point.
The third special maternity suit is as fresh as last week’s Friday, when she had pregnancy waxes at the show.
The hard laws of the model world: No home, you're lonely, competition is terrible
Manon Leloup wanted to understand that the model world would be a pure glamour and champagne party.
He made his own documentary, Speaking Dolls, where Leloup and his colleagues speak clean about the model business.
The Harpeer's Bazaar magazine assembled six hard truths from behind the scenes.
Every season starts with nothing.
Even if during the previous period you would have pose in top designers' suits, the new season will start again with castings.
And every season there will be new, fresh faces that compete with the cons.
The models rarely have a place they can call home.
The work is continuous travel and can take a year so that the accommodation is a hotel room or apartment where fashion houses accommodate their models.
If you are very young and you can't travel with your mother, loneliness can be unbearable.
New York and Paris are the most stressful jobs they want, but they are the most stressful.
There's not just one kind of weight.
Agent New York might ask to drop pounds, but in Paris, they say you're too thin.
Getting a job is a risk game all the time.
The designs and designers are all the time together and operate as a support network.
When the fashion sticks run out, the difference is shaky.
The models want to be in this sector because of the opportunities it offers, but the fact that everyone thinks the work is just a presentation of clothes.
The models want to be their own people, too.
The work makes the models feel like they're actors with some role.
But in the work of the model, you can also express yourself.
You're modeling last night in the Tory Burch show.
In New York, we are currently having fashion weeks where designers will reveal their models next year.
Roope Salminen, who changed his style, presents the most unknown Assistant Musician in the movie
In a film based on the early years of the Assistant Association, Roope Salminen presents the founding member of the band, Antti Lautala.
The Lautala founded Assistant with Toni Wirtase in 1991, but separated from the band in 1994.
It's a pretty big challenge for me, because I'm a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this movie I play a 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen laughs.
I've never wanted to meet the real Ant before the descriptions, because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly unknown to the people of that group, so I think it's good to learn his playstyle from the video only.
I don't want to make an admiration of a person.
The man who created the Roope Salminen and the dogs doesn't go into the role.
The Punk-Mans come with the man in nature.
The stars, the stars, in the punk period, surely many saw the premaits, as well as if they've ever been to our jobs.
Our performance has never been anything small, but we always go full.
Assistant in 1993-2004, Tuukka Temosen directed by the Basso, you made us the main actors of a beautiful film were published today.
The nuclear force that became known to the band's audience will be presented to the public by young actors who are not yet quite familiar.
Rumpali Sipe Santapukki presents Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirtasta Tatu Blueisalo Base Tuukka of Temo Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen told me about his future pestilence last night, when he mysteriously prepared for the most important day of his career in Snapchat.
The Roope has already published a picture of his new look in Instagram yesterday, which he had to perform for the film.
The Roope, seen earlier in the flies and jaws, has been driving his face into siloposch, and dyeing his brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: This is how you tell children about refugees
Many parents have in recent days had to think about how to tell the child about the situation of refugees seeking Europe.
Or should I tell you anything about it?
We do not need to talk about this by force, a member of the SPR crisis group, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff.
It is worth protecting smaller children, for example, not allowing them to watch the news alone.
Small children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can stay in mind and be distressed, he says.
However, if a child has encountered television news photographs of refugees or has heard about it elsewhere, it is worth talking.
It is good to have a debate on the basis of the child and to listen carefully to what he asks.
The fears of the child may be surprising.
They may not be the ones he thinks he's afraid of.
You shouldn't be frightened by the child even if you'd be distressed and frightened.
The smaller child closely monitors the conduct of his parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child will experience safety.
The older children are likely to encounter a debate on refugees at school, with friends or online.
It is good for parents to take the matter with them if the child is concerned.
The fact is, not all people in the world are doing well.
Parents, together with children, can reflect on how our family feels about this.
We still think that the world is a safe or unsafe place at the end of the day?
Parents may also have different aspects of education - some may want to protect their children from anxiety as far as possible.
On the other hand: If the family also talks about difficult matters, the child will be a model for dealing with the challenges ahead of life.
This could be useful for him in the future.

My own power at the end?
You can still be a good parent to your child.
Ballosalamaa, which hits the blood, is difficult to control
In the middle of the summer, the Perttu North swept the Apila Ballosalama into the attack.
It only squeezed profits and two places until the end of July a collapse in Tampere's raves.
Since the ori fled to the bottom, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered time from the veterinarian to the shelter.
An explanation for the extinction survived in the spotlight.
The horse had an inflammation of the throat.
The disease wasn't the least of the way it came from, but it took two meds to squeeze it.
Since the Apilan Ballosalama had to be in light exercise, the North says he was positively surprised by the last race of the horse.
It was in Turku on record time after the Taruntuule.
The Apilan Ballosalama was very stressful when it could have been driven normally only a few weeks.
Those things, with a small tendency at the end, were understandable, North says.
The coach assumes that a good competition made a blade for the slaves.
The horse must have moved forward, and I hope it would also have been settled.
Apilan Pallosalama has been so-called humor horses.
After it hasn't been fun, it could have thrown fat without any illnesses.
On the good day, the Ori have removed the lightning letter that the opponents have been wondering.
In a quick speed, competitors are unable to manage the Pallosalama, from which even warm bloody rides are removed.
The hopes of the north have a pee run at Vermo.
However, the different thing is how Apilan Ballosalama agrees with it.
It's kind of hard at the time of departure, and it could be a little bit of a bus under the boom and that kind of thing.
I hope the slave would be more calm than leaving Turku.
Apilan Ballosalama can also come out of the bow when it's okay, and we're going to drive with it from victory, coach permit.
That's why you can't get rid of the wrong iPhone programs.
Tim Cook, Managing Director of Apple.
At least some of the programmes that come with Apple's iPhone phones may sometimes be removed in the future - but not all.
Apple will potentially remove some of its own programs from iPhone phones in the future, explains Tim Cook Buzzfeed's CEO in the interview.
Apple's iPhone contains a set of programs that are relatively rare to use: such as FaceTime calls, Lehtikioski, Health, Exchange, Podcasts and Vinkit.
The latest addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which came as an obsession with iPhone phones, although it is necessary only for the owners of Apple's smart watch.
According to Cook, the removal of Apple's programmes is more complicated than it seems.
Some applications are linked to another iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook will tell Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which apps of Apple's iPhone are working firmly together with other programs.
There are other programs that don't work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them, Cook added.
According to Cook, Apple is investigating it, since the company does not want to waste memory on the iPhone phones of the users.
Inflation of the euro area fell to 0.1 per cent in August
In August, the euro area’s consumer prices rose only scarcely, i.e. 0.1% of the year-on-year, and Eurostat reported today by the EU statistical authority.
The rise in prices was drawn down by the cheaper energy.
Eurostat thus reviewed a few weeks' guarantee of 0.2% of the estimate slightly downwards.
In July, the inflation rate was 0.2%.
The so-called base inflation fell to 0.9 per cent in August from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat's estimate of base inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy in the euro area was 7.2 per cent cheaper in the last month than one year ago.
The average inflation in the EU-wide of 28 countries was zero in August.
In July, the increase was 0.1 per cent.
The highest number of euro countries, i.e. 1.4% of consumer prices, rose in August in Malta.
In Cyprus, inflation was the lowest at 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent negative according to the harmonised EU price index.
Inflation in the euro area remains firmly distant from the European Central Bank (ECB) objective, which is a two-percent price increase in the medium term.
The ECB forecasts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area this year.
The increase will rise to 1.1% next year, the central bank will expect its new inflation forecasts in early September.
The United States Fed's next attempt to blackmail monetary policy
The next fall in the United States begins at its speed in less than one year, but more certainly within three years after the country's central bank Fed again starts to raise its interest rates for a long time.
And the downturn in the financial markets begins before the next recession.
The Fed has suggested that the interest payments should be started even this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
Thus, the next recession can be pressed on by the fastest by the next autumn and as a financial market coursery before it.
Or, at least, this happens if the world's largest economy and financial markets work the way they've been doing, and if they react to the blackmail of Fed's money hanks as they have done before.
Such conclusions have been concluded by the German Bank of Deutsche Bank’s London Market Survey Strategies Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in their extensive long-term market and economic cycle study.
The Bank distributed a study report of over 60 pages to its international major customers last week.
The strategies drawn up by the study and the report do not believe that they know when exactly Fed will start raising its interest rates or what will happen in the economy and on the market.
Instead, by means of the cool facts and calculations of economic statistics, they present how the economy and the market have previously acted at the time and after Fed's increases.
In addition to historical observations, they will look at what the key indicators of the economy and the financial markets are now in the same way or in a different way than at the time of the previous increases - and what may result from it.
It is clear that both the economy and the financial market are now in a more humid state to face the rise in interest rates than once before in the 1950s.
I don't know, maybe a year to the beginning of the recession.
Fed's monetary policy and its current uptake have been pointing out by the leaders last summer and the beginning of autumn that the time to raise interest is beginning to grow.
The first interest payments for over nine years can already be reached this week.
The issue will be resolved within Wednesday and Thursday, when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Board of Fed meets at its two-day meeting.
For the past time, Fed raised its so-called Fed funds’ guidance rate in June 2006.
At that time, a series of relatively regular, but at a time of two years of interest rates of a small of 0.25 percentage points ended by Fed raising its interest rates from 1.25 per cent to 5.25 per cent.
The symptom of the financial markets started in 2007 from the difficulties of the most risky housing funding in the United States, and a year later the financial crisis broke into a global nightmare.
A major recession occurred in 2009.
Last time, the serious constraints on the financial markets and the real economy began slower than since the previous Fed increases have typically occurred.
Similarly, the trials were harder and rougher than once since the laceration in the 1930s.
Deutsche's strategics have screened the rises and falls of the world's largest economies, as well as financial markets from 1950 and from the beginning of the 18th century.
Fed's interest rates and their economic and financial impacts will be explained since the 1950s.
The first interest purchase has taken less than one year, mostly less than three years, and less than three and a half years on average.
The increase in the financial market has ended within two years of the start of the Fedi increases.
Fed has in turn raised and in turn declined its guiding rate from the beginning of the 1950s to a dozen different cycles.
Each time has differed in some respects and there are relatively few times in the review, so it is hardly possible to conclude any certain effects of the subsequent increases.
The strategies remind us that many things are different this time.
Not just better.
Rates too low for too long
Notwithstanding the crucial reasons for the financial crisis, those who are guilty may not be found undisputably even through decades of research.
But three points for the causes of the crisis and its destructive power must be somewhat undeniable:
1) In the 2000s, the Fed, the euro area ECB and the other largest central banks in the world viewed their guiding rates too low for too long.
They fixed the tech bubble tracks, and at the same time raised the following.
2) In the various parts of the finances and real economy, over the decades, the amount of debt increased even more by the overlapping of central banks as a result of monetary policy.
The biggest debt bubble of the so-called economic history was born.
3) In particular, the low-principle debt finances packed in the financial economy, most of the financial markets have spurred the largest price bubbles of the so-called economic history from shares to real estate, debt securities and commodities.
Even so, it is hard to argue that the financial market that increased to the heights of increasingly complex debt lines was rarely dangerous and unstable when Fed and other central banks last led interest rates upwards.
The financial structures set up in the reserve of debt instruments, notwithstanding that the valuation bubbles lasted until their time after the start of the interest payments and the cost of debt financing had risen.
The risks were realised as a financial crisis, followed by a large recession.
Larger bubble and more debt
The Deutsche Strategies do not guess what will happen next, but give the subject of nuclear activities to mention, for example, the following:
1) The Fed and other large central banks have now viewed their monetary policy more lighter than before the financial crisis.
If the interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they have now been even lower.
2) For a long time, debt has not been cheaper than it was ten years ago, but now the debt money is literally cheaper than free.
Thus, the debt load of the financial and real economy has not been lightened, but now in the various parts of the economy, the debt burden has been much heavyer than before or at any time before the financial crisis.
3) Liquidity from the central banks, which was denominated in the lowest and cheaper, has fallen mostly on the financial market and has slowed down the key types of securities and assets at the most or at any time at the top of the preceding the financial crisis.
And not only the latical atmosphere with the warning signs of the financial market, they also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and for decades from the hardest recession to the model than it has been before.
The euro area economy has hardly recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is unusually weak, but the pressures and risks of the financial markets are equally higher than before the financial crisis, when Fed next starts to tighten its money.
Perhaps the French Bank of Societe Generale's strategy, Albert Edwards, isn't as odd as it may be.
He has for good time trained the bank’s international investor clients for the following full translations:
First Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles go out, and soon, Fedin's time to put off the financial fires with even greater QE cash injections.
Hewlett-Packard (HP), which produces computers and printers, intends to reduce up to 33,000 jobs.
Most of the reductions relate to the corporate service party of HP, the company says.
HP is distributed in November to the Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which focuses on business sales, and the HP Inc., which focuses on pc machines and printers for consumers.
HP had the highest staff in 2011, with 350000 employees.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302000.
The company accounts for the single costs of $2.7 billion (approximately EUR 2.4 billion) of the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard from Enterprise will be reduced to 25000-300,000 employees.
Deductions from the consumer side remain at 3300 within three years.
HP intends to transfer its activities to low cost countries so that 60% of its employees would be in low cost countries in 2018.
The company tells us that he has already balanced his business so that none of its customers will be responsible for more than 10 % of its operating profits.
In the second year, the three most significant customers brought 65 per cent of their business profits.
iOS 9: how to get the new operating system iPhones after Apple update
The new operating system can be requested by entering the Regulations application, clicking "General" and then by selecting "Advanced Software Update".
If the update is ready, the phone allows you to download and then install it.
Some have had problems since this installation when the "software update failed" error notice has appeared on the screen.
In order to avoid this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst congestion to pass or try to update the iTunes program.
The phone guides the user in the final process.
This may include removing applications to obtain the status, but Apple has reduced this possibility by reducing the size of the update and also facilitating the process with a new tool that suggests removable applications and then reinstalling them when the update is completed.
You should ensure that the phone is loaded or close to the charger during the update that the battery is not finished in the middle.
If the download level is too low, Apple will not allow the update to proceed, because if the battery stops in the middle, it may lead to a breach of the update.

It is also worth ensuring that you have visited our list of all things that need to be done before downloading, so that things do not go wrong, and how you can protect yourself from it if they still go. iOS 9 brings with you new features such as a much smarter personal assistant and hugely new productivity features for iPad, as well as improvements that speed up and repair the operating system.
Yle: Minister Berner has acted in the government of the tax havens company
According to Yle, Minister of Transport and Communications, Anne Berner (central) has acted as a member of the Board of the Tax Paradise Company.
According to the above, the company was involved in so-called tax planning.
This is a Luxembourg Saltri II LuxCo company, appointed by Berner as a member of the Government in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner is still officially a member of the Government.
Berner himself says that he has left a notice of membership in May of this year.
I checked it out, and that's enough for me to leave a notice.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the registration chains take place within the agreed timetable, Berner says in Yle's interview.
Membership after fusion
Through the Luxembourg company, the Swedish Kährs holdings are managed.
Kährs is a parket manufacturer who merged with the Finnish parket manufacturer Karelia-Upoflor in 2012.
Berner operated in Karelia-Upoflor's Government in 2010-2013 and after the merger in Kährs' Government and in Luxembourg.
According to the top, Kährs' ownership in Luxembourg is through a multi-step ownership structure.
Berner tells Yle that he received a government membership at the second largest owner of Kährs at the Luxembourg company.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I've been involved in the government of Karelia-Upofloor owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was sought with a partner found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a capital investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I realized that my own job was to take care of the interests of the Finnish family company's capital.
It is important that we ensure that revenues from our Finnish companies are taxed in Finland and that the starting point was secured in this context, Berner says.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital's holdings in the company are not related to tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure set up for tax havens is due to the fact that the largest owner of Kährs had a capital fund in Triton for ownership already prepared by a Luxembourg holding company.
Espoo opens the company's maintenance reception centre
In Espoon Otaniemi, the first reception centre operated by the company opens for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 inhabitants from 6:00 a.m. today.
The number of locations can increase within a week for up to 300-400 people.
The Finnish Immigration Service will establish a reception centre for the former Rescue University real estate.
The activities are maintained by Luona Oy, whose sector is particularly the production of healthcare and medical services.
The City of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy agree together on the security arrangements of the Centre.
STTK prepares an alternative work-life blackmail package
The STTK will prepare an alternative package for government extortions.
The organisation also hopes that other recipient centre organisations.
According to President Antti Palola, the attention is currently in the Friday demonstration.
Alternative ways to lower the price of work will then be returned.
Everyone understands that life will continue after Friday, Palola pointed out the organization’s regime meeting to journalists at a break.
The fire estimates that, instead, the Central Economic Union (EC) is not prepared for discussions.
The TTK's economists have calculated that the change security contained in the Government's Competitiveness Package is estimated to cost the employer EUR 30 million when the second half of the package is EUR 2 700 million.
I don't know if it's a party's terrible enthusiasm to have a conversation if there's one relationship with 100.
Ball: Negotiation connection has been constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) has hoped for alternative proposals by Wednesday, since the government is to submit its own package to Parliament a communication and start preparing reforms.
The fire did not take a position on whether the timetable is realistic.
The connection between the government and the government exists according to Palola, and it has been constructive for him all the time.
In particular, the operation of Sunday personalities in the STTK field is a sick place according to Palola.
The organisation requires the government to withdraw from forced legislation to implement part of the extortion.
According to Palo, the STTK does not warm up to the preparation of the alternative package with the SDP that has held the matter.
Employees will meet on Friday to Helsinki to oppose the work life blackmail package presented by the government last week.
As part of the package, inter alia, the wages of the first day of illness are cut, overtime allowances half, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
The TTK emphasises the fact that the central organisations have invited employees to protest and that they have not been intended to organise a strike.
Fjäder's adventurous.
Mr Fjäder, President of the Programme, thanks the TTK report on the preparation of an alternative package.
According to Fjader, the STTK now comes to the same lines with the Opening Plan, since the Opening Plan has already outlined an alternative model for the government's presentations.
Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also be included in the alternative package, because without the SAK the package is not sufficiently comprehensive.
The President of the Programme, Sture Fjäder, hopes that the SAK, led by Lauri Lyly, will come in and prepare the presentation as an alternative for surgery.
The STTK of Antti Palola told me earlier that he was preparing new proposals on Wednesday.
We want change security and working time banks.
The plan informed on Wednesday that it has been preparing its own proposal for a long time, in which it is prepared to negotiate the 5% competitiveness of the government of the country as an alternative to cuts.
The plan has always been ready to negotiate, and we have long been writing an alternative model for government presentations.
We are ready to look at the terms of the service relationship as part of the agreement.
In response, we want change security and working time banks, says President Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also come to the Open Lines, as the STTK has done before Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
Now, together, we prepare a model that goes to the government and employers of the country, Fjäder says.
The agenda bureau will meet on Thursday at 15 a.m. of the decision on the possible content of the agreement.
"Same boat, coal, tallos" plays bingo when Sipilä talks tonight
Green Left of the University of Tampere
Viva's Bingokupon for the Green Left of the University of Tampere for the evening.
The Prime Ministers have previously held exceptional speeches during Mäntsälä’s rebellion and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of the Finnish economy in Yle's channels on Wednesday nights at 21.05 p.m.
In applying for the previous speech of the Prime Minister, Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was the Prime Minister when he had a famous radio call, which meant the beginning of the end of the rebellion of Mäntsälä.
After that, the President and ministers held a number of radio calls during the winter and consecutive war.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho held a new year's speech instead of President Mauno Koiviston, but it was more ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976 President Urho Kekkonen stopped the strike of train drivers on television.
Solitary call, monarchist makeup
Sparky's speech has aroused all day's criticisms and assumptions about what to come.
In Twitter, Paavo Arhinmäki, President of the Left League, said that "Sipilä could hold a speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a statement by the Prime Minister, which would also allow the speech to be discussed".
According to the Green Ville Niinistö, "a single call has already been seen.
The leadership includes dialogue, listening to people.
Erkki Judge of the SDP in Facebook condemned "monarchistic techniques: Prime Minister tells the people what's best for it".
The president of the SDP, Antti Rinne, challenged the Siply dialogue: "A little six months from the elections.
There is no single presence from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
We've been trying.
What are you afraid of?
Public service
According to the Government's Office, Sipilä's speech has been recorded in advance and takes about 15 minutes.
According to the SAK, the SAK president Lauri Lyly and CEO Jyri Häkämies of EK commented directly.
Your pride has been criticised for the presentation of the Sipilä speech.
We considered it and stated that it was part of the public service task to promote the full publicity of Finland, a line in the news of Ismo Silvo Yle, the director of Yle's publications.
It's like Me Tammelos at the time
The speech has also provoked irritation.
The evening dinner will be enjoyable in good time, the children will be combed and dressed for their best.
My mom puts on the most beautiful collar, and my dad makes a tie on his neck.
At 9:00 a.m., you'll be quiet down to the television as you used to be at Me Tammelos' time," writes blogger Saku Timonen.
"Does Prime Minister Sipilä, in his speech, also explain why the Finnish Government is sitting in tax havens with millionaires hiding its capitals, who are drawing up pardon laws for his fellow tax makers, while at the same time claiming to the people that it must be cut when the state has the end of the money?" asks Pia Lochikoski.
About what Sipilä says, one guess is presented by the University of Tampere's Green Left Viva.
It's published in Facebook a bingo below.
Do we hear about the same boat, coal, debt and team spirit tonight?
Coupons and pens ready, it starts at 21.05 and channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
In Ahtisaari Guardian: the Western countries rejected the Russian proposal on the exclusion of al-Assad
More than three years ago, the Western countries rejected the Russian offer that led to the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to renounce the power, tells President Martti Ahtisaari Guardian.
According to Ahtisaare, the Russian UN Ambassador proposed a plan to remove Al-Assad from power in style after a while.
However, the Western countries did not take the proposal because they believed that Al-Assad would fall otherwise in a few weeks.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaare, Russian ambassador Vitali Tshurkin, in his bilateral discussion, listed three points: the opposition was not allowed to be armed, the opposition had to be contacted immediately between opposition and Al-Assad and the abandonment of the Al-Assad power had to be undermined.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree with all things, but we are able to discuss them openly.
I told him what I was doing there, and he said sit down, Martti, and I'll tell him what we have to do, Ahtisaari remembers the Guardian interview.
Diplomatics do not comment
Ahtisaari tells us that she sent a message from Tshurkin to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurk did not confirm the content of the debate for the magazine, but Ahtisaare said there were no two words.
The UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaare's claims, but said that the Al-Assadi troops had already committed several mass murders at that time and that the main opposition groups refused all the agreements in which he had fallen under control.
Sir John Jenkins, former Head of the Middle East Department of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has hesitated to address Ahtisaare's speeches, since his experience suggests that Russia was never ready to discuss the fate of al-Assad.
Russia has officially supported Al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaare’s claim is that Tshurkin spoke with the mandate of Moscow.
If he had told me about what Tshurkin said, I would have said that I would like to hear the same thing from President Vladimir Putin so that I could take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, even in that case, he would have suspected that it would have been Putin's stunt to hold power on some al-Assad supporter.
Refugee flow from our own actions
During the negotiations in Ahtisaare, about 7,500 people were killed in the Syrian crisis.
The United Nations estimates that the number of victims exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of the current year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to escape their homes because of the war.
We should have stopped this disaster.
The flow of refugees to Europe is our own work.
I see no choice but to take good care of these poor people.
Now we're paying the bill that we made, Ahtisaari says to the newspaper.
Reserve for asylum seekers in Tornio
The organisation centre for asylum seekers designed by the Government in Northern Finland is likely to be set up in Tornio.
The center would be set up in a building in a empty building in the city centre.
The Ministry of Interior has sought a suitable place to better manage the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
On Tuesday, the Helsinki sanomamat news that the Council had already decided to present a school building as a spatial solution to the Ministry.
According to Sauli Hyöppisen, Vice-President of the City Council of Tornion, that is not true.
When the whole council was not together and part of the group wanted an official decision, we decided to invite the Council meeting to take a decision on Monday, he would specify to the STT.
At the time of the debate, 36 of 43 were authorised.
The Centre was opposed by 13 mandates.
On the basis of this, you could expect the decision to be positive, Snoopinen says.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city received contact on Monday, and quickly responded.
There would be an estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time.
The expert has checked that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is two hundred metres from the border, so it would be working in that sense, says Nousiainen.
Chip still hopes that the labour market is an alternative to excitement
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central), half the holidays in the public would only manage part of the government's desire to calculate the price of the work.
However, the government would be happy to accept an alternative package if the labour market organisations were able to agree on that.
In Parliament, Sipila told journalists that he had not contacted labour market organisations.
He also did not know how seriously the organizations are looking for substitutes for extortions reported by the government.
If such a agreement comes into existence, we will be happy to accept it as part of the overall package.
In the view of Sipilä, half the holiday money would be an instrument, since it would be directed to almost all employees, unlike the operation of Sunday personals envisaged by the government.
Labour Market Organisations could agree on the operation of holiday money as they are registered in collective agreements instead of law.
The Government will inform Parliament on Wednesday next week of extortion of working life as a communication from the Government Council.
According to Siple, the proposals of the organisations should be known before this.
This isn't the final back limit either.
Legislative work then moves, i.e. the train is on the move and it gets more difficult all the time.
It's a good time.
It won't take long in such a matter, if there's any will, Siply made up.
The list published by the Government last week contains, among other things, the conversion of the lopi and helatorsta into unpaid leisure days without shortening the annual working hours.
In addition, the wages for the first day of sickness are cut, overtime benefits are pooled, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
The reforms will be implemented as a forced legislation over trade unions, which has raised strong criticism.
As a result of the activities, the wagers' centre organisations are organising a major demonstration on Friday, and several trade unions have declared political strikes.
The Tohmajärvi Council approved the extension of the stock of juice hall
The Tohmajärve Council unanimously accepted the expansion of the stock of the Nordic Koivu Oy Hall, i.e. the juice hall.
The fact that the project was bigger and more expensive than the originally spoken was caused by the criticism.
A busy timetable is also brutal.
It was also a little wondered that the condition was not known a year ago when the previous extension was decided.
At this stage, the expansion of stocks in 400 to 450 square meters was approved for the investment programme, but the funding will be decided at the same time in the context of the interim report.
The agenda was still discussing the investment of between EUR 150 000 and EUR 200 000, but at the meeting, the Technical Director Erkki Ikonen reported that the price would be estimated to be EUR 300 000.
The investment was supported on the basis of the fact that it brings work and tax revenues to the site.
The municipality has no risk because the company pays the investment as a rent, Vesa Väistö (ps.) justified.
A place for Karelia in Joensuu
The city government enlightened its previous steep position to bring cattle-speaking streets to the center of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and right in view of the preservation of the animal tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu does not declare itself as the capital of the cattle’s tongue, because there are no historical grounds and the cattle’s language is a natural part of the area’s identity.
The language spoken in Joensuu has been more part of the Eastern Savos fractures.
Even after a new decision, there will be no cattle-speaking street signs.
However, the city of Joensuu is, on a case-by-case basis, also prepared for the use of the cattle language, such as information tables and tourism marketing.
The same approach is recommended by the city to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is an officially single language municipality, it is also worth taking the cattle's language at the moment that multiculturalism is living and changing dramatically even in the North Karelia.
The language of Karelia is still the specific characteristics of the county, as well as the image of Joensuu as the whole forest capital of Finland.
Both of them can be useful in the various kinds of marketing of the province.
Traffic termination cuts the province's vitality
Train links are surgeons that hit the province's vitals with a hard hand.
Transport links directly affect the economy and competitiveness of the province.
And it affects whether there is a chance to live and work here at all, the mayor of Joensuu Kari Karjalainen wonders.
He also highlights the air transport, which has also been on several occasions in the report.
It is important for the entire province that we do not have the opportunity to reduce the measures taken by the government, as it is now happening.
The impact of these terminations on employment, for example, should be seen, Karjalainen emphasises.
The deterioration of traffic connections causes an additional challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services here are, such as transport connections and housing, the easier it is to have students and employees, Director Jukka Mönkkönen of the University of Eastern Finland says.
He points out that poor connections also affect the research community, which is very mobile and travelling a lot for research.
Marko Junkkarinen, the recruitment director, says that the marketing of a university towards Western Finland is already difficult because the links are in the cross-sectional direction.
At the moment, about half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland come from outside Eastern Finland.
Some 10-20% of them are from New Zealand, which is partly explained by direct train connection.
Joensuu became one of my war voices for the war of Siu
The view of the city government of Joensuu on the regional war project of Siu seems to be unanimous, but there is one of the war voices.
Pentti Kesksalo, a member of the City Government, in the picture, presented a resignation of the entire project at the government on Monday, but his presentation was unreasonable.
The Government approved Kari Kari Karjalainen's decision-making proposal, which will be reviewed at the beginning of October before the City Council meeting, which will give a final opinion on the project at the same time with all other municipalities.
One train shift from Kouvola to Kouvola ends next year
Passenger rail transport from Kouvola to Kouvola will continue to be maintained, although one train couple is fewer than one train shift.
There will be changes in passenger train traffic between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One train couple leaves out, but five times a day still gets out of the Eagle to Kouvola and the opposite.
The contractions are due to State savings measures.
The purchase appropriations of the Ministry of Transport and Communications for the next four years will be reduced by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes will be completely shut down.
The VR will draw up new schedules by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed onto the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys got out of the place.
The Rescue Department released a 12 - year - old climbing from the torch to the roof, who couldn't get down on the roof with his own help.
The situation was born in Tornionmäki, Ketoti, at 6:30 on Tuesday night.
There's an old two - layered wooden house, where there's no ladders that take you to the roof at all.
It did not prevent a boy's team who decided to climb the roof of the house along the mast of radio amateurs next to it.
The other boys got down the same route, but one didn't.
As a result, others sneaked out of the place, and the passers alerted the rescue body to help with the draws of the last roof safely back on the surface of the earth.
FedEx's business profit is two, lowers the tax year 2016 prospects
The FedEx reported depressive results from the last quarter, and the supply was cut throughout the year after the output forecast, due to the deterioration of demand for freight services and higher costs for its land services.
The company also said that it was going to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for vacations.
This time last year, FedEx announced that it was hiring 50,000 season workers for holidays.
Its share fell by approximately 2.5 per cent in the opening auction 45 minutes before the midweek opening clock.
FedEx Corp. says that it expects next May to end the tax year for a result of $10.40-10.90, which is 20 cents lower than the previous forecast.
The analysts were waiting for $10.84. They're telling you on the FactSett's question.
Despite the average price increases of 4.9%, which came into force on January 4 and despite the higher additional charges in the country transport of heavy or large packages starting in November.
The company said that it would expect business profits to grow from the previous year, since they have cut costs, turnover has increased and online trade is growing.
The President and Managing Director Fred Smith said that the company will "govern firmly, taking into account the expected weaker economic conditions, especially in production and global trade."
The plans for wages for holidays were announced the day after the competitor UPS told that he was going to hire 90-95 000 extra workers, to the same extent as he hired last year.
In the quarter ending on 31 August, FedEx’s profit was USD 692 million, which is 6 per cent more than last year.
The profit per share was $2.42, which remains from the average forecast of $2.44. The 12 analyst survey carried out by Zacks Investment Research.
Turnover rose by 5 per cent to 12.3 billion dollars.
When Zacks asked, six analysts were waiting for $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years a reduction in international priority transport, which has stopped the development of the turnover of that Express unit.
However, the increase in network trade has improved the results of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the turnover of the land unit rose by 29 per cent, but the revenues of the operations were in principle the same because of the cost of the larger packages and their own insurance.
The income of the Express Unit was better due to higher basic fees, while the operating profits in the freight industry decreased by higher labour costs.
At the opening auction, about an hour before the opening clock, FedEx's shares fell by 3.85 dollars, i.e. 2.5 per cent to 150.15 dollars.
On Tuesday, FedEx closed 11 per cent down for this year and 17 per cent below the 11 June record.
The decision-makers of the United States Central Bank sit around a huge stomach table this week for two days at a long-awaited meeting to decide whether the time has come to raise the guiding rate for the first time for almost a decade.
In the second end of the central bank's decorative, two-step meeting room is a wall painting from the United States.
The map is a reminder that Janet L. Yellen, President of the Central Bank, and his colleagues, should put the economic interests of the nation above everything else.
The Congress has lowered the responsibility of the Central Bank for two: they must maximise the employment of the United States and keep prices stable.
However, after the great disruption, the Governors of the Central Bank have accepted that there is also a third, unwritten mandate: economic stability.
It is precisely this third requirement that can be a crucial factor in the decision to be published on Thursday, which is so strict that it cannot be predicted, the decision whether the US economy is ready to be re-routed from a record incentive that has been brought to the short-term interest rate of almost zero since the end of 2008 .
Although most of the information shows that the economy is growing stablely, the recent deterioration in the global financial markets may have already made the pre-secured officials of the central bank more frightened as to increasing instability, fearing how it would affect if the federal funds reference value were raised even in the quarter of a percentage point.
"The labour market and inflation are clearly the first and most important aspects to be followed," says Lindsey M. Piegza, the Meklariliike Stifel Nicolaus & Co's chief economic expert.
"I believe, however, that if they are looking for a justification for the restoration of the interest rate, increased uncertainty on the world market is sufficiently qualified to wait yet," he says.
The decision of the Central Bank has not been reached in agreement, which already creates an alarm to the economy.
According to Bloomberg's recent study, about half of the economic experts predict that the interest rate will rise this week.
The financial market expects the central bank to delay the increase, as the key indicator indicates that only around 30% of growth is possible.
This refers to a fall in the securities market if the central bank raises the level, unless the decision-makers then manage to soften the attack by promiseing that the next increase will not take place in the near future.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index rose 228,89 points, i.e. 1.4 per cent, while the new chapter was 16 599,85.
The recovery was accompanied by the expectation that the central bank would keep its level unchanged this week, explains the main economic expert of the Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It's surprising if the central bank raises interest rates right now," he says.
If the decision-makers raise interest rates, "they need to see a lot of efforts in their policy to support the financial market so that they do not panic."
Other experts claim that the increased level would calm the financial market, as it would eliminate uncertainty about the time the central bank operates.
Only a month ago it seemed that the central bank would be raising the interest rate in this month by a quarter of a percentage point, taking the first small step towards a slow tightening of the monetary economy, which would confirm the stability of the US recovery.
In spring and early summer, the fact that he expects the level to rise this year, despite the fact that Liberals demand more economic development in their choices.
Although the creation of new jobs slowed down in August, the growth in the labour market has been stable this year.
Unemployment rate fell to 5.1 per cent in the last month, which is the lowest figure for seven years and close to the level that the central bank considers to be the limit of full employment.
The increase in wages has shown signs of boosting.
Although inflation is still below the central bank's 2% annual target, the central bank's decision-makers believe that access to this will have a significant temporary impact on low oil prices.
The economy "selects even higher levels of interest and also needs them, taking into account the strict situation on the labour market," says the main economic expert of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, the financial markets around the world shocked last week when China devaluated its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index decreased by up to 16 per cent of its upstream records when investors feared the slowdown of the Chinese economy would also slow global growth down.
The market has recovered somewhat in this month and the Dow index is now almost 10% below the top end of the May.
For the CB decision-makers, the market failure is an additional factor in a complex equation which explains that interest rates should be increased.
"There are these events in the financial markets and recent weeks' news about the weakness of the Chinese economy, the decision-makers would tighten the level at this meeting," says Stephen D. Oliner, a special researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate, and a former central bank official.
Now he predicts that the decision-makers wait at least a month to gain a better understanding of the impact.
"The potential impact on the US economy is still quite unclear, and they do not have much information on the consequences of the Chinese events," notes Oliner.
International economic well-being is not the main concern of the Central Bank, so in principle it should not affect decision-making.
In practice, however, the Federal Central Bank has become the world's monetary authority.
In recent years, the central bank's influence has been vast.
In 2013, the President Ben S. Bernanken suggested that the central bank could "to cut" the increase in the amount of money, caused a disturbance on the market around the world.
In a world where the markets and economies are increasingly blending together, the central bank officials are expected not only to develop elsewhere, but also to consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the world economy.
The decision-making process of the Central Bank is "more art than science", says Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy of the property management company Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank, Richmond, Virginia State, pointed out this month that "the central bank has previously overreacted its financial market movement, which has appeared to be separate from the fundamental elements of the economy."
The Federal Open Market Committee, which makes decisions, has called for interest increases, and Lacker, a member of the Committee entitled to vote, refers to the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The economic crisis in Asia caused the central bank to cut its reference value by 0.75 percentage points during the three meetings "without regard to its limited, identifiable impact on US economic growth," Lacker says.
A year later, the central bank revoked these operations.
The central bank should give priority to the economic stability only during the major crisis, as when the market collapsed in 2008, says Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England.
The most recent myllery does not come near its level, Posen says.
"No one wants to be in a situation where the increase in interest rates is feared because the market is damaged," says President Posen of the Peterson Institute for International Economics Institute.
The federal law on the Central Bank (Federal Reserve Act) is still within the two requirements and does not mention economic stability, as long as this is the case, I do not think they should anticipate it.
Do you miss a great thai store?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown.
This store/warehouse was opened in 1997 and owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C, which is often referred to as Thai-Costcona, is a thai-cost shop, which also sells to private individuals.
Yeah, it's in Chinatown, not Thai Town.
The store/warehouse is a single stop store that offers a brilliant selection of fresh, frozen and dried commodities, popular Thai and Asian snacks, kitchen needs, furniture, religious and celebrational decorations.
There's also a car department in the store if you need motor oil.
The store is huge, and it takes more than an hour to go around all the corridors.
If it makes you hungry, you can eat in LAX-C BBQ Express.
The caterpillar (good, cheap) in the store is close to the bags, and there are a number of pick-up options.
What do you find in the warehouse? Do you need anything... anything from Thai?
LAX-C probably sells it.
Products have been priced rationally, and most of the products are sold in wholesale packages.
The fresh products contain Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs, fruits and other products.
The meat dish is wide, the same as the fish dish. The staff behind the dish cleans and fills the fish and, if necessary, shins it to you.
A large part of the movement is reserved for a huge freezer compartment where you can find freezing curry leaves, hairdrops and galangles, whole ducks, fish, beef meat and biscuits, porcelain leather, fish balls, local sausages, meals and other.
Who shops: Restaurant owners and cooks, but also individual families and individuals.
The records fit both the shopping cars and the trucks.
Finding: Fresh monthong duriotia next to the cashier.
Where it is located: The store is in the Los Angeles factory area close to Chinatown and central sites - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking area that it distributes with other shops and restaurants.
Even though there may be busy shops, the parking lot is usually easy to find.
The Brazilian Children’s Disease Organization in Rio Grande promotes healthy diet for breastfeedings
The Brazilian Children’s Disease Organisation SPRS has invented a shocking way to try to make women understand the importance of good food during breastfeeding by publishing pictures of babies sucking breasts that have been painted in illustrations of unhealthy food.
Breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give children all the nutrients necessary for the development of a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 calories.
However, the new study states that increasing the number of calories is not the only change in diet that mothers should make.
The recent research conducted by Professor Robert Waterland of Texas Baylor College of Medicine revealed that the healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genetic manifestation of their babies and protects babies from the development of tumours.
Unfortunately, unhealthy diet was found to have negative effects on the child’s immune system.
The Seven Channel Sunrise program is a favorite in the number of viewers, despite Nine channel companies, to news the director in Today Show
The attack of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to the Canberra to news the post-recovery of the Liberal Party was failed to increase the number of viewers in Today.
The Nine Channel morning program was sent from the main town of the country after Malcolm Turnbull pulled Tony Abbott.
The competing programme Sunrise, run by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of the weekly series of international broadcasts, including Dubai, New York, Niagara and Cancun.
The intermediate cargo did not seem to harm Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise’s viewer average was 397 000 in five state capitals when Today’s figure was 339 000.
Today's average increased slightly compared to Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but still lower than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has captured Sunrise in the past few months.
In August, Today's average was 318,000 and Sunrisen 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000 audiences.
So far, during September, the average Sunrisen is 349,000 viewers when Today has 314,000.
This is the most interesting event all morning.
Changes in the winds will blow this morning elsewhere than in Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!

The big news of seven channels was a 800-source series, where the former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson appeared, an amazing first performance.
The new drama series, which gathered a very impressive average of 1,219 million viewers, reports recently a widowed father who decides to move to the New Zealand coast with two children.
The critics have been wondering if Thomson's popular series would be the bearing power alone without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's results gave him real assurance.
The Seven Channel The X Factor was a strong favorite of 1,136 million viewers, easily won the The Block series (838,000) and the TBL Families series (726,000).
The Seven Channel had two fate on the second night of the Chase Australia series.
The first half-hour (17-17.30) of the new visa programme organised by Andrew O'Keefe gathered a medieval 446 000 viewers.
The second half-hour (17.30-18) rose to 623,000 viewers, which was small enough to win from the Eddie McGuire Hot Seat programme (613,000).
On Monday night, The Chase Australia’s first half-hour viewer was 520,000 viewers, and the second half-hour number was a peak of 720,000.
The average of hot Seat was 620 000.
The Chase Australian second night's average decrease will bring trust to the Nine channel that Hot Seat will eventually become the most popular program at 17.30.
The Chase Australia replaced the Million Dollar Minute program which failed to reduce the number of viewers of McGuire program.

The final three agrees with the fathers that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who does he choose?
The secret has been revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski could accidentally reveal who wins the Bachelor series.
The identity of that woman has been kept extremely secret with which Sam Wood ends up in the Bachelor.
The three remaining girls really don't slip who got the last rose.
However, when we discussed with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markosk and Lana Jeavons-Fellows a day before the three became two, they could inadvertently give a hint of the identity of the winner.
Sam Wood's lips are sealed before Thursday's finals.
All three women were poetry in telling how Wood is a perfect man, mentioning his sense of humor, ambition, family value and positiveness as a reason why they would like to be his partner.
But when they were asked, "If Wood's last rose is not for you, who should it be?", their answers could reveal who won the bachelor's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly mentioned Mackay as the best option for Wood after themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been messy since the first day.
"After the moment I walked in the house, (Sarah) energy and Sam's energy seemed quite compatible, and that thought was all the time in my mind," said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is really close to the country, it's fun to be with him," Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and there's chemistry between them.
They feel comfortable and relaxed together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood would be a good couple.
Mackay said last week's home visits made him realize that Wood could be "this right."
"When I saw him with my friends and my family, I realized that this is clearly not just a game - I'm with all my heart here now," he said.
When asked who Wood would choose if he wasn't, Mackay was mysterious.
"I don't know how to say," he said.
I like the remaining girls as much, so it's a match between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be sent on Wednesday at 7:30 a.m. on the Ten Channel.

Jarryd Hayne has many choices to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle were both very interested after he changed to the United States, and many other teams have asked him for his impressive open training day after the end of the last year.
However, Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers team and coach Jim Tomsula, and this seems to have been a wise decision.
Some coachs would have left Hayne on the switch seat for the rest of the game after this Australian rugbyliiga reversal dropped the ball when the first plane shot returned to the team in Minnesota on Tuesday, 20-3.
But Tomsula trusted her husband and let Hayne return the next flight shot and took her to the run after Reggie Bush was injured.
The real character of Tomsula was also seen in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of haunting his new enthusiasm in front of the other team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne in the post-game press conference.
The 49ers special editor, Cam Inman, reported that Hayne was also encouraged by Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the fallen ball and worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne dropped the Flying Gun, which Vikings took in the first quarter of the game.
This certainly wasn't the beginning Hayne and his numerous Australian fans wished a man for the NFL-debyy.
Hayen was seen cursed on his way from the field after the drop, and later he told the Australian radio pairman Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM channel at 104.1, that he could not have imagined a worse start for his NFL career.
"It was just one of these things, all I have to do is think about the next game and it's there," Hayne said.
Hayne compared his happering with its 2007 Origin debut when the input in his own goal zone led to Queensland's goal.
All of a sudden, it was a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne poseered in a photograph of his Instagram account with fans holding the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Put meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, the wealthiest man in Russia, Mihail Hodorkovski, was arrested with a gun in danger of a Siperian runway.
Hodorkovski had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated and his efforts to support democracy were limited.
4 died when the police fired rubber yards against demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a four - year - old son, died in the southern Nepal after the police fired rubber stations in a crowd that showed their minds against the new constitutional proposal of the country, announced on Wednesday.
Violence occurred on Tuesday night in the Rupandeh region about 175 miles west of the capital city of Katmandus.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the chief official of the area, said that over 1,000 demonstrators were gathered outside the police station, and some of them were throwing stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal said the police used the tears gas and then shot the air before he went into the rubbers.
Twenty cops and five civilians were injured, he told me.
It was not immediately clear why the rubbers that were known to have been killed, but which traditionally used as a less dangerous alternative appeared to have caused so many deaths.
Convergence was in violent demonstrations across Nepal’s southern planes during the last weeks, where the members of the Madhes ethnic group say that the new provinces set up under the proposed new Constitution will weaken their political influence.
There have also been protests in the Western Nepal when the Tharus Group demands a state of its own.
After 10 August, at least 40 people have died in violent collisions, of whom 11 have been cops.
At that time, the four main parties signed a contract that was distributed to the provinces - this is a big step towards the new constitution, but very controversial in Nepal, who has had a central government for centuries.
The new constitution has been designed since 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after the killing of thousands of people in the destructive earthquake in April.
The legislators have voted this week on the constitutional clauses in Katmandu, and the authorities have said that the new Charter could be adopted by Sunday.
The United States National Hurricane Centre NHC says that on the south side of Cape Verde there is 60% chances for a hurricane
The wide low pressure front, which is about 560 km south of the southest part of the Cape Verde island group, has 60 percent of the possibility of developing as a tropical storm over the next 48 hours, the United States National Hurricane Centre reported on Tuesday.
The second low pressure front, located in the middle of the Cape Verde island group and the Small Antilles, also has the 60% chance to develop as a tropical round storm over the next two days, the weather forecasting centre in Miami added.
Google begins the donation campaign with the aim of collecting 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) published a donation campaign aimed at collecting $11 million for humanitarian organisations that help thousands of refugees from Europe in their escape from the war and from the poor.
Google had an exceptional personal viewpoint in its publication of the donation campaign in his blog.
Instead of making a statement by the Director, his own personal experience was written by a Google employee, Rita Masoud, who fled with his family at the age of seven, from Kabul.
"Our journey was a number of dark trains and bus trips, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and darkness," he wrote.
I was lucky.
However, as the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has grown, people like my family desperately want to help.
Donations are received by four non-profit organisations that help refugees and immigrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Rescue children and UN Refugee Chief Commissioner.
Google told me that it corresponds with the same amount to every worldwide donation on the Google.com/refugeerelief site up to 5.5 million dollars, so that the total target is 11 million dollars.
The worst refugee crisis in Europe has been happening since the Second World War and is mainly due to civil war in Syria for four years, which has driven more than 4 million people from their homes this year.
Many also flee the war from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Dizziness surgery may help mildly obesity diabetic patients
According to the new study, the benefits of mildly obesity type 2 diabetes mellitus may last at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these mildly obesity diabetics live longer than those treated in other ways than in surgery.
"The death data will take a long time," says Dr. Robin Blackstone. He is a weight loss surgery expert who wrote a headline for a new study in the JAMA Surgery magazine.
In dietary or bariatric surgery different methods are used to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit food absorption.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most of the subjects involved have been sickly obese and their weight index (BMI) has been 35 or more.
BMI, i.e. the weight ratio to length, is considered normal when it is between 18,5 and 24,9.
If the BMI is more than 25, it indicates that someone is overweight, and if the person BMI is more than 30, it is considered that he is obese.
You can count your own BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new study, researchers in Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected from 2007 to compare two types of baritar surgery, gastric transfusion and reduced gastric cancer, patients with type 2 diabetes treated with mildly obesity.
The study showed that the average BMI of cut persons decreased from 31 to 24,5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, BMI remained mostly the same in 29 people treated by means of other means than surgery.
In 36% of cuts, diabetes improved completely and 28% partially.
Due to comparison, diabetes improved completely by only 1% and partially by approximately 2% in the pharmaceutical group.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and the "evil" LDL cholesteror" were generally better in the surgery group, the writers said.
Investigators also followed the blood haemoglobin levels of A1c, reflecting long-term blood glucose levels.
Haemoglobin A1c should remain below 7%, written by researchers.
Hemoglobin A1c after surgery fell from approximately 9% to 6%.
However, in the treatment group, it remained stable at approximately 8%.
This better "glycaemic control", which is described by improved haemoglobin A1c levels, did not reduce mortality over five years, says chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The study group also compared the mean results between two different types of surgery.
At the fifth year, when compared to the group in the gastric reduction surgery, the gastric transfusion group had fallen more weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg), lowered its weight index (7.4 and 5.1), reduced the haemoglobin to A1c levels by 3.1 per cent and 2.1 per cent, and more likely achieved a complete diabetes remission (46.9 per cent and 16.7 per cent).
The University of Arizonan College of Medicine-Phoenix Blackstone says that even though the research does not show survival or surgery after five years, there are research results from Sweden where the surgery led to longer life in more serious people.
The Swedish study found that overdose in weight loss surgery was 29% lower than the likelihood of death during the 15-year period when they were compared to a group that had tried more traditional treatments.
Although the new study does not appear to improve the survival of surgical patients, Blackstone says that the results are encouraging people with less than 35 BMI and are interested in surgery.
"The research results are crucial just in showing that the surgery is safe for a lower body weight index group", and it does not involve an increased risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take weight very seriously at the time of BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we wait too long before we take this seriously," he says.
I believe that once a person has gathered these genetic changes that permanently produce his body for obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to withdraw the situation.
"Everyone cannot come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees, adding that a real solution to the current refugee crisis is found in the Middle East.
The leader of the Buddhist Tibet has called for the end of violence in the countries of refugees.
Dalai Lama discussed the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech, which he held at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford at the beginning of his ten-day visit to Britain. The centre is devoted to ethics research.
Dalai Lama argued that, in the present situation, the needs of all mankind should be put ahead of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that although the response of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis needs to be admired, it is also inadequate.
"Everyone cannot come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama praised the action taken by Germany and Austria in the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful to take care of several thousands of refugees, but in the meantime, it is important to consider long-term solutions: how these Muslims can bring real peace and real development, mainly through education.
The ultimate thing is to think about how we can reduce killing in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of power.
The use of power has never solved these problems," he added.
When he raised the issue of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on the actions of George Bush after 9/11 terrorist attacks and claimed that the United States' violent response caused drastic events in the chain.
"After 9/11, I gave my sympathy to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem could be found through non-violence.
I know his motives were good, but he used power and it created unforeseen consequences," said Dalai Lama.
Over the last four years, the swallowing of the child’s hand disinfectant has increased to fourfold.
The toxicity data centres across the United States have reported a strong increase of almost 400% in the swallowing of alcohol-containing hand-disinfectant in children under 12 years of age after 2010, reports the Georgian poisoning database.
According to the head of the Georgian Poison Information Centre, Dr. Gaylord Lopez, the cases of the swallowing of the disinfectant reported in toxicity data centres for children under 12 years of age increased from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
"The children are more interested in these products and, unfortunately, a certain percentage of them will be taken to the emergency police," Lopez told the CNN.
He said that some children are deliberately drinking disinfectant, while some want to impress their friends or answer the challenge in social media.
There are videos on YouTube where teenagers drink disinfection to get a cheap increase of humidity.
According to the reports, the teens have mixed disinfectant with alcoholic oral water to get a stronger drink.
The smells of a pleasant disinfectant can tempt younger children.
"The child doesn't think this is bad for him," said Lopez.
Many of the more interesting (manufactures) are those with which the smell has been added.
There are strawberry, vinegar and orange fragrance disinfectants that are very attractive for children.
The hand disinfectant may contain any alcohol between 45 and 95%.
In particular, small children only need a few injections for alcohol poisoning.
"It's a really tightened alcohol", head of the University of Kansas Hospital Poison Information Centre, Mr. Stephen Thornton told Fox 4 to Kansas City.
So you wouldn't leave the whiskey shouting on the table, but the hand disinfectant is left visible, and if the kids are interested, it's a fast way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six - year - old girl who some time ago swallowed only four disinfectants of strawberry strawberries in the school, and was taken to care for first aid.
His blood levels of alcohol were .179, which is twice higher than the limit for adults to drink, says first-aid medical clinic Chris Ritchey, who handled a girl outside of the Atlanta at Gwinnet Medical Center.
When he spoke to him, he couldn't walk when he got to the emergency room.
Doctors followed him overnight in a separate child hospital for possible brain injury symptoms, as alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit his head, Ritchey told me.
"It was really scary," said Nhaijah's mother Ortori Scott to CNN.
The situation could have been killing my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use unalcoholic products or disinfection wipes and move the disinfectant away from children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants are combined with deaths.
In 2013 two ontario women died after swallowing a hand disinfectant containing toxic, unreported ingredient.
The health authorities assume that the product contained methanol, a fatal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, which had been reported as an active ingredients.
In January, in the northern part of New York State, three fourth graders designed to poison their "scary" teachers by spreading bacterial poison into the classroom, reports the police report.
The teacher is very allergic to the hand disinfectant and forbids it from his class.
The police need to prevent the plan as a "smart talk" and leave disciplinary measures to the school community.
Rumor: Celtic has no contradiction
Griffiths shorten speeches about Celtic's contradictions, and Deila admits that Hops is in a tight place, but he makes it turn.
Hearts fights against the Scotland Football Union for Neilson's charges, and Warburton is guard against the January recruitment that can interfere with the team's unity
Dons raised his lead on Celtic to five points.
The first half of Adam Rooney's punishment kicked Aberdeen to narrow victory from Hamilton at Pittridi Stadium and gave the team the opportunity to increase the difference to Celtic to five points.
Griffiths reduces the contradictions
There are rumors about Celtic's internal conflicts, but Griffiths immediately passed them, claiming that he and his team members have no sense of working under a more accurate eye when the team is preparing to meet the Dutch serial leader.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are waiting to meet you.
The lack of the Scots Championship is boring the Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers' middle field player and former Dutch country team player Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because they have no competition with Rangers.
The present ambassador de Boer of Ajax said: "The highlights of the Celtic games will no longer be displayed in the house, and why?"
Because Rangers aren't involved.
People here can't just talk about Rangers' return.
They're talking about Old Firm teams.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
The games of these teams have a lot of tensions, and also non-Scotlanders want to follow these games.
Deila swears to turn the situation around.
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian boss has sworn that he would turn the situation around.
Destroying Malmöl and the resulting drops from the Master's League quickly resulted in a loss of ten men to play Aberdeen, which is now at the top of the series by five points from the next.
But Deila said, "Celtic has had some bad episodes before, and we will rise again."
Now we just want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know this is frustrational and that many people are very, very angry or sad about what happens.
We are, too, but we have to go on.
We really need supporters because it improves players' performance.
Now it's important to stay together.
Warburton watches for January's player transfers
Although the Rangers Boss Mark Warburton just a few weeks ago commented on possible targets for January transfers, he is safe from the main recruitment, convinced that he does not want to mix the team with consensus.
The former boss of Brentford said, "The January shift window is very different from the summer window."
For future players in the summer, the time of adjustment is the whole precedent, which will be seen in our team during this period.
The team's doing really good.
Sometimes adding unnecessarily players can make more trouble.
Celtic's interest in Michu suggests retirement
The attacker of Swansea, Michu, whose name was attached to the transfer window in connection with Celtic, has suggested that he can retire after his agreement with Swans expires.
For two years, the 29-year-old player has had an ankles, and during the summer, he was unable to find a new company outside Wales.
Hearts is ready to fight the Scotland Football Union for Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field, and the team disappeared after this 3-2. The defendant's red card was later revoked, and this was already the third Collum's condemned red card which was revoked in the last eight months.
Neilson stays behind his message, saying, "I didn't question honesty, I didn't comment on performance."
Griffiths swear to avoid Tynecastle.
The faithful Hibernian player had to be reproached after singing an offensive song of the former Hearts player, Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place at the pub in Roseburn in Edinburg, before Edinburg derby at Tynecastle Stadium in March 2014.
"It was derby and it was a moment's imagination," the attacker added, "It seems safe to say I'm not going back to Tynecastle, unless I go to Celtic."
Tannadice's government believes in Dundee United's leadership - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly claims that the Dundee United government still has faith in the lead teams to turn the situation around, but admits that the weakening of players must stop.
"I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We're gonna get the boys all right again," says Donnelly.
McInnes is happy about the ugly victory in the Hamilton game.
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdeen, was desperately hanging in the game against Hamilton Accies, but Adam Rooney's first half-time penalty shot succeeded in reaching his seventh successive league, which lifted them up to the top of the table five points above Celtic.
McInnes says, "There is no team that would have won nothing, was either a pokaali or a league that would not have won games this way."
The unemployment of Scotlands remains the same as the whole UK figure increases
WORKING in Scotland lasted 164,000 people between May and July, while unemployment in the whole of Great Britain rose to 1.82 million in total.
The unemployment rate in Scotland is 5.9 per cent higher than 5.5 per cent in Britain, according to the figures of the National Statistical Centre (ONS).
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland decreased by 12 000 people over the three-month period, and the number of employees now is 2 612 000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74% over the quarter, which is higher than the average in Britain by 73.5%.
The Secretary-General of Scotland, David Mundell, commented on these latest figures: "The long-term plan of administration is to build the foundations for a stronger economy."
Almost a year has passed since Scotland made historic decision to remain part of Great Britain.
Over these 12 months, the labour market in Scotland has improved, employment has increased and unemployment has declined.
Why am I witnessing the execution in Oklahoma?
If there is no legal intervention, I will see later today when a man is executed.
If that happens, and I hope not, I'm sitting on the watcher's paper in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary prison watching Richard Glossip is executed with a deadly injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
I received a request in January through his best friend, and even though I was shocked, I agreed.
I've begun to be terrified this day when it approaches.
So why did I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
Obviously, journalists have the opportunity to monitor executions in America, and since applications are often more than free places, the participants are selected through a disgusting value.
Oklahoma has reduced the places reserved for the media to twelve-five.
Whoever's going to be picked is watching the event cool.
I can't do it.
I will sit next to the closest friends of Richard Glossip, and I have also created him through the calls that I have made in my own connection during the months, as well as one two- and a half-hour visit.
I like a man.
We laugh often when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be both a witness and a reporter, so I must not have a notebook and a pen to save what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
One of the oklahoman journalists on Twitter accused me of my neutrality.
Here's a lesson.
Tell me the story of the prisoner as he wants, and you'll be able to participate.
I complained to the reporter.
He admitted that "was able to set his word better", but he still feels that what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I've said and written.
He won't tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he said it.
I've told him that he can remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist to write about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes that the public will help to oppose the death penalty.
Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware is next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, you can listen to a series of podcast broadcasts I made.
I'm not going through all the details here again.
I can't be sure to say that Richard Glossip is innocent.
After the murder of Barry Van Trees, his actions would in any case make him guilty of assistance.
But I believe there is a very strong chance that he has not committed a murder.
I am sure that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think it's wrong to execute him.
And this is the point of view that I see him die.
I can't say I'm completely neutral.
There will be other journalists on the spot who will take care of it.
I'll give you a description of how it feels to watch a man I like die in vain.
The man was attracted from the Canning River after the watery police hunt.
Officer Canning Vale stayed dry when he attracted a man out of the Canning River.
The attempt of a man from Perth to distract the cops from his arm went wrong when he found himself in a low, mud water only metres away from a policeman who tried to "short him back to the beach gentlely".
The Canning Vale police were called to Beckenham on Tuesday because of an unauthorized intrusion.
When they discovered the suspect, this was trying to distract them by heading to the Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water, saying, "I'm not coming out, I'm coming for me," said senior sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want his uniform to get wet, so he used safer tactics to "good police negotiations".
"Sometimes people do funny things trying to escape," said senior sergeant Castledine.
Ben Cousins, the Master's Football player, is a remarkable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid blowing and tried to swim across the river Swan River.
He did not succeed in his company, but he inspired locals to begin the design of a playful Ben Cousinsbiathlon.
Peter Moody claims that journalists tried to spy on him and threaten to stop competing.
Peter Moody has claimed that Racing Victoria's operatives tried to infiltrate their stability to his deposits last year, and threatens to stop competition immediately.
He blames journalists and Racing Victoria's infallibility section, claiming that they have a personal campaign against him. Wednesday's late rejection of Lady Tatai due to the treatment on the day of the race was the last one.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what is best for competition and that he has had a difficult situation after the unexplained positive cobalt sample of Lidar.
He's been holding his tongue under control about the spies for a year and a half, and he didn't want it to look jealous.
"I wasn't going to say anything about this, and I've been silent for a long time, but sometimes it frustrates so much that everything will be dissolved at a time," Moody said.
They knew the situation continued.
Sometimes you just have to react and live with sanctions, and I have to live with what I have said.
I'm going home tonight and I'm sleeping well.
I want to walk upside down, and I want the owners to think that I'll do my best for them.
When they start to think differently, I don't have to continue as a coach anymore.
Then I should consider what I'm doing to my license.
Previously Moody dropped the bomb on the racing.com site in an interview where he told me that the iniquity department had tried to spy on his stable.
"Fourteen years ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in the room with a man, I'll call him when I asked him, and offered him a job on my deposits if he cares about what I'm doing there.
Obviously, they think I'm a fraud.
Well, if that's the case, they'd really like to fire their lawyers because they've failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of Racing Victoria, David Moodie, the current Chairman of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, the current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all clear at that time and are clear today.
Should I start thinking that this is going to be personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to become male and perhaps transfer responsibility to other than coachs about what is happening in the field?
Am I harmful to the industry?
Am I so harmful to the industry?
Maybe that's what people think.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me aside, and I don't doubt whether the things I'm saying now might make them think about it.
But I'm at the point that I don't care anymore, and it's gonna mourn me.
It really mourns me.
I push them to make a decision that is their responsibility.
I have my family support, and I can turn my back on this.
The frustration of the cobalt study of long-term Lidar has increased, and the late rejection led him to say that he could "throw his license over the table".
Moody, who is best known for the training of the undefeated master Black Caviar, has called the rule on the treatment measures for the race day after the mud or clay hat has been placed on the horse's feet, which is illegal.
"It's against the rules of competition.
I have to take full responsibility for it," he said.
One of my employees made it mud in the leg in the wrong way.
It could've had a grave last night.
It could have had it last night, just like it was.
It was on the race day.
Moody may have a three-month competition ban on the grounds of the hatching of the race day from which the journalists started the investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about the horse.
"We all understand that rules are needed, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Confidentially arrested by a driver who was forced to escape in Cobram
The police have arrested a man who committed a traffic escape after he hit a bike driver in Cobram this weekend.
A bike driver was transported by flight to the Royal Melbourne Hospital after he got serious injuries when the car hit him on the Murray Valley highway on Saturday morning.
The police told me that the driver drove away and didn't stop helping the injured biker.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia reported himself to the police in Shepparton.
He will be accused of not stopping in an accident, lack of assistance and other traffic violations.
The bikeman, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, is still in hospital and his condition is stable.
Melbourne Storm team coach Craig Bellamy attacks competitors in wrestling claims
Melbourne Storm's coach Craig Bellamy has criticised the two championial claims of NRL rugbyliiga that the fights of his team would be part of "line".
Coach Sydney Roosters Trent Robinson said that the judges allowed Storm's "pain" on their own side when he suddenly won the final map in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos Coach Wayne Bennett barely concealed his reference to the Storm after winning the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night at the final map. Bennett called the game Rugbyliiga's "show window" and said that the two Queensland teams were not "strongest enthusiastic" buttons.
Bellamy defended the fights of his team and said that they were just focusing on "contact" in a taklate.
Bellamy added that his confidence was increased by two leading coach criticisms of Storm, because it means that they are afraid to lose on the team.
"This is always going to be said, "I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when we lost them 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can assure you that we haven't changed anything in our defence systems or techniques throughout the year. In the last six weeks, we have only stressed the contact in the fights, and it has led us to success.
Trent's been on the team for three years, and he's obviously got a great team to train, so he's probably not used to losing, so this was a little shock to him.
It's funny how this always comes up this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "strengthening rugby" by reminding his mentor that the St George Illawarra Dragons, trained by Bennett, won the championship in 2010 by playing "strengthly".
Wayne's talking about an exciting rugby.
He thought it was important to compare his Saturday night game to our Friday night game and tell me how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember 2010 how St. George was often criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said that we couldn't care less.
But now he has a team that can play a rugby we think is exciting, especially when he has fast young friends.
That's the kind of game you want to play when you have its type of players.
He brought that side out in 2010, now he wants everyone to play rugby from his style, not every team has friends like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt to play it.
I'm going to be more confident when they say things like this because they're a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us as a resistance to important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game between Storm and Roosters was more score-rich than the game between Broncos and Cowboys.
Broncos game must have been a good game, I haven't watched it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two more goals, but is it exciting rugby?
Or does it make an exciting violation of the defense line and not making a goal?
For me, it's about lines.
If they mention us, it means that somewhere we can play against them.
Storm is free this weekend because they have already won the right to a home game against either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks next Saturday night to the pre-final at AAMI Park.
$200,000 guarantees for Serbians on drug charges
A man who is threatened by a lifetime of a 40-pound cocaine smuggling company in Queensland has been released against a $200,000 guarantee.
29-year-old Marko Maksimovic is one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police had traced 100 pounds of drugs to the Solay yacht who came to South America through Vanuatu and shipped to Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen meeting other accuseds on the boat all morning, and then he met them at the Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 pounds of drugs in the Toyota Echo car.
Although Maksimovicia threatens a potential life-long cocaine holding company for business purposes, his lawyer claimed that there was no evidence that Maksimovic tried to hold the entire amount and that he could be in the cafe for absolutely innocent reasons.
Peter Flanagan, Judge of the Supreme Court, was concerned that Maksimovic was trying to escape.
"He has strong links with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the Criminal Court case, Maksimovic lied to the police about where he lived.
Maksimovic’s mother and stepfather together offered $200,000 guarantees to ensure that he was released.
"After reading the conscientious certificates of both persons, it is clear that the provision of a $200 000 guarantee is a real financial burden for them," said Judge Flanagan.
But it was not enough to stop him from appearing before justice, he warned.
The guarantee was granted to Maximovic under the condition that he would give up both Australia and Serbia's passports, sign up to the police every day and adhere to his prohibition of movement between 6:00 and 6:00 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to attract pedofiles to send photos.
The pedophile used the 11-year-old girl's phone when she asked for pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl sleeping with this phone and then entered into the online communication service where Hogg received numerous unsettled images of the children sent to him by another user.
She woke up later, noticed that the phone was missing and found her sleeping in Hogg's hand.
She searched her phone and found some shocking messages, and then she immediately told her mother about it.
When the police came, the police saw five images, the computers on the spot, and found "careful" web searches on searches that were used to search for unscrupulous images taken from children.
Hogg then claimed to the cops that he had done this to lure pedophiles on the Internet before he "associated to be a cop to scare them".
Mr Fiscal depute, Eilidh Robertson, told the Dundeen Sheriff Court: "He said that it was a addiction - that he was dependent on the fear of people.
He admitted that he had completed the grave on the computer, but he said that they were made only because he wanted to pretend to be a cop so that he could scare the pedophiles.
He was asked for discussions with an unknown person who sent him the photos, as well as when Hogg asked him to send more pictures.
Hogg said he did this just for bait.
He said after drinking, he's getting sick, and he wants to watch pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added: "When the girl found pictures of her phone, she shouted, shouted and wept.
My mom saw the unconscious photos on the phone and then she met the defendant.
She was interviewed, and she told me that the defendant had used a computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked younger than her.
The 23-year-old Hogg in Ward Road in Dunde admitted his accusation of the manufacture or taking of unincarnated images of children on 14 June of last year. He violated his guarantee on 25 January of this year and left the court to the hearing on 24 March of this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to be included in the sexual offences register, for it can be claimed that his crime was not a "markable sexual element".
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal postponed the judgment until October in order to have time for social action to prepare the background reports.
Hogg was guaranteed in this case, but in other cases he's been arrested before the hearing.
He was added to the sexual offences register before the date of judgment.
Mr Mugabe, Zimbabwe, gave the wrong speech to Parliament
The oldest leader in Africa, Mugabe fell earlier this year at the leading stairs of the speaker.
He didn't get hurt, but the video of the crash spread like the virus in social media.
Parliament's openings also underlined the opposition's legislators' claims that they had been sent with anonymous threats of killing in which they were warned that they would be absent to Mugabe during his speech.
In the last month, they bumped and interrupted him in the middle of his speech on the state of the country to Parliament - which he repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition policies received text messages on their mobile phones that warned them not to disturb Mugabe's speech.
"The number of which the message was sent does not respond, but the title of the message is "death", Gonese told the editors after Mugabe speaking.
The message warned the relevant Members about the end of immunity to Parliament, and when they get out, Parliamentary immunity is not in force.
The group discipline officer said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai is "careful" of threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is prepared to cut between 25,000 and 30 000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost cutting efforts in business services.
Later this year HP is distributed to two listed companies, separated from business equipment and service activities that grow faster in computer and printer business.
The expected job cuts will bring about 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter, as stated in the HP Communication.
"These restructuring measures allow a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, the President of HP and the CEO, leading the unit after division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focalized than the current HP, and we will have a wide variety of services that will help companies to move into a new kind of business", Whitman said.
As a separate company, our ability to respond to the emerging needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
The annual turnover of Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be more than $50 billion, and it will "dispose to produce comparable integrated technology solutions" for companies, as reported in the company's press release.
The division will dismantle the company that Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard graduated from the Stanford University University were established in the 1930s to produce electrical supplies.
HP has been through a huge reorganisation to overcome the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the second largest computer manufacturer in the world and one of the largest technology companies in the United States, and its distribution is the latest in the sector based on the belief that firms strictly limited are better performing.
Captain Mikel Arteta of Arsenal says teammates have to support the injured Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb plays.
Wenger has also stressed Wilshire that it is only September and assuming that he's going to rehabilitate according to the plan, there is no reason why he would not be playing again by Christmas.
Even in this best case, Wilshire will miss at least four of the following English games, and in view of its background, it is uncertain whether he will participate in the next summer European championship races.
The biggest pity in this last problem is that the end of Wilshere's last season was strong after a single ankle, and he remembered his old sharpness before the beginning of the season.
"This kind of injury doesn't threaten career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't cure properly.
It's nothing strange.
It was just an accident.
It has nothing to do with his ankles or previous injuries.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but, as also Wenger admitted, the player attempted to return through the middle of the way there is always a risk of additional injuries.
There is also an uncomfortable model in the formation.
The studies of Premier Injuries Ltd show that Wilsher has had 23 different injuries since she debytoed six years ago.
In addition, during the last five years, he has played about Arsenal's 157 leagues in only 65 games.
In view of the wider overall of Arsenal after the period 2007-08, in six periods of eight it has been one of the Valioliiga teams who have lost the most days due to injury.
Wenger admits the possibility of a witch circle, but Arsenal believes that their last year's improvement to the disability statistics will continue.
"Sometimes when you get back from the injuries, there can be a susceptible period to strengthen your body and get a competition," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get over it.
I hope his body will be stabilized, I'm sure that it will happen, and that he will have a career that he deserves.
Wenger prepares to recycle his team when Arsenal starts his Master League game on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb and then plays against Chelsea on Saturday and next Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspur.
Hector Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to be at the start.
Wenger can also replace Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroudin Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to maintain a balance and give some rest to the players that need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear follow-up to the F block, in Zagreb of the Maximir Stadium is Europe's most frightening.
Also, Dinamo has not lost 41 matches since they produced their own "Invincible" campaign during the last season.
On Tuesday night, the stadium shocked the earthquake, which was 3.2 at Richter's scale.
It was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned about the last season of the Master's League against Monaco, and he is still motivated by the distant dream to lead the team to its first European cup victory.
"This motivation is huge," Wenger said.
Arsenal has never achieved it.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I can be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us serious things about friendship between men
It is appreciative how similar descriptions are not in the series, especially given that the need for men to open up is more desperate than ever, and that the suicide figures of young men are higher than 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the biggest cause of death in men aged 20-45 in Britain, and it is three times more common in men than in women.
In the attempt to address the problem Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced the year 2015 for men. The aim was to challenge a culture that prevents men from applying for help when needed.
Friendship is at the heart of this challenge.
In the recent study, more than 2,000 high school and high school-age students showed depression symptoms. According to the study, the possibility of a person recovered doubled if enough a high percentage of his friends were "health in mind".
Similarly, the probability of the emergence of potential mental health problems in those who were not depressed was half if they had healthy friends.
But so that friendship can work, it must be available first.
Through this social media, the style goes past content in the time of communication and the immediateity of the answer is often more important than the relevant contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, happy and successful, even though the isolation actually controls.
This superficial success is dominated by the values that psychologists call external: money, image, social status, all of this occurs at the expense of internal values - personal growth and friendship - that affects our mental health more deeply.
And as the billionaire of the video game developer recently explained, money really won't get more happiness.
Frendie's fineness was just turning this focus on his head.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but rather by their personality, which was clearly separated as friends.
Joey and Chandler's lots of hugs, moments in comfortable chairs, watching football, Ross miss Rachel, these humors came from the fact that yes, men can match all of this, even though they often hesitated to study their feelings completely.
As the volunteer worker of the Samaritans explained to me: "When I listen to people who are depressed and self-destructive, I have truly understood how small the interaction with a friend can improve feeling."
Often, men contact us experience that they cannot speak to friends.
The old idea of "exhausting" is strong, as is the feeling that if you open up problems, you will be seen as weak.
Frendit is one of the series that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term means of survival.
It highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
Although the neutral, external position of my phone on the other end help people in despair moments, long-term support comes from a close, personal family and friends network.
And so if you're in Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend, and all the locations are redesigned for the celebration, why don't you take your friends to a coffee in Central Perk?
Or even better, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know how much your friendship can mean.
Frendit sent to Comedy Central to the end of the ship, all 236 episodes, participate in #FriendsFest'
Di Maria makes the goal and helps PSG to slap Malmo on the side.
Angel Di Maria and Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan are celebrating paints against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria made the goal of the Master's League in Debyyti, helping the PSG pass the Swedish team Malmo on Tuesday.
Below the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right line when Paris Saint-Germain finally started his Master League with a nice 2-0 win against Malmö in Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria made a goal of the Master's League in his debyyte less than four minutes, pointing out to the French League Champions, but the team lost many opportunities before finally adding their way forward when Cavan hit the goal by 61 minutes.
Paris, who is in the same A block with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against the Swedish League Championship, for the game was not just a follow-up, but also a improvement in their quarterfinal games in the last three rounds.
But even though PSG took the points, it wasn't a classic game, because Laurent Blanc's team, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, lost the place in front of the goal and later switched from the field. Malmö is his old hometown team and the team in which he started his great career in 1999.
"In the Master League, it is not easy to win at home or in guests, so the 2-0 victory produces problems to the opponent and looks good in the statistics, and it is a good start, although there are things that we are going to have to do this season", Blanc said.
That's what's supposed to be good.
We wanted to win, and we won, even though I'm sorry we didn't succeed in making one or two more goals.
After the injury, Ibrahimovic returned to the Parisian team from one of the three changes after the team stayed on 2-2 sides in Lague 1's home game against Bordeaux this weekend, but he stayed in Di Maria's shadow for four minutes.
When he moved from Manchester United last month, the Argentine pimp was named a man who took the PSG to a new level in Europe, and he proved why he ran Marco Verratt's feed behind the Malmo Defense line and then hit a beautiful finish by Johan Wiland across the back of the network.
But if someone was looking for a simple and big profit from the PSG, he was disappointed.
Malmö was a blocked opponent, and he won Celtic's solution when he reached this level, there were nine international players in the opening field and five-man protection and two players in the deep center field.
But the team did not offer much more on the attack than the shooting of Nikola Djurdjic on 34 minutes, which passed the button by Kevin Trappi's paint.
Instead, the PSG was in trouble because of lost inputs and bad finishing, especially Ibrahimovic, who failed in five companies only during the first half of the time and then disappointed when Cavani put the ball in the first half of Ibrahimovic's touch immediately at the beginning of the second half.
However, he was much more effective in doing his pre-work with his colleagues, and just after Ibrahimovic's feed, Di Maria sent out a rotational kick that fell around Wiland's paint bucket at 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally reached after an hour of the game, thanks to his sixth goal of the season, the Swazi Cavan, after Ibrahimovic had stabbed forward the Maxwell Cross Eagle from the left.
It stopped Malmo's hopes of getting back into the game, and only Wiland's brilliant fight for the direct kick of David Luiz was kept the end numbers down before the goal of Ezequiel Lavezz came from the change was abandoned right at the end of the game.
Malmo Coach Age Hareide later admitted that the PSG was as high as his team. The Norwegian said, "Our last game of the Masters League was in December of last year."
Since then, we have played only in the Swedish League, which is not equal.
There's not enough quarrel fights.
I'm gonna pick up the hat for Paris.
This was a great game from them.
Glencore collects $2.5 billion on stock sales.
The mining industry in Switzerland left Glencore, who suffered from the cost of basic goods, collected on Wednesday $2.5 billion by selling shares as part of its extensive debt operation plan.
Glencore, listed in the London Stock Exchange, stated in the notice that it had sold new shares worth about GBP 1.6 billion to shorten its debt.
The company, which lost 57 % of its market value this year, struggles with the prices of the collapsed basic commodities, when the slowdown in the Chinese economy undermines demand and causes destruction on all markets.
The new label raised the value of Glencore's shares at the top of the London Stock Exchange in the mid-week morning stores.
The shares increased by 2.77 per cent to 131.60 per cent in the FTSE 100 index, which opened by 0.69 per cent higher.
Glencore had revealed last week a $2.5 billion stock trade as part of his broader plan to cut its 30 billion dollar debt burden by about a third.
The company sold a new share capital with 125 penny, meaning a 2.4% reduction at the end price on Tuesday.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares with a total value of 9.99 per cent of the group.
The concerns of long-term Chinese growth have cut the prices of iron ores around half, while at the same time prices of coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20-40 per cent.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
The Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the United States at the end of the month, the White House’s opinion was confirmed on Tuesday.
Xi's first official visit to Washington will take place on 25 September and is the answer to the last visit of Beijing in the November, President Barack Obama, the opinion said.
The President of the United States and the spouse of the President, Michelle Obama, will organise dinner for X and this spouse, Peng Liyuan, after having held bilateral negotiations.
"The visit of Prince Xi allows for the widening of cooperation between the United States and China in a number of issues of common interest in global, regional and bilateral matters, while at the same time giving President Obama and President X the opportunity to discuss constructively issues with differences" was added.
At a visit that was first published in February, Xin is also expected to deviate from Seattle on his way to Washington to meet numerous US technology leaders before continuing towards New York City and the United Nations September General Assembly.
Obama and Xin are expected to discuss a number of controversial issues, including Washington's concern regarding the alleged Chinese online spy and the increased country's continuity in the South China Sea controversial waters.
Matt Damon is decreasing the difference in filmwork.
Matt Damon joined the African American filmmaker, Effie Brown, when they discussed a difference that Damon said he didn't need behind the scenes.
During the Sunday evening of the HBO Project Greenlight episode, an actor interrupted Brown in emphasising the need for different perspectives as to the dark manoeuvre of the script selected for the project.
"When we talk about the difference, it will be taken into account when choosing actors for the movie, not the show," Damon said.
The shocked Brown reacted unbelievably, with the comments "Oh! Okay," while the Martian actress's comments stayed in the air.
The other producers, Ben Affleck and Farrelly's brothers, joined Damon and Brown to discuss the finalists of the series.
"I want people to think, "whoever the director is, how they treat Harmony's personal character," Brown said.
The only dark character is a whore hit by his white pimp.
The Dear White People producer demanded the rights of cinema management to finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon answered harshly that their direction "maybe to end giving us something we do not want".
After the conversation was sent, the social media exploded to devastate Damon's comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger for the movie game, writes: "Matt Damon speaking on the only dark person in the room and explaining to him the different kind of difference is about the light that hurts."
After its publication, the Twisting gathered more than 5,000 retwists and 4,000 loves.
Damon's comments are at a time when the exact racial presentation in the media is in the interest of social debate.
After the white police killed a teenage Michael Brown in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement spread across the country and urged the legislators and authorities to stop discriminating against colorful people.
In February, the singer Prince referred to the issue when he presented the album candidates for the year as a winner of the Grammy Prize.
"Albume still matters," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
The heads of the Black Lives Matter recently published an opinion to answer the question of Fox News' TV face Elisabeth Hasselbeck whether the group should be regarded as a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," the leaders said.
In fact, Damon was involved in it among the entertainers, producers and media moguls who have been invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unclear whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope.
The first American Ninja Warrior Master crowned
On Monday, a professional chopper and a dish collector of Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete who won the American Ninja Warrior competition and received a million dollars of prizes.
There has never been a competitor in the competition programme which has ended the seventh period, who would have survived all the parts of the programme's barrier track.
In the last episode of the series, two men, Caldiero, and cameraman Geoff Britten, survived the last round.
The last mission was to climb a rope of about 23 metres in 30 seconds.
Britten climbed first and solved the challenge in time, making him the first athlete of all time, who solved the exhaustive 4th part of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero solved the challenge three seconds earlier, which made him a winner.
Caldiero gave an interview to E!News after a hard win and was still in shock for winning a million dollars' head prize.
"It's this great thing to think when I've never earned or lived as much as $10,000 a year," Isaac told E! after his big raise.
So this suddenly... I can't even imagine what this is gonna be... the future is unknown.
The production director Kent Weed sat down to discuss the Hollywood Reporter's final list and why Britten is not getting more reward money, even though he is the first competitor of all time who has succeeded in crossing the track.
The rules say money goes to the fastest person.
"If more people pass, the money gets the fastest time", Weed said.
Even though money is a great prize and changes life, he gets a great satisfaction.
I don't think that's why he feels anger.
He's just so happy that he's done what he did.
His fans have praised him.
He's a great guy. He's a good family father.
He's a hero of his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If someone had to win me, I'm happy it was Isaac."
And I believe Isaac would have thought the same way if it had gone differently.
American Ninja Warrior returns to the eighth season, whose descriptions will be started in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneaked by Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS-- The second half of the period hasn't been very funny for Detroit Tigers.
Tigers used to be one of the best baseball teams, but now it's the last of the American League Central Division.
Tigers played his role perfectly on Tuesday when he won Minnesota at Twins 5-4 Target Field.
Twins lost the opportunity to get to a player's head from Houston Astros in a competition from another American League Wild Card.
For Detroit, the game was at least for one night returning to the six-word H word, which had been very difficult to reach most of the last half of the season.
"All the wins are fun, no matter how they get," said Tigers team leader Brad Ausmus.
The Tigers feeder Alfredo Simon continued his early assault support when Detroit ran three times in the first two shifts, and then once in the sixth and once again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) baited 6 1/3 in shifts and released three runs.
This was only his third grade in the last nine games.
"I just want a strong end to this year," Simon said.
It's hard for the replacement to feed every game, and that's why I want to go deep into the game.
The Tigers' replacements of Victor Martinez hit three times and allowed two runs that were his first hit their run after mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three-bag night after he hit four times against Seattle Mariners on 6 July.
"She blew the bat well," said Ausmus.
He looked good (in drill exercises), seemed considerably better in punching exercises and continued the same model in the game.
The Twins were three runs behind the last half of the seventh shift, and it was their best chance to get back to the game.
Sentter Byron Buxton started the shift pair by hitting twice on the left field line.
Aaron Hicks returned to the right side with one nest, and Simon got burned directly by another nest player Brian Dozier before Simon was switched to a left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked Mauer, the only player against the only one, the first to begin with Miguel Saya, who pulled two bases left of the right-handed Drew Verhagen.
When two runners were on the field and a smooth runner on the second base, VerHagen got the third base of Trevor Plouffe's double-playing landscape.
It was the main series record: 27 times this season when Plouffe hit the double.
After Detroit had received a confirmation run at the ninth start, Mauer had two hit-and-runs against the Tigers shutter Bruce Rondon, and the situation was 5-4.
However, the right-handed player burned the saying in three baits in the fifth salvation.
Detroit used Phil Hughes in rusty at the beginning.
Tigers received three runs in the first two shifts against a right-handed veteran player who got out of the list of injured before the game, after over a month of lower-left infection.
"It's obvious that I didn't want to start like this," Hughes said, "but when the game progressed, I was more comfortable, and I felt I had made a few nice inputs on the third pairs."
After Hughes grabbed the start beam to the first nest, he gave another nest player Ian Kinsler to go one by one.
On the right side, J.D. Martinez's walking in two fires led to Victor Martinez, who took himself on the middle floor to the first base and caused the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez cut off his 0-21 pipe when he runs in good runway stations.
Nick Castellanos, the third base player, continued by hitting right and causing the second run, but the threatened situation ended when Victor Martinez was abandoned when he tried to move to the third base.
Tigers continued on the second round and got one fire, two in the nest situation, the kidnapper James McCann, and two fires, one in the situation of the run center Anthony Goselt, followed by the situation was 3-0.
"It was an important hit," said Twins team leader Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit very well, but he flew to the right point.
Hughes began to be in the input counts and feeding the non-performing third pair, after which he became replaced by a right-handed prolonger A.J. Achter.
For Hughes, three runs were counted for six hits and a walk with four pieces.
NOTE: Anibal Sanchez, the Tiger's right-handed feeder, went off to the throw-hand shoulder due to stretch.
He's being investigated by Dr. James Andrews, who cut off Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the list of injured persons since mid-August, due to the upper wing, but he had to return on Wednesday.
While Sanchez is outside, the left-handed feeder Daniel Norris will be on the injured list to start against Twins.
Norris' statistics on Tigers are 1-1 in four starts after the left-handed feeder David Price was switched to him on July 30th.
Norris has been out since August 20th, due to the stretch of the right belly muscle.
The three Tigers and Twins game series ends on Wednesday at Target Field.
Norris (2-2-, 4.43 ERA) faces Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA) from the Minnesota right-handed feeder.
Xi calls for a wider economy to be opened to the world
The economy must help the outside world to promote growth more, President Xi Jinping told the group on Tuesday to guide the reform.
"Kina should commit to attracting foreign funding and expertise and developing transparency policy," he said, speaking at the 16th meeting of the Group leading to the deepening of the general reform.
Supporting transparency at the same time as the reforms are being driven forward by more new movement and vitality, and creating a new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The Management Group adopted a series of guidelines containing a negative list of market access restrictions, the degradation of border control principles, the urge of state-owned companies to take private capital and the revision of the resident registration system.
According to the opinion, a negative list of sectors and companies not to be invested will be established.
The system will be tested gradually and improved through experimental programmes.
This change is notable because it gives the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, ensures a legal business environment and makes the markets more transparent, the opinion states.
The government also stinks its control over the power it distributes to companies, ensuring that companies decide on how they manage their business.
The opinion also stated that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for developing regional growth.
In order to open the sectors governed by the State to private donors, more areas will be opened.
"The administration does not change its policy on foreign investment and will protect the legal interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better services," said the opinion.
In addition, the search process of permanent residential permits for foreigners, the 'green cards', will be facilitated by optimising requirements and reducing the search process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of the right to professions of lawyers and the support of professional judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang, as well as by senior leaders Liu Yunsha and Zhang Gaoli, an opinion published after the meeting.
