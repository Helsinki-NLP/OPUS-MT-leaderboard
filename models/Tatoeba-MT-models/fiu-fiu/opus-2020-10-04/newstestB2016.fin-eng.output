Found a 9-year-old boy on the escape routes in Tampere
The police have had a search mission for a 9-year-old boy's escape trip to Tampere on Tuesday night.
The disappearance report from West Tampere with his friend on the boy who left for his departure has been spread in social media.
According to the police station, the boy has been contacted, and he has no danger of life and health.
The son's father told her about the night after midnight that the boy was found.
He's fine, and now we're going to start examining him.
The boy was found in the neighborhood of the home. Dad told me.
Ronaldo again as a wreck - rip the paint difference to Mess
Cristiano Ronaldo hit five paints in the Spanish league this weekend and continued his factory in the Master League.
The battle between Lionel Mess and Cristiano Ronaldo on the goal of the Master's League turned to the latter for at least a moment.
Real Madrid's Ronaldo alone moved to the top of all time's painting statistics when he shot a visitor in the Shahtar Donetski network with two hits from the punishment kicks and one of the game situations.
Ronaldo lifted his paint balance to 80, while before Tuesday, there were 77 hits on the Barcelona Mess.
Real won the game 4-0.
Juventus has been combing the Italian football league in Serie A since the early season, but in the D block of the Master's League, it strongly started from Manchester City with 2-1 guest wins.
The winning painting was made for many ten minutes before the end of Juventus Alvaro Morata.
The city's attack bored the absence of Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, who was injured in the weekly volleyball game, came to the field only with the last ten minutes.
The second association of Manchester, United, also, experienced a hard time in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven, having suffered 1-2 losses.
ManU's 20-year-old civilian, Luke Shaw's visitor only lasts 15 minutes.
Hector Moreno's dangerous-looking slippery hit the ManU bag that attacked him so badly that Shaw's leg bone was likely to break.
Shaw lay on the lawn of Eindhoven home stadium for a decade of minutes before the medical staff went to the hospital.
Memphis Depay took the guests in 41 minutes to 1-0 leadership, but ManU's joy lasted just a few minutes.
Moreno fixed it before the break with an extra time.
Luciano Narsingh made the PSV victory painting in the second half.
In the Mester League of the Earth's season, Paris Saint-Germain started the A block.
This was the exchange of the Manchester United shirt to the PSG-fucking Angel Di Maria of Argentine.
Di Maria broke through the right and lifted the ball over the back corner of Malmo's goal watchman Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani made a 2-0 for the second half-time PSG.
PSG has been betten among the successors of the season.
The presumption is not wrong, but Malmö belongs to the league's small euros is not the best possible benchmark.
Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the Stargate of PSG, first encountered Malmö FF in his career.
Ibrahimovic started his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played for 90 minutes when his team in Moscow lost in the B block in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
The opposition party called for a divorce immediately - the President had the wrong speech.
The President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, gave the same speech he had spoken a month ago.
The Zimbabwe President, Robert Mugabe, has repeatedly held the same speech in Parliament that he held at the end of last month.
Mugabe, during his 25-minute speech, apparently realized that the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether the 91-year-old Mugabe was fully alive.
The main opposition party MDC asked Mugabe to resign because this is too old to rule.
Assistants of Mugabe rushed to say that the confusion had taken place only in the Mugabe presidency and that the President had not done anything wrong.
Mugaben's speech discussed earlier and now the impact of China on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria want an extra summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have presented an extra summit of EU leaders for the next week because of the refugee crisis.
Donald Tusk, President of the European Council leading to the summit meetings, assessed the request.
According to the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Heads of State should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how to register more effectively in Europe.
Negotiations on the quotas for asylum seekers, according to Mr Merkel, are on the table of the Home Ministers.
Professor admits in an emergency call that he shot his girlfriend.
Professor Shannon Lamb of college asked for an emergency call to shake the police at home a little bit and told me he shot his girlfriend.
Lamb mentioned in particular that their beloved dog was there and alive and probably scared. The professor told me that the contact information of the dead woman's family would be on the woman's phone.
Within the house, the police found the body of Amy Prentiss and the white paper, a message written in hand: "I am very sorry and I hope that I could withdraw my actions. I loved Amy, and he is the only woman who ever loved me", read by the authorities in Lamb's letter.
There were no signs in the house that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University in Mississippi Cleveland, had already traveled 500 kilometers to the school campus, and the police found Professor Ethan Schmidt, who was thought to have been shot by Lamb, who was dead at the campus at his office.
Lynn Buford, Chief of Police at Delta State University, said that the university's office received information about the shooting at 10.18 a.m.
She said Lamb called the fateful emergency call for some time after this.
One more death occurred in the day, and Lamb took his life when the police reached him.
The next day, the ambulances remained behind the locked doors, and the authorities were still trying to figure out Lamb’s motive.
Scientists surveyed the details on both locations, and Lamb’s teachers told them about the man.
Students always said they were eager to wait for the professor's lessons.
According to the Prentiss City of Dead Gautier police, the professor had no previous rape or crime background.
Schmidt, on the other hand, had mentioned in the book Lamb wrote in which he had confessed to the "famous people" with whom he could spend academic life with.
Both worked in social sciences and history, with 17 members of the educational staff, and many students participated in both men's courses.
However, references to the problems were raised.
Lamb's complimentary student Brandon Beavers told me that the professor seemed agitated and nervous, "as if he had a problem with something."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb had told her she was suffering from stress at the end of the financial year 2014-2015.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for a medical leave for some kind of health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's recruitment policy meant that the claim for which Lamb had worked hard was not automatically guaranteed the post of assistant professor.
University principal William LaForge told me that she was not aware of the contradictions between Lamb and Schmidt, but said that something clearly troubled Lamb.
She can't answer these questions anymore.
After leaving the campus, the police found out what route Lamb had come from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Before the police reached Lamb, he had taken out his life with a 38-caliber pistol in the backyard of the house in Mississippi Greenville, about a mile away from his parents' home, the Washington County Death Investigator Methel Johnson told me.
Lamb's car was still on the yard.
The police didn't find out why Lamb had just gone to this house, but Johnson told me he believed that he knew the people of the house.
He spent his youth in the area.
Lamb began his work as a teacher in geography and educational science at a university with 3 500 students. The city had 12 000 inhabitants in 2009 .
In the spring, he got his doctoral value in education.
One of Lamb's long-term friends described this as smart, charismatic and fun.
Carla Hairston told me that he met Lamb through his shared friends when he was 15 and 20 years old.
She and her friends were still in high school, and Lamb was an interesting older guy who tried to teach Hairston guitar play for years.
"The sheep were quite a heartbreaker at the time.
All the girls were on her butt," said Hairston, now 40 years old and living in Jackson's suburbs in Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were probably seeing each other for a while.
At the emergency call, Lamb told me he killed his wife, but according to any document, they were not married.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, and they lived in a brick house in the riverside in the small town of Gautier.
According to the police, the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband Shawn O'Steen told me that she was divorced from Prentiss 15 years ago.
"He was completely shocked," said O'Steen about his daughter.
"The daughter and mother were the best friends."
O'Steen hadn't met Lamb, but she heard from her daughter Abigail that she liked music and played blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met when Lamb and Abigail both appeared in the summer event three years ago.
Later, they also called together.
According to O'Steen, his daughter is composing and performing his own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for many companies through the network.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and a part-time entertainment coordinator in a modest The Julep Room outside Gautier, said he saw Lamb and Prentiss on September 5, when Lamb had played guitar and lipstick to a rare audience.
Nothing said that something was wrong.
"A happy couple," Shaffer said.
"We were playing together.
Both of them had a good sense of humor."
"The professor Schmidt, who received his pride, led the first year's seminars and was specialized in the history of Indians and colonial times," said English professor Don Allan Mitchell.
He was married, and he had three little children.
He studied the Emporia State University in Kansas and was his own brotherhood and the chairman of the college.
At the campus of Delta State University in Cleveland there are 900 people gathered at a memorial event in the candlelight. There were teachers, other staff, students and residents in the area.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the night event where the choir of the university presented the songs "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
Learning continues on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get the students back," LaForge said.
"The crisis is over.
This is a healing day."
Amy and Rogelio Solis report on Mississippi Cleveland.
Assistant journalists: Associated Press journalists Emily Wagster Pettus Mississippi Greenville and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The case has been corrected, because the police are now telling me that Lamb called an emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and it was further explained that even though Lamb referred to the emergency call as Prentiss as his wife, there is no evidence of their marriage.
Toys R Us intends to hire less seasonal workers
Toys R Us does not intend to hire seasonal workers as much as last year. However, the retailer of toys and baby products tells its current employees and seasonal workers that they have the opportunity for additional working hours.
The company intends to hire 40 000 people in shops and distribution centres across the country. In 2014 it hired 45 000 seasonal workers.
Most of the jobs are part-time.
The interviews of applicants will start this month, and new workers will start in October to December.
Although there are still months of vacation, the trade season is approaching at a good rate, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workforce for shops and for the delivery and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox is joking about her date with Princess Diana.
Back to the future, the first night of the film was a very important moment for Michael J. Fox's career.
The first night was also personal.
"We were sitting in the theater and we were waiting for the royals to arrive, and I noticed that there was an empty place next to me, and I found that Princess Diana was coming next to me," Fox told me that the back in Time document was coming in the trailer.
"When the movie started, I realized that the situation reminded me of a date with the Princess of Wales."
The Back in Time document relates to the future films, and the document also interviews Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeck and producer Steven Spielberg.
Back to the future, the film got his first night 30 years ago.
"This movie is definitely a time travel movie for me all the time," Spielberg said.
Back in Time is published in VOD and DVD formats and is presented in selected film theatres since October.
Secretary-General of the United Nations: no military solution in Syria
The UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon commented on the reinforced military action in Russia and notes that there is no military solution to the almost five-year conflict and that weapons only bring more violence and more suffering to millions of people.
The Secretary-General again called on all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to combine its powers and to support comprehensive negotiations to find a political solution.
At the press conference on Wednesday, Ban reported his intentions to meet five permanent Member States of the Security Council, the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France, to discuss the situation in Syria, which would later be scheduled for the United Nations General Assembly in this month.
Ban regretted that the dispersal of the Security Council, the Syrian people and the regional powers caused the situation that cannot be resolved.
Ban called on five permanent Member States to demonstrate similar solidarity and coherence in the context of the Syrian crisis in which the Iranian nuclear agreement was reached.
Chapter 8 of the Support Questions: Is Donald Trump serious?
Trumpia has been attempted to be stamped as an empty speaker.
He's also been considered a joke.
Some foretells Trump's crash.
The Republican circles have (the 12th) been unresulted by every effort to pull Trump down from the galaxy.
Ten out of 11 national gallups show Donald Trump two-digit support figures, some of which are already seriously considering what it says in practice about the conditions of the real estate mogul.
But the elections are only in the early stage.
No one has yet been announced that Trump is elected candidate for the Republicans.
Experts remind us that Rick Perry, who was at this time in the galaxy in 2011, was allowed to give room to the upcoming Herman Cain, which did not eventually win the probation in any state.
Trump would be difficult for many reasons in public elections.
External groups, such as Jeb Bush Super PAC and the economic Conservative Club for Growth, have noted Trump's strong position and started digging his slope for him.
The following fresh gallup data indicate that the real estate moguli cannot be ignored by the shoulder adjustment:
There's been a full translation of Trump's support.
Just before Trump announced that he was candidate in mid-June, only two of the ten Republicans, according to the University of Monmouth, had a positive picture of the property mogul.
By mid July, 40% had a positive idea.
At the beginning of August, the corresponding proportion was 52 per cent.
Now six out of ten Republicans have a positive picture of Donald Trump.
About 3 out of 10, the image is negative.
These figures are also considered to be the first in the states in which the elections are held.
In the last week's Quinn Market Gallup, 60% of the Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two thirds of the Republicans would be pleased with Trump's candidate.
In the CNN and ORC gallup last week, 67% of the Republicans expressed great satisfaction or satisfaction with Trump’s possible choice as a candidate.
Only two out of ten would be extremely unsatisfactory with Trump's candidate.
Ben Carson makes almost as enthusiastic reception as Trump (43% would be very satisfied with Carson's candidate and 40% Trump's candidate).
Who's next the most popular candidate?
The third is Marco Rubio, whose corresponding rate of support is 21 per cent.
On the other hand, 47% of the Republicans would be unsatisfactory or extremely unsatisfactory if Jeb Bush was elected candidate.
Most Republicans do not consider Trump's temperament to be problematic.
Donald Trumpia is widely criticised of magnificentness and insulting comments. 52% of the Republican supporters throughout the country consider the properties of the real estate mogul to be suitable for the president.
The same figure applies to Iowa, where the party meeting is held first: 52% of the Republicans, according to the Quinn Market Gallup, consider Trump's personal characteristics to be suited to the Head of Defence Forces.
However, according to ABC and Post's gallope, 44 per cent believes Trump is unable to function effectively, and six of the tens consider Trump's temperament to be inappropriate to the White House.
The Republicans are getting used to the idea.
They're starting to take Trump seriously.
When the Republicans are asked who is most likely to be elected candidate for the party, according to the CNN and the ORC gallupe, four of the ten believes in Trump's potential.
The situation has changed since mid-July, when four out of 10 would have put their money on behalf of Jeb Bush.
Overall: The Republicans have never had a very reliable crystal ball in their use.
At this stage in the last election, four of the ten Republicans considered Rick Perry as a probable candidate, and only 28 per cent Mitt Romney.
Most people seem to think Trump's campaign is convincing.
Although the Republicans support another candidate, Trump covers almost all the other candidates.
Some experts consider that the distributed camp is likely to benefit from Trump when Trump’s opponents are divided into the supporters of different candidates.
At the beginning of September, Monmouth University’s opinion survey revealed that Trump’s imaginary double battles between almost any other Republican candidate would receive more support to his side almost always.
He leads Carly Fiorina at 13 points, Marco Rubiota at 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jeb Bush at 19 points and Rand Paul, John Kasichi and Chris Christie at 33 points each.
With Ted Cruz, he's even.
Is Cruz Trumpi's only real opponent?
Ben Carson would take the victory from Trump 19 points away in a imaginary double fight.
A small majority of Trump's supporters tells us that they have already taken a vote.
According to the CBS and the NYT published on Tuesday, fair half of Trump's supporters are sure of their vote.
Of course, the situation can change for many reasons, and at the moment a certain voter can also change his mind.
46% of Trump's supporters have not taken a final decision.
The very competitor of Trump this moment is neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who have already chosen their candidates will vote twice as likely as Trump.
Six of ten Republicans agree with Trump's view of migration.
When Donald Trump called, the campaign speech two months ago, the migrants from Mexico became rapists have been a hot topic for 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's magnificent speeches expelled important Latin American electorates from the Republican troops and hinder the brand's reform.
However, according to the results of the opinion of ABC News and Washington Post published on Monday, six of the ten Republicans are on the same lines of migration with Trump.
As long as the migration is in the light bowl, there is Donald Trump.
The displeasure of the administration is at the top.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are currently collecting about half of the Republican voices. The popularity adds significantly to the fact that both have come to terms outside.
The Republican troops want to be a new face instead of a political convict. According to ABC News and Washington Post's latest survey of opinions, this view was six out of ten of the Republicans.
These two candidates are also angry with Washington.
According to the opinion survey made by Des Moines Register and Bloomberg in Iowa, three of the four Republicans in Iowa have been frustrated in the activities of the Republicans in Congress: 54% are unsatisfactory and 21% on the edge of rage."
Jeremy Corby's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time
After the elections, Corbyn's first visit at the Prime Minister's Question Time has been welcomed.
Jeremy Corbyn, a new swingshot at the Labour Working Party, is about to rise for the first time to ignore his powers in David Cameron's Question Time later.
Corbyn's first six questions about her little after midday, and the media and the representatives of the Workers' Party are following the man with a hard eye.
Corby's been calling for less theater and adding more facts to the weekly show.
He has also said that he could miss some of the sessions and leave them to his colleagues.
At the meeting, Corbyn's leadership will be weighed for the first time in connection, and Corby will now be subjected to a parliamentary test after the gathering of the shadow government and the Central Organisation of Corbyn Trade Unions at the TUC's annual meeting on Tuesday.
The decision of the Labour Party to remain silent during the national song on Tuesday's 75th anniversary of the British Air War has been criticised by several representatives of the Tory Party. The silence has also reached the titles of the first page of several newspapers.
The silence of Corbyn during the national song attracted attention
Corbyn’s representative stated that Corbyn was standing during the national song, silently respecting the heroism of the Royal Air Forces in the battle of Britain.
However, Mr Owen Smith of Corbyn's shadow government told the BBC's Two's Newsnight programme that he would have called the party's leader to join a national song despite the opposition of this monarchy.
The tenth shadow ministers have refused to join Corbyn's first parties, appealing to disputes in economic, defence and external matters, with less than a sixth party in favour of initially choosing Corbyn to the party.
The correspondent of BBC, Robin Brant, believes that political disagreements on the EU membership of the United Kingdom and the conditions for granting the government's benefits have accumulated in the Workers' Party since Corbyn's appointment.
At the TUC meeting, Corbyn stated that the Labour intends to propose changes to remove restrictions in full.
Hours later, Mr Smith, Minister for Employment and Pensions of the shadow government, stated that the party's position is very clear: it only opposes the government's plans to lower the limit from 26 000 to 23 000 pounds.
Corby is the fifth Labour Director David Cameron meets over the past decade in charge of the Tory Party.
The new approach to politics, which was promised by the Labour Director, says that he chose to ask Cameron questions from the general public on the 30 000 proposals.
According to Corbyn, the electoral district of Islington North, there are too many confrontations in the Question Time, and he promises to avoid clever vocabulary and loan throwing and instead concentrates on serious topics such as poverty, inequality and the challenges of young people.
Corby has said that the shadow minister, Angela Eagle, is going to take him for questioning hours, for example, when Cameron is on his way abroad.
Corby has also thrown the idea that others, too, may sometimes be able to vote, and tells us that he has discussed this with Mr Bercow, President of Parliament's sub-school.
In 2005, when Corbyn came to the party leadership, Cameron said that he wanted a doll theatre policy, which is often linked to Question Time, but some years later, he acknowledged that he failed in his efforts.
Since the first time the Question Time was televisionized in 1990, it has been regarded as a key measure of the leader's criticism, the control of the sub-room and the position. However, according to critics, the questioning lesson has become a caricature that needs major reforms.
"Shot in Joburg": homeless young photographers
The center of Johannesburg is a homeless environment.
An intelligent way to learn and make money has been found for the group of former street children.
"I was shot in Joburg" is an unprofitable description studio, which teaches homeless young people to photograph their homeland and deserve at the same time.
BBC News met a young man who has completed the project among the first.

The pound will be strengthened when UK wages rise.
The pound was strengthened when wages rose in Britain, and SABMiller drew the FTSE 100 indices up.
In May–July, wages in Britain rose by 2.9 per cent compared to the corresponding period last year.
The faster growth than expected was the fastest since 2009.
The pound was strengthened by 1% and its rate was quoted at USD 1,5505, and the pound was also strengthened in relation to the euro, and the rate was recorded at EUR 1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose by 1.49 per cent and ended at 6.229.21 points.
The highest increase was made by SABMiller, whose rate was 20 per cent when the company received an initial purchase offer from the competing AB InBev.
In the event of a merger, the trade would combine the two largest brewery companies in the world and would bring brands under the same roof, including Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's share rose by 0.9 per cent in the old water of the Richemont Group's positive results focusing on luxury products.
Richemont's latest sales figures are better than the forecast.
Glencore's share rose by 5 per cent of its reported miners' intentions to collect $2.5 billion in the stock, as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The package and paper group Mondi shares were the largest fallen by 4.3 per cent when Goldman Sachs dropped the company's share price for sale purposes.
The JD Sports course rose by 3.1 per cent from the information provided by the sporting company that its return before taxes will rise by 83 per cent to 46.6 million pounds.
JD Sports Boss: higher wage expenditure could be detrimental to enlargement
According to Peter Cowgill, the chairman of the JD Sports Management Group, the increase in minimum wages in the United Kingdom would mean more purchasing power for potential customers.
However, increased purchasing power is not sufficient to cover higher labour costs for the company.
According to Cowgill, the increase in labour costs may jeopardise JD Sports' enlargement plans and reduce the need for additional labour.
Metcash has been reinstalling the grassroot campaign against Ald's rift
Metcash is trying to secure his IGA store from the takeover of Ald in South and West Austria.
The wholesale food dealer Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to maintain the market share of IGA retail trades in South and West Austria against the invasion of USD 700 million.
Aldi will open two distribution centres and the first up to 120 stores in South and West Austria at the beginning of next year. Metcast and IGA supermarkets will strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build IGA brands on the market in mainstream communications and social media and organising events such as Adelaide show.
The IGA stores and suppliers and many brands are involved in the campaign. For example, Simmo, the ice cream factory located in Dunsborough offers tastes in IGA stores, and traders sell tickets to stock customers at the discount price of South Australian football league games.
Metcash is expected to publish more detailed information on its defence strategy on 29 September, when the food, alcohol and iron trafficking stock will organise the annual investment strategy date.
It is a major market, as South and West Austria represents almost 30% of the footprint of Metcash IGA stores, and in these areas the coverage is higher than the IGA network of Eastern States.
The South and West Australian consumers are known for their neighbourhood, and the IGA traders have a significantly higher market share in the region than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland. In South Australia, the market share is 30% and West Austria 24%, while in eastern states only 14%.
For example, Morgan Stanley's analysts believe that Aldi catches 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first shops.
This week, analyst Morgan Stanley Tom Kierath estimates that the sale of IGA dealers can be made by 360 million and Metcash 250 million dollars by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South and West Austria next year and will proceed to the sale of $500 million and $600 million in these regions.
Metcashi's fixed costs are high, so the loss of food sales and volume can mean a loss of $13 million before interest and taxes, Kierath says.
At the same time, Metcast loses market share in eastern states, mainly to Ald and Coles, although the recent investigation of Roy Morgan suggests that the IGA customers are most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcashi's food sales will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, by 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018.
Last week, the leading portfolio manager of the Magellan Financial Group, Hamish Douglass, told me at the event held in Melbourne, that it would be very likely that Metcash would disappear in the last ten years.
Metcash has refused to take a public position on Douglass' comments.
It is understandable that a member of the Metcash Government contacted Douglass last week.
The market share of the IGA has fallen from 18 % to 14 % since 2010 and the result of the food business activity of Metcash serving the 1200 IGA reseller has fallen by 43 % from the level of 2012.
However, the wholesale trader takes countermeasures and makes an annual harvest of over 150 million Australian dollars in order to respond to the prices of hundreds of products in Coles and Woolworths per week. Ketju wants to support traders in the reform of shops so that they can increase the supply of fresh products and improve the food selection of their own brands.
According to Metcashi's CEO Ian Morrice, price review and shop reform plans are in good speed and the company is able to increase its profit for the first time in 2017 for four years.
Steve Healy, President of the Australian tennis Union, defends Thanasi from Cockman
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves to behave rather than a special mention criticism.
According to the Australian tennis union president Steve Healy, Thanasi Kokkinakis has been a side victim in a recent Nick Kyrgios-related jupaka, who deserves special mention instead of a criticism.
The younger party of the "Special K" dude named Kokkinakis was in the unfavourable light game when the evil boy Kyrgios provoked his opponent Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal ATP tournament.
Soon afterwards, in the quarrel fight between the Cokkinakis and Ryan Harrison in Cincinnati, the judge had to separate the competitors twice. "Wawrinka should have given the Cyrgians and me back to that guy," said Harrison.
In the U.S. open, Kokkinakis frustrated the bay when the powerful cramps ruined his fight. Healy has faithfully defended the Cook.
At the moment, the teenage star is in Glasgow, where he fights with Sam Groth on the second stage of the solitary games behind Bernard Tomic at Davis Cup's semifinal against Great Britain.
"I strongly think that Thanasi has been drawn by his argument," Healy said.
"He broke the bay when he lost the fight in the open Americans, and he's not the first player to break his mail for frustration. I know Thanas so well that he's not proud of what he did.
However, he has endured very well, for example, the provocation of Harrison in the openness of the United States, and I think he deserves recognition.
He's got a strong team and a brilliant operation around him, and I think he's just been treated unjustly.
She's very mature for the age of 19, she's working hard and complete a team. She's never had any problems with other players, and she's being respected among the players. She's practised hard, is in good condition and really stable and mature young man. I think she should be evaluated on the basis of her own seaweeds."
Healy also supported the decision to drop Cyrgios from the Australian team from an important round that begins on the pesticide. Healy describes the solution as a common decision for all parties, but he supports the return of the Canberra family as a long-term confirmation of the team.
"We want to focus fully on the fights instead of the polemies of Kyrgios," said Healy.
As Federer and Murray have pointed out, a young man must grow up in the lights of the public, he deserves a criticism of his bad mistakes, but we are trying to support him to understand the consequences of his actions. We also try to arrange for his own peace. I believe that it is best for the whole team and for Nick."
European migration crisis: Hungary declares emergency, seals borders, arrests migrants
Hungary, who announced the emergency status, closed its southern borders from Serbia's direction on Tuesday and captured illegal immigrants, with the aim of preventing the flow of the migrant.
There was a chaos on the border when hundreds of migrants were gathered into a non-stop country and the Serbian authorities reacted ragefully.
People fleeing violence had to stay on the road between inspection stations in their tents for an indefinite period.
Depression began to rise to the surface.
When the police chapter flew in the air above the migrants, they shouted "Open the border" and screamed for insults to the Hungarian riot police.
Some became a protest for the eating and drinking strike.
The Serbian Minister for Foreign Affairs announced that it does not accept the return of migrants to Hungary at the same time as more arrivals from Macedonia and Greece.
"Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not to increase the damage.
The situation needs to be discussed in the next few days in Brussels and in other countries," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The death of the border between Hungary and Serbia began a day later when 28 states failed to develop a common migration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
However, ministers agreed that the responsibility for the flooding of 40,000 asylum seekers in Italy and Greece was shared, and that the meeting hoped that in next month or by the end of the year we could reach an agreement on which EU Member States would accept 120 000 migrants, including Hungary.
The German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria convened a extraordinary summit on Tuesday for the next week in order to discuss the immigration crisis in the continent.
However, Hungary did not hope for immediate action in Brussels or neighbouring countries.
On Tuesday, the emergency situation developed so that the authorities in the two southern regions could use more efficient means, i.e. shut down and accelerate the legal processes relating to asylum.
At the same time, Hungary's Foreign Minister, Peter Szijjarto, said that Hungary is also planning a giant wire garden to the Romanian border to prevent the flow of migration from the direction, now that the Serbian border has already been set up.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even the prisoners participated in the tender for finalisation of the wireyards between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a clear bottleneck for migrants and a transit point for the European Union. Many of these migrants are refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban argued that most of the people coming are living-level refugees, not soldiers who have the right to seek security, and that the views of other EU countries, including Germany, are very different.
According to the new law that entered into force in Hungary at midnight, there is a crime to cross or damage the four-metre heights of wire wire wire wire wire which the government has built on the southern border in Serbia, and the law also defines longer prisoners for convicted traffickers of human traffickers.
"Because of the situation caused by mass change, the government declares a crisis situation in the country," told the editor of Zoltan Kovacs to journalists in the city of Szeged in the southern part of the country.
"We follow the strict line: illegal crossing is a crime."
In practice, Parliament still has to accept military action that is expected next week. The suppliers of the Associated Press News Office have seen heavy-armed soldiers with vehicles and military dogs on the border for several days.
Orban's Internal Security Advisor Gyorgy Bakondi told us that the authorities have captured 45 border crossing attempts immediately at the border and 15 further.
Help by harming the people who have crossed the border are now held by the police, accused of crimes based on new laws.
The authorities will fix the fence quickly.
In addition, the Hungarian authorities closed two of the seven border crossing points at the Serbian border on Tuesday. One border crossing place was closed by means of a train wagon covered with a wire.
The chaos took over the main border crossing place near Rosse in Hungary, when the Hungarians opened up a small metal container a point where people were packed in.
About 20 fits in, but thousands left out.
The second group of migrants blocked the main street that connects Serbia and Hungary, and people reported to be at the grocery store until they were released to Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's leadership in half of Bernie Sanders by national gallope
Former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton's support rate is still two-digit in the race for the national candidate for the democratic presidents, but Senator Bernie Sanders has closed the distance.
Clinton's support now represents 47% of the votes of democrats (down of 58%), while Sanders is second with 27% (up to 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden has not yet announced his possible departure to the presidential contest, with 15% of his position among the democrats.
More than five months before the pre-election, it is too early to tell the majority of democrats who they support.
Clinton’s supporters are, however, more confident than the supporters of other candidates.
Following the gallup of CBS News last month, Clinton has lost support for several democratic groups, while new supporters have joined the Sanders camp.
Clinton still has a strong leadership role among women and moderates, but the leadership is narrowed.
Clinton's support among men has fallen significantly, and he has only a 5% bow over Sanders.
Clinton has lost his leadership among democrats under the age of 50, and now he's at the level with Sanders.
However, Clinton still has a clear advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton's advance in the Sanders support contributions was two digits among the Liberals, but now Sanders has taken five percentage points of neck to Clinton in this group.
Approximately half of the democrats declare their support to Clinton if he is elected candidate for the party.
Fourth would support Clinton with small reservations, and 15% would only support him because he is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support Clinton.
It is not surprising that Clinton's current supporters would also be particularly enthusiastic if he was elected candidate.
The views have more degradation among those who are currently not in favour of Clinton, only about a quarter would be eager to support him.
48% of the democrat voters would support Clinton, and only 35% of the Republican voters would be eager to support Donald Trumpia.
When Clinton voters are asked to freely describe why they support his candidates, the most popular argument is the right experience of Clinton (16%). Secondly, the most popular answer is that it is time to choose the female presidency (13%) and thirdly that Clinton is the best candidate for the task of (10%).
Clinton’s supporters also mention his contact with Bill Clinton (9%).
It also mentions the convergence of views and the possibility of winning the actual elections.
The Vice-President still punches his potential candidates, and 57% of the democrats would like him to join the race, and a third would prefer to leave him out of the race.
When the second most popular candidates are asked from the democratic voters, the majority will choose Biden.
More than half of Clinton's supporters, Biden, after Clinton, is the second most popular candidate and significantly more popular than Sanders.
If Biden doesn't go to the Democrats candidate contest, Hillary Clinton will increase his way forward over Sanders, while Sanders' advantage is 20 percentage points, and it will grow to 30 percentage points if Sanders don't race.
55% of the democratic voters consider Clinton as a candidate who has the best chance of winning the actual elections, but the proportion has fallen from 78% last month.
Biden, second, is far from Clinton, but more and more believes in Biden's chances of winning the actual elections.
Democrat voters, however, consider views more important than the potential for candidates to win.
The voters do not regard democratic or potential candidates as unacceptable.
The voters consider democratic candidates or potential candidates to be suited to their characteristics.
Most people think Clinton, Sanders and Biden are honest, trustworthy and leader types.
Biden is mostly described as being honest, while Clinton is mostly considered the leader type.
Even 30% of the Democrat voters do not consider Clinton to be honest and reliable, but Sanders is 15%. 27% do not know whether Sanders is honest.
The Democrat voters believe that the views of Clinton, Sanders and Biden are close to their own ideology.
For all characteristics, about a quarter there is no opinion on Sanders.
When the voters are asked for views on the use of Hillary Clinton's private e-mail and its own server as Minister for Foreign Affairs, the majority of the democrats say that they are satisfied with the Clinton explanation and have not changed the concept of these voters about Clinton.
The Americans disagree more widely.
Half the Americans are unsatisfactory for Clinton's investigation, and only one third is satisfied.
The opinions of the people were divided in March, when the conflict had just come out.
The majority of Americans believe that the use of a disputed e-mail has not affected their overall picture of Clinton. 36 percent say that the image has changed in a negative direction.
The majority of this 36%, six out of ten, are Republicans.
Although the voters of their own party consider Clinton to be honest and reliable, there is room for improvement in these characteristics when asking for the views of all voters: Clinton considers only 32% honest and reliable, which is 8 percentage points less than last month and 15 percentage points less than in May.
62% of all voters do not consider Clinton to be honest and reliable.
On the other hand, 55% of all voters in the whole country do not consider Trump to be honest and reliable.
But both Clinton and Trump get good grades for leadership.
Six of the candidates Biden, Carson and Bush were considered the most reliable.
Most people think Sanders is honest, but as for Carson, many do not have Sanders' opinions.
The sample of the questionnaire is 351 voters and the error margin of the survey is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson catches Donald Trump's way forward in a national support survey
According to CBS News and New York Times, Ben Carson has reached Donald Trumpia.
These two candidates swept over half of the votes in the new survey and left the other candidates far behind.
Among the Republican voters in the whole country, Trump still has a strong support, and the support rate has risen from 23 % of the CBS survey made before the Fox News debate last month. According to the questionnaire published on Tuesday, the support rate is 27 %.
However, the support of Carson would increase to a huge increase in the same period, from 6% to 23%.
According to the survey, Carson has a strong support in all population groups, and in the group of higher education institutions, he'll beat Trump.
Other candidates, except Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, will stay far. The support of Governor of Wisconsin Scott Walker is the weakest and has fallen from 10 % last month to 2 % now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Senator Marco Rubio shared the third position with 6% support.
The margin of error in 376 Republican voters is 6 per cent in the direction or in the other direction. The questionnaire was carried out in September.
According to the latest survey published by the CNN and ORC last week, Carson's support is increasing, with 19% of the Republicans in favour of Trump's 32%.
In the latest survey from ABC News and Washington Post, Trump was also a clear leader above Carson.
In the last week's meeting of the men, Trump started to charge a retired neurosurgeon, but Carson apologized after questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said on Saturday when he campaigned in Iowa.
Five members of the department accused of the death of the Baruch College Fux
Almost two years ago, after the death of a student in Pennsylvania Poconouvir, five people are counted as murder charges.
The members of the Baruch College (City University of New York) of the Pi Delta Ps Department were injured brutally in the baptists of Chun "Michael" Deng in September 2013. According to the police, the department did not deliver Deng in time to the hospital, which was considered to contribute to his death.
According to the authorities, the victim's eyes were tied, his back had been put on a nearly 15-pound sand-filled bag and had been repeatedly attacked by him in trying to reach the target that was placed on the other side of the ice field.
Deng was told first that he complained about headache and then lost consciousness.
According to the police, the members of the Pi Delta Ps Department didn't call 911 when Deng lost consciousness, allegedly waited an hour before they took Deng to the hospital.
At the press conference, Chief Chris Wabner told me that the members had time to change Deng's clothes, google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, President of the Department.
"In this stage, members began to hide the tools by putting the department's interest ahead of Michael Deng's health," Wagner said.
Deng was not recovered, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy protocol, Deng had been hit several times in the head, in the upper body, and in the thigh with a boring object.
"A lot of families have been shocked by the disruption of the department, for at least one student a year has died as a result of the smoothing process since 1970," says Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family.
The departments and their members must be accounted for where the authorities must take an important step.
The great jury of the Monroe County presented five members of the department to be accused of a third-degree murder.
In addition, 32 members of the department will be charged with conspiracy and criminal conspiracy, including Meng.
"We want to be accountable not only for individuals, but also for an organization that has officially or unofficially accepted the disruption," Wagner reported at the press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College set a ban on the operation of the department, and the national department resigned from the local department.
This is how the increase in the interest rate of the United States Central Bank (Fed) affects
The increase in interest rates and the increase in the stock market are fragile, the return on securities is rising and the economy is slipping down.
We know that.
We do not know how long all will take time and how long the effects will last.
In particular, with regard to the economy, we can find part of history in the timing.
Lama has arrived in up to 11 months after the first increase in interest rates and has lasted up to 86 months.
The central bank often raises interest rates aggressively, but not always.
Therefore, the ECB’s officials have already stressed the fact that investors would not pay attention to when the increase in interest rates begins, but to how long the normalisation of the situation takes.
Of course, there are a number of variables involved.
In the end, however, market operators can notice that all interest increases may be overreacted.
"The first increase of the Central Bank after the global financial crisis was, without doubt, often seen as a sign of the end of cheap money," Julian Jessop, the Capital Economics chief global economist, told his customers.
On the other hand, we do not expect the gradual normalisation of interest rates to a rather low level, which is a scary standing shock for many.
However, that does not mean that there is no effect.
Examples of the impacts of the various economic sectors are here based on historical trends:
As has been seen on the market for about a month, the expectation of an increase in interest rates can increase in instability for some time.
When interest is finally rising, the effect is not so dramatic.
"The trend would appear to be the recession of interest income in capital after the first increase for 12 to 24 months, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy, Deutsche Bank’s analyst found in the recent study of the consequences of the increase in interest rates.
In the 35 years, the market is generally seen as a sharp increase, approximately 14 per cent, relatively stable for the following 250 days (mean increase 2.6 per cent), after 500 days, the situation is normalised, and the average interest income after six blocks is 14.4 per cent, says Bob Doll, Nuveen Asset Management's main equity strategy in Barron's magazine.
According to Deutsche, the impact on shares is generally slightly higher in the later phase of the cycle and interest income begins to decrease.
In the economy, the lama is a fact, but the increase in interest rates usually works.
In this case, if the central bank meets the circumstances that were not previously in existence and which could accelerate the shock.
Particular attention is given to the fact that the gross national product is at the lowest possible time in view of the increase in the central bank's guarantor rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, 118 steering rate increases since 1950, only twice the nominal value has been less than 4.5 per cent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 shows 3.6 per cent, many did not think it would last, and in the third quarter there would be 1.5 per cent, the Atlanta Regional Central Bank reports.
In raising interest rates, such a delicate economic situation may be at risk and it can be asked whether this situation is different, Deutsche said.
On the market, operators have been talking about the increase in the guiding rate throughout the year, and the views will turn to the meeting of this week's Open Market Committee, which will end on Thursday.
Many strategics and economists believe that, even if the Open Market Committee would approve the increase at this meeting, there is only 25% of the likelihood of future trade.
"In our studies since 1950, all the lifting cycles have been in a super-cycle, which also increases very rapidly after the fall in the upturn," the report states.
Recovery has been very slow compared to the worst lax in the comparator period.
The cycle is clearly the longest that the central bank has been waiting for since the last recession. The record had been 35 months, now it is already going to be 74 months.
Fixed-income securities have also been unstable in the market enthusiasm, and the formula is also repeated on capital.
"The difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than in shares when the central bank changes the rate.
In the case of bonds, income appears to change the direction immediately when the first increase/loss cycle starts.
At the end of the rising cycle, revenues fall immediately," said Deutsche.
Charles Schwab's strategics believe that the acquisition of interest rates will allow long-term and short-term bonds to approach each other and to level the curve.
"In such a environment, debt securities that are not profitable are often better suited, although we are still cautious about income," said Schwab, analyst Kathy Jones of fixed-term securities.
Interestingly, Jones said that the market has already adapted to the future direction of the Central Bank.
"In addition to the strengthening of Dollar and inflation forecasts, there are already several signs of adapting financial policy to tightening," says Jones.
The short-term interest rates are rising, the return curve is direct, the credit risk margins are expanded and volatility has increased, all are typical on the market in a situation where the central bank tightens politics.
Overall, companies operating mainly on the US market benefit from lowering interest rates and attracting local products.
The prospects of obligated multinational companies are weaker, as the stronger dollar will make their products more expensive on the global market and the debt to be kallis.
"The history shows that quality shares are more profitable over the next three months of interest", Goldman Sachs analysts tell their customers.
Companies with a strong balance sheet defeated the weak balance sheet after the increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, on average by five percentage points.
Companies with high return on capital and low volatile shares also managed better than their quality, on average 4 and 3 percentage points better.
"It's a big question.
Companies with a significant share of variable interest rates will lose most," said Goldman.
Consumers, outside the stock market, are generally also benefiting from strengthening the dollar.
Savings also benefit from higher profits, although experts disagree on how quickly the effects are visible.
Parliamentary Andrew Bingham: BBC Radio 3 on a copy of Classic FM
Conservative Andrew Bingham criticized the radio station for too much popularisation.
According to Bingham, it is now difficult to separate the channel from its commercial competitor.
It also claims that the BBC Music Awards award gala is only a copy of the British Gala.
The Voice Canal Damien Collins, on the other hand, is accused of personality failure.
According to the major parliamentary, BBC Radio 3 gradually turns into a copy of the Classic FM channel, and the charges add pressure to the station to prove that each of them offers other commercial radio stations.
Conservative Andrew Bingham also told BBC's leadership that the broadcaster's radio channel is becoming too populist and that the channel is no longer a distinction between its commercial competitor.
"I don't want to talk about popularisation, but Radio 3 seems to be changing towards the Classic FM channel," Bingham said.
The BBC Music Awards Awards award for Bingham's criticism will also take place last December:
"For the first time in the year, the BBC Music Awards seems like a copy of the Brits Prize Gallery.
These two are examples of the fact that instead of a new and different kind, it is merely a copy of what is already on the market," says Bingham.
The Director General of BBC banned the charges and stated that BBC Radio 3 offers a significant increase in live music and enlightening content of commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 learned from classical music what I can't learn from other channels.
The channel's commitment to live music and music is entirely in its own class.
I also think it is important that Radio 3 is also committed to searching for new music and ordering new works," said the President.
Earlier this year, Alan Davey, head of BBC Radio 3, said that the station must work harder to maintain public interest, because the British know classical music better.
However, radio 3 is not the only hard one in the consultation of the BBC channel, limited to the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport, which was criticised by the entry of commercial channels into the territory.
The Tory Parliamentary, Damien Collins, criticised the The Voice Capacity Research Competition, which BBC bought from the Dutch producer Talpa Media, which is estimated at a price of GBP 22 million.
"It's not much to discuss, because it's not unique or particularly distinguishing."
According to Lord Hall, the program presented by BBC1, which, as the Star Judges, was produced by Paloma Faith and Boy George in a typical manner to BBC.
In addition, Collins asked the company to find a hit show in his own cabin when he next sets up a new series of entertainment.
However, Collins did not agree to exclude the "The Voice" series from being ordered in the future or that the money of taxpayers would be used for other forms of entertainment.
Increased online trade in August – possibly black Friday
In the first months of 2015, online trade increased by 7 per cent.
The sales of online trade have been recorded since 2000, and last month the growth was the slowest in all times.
Three years ago, the network trade was strengthened with mobile purchases.
Experts believe that November's black Friday can control shopping desires.
For more than ten years, the conquest of online trade has devastated many of the British shopping skates.
According to experts, there are indications that online trade is about to stabilise, and the new sales figures show only a seven-percent increase over the first three months of 2015.
In August, the growth of total sales was slowest throughout the period when the sales of online trade have been statistically recorded since 2000. Last year the net sales grew by only 5 per cent.
According to experts, there are indications that online trade is about to stabilise, and the new sales figures show only a seven-percent increase over the first three months of 2015.
"If we compare the growth of the last year to the 2000s, it is clear that the growth balances over time," the main editor of the IMRG Andy Mulcahy told Guardian.
According to Mulcahy, online trade was accelerated three years ago when consumers took mobile sales.
"As a result, more and more were able to buy from the network, and buying for many was possible in a different environment, even in a homehome.
As mobile shopping is now more moderate, growth can be balanced."
The black Friday from America is a phenomenon that is considered one of the reasons for slowing growth.
According to experts, the theme day to be spent on the last Friday of November can make consumers postpone the purchase decision before the black Friday.
Last year, five times the number of online purchasers compared to the normal, caused many traders' websites to fall.
Experts believe that the black Friday, which will make consumers combine after the offers, can curb the demands of purchases during the rest of the period.
According to the study published by the British Retail Consortium, a fair pound per five GBP was consumed online.
More than a third of certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, are purchased from online shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes from the net instead of shopping fashion tiles.
In the Meka, the victims of cradle accidents are buried, the Bin Laden family is responsible.
The Muslims carried 29 bodies on the streets when the first funerals were held in Mekka.
According to Saudi Arabia, Saudi Binladin Group is responsible for the accident.
According to the Ministry of Health, 394 people were also injured after the lift fell.
The bodies were carried in high air when the Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of the fallen crawl on Mekka's Great Mosque
On the streets, a number of white-dressed people had gathered to say goodbye to the victims on their last journey to the graveyard of Al-Moaissem.
The tragedy went to a pilgrim where the fallen builder was only one day earlier invaded through the mosque roof of the Muslims.
The King of Saudi Arabia requires the family company of Bin Laden’s construction industry to be responsible for an accident involving 394 injuries.
The 29 dead victims were transported on the streets in a lifting accident in Mekka's Great Mosque.
After the fall of the lift among the dead, Qasim Akram, from Bolton of Great Manchester, had traveled to Meka's first pilgrim.
Akram had been in Great Mosque with his parents, who had started their annual eradication trip.
The Saudi Arabian authorities have promised that the eradication will take place when thousands of people are currently entering the city for pilgrim.
King Salman said Binlad's Group shouldn't have left the lift boom up when the nozzle was not used.
According to the Arab press release, Binlad's Group is part of the accident.
The English service of the news agency did not report it in detail, but according to the English release, the group’s management has been prohibited from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the crawl to fall in the yard of the Great Mosque. Thousands of Muslims will head to the Great Mosques later this month.
Binladin Group has not published a notice on the crane accident and the group representatives have not been targeted for the opinion.
The King also accused the group that it had not complied with the up-to-date safety provisions and cooperated with meteorological experts.
Ten nosturis are surrounded by Mekka's Greatmoskeeper as part of the giant construction project of the Binlad Group.
For decades, Bin Laden’s family has had close links with Saudi Arabia’s ruler family, and Bin Ladens are responsible for several major construction projects.
Al Qaida's late leader Osama bin Laden was a reluctant son whose family had abandoned in the 1990s.
A riot accident in the rainy and hard wind occurred only a few days before the celebration of Meka, who is the duty of each capable Muslim to do at least once during life.
According to the authorities, 158 people are still in hospital.
The authorities ordered a million rials (approximately EUR 250 000) to the families of the victims and to those who were permanently injured.
The rest of the injured will receive half of the compensation.
According to the B & Q Boss, there is a cheap Eastern European labour force behind the phenomenon.
The British employ more generals at home, says Veronique Laury.
The popularity has been increased by skilled and professional workers coming from Eastern Europe.
More than 200 new Screwfix shops for workers will be opened.
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q shops around the country.
Text: Rupert Steiner, chief correspondent, Daily Mail
It is said that the British are moving home hammering and painting to the authors coming from Eastern Europe.
Hammering and painting skills seem to be few now.
The British are now increasingly hiring household generals to carry out home scratch work, reports the director of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury is a new CEO in Kingfisher, who owns the home renovation chain. Laury says that the phenomenon is based on professional workers coming from Eastern Europe, who offer services at low prices.
As a result, Kingfisher intends to open 200 new Screwfix shops for business operators, while 60 B&Q shops are closed.
Laury needs more female labour for B&Q shops, because eight of the ten purchase decisions in the shop make a woman.
At the moment, most of the staff are men.
According to Laury, it is worth paying attention to demographic trends, as today more and more women alone are renovating their homes.
"Our shop staff are still mostly men," says Laury.
"We need to balance the situation.
Half our customers are women, and 80% of the purchase decisions make a woman.
Women play an important role in the decision-making process."
Laury is one of the five women who are in the backbone of the companies of the British FTSE 100, and has also reorganised the company's management group so that men and women's leaders are equal.
Kingfisher is almost the only of its quality, as 50% of its staff are women, including the Managing Director and the Financial Director.
"This was a conscious decision. Multipleness is an important topic for us," Laury told me.
"It hasn't been hard to find good women in the leadership group."
The sales and profits of Kingfisher have fallen in the figures of six months, even though the company worked hard after the sale of shops.
Kingfisher responds to the current trends: the company owns Screwfix and B&Q chains and intends to open up 200 new shops.
The government of three aces decided to rely on forceful legislation to save the economy of the country.
The apparent effects were gained pretty quickly.
The sharp head of the SAK and other recipient centre organisations began to force the country to stand on Friday due to the widespread demonstration of workers.
A lot of people then think that there is also reason.
Let's ask if it's worth strikes when it's going bad anyway.
There's even been a resistance movement.
More than 50,000 people have already gone to the Internet to announce that they are not going to participate in the demonstration, but they are going to work.
In an old good time of consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no Internet where to protest, but openly speaking as a rikkur would have been a political suicide for a small person.
Millions of trade unions a few tens of thousands of people's protests do not delay much, but it gives us the subject of thinking.
The position of the trade union movement is no longer as obvious as it has been a couple of decades ago.
Not everyone knows the goal of the movement, values have changed
From the point of view of the interest of the Ay movement, the government's strong solutions can also be seen as a direct gift of heaven.
When things have seemed to be rolling on their own weight for years, the unions are finally getting involved, i.e. the workers' rights to defend, be visible and properly.
This is how the government may want to imprison the role of the ay movement, when the membership of the trade union may be considered more necessary than before.
Let's be whatever you think about the activities of the organizations, so it's nuts that the Friday demonstration would somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial production has declined for 31 months consecutively.
Gross domestic product will continue to decline and unemployment will rise.
These things would think they'd force everyone's head.
Hard savings for Lappeenranta University: Objective 8.5 million savings, staff cut by 130
The University of Lappeenranda will start a savings rate with a view to obtaining a cost reduction of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the savings, the university will start the YT negotiations on all staff, with a savings target of 6.5 million per year.
In practice, it means reducing around 130 employees.
The rest of the action is also intended to save two million.
In the light of the YT negotiations, the 2016 budget is expected to be 8.5 million deficits.
It is also affected by the government's budget cuts.
During this financial year, the university will result in some 2.6 million deficits.
Costs will increase slightly next year, but the funding from the Ministry will be reduced by EUR 2 million and other EUR 3.2 million.
The total budget of the university is around EUR 85 million, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The interaction between operations of massive teaching and research, as well as the reduction in corporate financing, is very important for our university, says Principal Anneli Pauli at the University's Newsletter.
Before the summer, the impact of the operations seemed even more moderate, but now the reduction in the additional funding appears to be in new proportions.
Negotiations with the trustees will be initiated on Tuesday next week and will last for the six weeks prescribed by the law.
Yle: Onnibus wants for Finnish railroads
The owner of the cheap bus company Onnibus, the British Sir Brian Souter, tells Yle that the company is also targeting rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in joining Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest rail transport companies in Britain, Souter tells me.
Rail transport is to be opened gradually to competition.
The first is the near transport of the capital region in 2017-2018.
There's a long-distance traffic after close traffic.
Souter says he's already approached the Ministry of Transport.
According to Yle, at the Ministry of Transport, Onnibus's plans are welcome.
At least Transdev (former Veolia) has announced interest in other international companies in rail transport, which also has bus traffic in Finland and rail transport in other parts of Europe.
With the United States Central Bank the time of the interest rate decision
The whole world will follow the United States Central Bank Fed meeting on Wednesday and Thursday, which will decide for the first time on any increase in interest for almost a decade.
A fair half of the economists who believed that the central bank would raise interest rates last week are now implying that the central bank will maintain the interest rate in the current 0-0.25%; this is reflected in the question made by Reuters' 80 economic scientists.
"This is a historical situation, as the central bank has kept the interest rate at zero for seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the significant central bank can raise interest rates from the zero level and thus initiate the normalisation of interest rates," said Peterson Institute for International Economics, senior researcher Angel Ubide.
The state of the US economy has been relatively good, and recovery has brought billions of extra dolls into the balance and only a little accelerated inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore the global situation which is not as high as the rose.
It has called for the market to be prepared for change, but there are also remarks about the opposite.
The decision is to be published on Thursday 20.00 Central European time.
Delta State University shooter left an apology warrant.
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning — before shooting a colleague later on the same day — Shannon Lamb wrote a message in which he apologized for the first murder and hoped he could withdraw it, the authorities told on Tuesday.
At Mississippi Gautier, Delta State University, Lamb, who taught ground science and societal science, called the emergency number about 10 a.m.
Monday and told me he shot a man.
Lamb called an emergency call to the police at his house.
"I shot my wife last night," Lamb told me. She also mentioned that there was a friendly dog in the house, which has no trouble for anyone but is probably scared.
The police asked the caller's name, but the man didn't tell me.
Lamb didn't tell me the motive for shooting.
The police arrived at the scene and found Amy Prentiss, 41, a message written by the body and Lamb, which reads as follows: "I am very sorry and I hope that I could withdraw my actions.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the message, Lamb drove 500 miles away to Delta State University where he killed his history professor Ethan Schmidt before he took his life late on Monday when the police reached him.
University principal William LaForge told me that she was not aware of the contradictions between Lamb and Schmidt, but said that something clearly troubled Lamb.
On Monday, it was reported that Lamb assumed that Prentiss was also in a romantic relationship with Schmidt, but on Tuesday, the authorities indicated that there was no information or evidence of triangle drama.
Shawn O'Steen, who was married to Prentiss for seven years, described her ex-wife as a good person.
The couple had divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen told me that she and Prentiss have a 19-year-old daughter who's shocked.
The man says the daughter and mother were the best friends.
According to Sun Herald, a close friend of Prentiss Lindsay Knowles told me that Prentiss worked online from home.
Knowles said that Prentiss had been dating Lamb for three years. He also told a woman about a dog named Lightning.
"He always wanted to help others," Knowles said.
According to the police, Lamb had called relatives during Monday and told them that he was not going to prison.
When the police reached Lamb Highway 1 near Greenville the same night, Lamb stopped the car, fled the foot, ran into the woods and took his life.
According to the resume on the University website, Lamb received a doctorate in educational science at Delta State University in spring 2015.
Falling Stars
For the last few years, they have been heavy on an actor (to the left with his son Redmond).
In 2001 he fought leukaemia, and in 2009 his long-term partner, Farrah Fawcett, died of cancer.
The actor has also fought with drugs, and in 2008 he was arrested for the possession of drugs.
Everything that's happened has really demanded its taxes.
Manchester United Luke Shaw on the page for months due to two breaks
Luke Shaw's right foot broke in the Manchester United Masters League fight against PSV Eindhoven.
But Louis van Gaal is still hopeful and believes that Shaw will return to the field for a period of time.
A 20-year-old Shaw was injured in the PSV defence area in the bad fight by Héctor Moreno, when the game was running 15 minutes.
Shaw got first aid on the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he could be transferred to the hospital.
"Shaw has two fractures in his leg, and he's in hospital," said Van Gaal.
Shaw will be transferred tomorrow or after tomorrow for surgery to Manchester.
A young man who joined the Manchester United lines at the age of 18 has experienced a lot of pain and is now injured after the great games.
In the suitcase, Shaw was given oxygen.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but when the leg breaks in two points, he's on the side for six months, and he's not playing in the block phase anymore.
I hope he'll be able to play this season.
Moreno seemed to have made it a little bit when the situation did not follow the red card with the punishment kick.
Nicola Rizzoli, Judge of the fight, didn't punish a Mexican player.
According to Van Gaali, the Italian judge made a mistake.
"You may conclude by yourself, but I think the situation was worth the punishment kick and the red card.
It was a two-foot garbage.
Shaw said, "Thank you all for your messages, and I can't tell you how crushed I am.
More on the subject: Manchester Unitedin Luke Shaw on the PSV game
The English defender has a special reason to recover in order to compete for the European Championship in France in June.
"The problem is very badly injured," said the coach of the PSV.
"In such injuries, all parties are always very sorry.
The goal of players is never to harm the opponent."
Moreno broke his legs when playing in Mexico's lines, the Netherlands created by Van Gaali only at the 2014 World Championships.
"He is very sorry, because his purpose was not to harm the opponent. It is regrettable to hear that the injury is serious," said Cocu.
"I didn't see the situation.
I only saw a ball that was going in the other direction, so it seemed that he (Moreno) touched the ball, but I didn't see Luke's tack."
"I know how it feels, and I know how difficult this can be," said Moreno to the SBS6 channel.
"I feel really bad, I'm really sorry."
Andrés Guardado of PSV was also taken to the hospital after a colliding with Chris Smalling.
David Cameron should know Lorax better.
Each parent will soon notice that the child will learn his favorite book almost outside.
Except you see David Cameron.
When the children's holiday organization asked Cameron to appoint his favorite children's books, the Prime Minister chose Lorax, an environmental story published in 1971 by Dr. Seuss.
In the text published on SuperCamp, Cameron writes that the choice was difficult. "The story is fun, touching and creative, and it has a strong message. I'm happy to read it to my children, because there is always a picture or a message we have not seen before."
It sounds good, except that the next point where Cameron is to describe the design of the book is a summary of the 2012 film version, adding new characters and details to supplement the short initial text.
"In the town of Tarville, where the right trees and plants have disappeared and even the air is traded, a boy named Ted, who wants to get into the heart of his dreams girl Audrey by carrying out this biggest dream: see the right tree," the text says. In 1991 Dr. Seuss, the Theodor Seuss Geisel version, Ted had no pleasure.
If this is not suspicious enough, Cameron's text is partly connected with the Lorax film summary on the Internet Movie Database site. It begins as follows: "In the town of Tarville, where everything is artificial and even air is commercial goods, a boy named Ted who wants to get into the heart of his dreams of her girl Audrey."
Cameron is known as an active parent, so it seems unlikely that the design of the book would be such a stranger to him. Ahne Kerskanen will destroy the trees and make them Tarviks despite the opposition of Lorax. Lorax is a small and thick, stirsty creature that protects forests.
A similar, meaningless little pr task is likely to be entrusted to an assistant, apparently to someone who has not read Lorax 20 times in the tube as a child.
The Prime Minister's representative told me that the text was probably from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps did not comment more on it, but confirmed that the text was the handwriting of Cameron's staff.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being away from the British team, but it's still tough.
Pakistan's encounter in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but since we have seen the recent loss of the three-0 test series of the team selected for the UK tour is not expected.
I wouldn't shut down the chance of a guest victory.
The side of Alastair Cook can be more experienced than the three-year-old team, but the team has good players and the attitude of the team is strong – they have no bad experiences in 2012, only young positive.
As a ball player, Moeen Ali develops as a spinning feeder, and Adil Rashid, although he has no experience at Test level, represents an attack option.
Subject: Adam Lyth dropped from the English Test Team and replaced by Alex Hales
Obviously, the decision to leave Adam Lyth out is hard for me to understand his principal coach in Yorkshire.
His seven Tests have been under challenge for two good attacks, and the simple and cruel truth is that cricket players are criticised according to the results.
For example, Joe Root is not a questionable choice because, as I have said before, players are the best players.
A few 50-point fights would have been held in Lyth's team, but his fate was in his own hands.
I hope he gets another chance when he hits Yorkshire more runs.
The head coach of England, Trevor Bayliss, also praised his attitude when he did not do as well as he could, which is not surprising me.
The question of how long the test holes will be able to be impressed is difficult.
Lyth had seven paintings — like his predecessor Sam Robson — while Nick Compton received nine.
Only Compton got a chance for both home and guest fights.
The only subject of complaint may be that England used Jonathan Trotti first in Caribbean — when Lyth was in the top condition — but this past opportunity is now history.
Alex Hales is coming to the team and he's the hitter I appreciate high.
He's an unknown cricket player, which we saw in Yorkshire earlier this time when he made 236 points against us on the Trent Bridge field.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but, of course, this depends on the composition of the United Arab Emirates team.
The idea has been thrown into the air that Moeen will start a beating shift with Cook, which will bring an extra twister into the game while four quick feeders are being held and I'm not against the idea.
I don't see any obstacles to the top feeder being hitting here, and this left-handed player has already shown himself to be a brilliant cricket player.
Moeen may not have received much in his local team at Worcestershire, but he has been a team's third player, and it is not a big difference.
My former teammate, Justin Langer, played the first 38 Test games as the first replacement player before he was able to start in 2001.
He did three hundred points right now, and there was no return.
Zafar Ansari is in the team as a replacement tour, and on the basis of what I have seen of him, he has proved to be a very impressive young man.
People can look at his statistical figures – on average 31 points as a hitner and 35 inputers – and this may be a shotgun, but very many spinners have not shown themselves ready, and the electors decided to take a young player.
He learns a lot during this fight trip.
Outside the team, England seems to have made a couple of smart choices for training staff.
The appointment of Sri Lankan hitter, M chain Jayawardene as a counselor for Test matches may be a breakthrough.
This is one of the most delicate men of the species who bring much experience because he has played against all kinds of attacks and attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes to the share of the white ball of the game and brings both energy and mercilessness.
I think he has always had an impact on a suitable international cricket, whether he is a player or a coach, and, like Mahela, he has a useful intelligence.
Sometimes a new voice in the dressing room, even if it says the same as before, can be a cheerleading injection.
Colly's teammate Durham, Ben Stokes, has rested in one day's fights, Root got the same opportunity against Australia, and I agree with this decision.
Although not everyone agrees, coachs and constituents do not set a timetable for the fight.
And we must remember that, like players, their jobs depend on the results.
These decisions will never be taken without consideration.
Brexit camp can win if the economy is badly upset 2017
David Cameron's halfway renegotiation strategy for maintaining Britain in the EU is today in a deeper way, even without "yes or no" Jeremy, who is pleased to choose Corbyn to lead the Labour Party, or to the TUC to mock Europe on Tuesday.
Other countries have their own Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
The European diplomat recently explained how many crises the EU is crising – even though not all of them are doing their own, some of the Member States have been tired of the British self-sufficiency agenda, including consensus and harmful changes to the Treaty, which they do not really want.
In Brighton, the annual Congress of TUC decided that they too would not enjoy the EU if it concerned social security.
We could call it Dave and George's selfie agent.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor are hanging out at summits and bilateral negotiations in the capitals of different countries, catching a picture of themselves in front of a famous monument, with or without high-value individuals, returning home and telling them that they have acquired allies for reforms.
Everything has to do with me.
My European friend, who wants an open-minded Britain inside the EU. "Do not leave us alone with France", says Berlin, and suggests that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in different capitals have come to the point that we no longer care whether we are staying or leaving.
Angela Merkel, the German considering sensible Chancellor is a federal, but has been in power for ten years and wants to leave the office before it becomes destructive, as it happened to those who took too long: Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France François Hollande is facing a re-election or a successor selection in 2017.
His power is shrinking, too.
Poland will soon have a nationalist right-wing government, the left-hand government in Spain.
It is difficult to imagine them running around to help selfiebrits, which could use their energy better to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom, and they do not want it because most of them have separatist tendencies.
Some of these ministers can plan to deliberately throw useless comments in the style of the Scottish National Party in the UK’s 2017 National Election campaign to force the Brexit Process, my friend proposes.
"The latest negotiations were an orderly case," the British had nothing left in hand for the renegotiation.
Europeans know how the British press catches and how the EU-sceptic oligarch press is, just like the 1975 referendum by Tony Benn, the result of which supported the accession of the EU in 1973.
Someone may be distantly remembering Boris Johnson, a sneaky European student who became known as our correspondent for direct bananas in the EU at the beginning of the '90s' in Brussels.
At least Ed Miliband knew his enemy.
These include tax circulating, hacking phones and seemingly-placed dwellings that own most of our good newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair thought the same way about them, but then he realized that when he's in a cage with a rough gorilla, he's gonna have to hand the bananas out for a blunder so that the gorilla wouldn't eat you for both lunch and dinner.
Miliband was even more brilliant when he opposed the referendum, and Blair agreed to the EU Constitution, which was then rejected, and when France and the Netherlands rejected the agreement in the 2005 referendum, Blair was conveniently able to escape.
The press never forgived him for that.
But nice Jeremy Corby, who kindly killed me on the back of Westminster on Monday, and I told him he didn't have time to waste on me, and it could be a risk that he would introduce Neil Kinnock's media robotic strategy in the '80s, and it was a mistake and it's still a mistake.
But Corbyn needs to develop a consistent strategy for dating the media, not with me, but Andrew Marrin, who was sitting on the BBC coat on Sunday.
The official position of Corbyn on Europe is what we politely call building.
He says he wants to keep us in a reformed EU.
Most outsiders of Ukip and Tory are likely to be able to respond positively.
That's what Hilary "Benn but not Benniit" Benn said on radio and television this week when his internal boy of patrol tried not to admit that there was a bad bet from Corbyn to call Karski John McDonnell as Secretary of Finance.
It reminded me of the '70s, when his old father had trouble being on TV with unfaithful labour forces without going too far and losing his place in the underroom.
Hilary's difficulties were more interesting.
Benn said he was opposed to staying in the EU in all circumstances. McDonnel did not say that, nor did Corby’s colleagues and members of the subroom in private meeting on Monday night.
Corby wanted to care about how I suck the picture, it must be remembered that he even touched me. The message is important during the 24/7 period, especially in the discipline of social media, where paranoia and fraud are capable of.
Cameron does not need to be given a free passport in relation to the EU in which he could consider the support of the Labour as a self-evident in the referendum, as McDonnell has stated.
At least Simon Jenkins feels that way.
McDonnell's and Corbyn's equivation of EU membership is suitable for benniitits and anti-capitalism, and the debates are no longer just a limited circle of left-wing contradictors who have the idea of combining similarity as a key texture in the doctrinal shafts.
There has also been evidence of equivation with regard to NATO, and Tom Watson is unconscious that Corby is not campaigning for departure, and foreign diplomats are forced to try to clarify it in their own countries.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital?
The United States has already been rather disappointed by the miserable military performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even during the operation of the Tory Government, and I received a reminder on Monday in the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticise the British authorities' opinions on electrical cigarettes
According to researchers, the claims of the State-funded plant that the burning of electricity cigarettes is 95% less harmful than traditional smoking were born at a meeting of 12 participants with links to the tobacco industry.
In the British Medical Journal (BMJ) and Lancet Medical Journal, experts criticised the evidence provided by the Public Health England (PHE) electric cigarettes report.
PHE described the report published last month as "reverse and comprehensive results".
However, several researchers have questioned the security of information and highlighted the links between some experts in the tobacco industry.
Last month, the Lancet Medical Journal's headline put the teeth on a "smooth base" based on the most important conclusion of PHE.
In addition, two researchers have considered in BMJ whether the claims were established for "good or sand".
Professor Martin McKee of the European Public Health Service of the School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Professor Simon Capewell of the University of Liverpool have said: "The basic assumption of public health care is that the principles of action are based on a clear evidence of their effectiveness."
According to McKee and Capewell, the general public assumes that PHE's claim that "the best estimate today indicates that electricity cigarettes are approximately 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes" should be based on the analysis and modeling of detailed research results.
The claim reflects one meeting of 12 people, which was summed up for the development of a multi-critical model based on a multi-critical assessment of nicotine products. The model wanted to harmonise the views of participants on the disadvantages of nicotine products.
According to McKee and Capewell, the supporters of the meeting included EuroSwiss Health, which was financed by British American Tobacco (BAT), according to sources, by the executive independent research conducted by the CEO.
In addition, in the Sustainable Action Report, the Managing Director showed its support for BAT’s activities in terms of public health.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting granted funding from the electric receiver, but the alleged earlier funding from the tobacco company Philip Morris International was not granted by the participant in question.
There are no explanations of the selection criteria for the composition of the Panel; however, there are a number of well-known supporters of electricity cigarettes, some of which contribute to the financing of industry.
However, some participants are not familiar with their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The meeting was also attended by the PHE Sugar Officer.
According to McKee and Capewell, the Group's research report shows that there is no undisputed evidence of the harmfulness of the products in relation to a wide range of products and their compliance with their criteria.
However, links or shortcomings are not mentioned in the PHE report.
According to the PHE report, there has been no evidence that electrical cigarettes can contribute to the smoking of children or non-smoking. McKee and Capewell consider the claim to be premature.
According to Professor Kevin Fenton, PHE’s head for Health and Welfare has responded earlier.
According to Fenton, electrical cigarettes are significantly less harmful than traditional smoking.
Every one of the people who smoke through life dies because of tobacco addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of electric cigarettes are lower than the risks of traditional tobacco, but the long-term effects need to be further investigated.
PHE is obliged to inform the citizens of what evidence shows and what it does not demonstrate, especially in a situation where relative risks are unclear compared to traditional tobacco.
In the United Kingdom there are nearly 80 000 deaths in relation to smoking each year and there are two billion GBP annual costs for public health care.
Responsible action requires that we clearly present the current evidence that electrical cigarettes are not a risk-free alternative, but that their harmful effects are a fraction of the detriment of traditional tobacco.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says Channel 4 Boss
Luke Johnson, headed by Channel 4, has said that BBC should stop sending certain programs, including EastEnders and The Voice. Johnson said commercial competitors would give their right hand on the slow sets, like Albert Square.
According to Johnson, the licence fee should be used only for the purposes of programmes that other television stations do not.
He criticised BBC's probability to present programmes that are likely to be smaller than the public, at the same time as the large number of competitors' programmes, and, for example, the BBC4 channel.
After Tony Hall, Director General of BBC, had announced that the company wanted to increase cooperation with other organisations, Johnson said that for six years, he tried to get channel 4 to work with BBC, without results.
"I do not agree with the idea that BBC would buy formats and send programmes that are clearly part of a competing channel software", Johnson told the Communication Committee of Parliament's House, which explained the future of BBC.
If BBC wants to keep a broadcasting charge, which I think is not necessarily a good idea in the medium or long term, it should reduce its supply to at least programmes that are not produced and purchased by others.
BBC will send The Voice to the best time of view, because it will want the broadest possible support in the future.
If no other channel takes care of the program, it is clearly ridiculous nonsense.
"I do not understand why a regressive tax should finance programmes that could be financed without aid," said Johnson.
The Voice is one of these, EastEnders, the other, even though it is own production.
A lot of channels would give their right hand on it.
I don't understand how this serves the service of the broadcaster.
I don't think this would be a loss for BBC."
Johnson is a serial entrepreneur who was headed by Channel 4 in 2004-2010. He believes that BBC is looking for good viewers because he works in the company with ambitions and because they believe it is the best way to guarantee long-term support.
Johnson's comments on the most popular series of BBC are similar to that of the former Sky Boss Tony Ballin, who proposed in 2003 the MacTaggart lecture that BBC sells out series like EastEnders.
According to Johnson, BBC's niche programs are shown on the BBC4 channel, where the number of viewers cannot mostly be measured, but the programs fulfil their purpose. "BBBC can say, in defending his hypocritical missiles, four billion quids of broadcasts were made by special programs that no one was watching."
"BBBC presents them at times where no one will ever see them."
From the general broadcasting fees, Johnson said: "I will find you in that sense to find another old-fashioned system that who gets the best benefit.
Of course, everyone thinks that 150 pounds a year is cheap, but people for whom it is a big sum, especially if the BBC is not much looked at."
Former Head of Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who also stated his own views in the committee on Tuesday, said that BBC should exchange its ancient mission with new "information, teaching and entertainment".
According to Elstein, BBC's current offer hardly has educational programs – 1 per cent on television and 0.1 per cent on radio. He adds that BBC should learn from Australia and Canada's broadcasters and go to the new faith of his mission: "inform, illuminate and entertain".
To the cooperation issue, Elstein suggests that BBC could increase broadcasts, for example, of events such as the Proms Festival, which was sent only a fracture part of the concerts last year. “BBBC should also join the alliances with commercial channels, so that the whole supply is also available online,” he continues.
Brain cells can be controlled by sound waves using sonogenetics
The video shows how the shuttle can change its direction when the ultrasound is targeted.
Researchers have grown worms whose nerve system has been genetically modified, so worms can be controlled by ultrasound.
The small shuttle lamps change their directions when they are targeted with an ultrasound with a frequency above the hearing area of the ear.
The sound waves activate motion nerve cells that have been genetically modified so that they have a transport film that reacts to the ultrasound.
More on the subject: Researchers are following the activity of the brain through light
According to researchers, the worms were able to demonstrate the efficacy of the new sonogenetic method (dubbed sonogenetics), using ultrasound to activate the brain, heart and muscle cells by an irritation outside the body.
Researcher Sreekanth Chalasani of Salk Instute in California La Someday told Guardian that the method could replace deep-aivo stimulation (DBS). DBS treatment is an invasive method for treating Parkinson’s symptoms, in which the brain is stimulated by electroimpulses.
Chalasani noticed, however, that the worms begin to react when they are placed on a liquid with microscopic small bubbles.
Chalasan says that the bubbles are stiffening ultrasonic waves that move in the worms.
Strengthened ultrasonic waves affect TRP4 ionic doors that are part of the worm cellular membranes.
According to the article published in the Nature Communications, the sound waves will allow these ion channels to open and activate the cells to which they are attached.
In order to control shuttles with ultrasound, Chalasani transformed the worms genetically so that some of their movement-driven nerves appeared in TRP4-ion channels.
When the ultrasound was directed to converted worms, the microspheres reinforced the sound waves and moved to the worms, when the nerve cell moved on to the signal.
The method is a little similar to optogenetics, which is a variable tool that enables researchers to activate nerve cells using light.
According to Chalasan, however, sonogenetics have certain advantages compared to optogenetics.
The light is to the brain targeted by light fibres, and low-speed ultrasounds pass the cell easily, so the ultrasound can be directed to the brain through the skull.
"We believe that gene therapy and viral therapy will allow human nerve cells to be instantly exposed to ultrasonic signals in a clinical environment in certain neurologic treatments," said Chalasani.
According to the investigator, the method could also be used in muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture — Your Homefather!
The ads are a disgrace for the British armed shop.
Look at Amnesty International's anti-arms video.
Horrible killer missiles!
Fibre-breaking legguns!
grape bombs!
Distance materials that cause unbearable pain, but do not leave traces!
The happy voice and drawings clearly reveal that this advertising of the world's largest arms fairs is a parade. The video is produced by Amnesty International and is designed to highlight the efforts of the British government to sell weapons to the repressive governments at the DSEI (Defence Security and Equipment International) fair, held at the ExCel Fair in London, Docklands.
More on: DSEI arms fairs: authoritarian governments arrive in London
For bus stops and metrocars there are also posters that require a second look.
"A key notification: are you moving on the metro from 15 to 18 September?" The notification reminds you of the appearance of the London metro announcements. There is a picture of the tanker in the second line of the Metroline.
"In September, a number of armed dealers arrive at Docklands, and customers are being asked for help in order to stop arms fairs."
Three hundred posters have been made by artists who have worked in Banksy Dismaland's Museum of Cruel Designs.
A colleague named Special Patrol Group helped distribute posters around London with six pounds of "a public space hacking package" with six keys which claim to be accessing about a third of the world bus stops advertisements.
Transport for London isn't laughing about poster quandalism.
One of the stunt advertisings of the Special Patrol Group.
According to the curator of Cruel Designs and the lecturer at the University of Essex, Gavin Grindon, artists have started to question things and want to bring their political work to the public to see outside the galleries.
Artists have noticed that social influence through art requires art to be brought into the real world, and many move to work with the activists of protesters.
One of the anti-arm trafficking posters welcomes public transport users in the metro.
Amnesty's video has been viewed over 100 000 times a day via Facebook. It has been designed without compensation by the VCCP Advertising Office, and both the graphic designer and times have done their work without compensation.
Matt Lever, the artistic leader of VCCP, was incredible in the absence of the Messiah and an empty spot at the event calendar of ExCeL. He said, "Let's give them a campaign they're trying to avoid."
They tried to squeeze a more realistic, blurred business video, but bright colors and animateds make it better."
"They've done a wonderful job and helped us raise the messes in which illegal torture trade is carried out," says Amnesty's Tom Davies.
"Now the government must take action and ensure that torture instruments are not illegally traded at our home door."
However, the most creative gifts of armed fairs may be displayed in excel itself, where exhibiters use excellent circular expressions of their goods.
In the press release, Saab announced the order made by the U.S. Army concerning "the portable AT4CS RS."
The product includes "specially shaped warfare that effectively intrudes directly into the object."
It doesn't sound very pleasant.
Eight golden rules for people living in student dwellings
I moved to a student apartment 11 years ago. I was innocent 19 years old and still believed in barets and moral relativism, only now I remember the popular smiles that I annoyed and countless, long complaints from others.
The most important teachings I can summarise in eight simple rules.
Movement to the loft is a mildly burdensome experience, and the worst is shocking.
In this situation, it's easy to chase: you tell everyone where you are, did you like a mid-year and why you don't like Corbyn, and why you don't "hate or love Marmite, because it's just yeast, hahaha, I'm in my room".
Take a breath.
And help others breathe: show your interest and ask questions about other things.
Questioning guides the conversation and helps you find people you like and people you wouldn't talk to, even when your lashes were in the flames and these people would share the extinguishers.
Give me room for the others.
Own rooms often work as drunken dishes, cinematographic theatres and general housing rooms, but they also have a place to dress from underwear.
More on the subject: Do not even imagine combining dating and university studies
For Introverts, the university is a tough place
The room should be a place of calming, but many apartments have a social culture that is walking from one room to another and forming long-term friendships.
Such a culture can be a nightmare for a person who needs a place to return.
It is not possible in this environment to say: "I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I want you to leave so that I can download back the energy I used by dating you."
Try to see if one of your students is exhausted from social contacts, perhaps not to knock on the door and send a text.
Speaking of knocking: knock.
In my own student apartment, there was a guy who thought the unlocked door meant he was welcome in.
He saw all kinds of things.
Get some friends by baking.
You'll start your study properly when baking is in, so if you bake browns and knock on someone's door, you don't seem like a 50-century, a little strange case: "Hello in the neighborhood, I baked you something little.
Homemade deliciouss are a great way to get new friends.
Your student friend has to talk to you, and it's a good surprise that gives them a positive picture of you.
Of course, this requires reasonable bakery skills.
If you serve unhappy flour, sugar and fat cookers, the others probably pretend to sleep when you knock on the door.
Food bruising is also a common fault in student housing.
Of course, taking another chicken is stealing, but is it possible for her tea to take a drop of milk from someone else?
Always make sure it's from the owner.
It's likely you'll get permission, even if you're borrowing milk to the owner of your jurp.
I understand that it's annoying if someone whispers something from you, but try to deal with the situation as adultly as possible — unlike my own student friend, who dragged the washing agent into his milk for punishment for the thieves of milk.
She's in jail now.
Don't be noisy when the others try to sleep or punch.
It's not just because it's polite, but it's also worth remembering that everyone else digs a hole...
In my own apartment, a girl asked the person living in the next room to adjust the music to the slightest, for it was three in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
The neighbor just increased the volume.
When I finally slowed down in the neighborhood, the girl let the neighbor sleep for two hours, and he left for three hours for the exam, left the music in his room and locked the door.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse would happen to move into the same apartment?
And wouldn't it be strange if you thought first that your student friend was your future spouse, you'd start dating, divorced, and you'd have to see him every day and lose the right to meet your friends?
Surely the heart wants what he wants, and if the student's friend is definitely not the only one, try to control him.
If you notice at the moment that someone has forgotten his keys in a room where the door is not locked, the limit of cheating and bullying is more disgusting than you could think.
A good joke is fun, but one of them will recover in a moment.
Hide some object may be a valuable and fun lesson, but no one's room should be mixed with toothpaste and sampon.
The door of the other room can be locked and dropped in a glass of water, which is placed in a freezer, but do not attach any items to the roof on a blue barrel a few times more.
Racist attack at the foreign students' lounge in Kite - The house envisaged as a reception center was strangled in Salo
A racist attack in Kite, North Karelia was held on Saturday night at the foreign students' lounge.
Unlike the police used to say, this is not the accommodation of underage asylum seekers, but the sleep spaces of foreign students who have already been in Finland, says Heidi Luukkainen, the teacher of the Christian Church of Kite.
The windows and walls of the National University were swept with racist signs, such as racists, and the metal object was thrown through the window of one of the rooms, says the Eastern Finland police.
According to Luukkainen, the youth-guarantee training of the National University, it was estimated that ten people were in the vicious building at the time of the attack.
"It was a weekend and adult people are free to move, and some could be elsewhere," says Luukkainen.
The university has accommodation for people from 12 different nationalities.
They are already students who have been in Finland for some time, as well as newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
All those who were in a messed-up building have a status.
Some study in adult primary schools, part is in professional studies and part is studying Finnish," says Luukkainen.
The A status is a so-called ‘continuous residence permit’, which can be granted for four years at a time for a foreigner who has already been in Finland for some time.
The Eastern Finland police are investigating the attack as an act of damage and a breach of home peace.
According to a large number of students, the event was held to students on Monday, where there were also the necessary interpretations.
There's no panic here, and no one has ever wanted to leave.
We've had students from abroad for forty years, and this is the first time that something like this happens," says Luukkainen.
According to a lot of people, the messes have already been cleaned out of the walls.
There were at least three men suspected to be killers, and they had been moving on a light passenger car.
I think it's the end of the juvenile weekend when this topic has been on the surface.
Nothing more serious", Luukkainen says.
Salo has also been struggled by a hospital with a reception centre.
The case happened last week.
MTV told me about it on his website Tuesday night.
The hospital wall was drawn by a hakaristi and written in English "You are not welcome".
This case has been filed for a criminal report to the police.
Description of 15 September at 16.02 Repaired by the police of incorrect information on the age and status of people living in the building.
The government will put an end to the Y-train to Karja, the passengers in their chews, "of course, idiots."
The Y-train from Helsinki to Karja of Raasepor stops passing in March.
The news insisted on passengers coming to the beginning of the train at the Helsinki main railway station.
In particular, the subway strikes the Siuntians, said Torbjörn Bengtström.
It is idiotic because the population is growing all the time and working needs a rapid and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can't be tied to anything but political will or lack of it.
Bengtström says with HSTV's interview video, he'll come to the capital with a tractor.
Train changes are also taking place elsewhere in Newland.
The H and R trains on the main track will be combined as a new R line.
Purola's station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna Tuusula are out of use.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on the routes to which the Ministry will buy train transport during the next contract period.
The contract period will change in the year-to-year period and the routes to be ceased are in the whole country.
The new four-year agreement to be finalised in autumn will later be approved by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
Siuntian Bengtström believes that the State train cutter is a short-sighted operation.
Same mistakes have been made before and repeated in a very systematic way.
Then there will be repentance.
The Y train is also used by non-raceporians and Siuntians because it is fast and passes several stations.
The Espooan Annina Table was harmed by the fate of those traveling farther from the city area.
"It's especially bad for those who have to redesign their journey," he said when he hurts his Y train.
A little relief is promised.
A new train connection is coming to the coastline, which will replace the Y train in the Helsinki Region's transport (HSL) area, i.e. exports to Kirkkonumme.
This will increase costs for HSL, i.e. practically for municipalities and their taxpayers.
"We are now starting to explore different options and their impact on service levels and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of the HSL.
It is still impossible to accurately assess the costs.
Rihtniemi states that, based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid about a million dollars a year for the Y train, of course the Ministry has paid much more than that.
The R line on the main track leaves two positions behind.
On the other hand, the number of trains in Ainola and Sauna Kallio doubles.
The whole country ceases to have 28 small stations and numerous routes.
The Ministry no longer buys train transport from routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The Pieksämäki-Joensuu route will be shortened to Pieksämäki-Varistus.
Train shifts decrease on routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka port and Kajaani-Oulu.
Over half a million trips a year will be made on displaced shifts, with a total of nine million trips in transport purchased by the ministry.
The new agreement is intended to bring the State the annual savings of 12.3 million.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
The Sixten Korkman wrote in the chapter The topic of capital: "You should learn about Marx."
The crisis in the world economy has raised the surface Karl Marx (1818-1883) and its final work in 1867-1894, published in the book on Marx's capital, known as former President of the GDP, writes the topic of the book published today by Yrjö Hakane.
"He is now being taken more serious than for a long time", Hakanen writes in his premiere.
Marx's estimates of the development of the capitalist economy, the internationalisation and the invasion of all the areas of life, the concentration of capital and the growing role of monetary capital and imaginary capital have proved to be astonishingly far-reaching.
The author list of the book based on the capital seminars organised by Hakase is also found by the professor of Aalto University, a respected economicist of Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes Marx's current "family and forever."
But isn't the former CEO of the Business Institute and of the Economics Delegation Marxian?
Not at all.
On the phone, Korkman says that he does not consider Marx as a modern economic thinker, but rather as an interesting social theoretical.
Today, social sciences are differentiated and specialised, but Marx was a philosopher, historic, sociologist, economic scientist, journalist, political agitator and literacy lessons.
"The fact is that the history is telling about the wrong opinions of the dead men," Korkman begins.
The truth is, Marx's prophecies went badly.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew the conclusions of the early age of capitalism too far, Korkman is considering.
But Korkman sees the value of Marx's radical installation.
"The more thoughtful thing in Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
Now again, we are discussing Marx's interests, such as the distribution of wealth.
"Marx may be able to give inspiration to someone who wants to understand the big picture, the changing world as a result of a technical confusing," Korkman analyses.
But what the government's supposed to decide tomorrow isn't helpful for Marx.
He thought capitalism was a hopeless case, which should just stop.
However, it's worth getting to Marx in the opinion of Korkman.
"In the '70s, Marx couldn't read," says Korkman.
"The Mayans, the Trotsk and the other sects hated all capitalism, but more and more each other."
Today the debate is more versatile, and Marxia can also be approached without the ideal and political pressure load of the backdrops.
"Every societal scientist should get to know Marx's thought world, like other classics," Korkman says.
The UN calls for war criminals in Sri Lanka
The UN calls for the establishment of a special court to investigate the war crimes committed in Sri Lanka's Civil War, reports AFP.
The UN report on civil war in 1983-2009 appeared on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report is accused of war crimes, both of Sri Lanka's armed forces and of the rebels known as Tamilitigers.
In Sri Lankan civil war, it is estimated that at least 100,000 people have died.
There's no accurate information on the number of victims.
In particular, the major attack of the armed forces in the last months of the long war in 2009 should be investigated properly, the UN report requires.
The Sri Lankan Armed Forces report is accused of torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, which was as likely as men as women.
According to the report, the rebels have been guilty of forced by siders and children to fight.
According to the report, both parties have committed murders.
Sri Lanka replied on Wednesday that it intends to conduct the investigation itself, but it does not allow the establishment of the UN Court of Justice because of foreign judges.
In the yo test of England, you had to punter social media.
In the autumn student writings, on Wednesday, there was a long foreign language, mostly English.
More than 16,000 experiments tested their English skills.
In the experiment, it could be written from social media.
Based on our own experience, we had to consider whether social media would make us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the 150 to 250 word written in English could show the online magazine to the consultant.
The title was Aunt Dear Agony.
Aunt Agony is in charge of Finnish Leelia's resting chair.
He had to ask for advice on how parents could look at things for young people as well.
In total, there were four topics of the substance, one of which had to be selected.
"It was the hardest of them", assessing the third topic of Porvoo Swedish high school writer Mia Lybeck.
The third issue was only a citate from the former President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso.
The fourth subject, Lybeck said, was really nice.
It was supposed to write a fire speech why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least our school has been practicing writing speeches," Lybeck says and estimates the whole test "what's normal."
In Finnish - or in Swedish - the English experiment, it was possible to answer the questions of texts, such as the adaptation of summer champagne to climate change and the processing of large data masses.
On Wednesday, some long Russian (168 pupils), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written.
The autumn articles continue on Friday, when another domestic or Swedish or Finnish test is over.
In high schools, the test is normally conducted, i.e. the demonstration of employees does not affect it.
The Higher Education Panel urges the pilots to seek appropriate access to the trial event on time.
You can also have more time if you can show that the delay was not due to your own carelessness.
In Oulu, the shop was robbed with a gun in danger.
In Oulu, a shop was robbed on Wednesday morning in Kello.
According to the police, the robber had dressed in dark clothes, and his face was covered in a commandopipopo.
He's a normal body. He's about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened his staff with a handgun and received a small amount of money.
They're investigating it as a brutal robbery.
The police are waiting for ten-century demonstrators to arrive in Helsinki - support teams from elsewhere in Finland
The demonstration against government surgery decisions will be blocked by the Helsinki Centre on Friday, predicting the police.
According to preliminary information, even tens of thousands of people can arrive.
The members of the SAK, the Programme and the STTK associations will meet at the Railway Market at 11 a.m.
Police are also believed to be involved in the demonstration.
On the other hand, the task of the police in work is not only to carry out alarm and other police activities but also to ensure the smoothing of the giant expression.
The roads leading to the railway track shall be closed from motor vehicles for a period from 9.30 to 14.
Only alarm vehicles will be released to the area.
From the direction of Hakanieme, traffic is cut off from the road circle of Kaisanieme, west from the Mannerheim.
Is there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Captain Seppo Kujala?
For now, at least, it looks like it's enough.
I'm not taking a position on the police's work fight.
As a result of the demonstration, there are support teams from elsewhere in Finland, according to Kujala.
The exact patrol officer, the police won't tell me.
"Something's coming, but basically we'll be fine on our own," Kujala says.
The police are calling to avoid private cargo at the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
The Kujala estimates that the worst transport tube extends from the level of Hakaniemi to its core centre.
Stand-up traffic is expected from the morning to the beginning of the night.
Along with demonstrators from elsewhere in Finland, many order buses are also coming to Helsinki.
They won't be released to the Railway.
The buses are on the basis of time.
The rest of the journey must then walk to the demonstration place," Kujala says.
The expression also stops the Helsinki public transport.
From a police point of view, there's a positive side.
The problem of the smoothness of public transport, which is normally in the hands of these large people gatherings, will now be dealt with in part by itself.
The organisers of the statement have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of the government's economic policy may come to Helsinki.
The police are waiting for the demonstration to go peacefully.
There are people who are usually working or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
The Finns are rational and peaceful people," Kujala says.
Local demonstrations are also held across Finland on Friday.
Friday's demonstration is exceptional in many ways, do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The great demonstration organised by trade unions on Friday is in many ways interesting and exceptional.
For example, there is no very good reference in Finnish political history, says the professor of the University of Jyväskylä, Emeritus Martti Siisiäinen.
It's not a miracle for the Ay movement to protest.
If it weren't, it'd put your hands up in front of the government, then that's what Siisiäinen says.
A very right-wing government has attacked the Finnish Corporatism tradition on the core points - and also on points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's hard shots are lacking in contract law.
There are a lot of features here that the Ay movement is really trying to get on its knees.
The Ay Movement also has a place to look in the mirror.
For example, the mirror is needed because the Ay movement does not have all employees' support for Friday's demonstrations.
The new is now the steep division that the demonstration will bring about among the people that the ay movement would like to participate in the demonstration.
The unemployed across Finland showed their minds at the Parliamentary House in November 1993.
If you are looking for a reference point for Friday's demonstration, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed, the Murrostorstai, written in 1993, says.
In the middle of the deepest lama arranged Murrostorstai gathered 20,000 unemployed.
The Esko Ahon (Central) government stumbled from the labour market crisis.
It was said that Finland’s government and employees’ organisations had never been as bad as Aho’s civilian government.
Now, the government and the Ay movement may be even worse than in the time of Murrostorst.
Besides, there is now a great government in Finland ever, Siisilainen says.
The present government coalition is still interesting in the way that it is so tight right, despite the speeches of the Finnishs.
At the time of the blunt, there were certain elements of the old workforce.
A number of thousands of demonstrators are expected on Friday.
The expression also stops public transport and possibly closes day care and schools.
Even if the demonstration does not receive undistributed support for employees, it can become the largest for years.
About 300 demonstrations have been held in Helsinki in recent years.
There's a lot of them.
Traditionally, the demonstrations of the Finnish ay movement have been quite calm, even though the practices have been hardened in recent years.
Traditionally, the Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, be lawful.
Contesters are trying to avoid damage or destruction of property, says Siisiäinen.
The end of the 1990s, however, brought new winds.
The culture of demonstration changed.
The EU membership annoyed farmers to throw eggs and the police prepared to get on pig shit.
The firemen strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also visible strikes, including pilots and air traffic controllers.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Metal and electrical strikes of the 1970s
In the 1970s the most significant strikes were a metal strike in 1971 and a power plant and electric strike in 1977.
There were 70 000 metal men involved in the metal strike.
The strike was suspended at the Reconciliation Board's presentation after seven weeks of strike.
Metal men received a 16% raise.
The spring 1977 electric strike lasted 49 days and caused electricity cuts all over the country.
Murrostorstai in 1993
On 4 November 1993, around 20 000 people, many of whom were unemployed, met to show their opinion on behalf of the work.
Firemen strike three months in 1998
The strike of firemen was one of the longest in the 1990s, unless the longest national strike.
Farmers opposed the EU 1994 and 1999
In 1994, the police were exposed to chicken eggs in protests against the EU by farmers.
Siberia teaches, the EU stops, was one of the slogans.
Espalle's farmers smashed a ton of snow.
In 1999, the Helsinki EU Summit also led farmers to protest and burn haypales in front of the meeting.
Nurses striked in 1983 and 1995
The nurses striked for about a month in 1995.
For the last time, they had been in strike in 1983.
A few deaths during the strike were coloured by the 1995 strike.
Teaching threatens to strike and the death of nurses in 2007.
Finally, the threat of decommissioning was accelerating the outcome of the negotiations.
Doctors striked 2001
"The doctors at the strike - from the escape," was the attack of the strikeing doctors in 2001.
The strike of local health centres and hospital doctors lasted five months and led to an intense debate on how strikes could endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised the doctors' salaries.
Students on the move in 2013
Approximately 5 000 students marched on behalf of study support in Helsinki from Senate to Parliamentary House in 2013.
The Central Crime Police will investigate the background of the Finnish truck full of refugees to the Austrian police
The Austrian police have asked the Central Crime Police to help identify the backgrounds of the refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, Austrian police stopped a truck with 42 refugees on board near the German border in Aisterheim.
There's no way to know if the truck was on its way to Finland.
All those people on the cold truck were in good shape.
We've had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and the principal responsibility are at the scene in Austria, reports Chief Inspector Tero Haapala.
At the end of August, refugees travelling in a truck in Austria became more fatal.
At that time, all 71 passengers on board apparently died by suffocating.
According to the General Radio, first reported by the Austrian police on cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to the Finnish shareholder company.
The company is engaged in restaurant activities, among other things, and its CEO is a foreign man, a man of about 40 years old.
In Austria, two Irish people have been arrested for human smuggling.
Captain of the refugees, former drug abuser and junkie businessman, the story of five smugglers
Upporic smuggler king, a violent boat driver, a stylish missionary and a good guy who thinks he's a taxi driver.
For example, such people carry human smuggling into the European Union.
Criminologist Andrea Di Nicola and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci at Trento University have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "companies" and their written book Death Travel Office will appear in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present smugglers of human smuggling, make proposals for solutions and present smugglers from different stages of business.
The HS presents five of them.
I'm gonna beat them up right now.
There are no attractions of foreign tourists on the eastern coast of Tunisia, but many Tunisians are headed for the summer holiday.
For their location, islands also fit for smuggling, as the trip to the island of Lampedusa to Italy is only 120 kilometres.
For the purpose of comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 km.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives in Emir, a chain of burning captain and the father of six children.
The gathering islands are famous for their shrimp, but the fishermen are more profitable to transport people.
That's what Emir has done with a blue, ten - metre wooden boat for hundreds of times.
If the boat's full, it'll fit 40 people.
From one trip, Emir will make some EUR 8 000 afterwards.
Emir has five assistants looking for her customers around Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the arabic period a vast number of Tunisians wanted to escape the restlessness.
After that, the situation calmed down until it revived with the refugee crisis.
Customers arrive from the continent to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir's staying in empty houses for as long as he sees good.
The food is given so that the customers are just and just staying alive.
Accommodation costs about EUR 75 per night, and if the customer stops the money, it's their problem.
We're going to go to the water at midnight with the lights out.
The first night you drive away from the island, then you stop, wait a day, and the next night you drive to Lampedus.
Sometimes seagoing is hard, and in waves of 20 metres passengers weep and vomit.
At the destination, the human cargo has been unloaded in half an hour and Emir is leaving for a return trip.
Emir wants to be afraid of him.
That's why he's beating his clients, and at least he's saying he's gonna beat the musicians to death.
He says in the book that once he was taken by the police, he threw all his passengers across the river and told them to swim on the nearest island.
"I picked up customers by one and threw them across the back," says Emir in the book.
The most peaceful passengers are coming south of Sahara.
I hear his countrymen have to assault him for this.
I'm gonna kick them out right now.
We need to show them immediately who's in charge.
It's the usual cab driver.
Goran is an ordinary taximan in Bogovaša in Serbia.
His taxi isn't very good. The starter engine's on its last, and by the way, it's seen the best days.
However, the most important thing for Goran's customers is that the taxi moves at all, and that it moves towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaša is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometres from Belgrade to southwest.
The centre for asylum seekers is located next to the village, where families are mostly allowed.
In the forests surrounding the center, without their family, men will stay in tents, lavas and abandoned cars, which now anyone has managed to find or build.
In the forest, families who have not submitted asylum applications in Serbia for reasons or other are also living in the forest.
Some also stay in private dwellings, but it is a public secret.
Among the foresters, Gora finds most of his clients.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans the route requires a large number of crossings and weekly walking trips in a difficult countryside, often in mountainous areas and in the dark.
When finally arrives in Bogovasha's region, in a large area of human smuggling, people are fatigue.
Goran’s riders are mainly Syrian, Afghanistan, Pakistani, Iraqi, and Kurds.
The best clients are Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say their affairs once and that's enough," says Gora.
He says the Africans are trying to do something.
That's not what Goran likes.
She's a fool all the way.
At first, for example, 300 euros will be agreed, then they will drop it to 200 and eventually offer 150.
Goran underlines being a nice and good-hearted man.
I don't care about money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," he says in the book.
Goran tells us that he works cheaper than others, and he's only paying EUR 50 per person to the Hungarian border.
There's a hundred miles on the road, most of which is comfortable on the motorway.
I hear colleagues are asking for a three or four-fold price.
Goran deserves about EUR 50 000 a year.
It is not a large amount for the smuggler, but in Serbia it is quite a nice annual income.
Serbia has ordered that taxi should not be transported 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Gora doesn't care: he knows the roads and the shortcuts and takes his rides a mile away from the border.
Then he'll show his clients the right direction and throw them away.
In the Work of Mercy
A 35-year-old congo man is called Ambassador, and it's not just a nickname.
He really has a Protestant Church in the capital of Uganda in Kampala, where there are many refugees from Congo, as well as a small centre to help the congo children refugees.
In addition to preaching, ambassador runs a smuggling business where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He looks at doing the work of mercy.
It's important for the ambassador to look good.
He polishs his shoes several times a day and ensures that the white underwear of the low belt of the jeans is stylishly stirred.
Ambassador is proud of his new Mercedes, his landlord car and three motorcycles.
When the missionaries do not preach, he organises people from Congo to Uganda and forward to Europe.
At first, the customer calls to one of the five phone numbers of the consignor.
He advises that you should come to the border in the morning, hide the money viciously, and smash it in amongst traders crossing the border.
In order to obtain an asylum seeker or a refugee status to the Uganda authorities, it is necessary to inform the Uganda authorities that there are, for example, war areas in North Kivu, and that they have been forced to flee violence in their homes.
Often it's true, but if not, the consignor will arrange a new identity for the client.
An old identity certificate will be destroyed and another will be acquired.
It helps the congressman's contacts in Uganda's police.
Then the customer will be directed to the same place where the right asylum seekers go: asylum seek procedures, NGOs, eventually to UNHCR.
Ambassador knows bureaucracy because he himself has become a refugee in Uganda.
He bills separately for each gate: submitting an application to the Uganda police costs about EUR 100, managing documents to the humanitarian organisation around 150 and moving process, for example, EUR 4 500-7 000 in Europe.
Foliota and ice burns
Tom's a start-up smuggler, an ex-drug.
A 4th-century Irish watches the French coast in Calais, where his job is to load people in the trucks on their way to Britain.
He has an Afghan, a French taxi driver in London, and a dozen truck drivers who may not even know he's in a human smuggling business.
At night, Tom and the taxi driver picked up their clients, usually 2-3 people, somewhere from the Calais Center.
They're driving motorway A26 and trying to avoid the police.
If the police were to stop the car on the motorway, Tom and the driver would be put in prison for organising illegal immigration.
That's what Tom doesn't want. He's been sitting for seven years for drugs.
Taxi stops, Tom runs over his clients' motorway to a resting place where drivers sleep before they continue to cross the channel to Britt.
Tom picks the right truck to make sure that it's on his way to England, not even Holland, and cuts across the protective coat.
We need to do it quietly so you don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver is involved, but then it's more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his client in a aluminium foil, the same as in the kitchen is wrapped around the paste or the oven potato.
It's supposed to stop the police's heat scanner from finding a hideout.
Some use iced bedroom bags for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in a truck, and he's leaving the place, hoping that the driver doesn't have a sudden flash travellers before Britain.
King of Smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the most famous human smugglers in the world.
The Upporian Turkish has been called the champion of marketing and the undeniable king of the Mediterranean's illegal rises in landscape, which controls sea routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been operating since the 1990s and has continuously developed new smuggling methods.
He also has a competitive advantage in relation to other entrepreneurs: he only demands money.
One of the new methods is a luxurious shipping fraud: Turkish ports are rented for a couple of days’ tourist trips to the United States or European families.
In fact, ships will be loaded in full by Syrian, Iraqi, Kurdea and Afghanistan, who will be transported against the payment of EUR 5 000-7 000 from Istanbul first to some port and from there to Europe.
Customers are stored in human storage, such as in old industrial halls until it is time for them to leave.
People are storing into minibuss and driving somewhere in the coast.
They are told to hide amongst plants and wait for the sign.
When it's given, we need to get on board quickly.
Passengers must hide under the deck all the way.
The Maritime Guard can only monitor the depth of the boat's swimming, for there are no other signs of the crowd.
Food and drink are given, but the less the passengers stool and vomit, the better.
Küçük receives approximately EUR 53 000 for one luxury shipping trip after the costs.
He does not do practical things himself, but hire captains, recruiters, guards, accommodations and other smaller factors to do the work for himself.
During the summer period, shipments are organised at least hundreds and Küçük makes millions.
He believes to have purchased undercover companies through the country, the pharmaceutical company and more than 100 apartments he rents.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same time as the representative of the Turkish Democratic Party and an entrepreneur in the pharmaceutical sector.
After that, apparently, he's gone.
Corrigendum 16.9.2015 at 15.10: The Death Travel Office book will appear on this, not next week.
The American Olympic Advancer tells in his book about his illness and becoming a prostitute
Three times the Olympics competing at the 1 500 metres of Suzy Favor Hamilton's new book has attracted attention to the United States.
Favor Hamilton, in his book called Fast Girl, tells me about stopping his career and becoming a prostitute.
The Sports Illustrated magazine published fragments from the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career at Sydney's Olympics.
He came to the races in top order and ran in the cluster for the second best time.
But in the final, he panicked.
He rode to the top right at the beginning and defended his position on the earthly run.
But before the goal was 150 meters, his strength ran out.
He collapsed into the surface of the track, and other competitors passed him one after another.
I felt like an idiot and thought I'd never run again.
But I forced myself over the goal line, Favor Hamilton says in his book.
Later, Favor Hamilton suffered bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before Sydney's races, and he himself felt tremendous pressures on success.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when he became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no economic problems, but the idea of getting money for having sex with strangers was fascinating.
He also oversounded his husband to accept his action.
Favor Hamilton's taxi was EUR 450 per hour.
He says he used the money for a luxury life.
One of Favor Hamilton’s explanations for prostitute was also that he needed similar adrenaline defects as he had been competing in general sports.
Later, Favor Hamilton found out that he had bipolar disorder.
The double life of the former star drinker came out at the end of 2012 when Smoking Gun published a article on him.
Favor-Hamilton attended the Olympics in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was 1500 metres of the world's statistical community at 3.57.40, but last in Sydney's Olympic Final.
The world champion rejoiced when the covenant reigned the Norwegian skiing squad:
The skiing king of Norway Petter Northug has crossed the boundaries for at least one of its colleagues.
Northug and the skiing union of Norway have twisted the whole summer and autumn, like last year, the athlete agreement.
Even though the union has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been suitable for a multiplying world champion and the Olympic winner.
The result of the contractual dispute was the Norwegian skiing union decided to exclude Northug from the future seasonal world cup.
The decision was given thanks to the double world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he's happy that the union has strangled the skiing pile.
"Thank you for showing me the spine," Jacobsen wrote in his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the Union's sponsor," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Skiing Union and Northug is about money.
It seems that Northug would like to be a part of the seasonal country team so that he can advertise his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said that he was happy to represent a union that also carries for future generations, and that one athlete would not give on the solos.
At the same time, he recalled that the alliance has given Northug both economic and other privileges for several years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has completely different rules than just because he's the best.
On Tuesday, Northug published his own announcement, in which he assured himself that he would want to be in the brave Norwegian colors next season in the world cup as well as afterwards in the MMs and Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won six MM medals in his career, two of which were golden.
He was involved last winter in a team that won a messenger in Falun.
The shield of the spillers is also spent in the Nordic country
On shielding day 25.9., tricks are organised in various restaurants and shops that have been granted the Paist translation shield.
The aim of the day is to emphasise the high level of food skills in Finland and to lower the threshold of departure to the restaurant and to raise awareness of the importance of the balloon as part of high quality.
At the same time, we would like to remind you that not all high-level restaurants have focused on the capital region, but the top restaurants that have been checked and classified by an objective operator are located around Finland.
The international attention received from the event is an indication of the significance of the event as part of the increased awareness of shield foods and organisations.
In the Nordic country, the day will be arranged for a restaurant in Vaasa in Fondiks and Kantarellis.
In Kokkola, the shield day is a part of the Old Town restaurant.
The event has also received significant international attention.
The event has therefore been decided to be one of the most important international events of the organization, which will be held in different parts of the world during the same day.
Finland remains the host country of the event.
Kauhajoki-lehti: Chancellor of Justice for the establishment of a Disastrous reception centre
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are in collaboration with the establishment of the Refugee reception centre in the premises currently owned by LSK Business Park Ltd.
According to the complaint, the region still has a critical crisis-time infrastructure, which is used by the defence forces and its partner, namely the Finnish Special Networks Ltd.
The Kauhajoki magazine says that the private person believes that the establishment of the reception centre in the same building would constitute a significant risk of safety which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the Defence Forces may have interest in the area and airport of the former Aviation School, which is not also affected by the study when preparing the reception centre, written the paper.
The case states that, for the last two years, negotiations have been on the organisation of flight training and on the outcome of a possible foreign operator at the airport.
This has been discussed, among other things, with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (ps.) and Head of State of the Ministry of Defence Arto Rädy.
A private person notes to the Ombudsman that the complaint is not a question of the principle of objection of the reception centre, but of the fact that the planned place in the former armed area is wrong.
The horror city government dealt with the reception centre issue last Monday.
Niche: the situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
The government means that there are the necessary conditions for immigrants and those here, Niecstö commented to journalists in the evening after meeting the chairmans of all parliamentary parties in his office in Mäntyniemi.
According to the President, the concern for the management of the refugee situation was combined with all participants.
He considers it valuable for the government and opposition parties in Finland to be able to discuss the fundamental issues confidentially.
Especially in these times when we face major challenges
According to Nizza, the situation in Syria and the activities of Russia and the United States in the region may also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, in the Baltic Sea region.
Society is a hope for the development of the dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. the United States and Russia are capable, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and on the still tension of the situation in the Baltic Sea.
According to Nisture, the NATO issue was also ignored in the discussions.
The president did not take a position on the labour market situation.

Only alarm vehicles will be released to the area.
Metro and rat drivers throughout Friday's demonstration
Metro and tram drivers participate in Friday's demonstration from the morning to the end of night traffic.
The Association of Ratio and Metro staff told the STT this evening.
Most of the beginners close for two hours, including posts closed

The Early Education Agency will allow you to report further changes to the activities tomorrow.
Media Researcher: Sipe take a big risk
According to Sipila, the communication requires diverse channels, and the Prime Minister's TV and radio calls are one channel among others.
This kind of direct speech will also be needed in the future.
This is not going to be the last time, Siple said to journalists in the Parliament.
Siple has not yet wanted to assess how often the practice of the Prime Minister's television and radio calls becomes.
According to the Siple, speeches may not always be transmitted in the Yle channels.
If other channels are registered as channels, then let's see.
Now, this channel is used tonight, sire said.
According to Sipila, the Finnish economy is so severe that it requires that television and radio talks be kept to the public.
This file, which is now being discussed, is quite complex and requires a longer explanation.
That's why we ended up in this channel.
The speech will be sent at 21.05-21.20 in TV1 and Radio in Finland.
You can also look at it in Yle Arena.
Squirrel's taking a big risk
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä’s television talk is not about the more general government turns in.
Is it an attempt to take the right of a public debate more strictly into its own hands and to refuse a public debate on questions? is it considered by Professor Anu Koivunen of the University of Stockholm.
It reminds me of the recent comment by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Timo) Soin that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to define himself.
In the name of a democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these things do not relate to each other.
The man understands that commercial media is upset about the announcement of Sipilä.
It would be strange if the media field didn't react.
The communication styles of political decision-makers are not communication issues in democracy.
Definitely it is for media representatives to endeavour to avoid being taken by politicians.
According to Koivus, TV talk is a big risk for Sparky.
In his speech, Sipeh should bring something new and special into the table so that the exceptionally high expectations for the speech are fulfilled.
Is there more to offer today what we have already heard?
Or is he able to speak in a different way, differently, or differently, or say something new?
The manor says that if there is only more old, we need to wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it an extraordinary time.
In this sense, it is the case that it is not a particular situation, it is a routine speech among others.
The risk is that Yle is stamped as a messenger of politicians or parliaments and governments, which is certainly not in line with the interests of Yle or the general line.
A squirrel bet from the squirrel
In the forthcoming speech of Sipila, it is also important that what the Prime Minister fails to say, the media researcher stresses.
Tonight, we need to look carefully at where Siply missing and where not, says research coordinator at Jyväskylä University, Heikki Kuutti.
The cube says the TV is a clever bet from Siple, because this makes it so that it can bring its own view out without the sora noise.
In this way, the public will receive a message without a journalist filter, unlike the information conference where suppliers can ask critical questions.
The shrimp passes the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, it is a risk that the media interprets something wrong about the speech, because the precise questions are not allowed to be raised.
The cube says it's very important how Siple plays on TV, the sweat, the shaking hands.
He compares Siply to a father who now tells the people what to do.
If Sparky knows how to play it well, it can work.
The situation is different from that if the government were to inform about something, because this person here seems to be speaking directly to another person.
This (United States President Barack) Obama and partners are regularly engaged.
It's really extraordinary.
Political researcher Erkka Railo considers the speech of the Prime Minister to be very exceptional to the citizens.
He said there has been no such thing that has been happening in decades that the Prime Minister speaks directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires extraordinary means, Railo says.
The investigator believes that the Prime Minister would like to congratulate Finns on the extortions ahead.
On Friday, wagers' organisations organise demonstration and strikes against government action.
In Twitter, the President of the Left League, Paavo Arhinmäki says that Sipilä could speak about the state of the nation in the Parliament as a statement by the Prime Minister, which would also allow us to discuss the speech.
The President of the SDP, Antti Rinne (sd.), once again, announces its challenge for the Sipila dialogue.
We don't have time for monologs.
It's almost six months from the elections.
You can't hide forever, Rinne writes on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy on a runaway has been found in Tampere
At the time the boy was found, he was fine.
The boy's father updated his Facebook page.
The Internal Finland Police Department will also confirm this for the evening.
The boy left to play out at four o'clock this afternoon.
Later in the evening, he was no longer contacted.
My father thanks everyone who helped me look for him.
Thank you for the ten contacts and observations during these hours.
Update was distributed closer to 15,000 times that is an incredible balance in such short time
The Finnish UFC star was disappointed in the violent wildness of young people: You can cause anger
A Kurditaist free fighter Makwan Amirkhani published a video on Facebook, in particular inviting immigrants to young people.
Makwan Amirkhani gave a heavy speech against the street fights of young people.
Amirkhani, born in Iran, and arrived in Finland with his family at five years of age, has so far won both their professional fight in the most respected UFC series.
Amirkhani says she got a message that asked me to look at one of the Instagram accounts.
Videos have been downloaded on the account where young people fight with extreme violence.
Amircani says he's disappointed in the wilderness of young people.
26-year-old Amirkhan has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
Guys kick the rest of the country, sit on the other side and beat the eyeless eyelessly without thinking of any of these consequences that this will result when you do these videos, Amircani updates.
It's hard to defend anymore
Some of the young people displayed on videos are immigrant backgrounds.
According to the Helsinki Police Officer Jarmo Heinosen, both immigrants and Finnish young people have downloaded fight videos to social media.
That's exactly what you're fighting at the top of the street.
You make the life of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, Turku Amircani reminds me.
Amirkhani reminds us that there are websites in Finland looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become very brutal.
It's a little hard, boys, to defend you anymore.
You should remember that you're still in a foreign country and you're going to be quite long guests here.
That's a different way to thank you for being here, Amircani says.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever get targeted by someone's racism, you'll be charged with it.
Now, think a few times before you go with me, guys.
Amirkhani says that violent action is a contribution to racism.
You'll make me feel anger that I don't like myself.
You've got things going pretty bad anyway, and you won't cure them at all, Amircani decides.
SAK puts its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
On Twitter, the President of the SAK, Lauri Lyly, says that the recipient organization will consider its position on Monday on the alternative list of savings from the STTK.
Lauri Lyly commented on the STTK's proposal on Twitter.
The STTK previously informed the government of its own proposal to achieve the 5% productivity cut required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (keski) on Wednesday.
Sture Fjäder, the President of the Programme, believes that the Government will accept the proposal if the SAK, the STTK and the Opening Plan are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require the largest payee organisation to soften its previous position.
The SAK President, Lauri Lyly, on the other hand, commented in a few words on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will deal with it on Monday.
According to Lyly, the SAK is looking for solutions to "open the labour market lock" and that agreements on the position of forced laws are required by active parties.
Lyly recalls that the Prime Minister Sipilä's Government's proposal for a social agreement did not qualify for the SAK.
In the past, Siple broke the negotiation of the social agreement when the SAK refused to commit to the objective of the 5% productivity slot.
Comment: The big-minded imagination threatens to shrink, "I know it feels a little funny to puke a fist."
It feels a little funny to put a fist in the pocket if there's already a reconciliation paper, writing Pekka Tiinane.
The tunnels vary in the payer camps.
Are you supposed to call the government for refusal, or do you want to agree with it?
On Monday, the SAK federal leaders gave up sacred hatred against the Government of the Republic.
The whole of Finland was threatened to get caught.
The threat spread to the charms, too.
The OAJ threatened to close schools and daycare homes.
On Tuesday, the OAJ canceled: no schools or daycares are completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd), Chairman of the STTK Staff Organisation, took part in a conciliation.
He said he kept in touch with the government and was preparing an alternative presentation required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (kesk) as a 5% productivity scene.
Mr Sture Fjäder (kok), the President of the Programme, quickly reported that his reconciliation paper was already ready.
At first, the SAK office didn't come up with any rifles.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is difficult to agree when the federal leaders just told the country to stand on Friday.
However, at the end of the day, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau would meet next Monday to deal with the situation and that the SAK would seek solutions to "open the labour market lock".
In order to bring about a joint proposal by the employees, the SAK should tend to accept a 5 % productivity gap as a target.
No wonder the STTK of Palolan has relations with the Sipilan Government.
The right hand of the fire, Jukka Ihanus, Head of the STTK Social Contributor, was formerly the special support of Central Prime Ministers Matti Vanhasen and Mari Kivinieme.
The fire described the fact that the government's ay-skills have been improved all the time.
It happened or not, but the exit of the fire took a bit off the Finnish standers, whose bowling picture is made up by Marko Piirainen of the ACP (sd).
It feels a little funny to wear a fist if you already have a reconciliation paper in your pocket.
Modified at 18:00: Added information about Lyly's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: "This must not happen again"
The Russian Duma President, Sergei Naryshkin, criticised the OSCE meeting in Helsinki.
The Russian Duma President, Sergei Naryshkin, believes that Mongolia is a better OSCE host than Finland.
At the capital of Mongolia, Ulan Bator, the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has begun to hold a hearing in which Naryshkin gave extensive comments on the July Helsinki celebration meeting.
At that time Finland did not allow the presence of Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, who were forced to force the European Union, to come to the meeting - a matter from which the President held a reminder of journalists.
We estimate that it was against the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, Naryshkin stressed the news office according to Interfax.
In addition to Finland and the EU, Naryshkin's criticism was addressed to the United States, where its access was also blocked.
Sanctions are political suicide from the EU, declared by Naryshk.
To Mongolia, the Russian delegation was able to become complicated, so Naryshkin continued to spy on Finland by praising and congratulating Mongolia for the "parallel organization".
I am sure that the Parliamentary General Assembly will proceed with constructive and positive results - unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that there are no obstacles to parliamentary dialogues.
Naryshkin has met Ulan Bator, the Ilkka Kanerva (kok), who has already been discussing the Russian delegation, according to the Russian media.
The lock meets the real playoff troll: "You paint tight."
Killpara and Lukko will continue the bull days in the Hakamets today when both of them are on fire on the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti anticipated that today in the Hakamets there is no real goal party.
Last night, the killer went to Kuopia to scratch the 3-2 continuation wins from Kalpa.
The rise was male because the last season's silver group was the worst of the two goals of the defeat position.
Tuesday, the lock was more brilliant.
As a guest of Blues, the Rauma people's catch was round zero points, and the loss figures were also 2-3.
Hard game, paints tight, if any of you play the same game as last year, Lukko winner Janne Lahti anticipated positions on the company's pages.
The killer has become quite a playoff nightmare for the Rabbits.
In fact, during the two previous periods, the killer has just dropped out of the lock's final series.
Both layers require a decisive seventh fight.
During the last season, the Lock took the show off in the fourth game, but Tappara rose to the next three sides and ends.
There are no major changes in group compositions except for goalkeepers.
The cats who rejected both yesterday will have a slide shift today.
With the goal of the killing, Mika Noronen will make room for Tomi Karhuse, and between the Lukko dolls, Rasmus Rinne will replace Ryan Zapolski.
View angle: In the Ace, there's a terrible play going on
Athletic director Hopela handwritten a non-compliant follow-up to the main coach of Rautakallio, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976 Sylvester Stallone handwritten a Rocky movie where he himself played the main part.
The subconsistent put the campus on the world champion Apollo Creed, in a sensational way.
Rocky got a lot of sympathy, even though he finally lost the title fight.
Thirty years after Rocky's first night, Mika Hopela manuscripted the unrested Tuhkimo story in Pori.
Anonymous and wood-handed batteries came to the surprise of all SM finals in 2006.
The team was full of people like Rocky's anonymous, but struggling counterparts.
There was white Indian, Porin Matt and Pele Pelto.
In the fall game, players colored their heads red and cut the irocesis.
Hope became a blonde.
A great TV speaker, JP Jalo, called the coach Neumann.
The ace took the winning silver.
Hope was one of the heroes.
The manuscript Hopela believes that this season's news works work in the same way as ten years ago.
A man working as a sports director has built a pasture for the evil boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been smashing guys in a hole like Rocky pig carcass at the slaughterhouse.
The merits of Masi Marjamäen, Mikko Viitasen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparise are in some other than a biological game.
Hope has forgotten that in Rocky VI, the main part of the Pekka Rautatallio plays.
Karri Kivi has crossed the Rautamalky Sean Connery.
Rautatalio is as clumsy as Connery would have been in the 1976 premiere of Hopela.
There's nothing more than Rocky's nickname in the Iron Rocky Rocky.
The game philosophy of Rautatallion does not include assaulting and sneaking.
He appreciates a hard game, but it's different from playing hard than a pig.
In the last season, the Essien Garret Stafford took a Tapparan Jere Karjala to the head.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but Rautatallio put a man in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We're the only ones who deserve to play.
I don't accept a game like that, and it's not part of the ace hockey, and Rautatallio went hot after the game to the people of Satakunta.
This season of the mothers' team has been oddly built.
There are trains, veterans, cops and squanders.
There are virtually no key men in the best game age.
No wonder the chief coach has complained about the lack of skill.
How much have you been able to influence the players' procurement, Pekka Rautatallio?
The events of the last season affect the acquisitions and unfortunately the situation on the market was quite limited, and Rataclio responded diplomaticly.
You can't go under the surface.
The yearly model 1953 Rautatalio is known to be interested in moving to Hopela's place as a sports bomb.
Men's contracts end in the spring.
In the three leagues of the season, the balance of the males is equal to the number of losses on the goal difference 1-6.
I don't think I should have handwritten a part of the future.
Olga Temonen plays the mother of Sipe Santa
Olga Temonen reveals that if he had met his husband Tuuka as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen plays for the first time in the direction of his husband.
Yeah, I'm playing my husband's friend's mother in the movie.
In a way, it feels crazy, an actor, and the producer Olga Temonen laughs.
He has been married to Assistant's ex-basist and director Tuukka Temose since 2008.
The couple has worked a lot together before, but this is the first time Olga plays in Tuuka's direction.
The role of Olga in the early years of Assistant You made us a beautiful film is a drummer Sipe Santapuk's mother, Sirkka.
Circuits and supports his son, even though this father of Risto (to be presented by Lorenz Backmann) is trying to be a sound of sense.
The more I have come to know my true example of Sirka, the easier it seems to be.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuuka for trusting me in the role.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but then the two have become a great deal of convergence.
They've met, spoken on the phone and communicated.
The circus has helped so much.
We've been through a lot of different corners of their history.
It is also a good thing to understand that the drama is a drama and the truth may have to be a little coloured.
Olga stresses that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Assistant would become the largest band in Finland.
In the '90s, it was lame, and it was really rude.
There was quite a small probability that someone actually succeeded, but Sirka had some kind of intuition, and he was right.
Olga tells me that he had heard from Tuuka a lot about this youth before the movie plans.
However, parents' stories have been a little different sometimes.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how many parents really know what you're doing.
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different than the ill - famous Tuuka of Heinola.
Olga was an ark and a nice girl who had nothing to do with the movie Tuuka.
At the highest level, he could have been secretly in love.
According to Olga, he has worked so much with Tuuka over the past 10 years that the big joint project does not scare.
Everything's always been super good.
Now the whole production group will go to Heinola for a month.
Of course, a couple in Iiti is often planning to drive home for their young children, because the distance is not too long.
We'll take over the whole Heinola month.
They have received us very warmly, asking only what streets and when to be empty.
Iron Sky 2 became the most expensive play movie in Finland
Timo Vuorensola's Iron Sky: The Coming Race budget is EUR 17 million.
The descriptions begin in October in Belgium.
The director Timo Vuorensola starts filming the Iron Sky 2 film in Belgium in October.
The Scifi movie, Iron Sky, The Coming Race, will become the most expensive play movie in Finland in its budget of EUR 17 million.
In the past, the title of the most expensive film in Finland has been on the Big Game of Jalmari Helander.
The Angry Birds animated in progress will also rise after the completion of the Iron Sky 2, as the budget for the film is over EUR 100 million.
The film from Timo Vuorensola and Tero Kaukoma will begin in October near the AED Studios facilities near Antwerp and last for eight weeks.
The director Timo Vuorensola goes to Belgium for the next week.
The garbage budget isn't scaring.
I've been so sick and relaxed!
I have such a relaxed script because I know exactly what a movie should be like.
Everyone in the working group seems to realize that we're doing something unprecedented.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though time is tight, there's no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to show this movie to the audience, she's gonna tell the evening.
The original budget for the film was designed to be 8-10 million, but the budget also increased as the manuscript was developed.
The budget is big, but there's a big stoor.
However, 100 million would be involved in the film because each angle and efficiency are so expensive.
Now it's all so tight that there's no loose.
The film production company Iron Sky Universe launched today on Wednesday a mass funding campaign and a bond of 4-8% annual interest.
The final interest rate will be determined by demand and supply during the campaign.
At the latest two years, the company will repay the loan.
In the action film, Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov are acting.
What's the matter with you? A giant or cool?
Big logos return to shirts
Trendsettes' breasts have recently decorated large logos.
A while ago, a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and large logos like Crocs in the console.
The commercialisation of a hood or a t-shirt was somewhat seen as a jerk.
It's time changing.
Sports has become a real fashion megatrend, and so are old, familiar sports fashion characters such as Adidas and Nike have risen to the wavehard of coolness.
And as often before, the silly and trendy boundaries are creepy: if something is already a jerk, it starts to become ironic and cool.
First came a standard core trend, i.e. a tavis fashion, where trendizers surprised by favouring as boring basic clothes as possible as a way to separate themselves from the mass.
Now, instead of a grey basic college, it's already buried on the bottom of the closet with the manufacturer's logo.
The bigger and the more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logs, for example, the tracks identified by Adidas, the favorite team's shirts and the New York Yankees tickets have made a return to the street fashion.
The bottom of the jeans begins to mock the Calvin Klein logos are now a cool detail.
Trendi seems to be moving into sports tires, too, to the luxury brands.
For example, the breast of Versace's systeria makes it clear what a sign of clothing is.
Would you be ready to introduce logos in your dress?
The Russian policeman published evidence: I didn't get into the tunnels of the tank!
According to the claims, a special incident would have taken place in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo 2015.
In recent days, the Russian media has spread colorful claims that the Ministry of Emergency had to remove large sizes of Zotovia from the tank lock for five hours.
Zotov has been doing everything he can to deny the information.
He even published a picture on his own public Facebook page, where he seems to squeeze the armored vehicle in a very good mood, and, on the basis of these images, it is not about catching or madness.
That's bullshit.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go into the battle tank, but it was a collision tank BMP-3.
I'm an ex-military, Colonel, I've served at Ural.
I went in there, looked around me, and I came out in peace, Zotov said Comosomolskaya to Pravda.
I didn't get stuck and I certainly didn't spend five hours in that position, he said.
On the Russian military TV channel, Zotov explained his enthusiasm to the exhibition of a new Russian technology because he himself is a former professional soldier.
That's why I was curious about what's inside the wagons, and I excited our techniques.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And in the next exhibition, I will definitely visit all the tanks and all the collision tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the writer's reporter a fool.
One stupid man wrote it, and everyone else repeated it.
There wasn't anything like that.
I went in, and I came out.
I'm long and rotting, but nothing like I'm stuck in a tank somewhere, didn't happen, he said to Russkaja sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotovi's words are supported by the fact that no photograph of the alleged congestion has been published, even though over a few days there were 50,000 people in the arms exhibition.
The claim of Zotovi's stuck-up started on the Bloknot.ru site, where Zotovin was told about his rims out of the tank bone and threatened to finally shoot everyone around, unless he gets out of the surface.
Later, the Bloknot site published a follow-up story where the exhibition organisers reported their views on what happened.
Everyone's just used to the fact that soldiers jump quickly out of armed vehicles.
But the representative Zotov, due to his great size, simply delayed when he came out.
But in no name he was sitting there for five hours, said the exhibition coordinator Aleksandr Pisarevski Bloknot.
Here's the decoration bloggars' favourite object.

There has been a leak at the Kittilän mine of Agnico Eagle Finland, the Canadian mining company.
The purified process water of the gold mine has leaked from the so-called enrichment sand to its stream.
According to the company, measures to correct the bleeding have been initiated.
The pool has neutralised enrichment sand and purified process water.
Usually, the water is pumped either again as process water or transferred to the environment through the surface area, as authorised.
The bleeding was estimated to be about 300 cubic metres per hour when it was observed.
According to the company, the quality of the flood water complies with the current permit conditions.
That's all the material went into the environment.
The bleeding was observed on the inspection round Monday morning.
The leak has not been shown to cause structural damage to the underground retention structures.
The company reports that it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent workers.
Dansken Kuopamäki: IMF warns you not to cut too much
The Finnish country report published by the International Monetary Fund today follows largely the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organization embedded in structural reforms covering Finland in order to overcome economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime allowances and paid holidays would support Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the whole contract system and unemployment security.
According to Mr Pasi Kuopamäe, the main economic owner of Danske Bank agrees with the structural reforms, but there are also small differences.
The IMF estimates a great deal of communication to the government's activities, but on the other hand, there are also the words of the warning that should not be cut too much.
These include infrastructure investments, Kuopamäki says to the Economic Reports.
The IMF also believes that growth projects should be implemented in the fastest possible timeframe to support weak economic growth.
The IMF expects Finland to grow by 0.4% for this year, which will rise to 0.9% next year.
Danske expects this year to be zero in its new projection of economic growth.
The IMF is a little more optimistic this year.
They may have had the most recent observations on the ground.
During this morning, Statistics Finland reported that the total production was in small growth in the summer, Kuopamäki notes.
The weakened trust in industry or other so-called softer meters could have been given less attention.
However, there is only a few decimals.
Nintendo, who recovered from death, appointed a new leader.
In July, Satoru Iwata, who died of cancer, started work on Wednesday, Nintendo told me on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and he was popular and charistant face in the game sector.
Iwata, for example, responded to the successful Wii-Consoli reunion.
The choice of a 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names raised as potential followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to monitor Iwata's footprints, assessing Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
The task of Kimishima is to see Nintendo being strongly involved in mobile games, but so that it does not eat the company’s bread on the side of traditional game consoles.
More and more minor asylum seekers arrive alone in Finland
In February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Agency acknowledged that even hundreds of children who have arrived in the country will disappear annually.
According to the Swedish Immigration Agency, the SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter have reported a number of minor applicants disappear annually.
Juha Kannelmaa, the Immigration Office superinspector, tells us what the situation in Finland is and how it has changed.
Is there the same situation in Finland?
How much of the applicants disappear in a year?- A total of 156 applications for asylum received alone were made in Finland in 2013.
They're missing nine.
In 2014, the corresponding applications were made 196 and they disappeared 11, Kannelmaa says.
The fact that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may have been found to be full-aged there may be the background of the disappearance.
In this case, the applicant may be more attractive to disappear than to continue processing the matter in Finland and to be returned to the country responsible for processing the application.
Similarly, some of the missing people will be found later when they apply for asylum in another Member State.
In 2014 there were 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of which 134 applications were withdrawn because the applicant had probably moved away from Finland, so adult asylum seekers disappeared over the last 123 years, he says.
Is there a growth rate?
By 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 requests for asylum for a minor who has become alone.
There is no total statistics for missing minor asylum seekers this year, but the number of minor applicants is therefore known and has increased clearly, which is likely to affect the number of missing people.
What happens to those who have received a reverse decision?
They also disappear, for example, to the "sötét labour market"?
This is difficult to assess from the Immigration Agency, as the police responsible for implementing the reverse decisions, Kannelmaa emphasises.
Petteri Orpo (kok) Minister for the Interior has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered seekers.
He has taken action on the matter.
At the EU Interior Ministerial Conference on Refugees, Orpo reported on Monday practical measures to manage the flow of asylum seekers via Sweden to Northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A.'s studio online, see the pictures of the devices.
Because of disease attacks, Timo T.A. Mikkose's equipment for TV and radio production has now been sold.
Mikkosen's spouse, Nina Mikkonen, sells Huuto.net equipment that were the most advanced professional equipment in its field.
The Internet announcement was the first to tell me the website of Iltamacasin.
Today, most of the devices have remained in the footsteps of technological development.
In the digital media world, television programs are no longer embossed on Betacam tapes.
Nina Mikkonen is still confident that interested ones are found.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date in that way, but they are also needed as long as there is an old generation of material that needs to be digitalised.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of enthusiasms - collectors and builders of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen is thinking about IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkoset is trying to move away from the current Storm House.
We can't take all the supplies with us.
I've been beginning to invent and see where the goods are abandoned.
This is where I started, Nina Mikkonen says.
There is no use for television and radio equipment anymore.
It is clear that a long-term man will not return to his work.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now only goods and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkosen's real life work was archived in summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to pick up films and other materials from Storm.
Traffic threatens to break up worse than thought: Metro and trams can stop all Friday
Metro and tram drivers today decide whether to expand their forces in connection with Friday's demonstration.
The original plan was to stop metro and tram traffic only during the demonstration on Friday.
During the afternoon, it will determine if the traffic stops all day.
Chief Confidential Pekka Hirvonen says the threat is large on the field.
Night and shift cuts are badly stirred by drivers, so the government's plans to cut the allowances are annoying resistance.
Hirvonen wonders, however, that stopping traffic all day is a dilemma.
If the metro and tram wagons stand by Friday, public transport in the capital area is virtually almost completely stopped.
According to the VR, trains do not travel between 6:00 and 6:00 a.m. on Friday.
Fridays aren't moving in close or remote.
The trains that left before 6 a.m. will be driven to destinations.
According to the HSL data, most of the buses are left on the curtain.
ACP members will be gone from work on Friday morning to Saturday morning at 3:00.
It is likely that a small number of buses can be driven, driven by the supervisor, Pirkko Repo, the HSL reporter.
Repo says HSL can't say exactly what bus shifts are going on Friday.
The wagers' organizations organise a major demonstration at the Helsinki Railway Market on Friday from 11 to 13 a.m.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tears against refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place at the border of Hungary and Serbia, where many refugees are trying to move forward to Europe, reports the news office AP.
According to Sky News, the refugees have tried to break through the border fence.
The refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in panic.
According to local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water pumps against people.
The Muslim boy was arrested at school in Texas, the teacher thought it was a bomb.
In Texas, in the United States, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested after the teacher considered his own watch as a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News he only wanted to introduce himself to the output of his electronics.
But one of the teachers thought the watch was like a bomb.
The police were called, and the situation ended in the end of the boy's handcuffs being taken to the juvenile arrest cell.
Mohamed has not been found at any point to claim anything but that he had made the watch.
Still, it's still possible that the boy is accused of making a false bomb.
According to Mohamed, the police had said the watch looked like a movie bomb.
The clock is in custody of the police, but it was made up of a circuit board and a digital display that had leads between them.
The case occurred last Monday, and Mohamedia was punished for three days of forced leave from school.
His father is angry about the case, and the American-Islamic Council in the country wonders whether the case is another sign of Islamophobia in the United States.
British Head of Labour refused to sing a national song
The song asks God to protect the queen, but Corby is the opponent of the monarchy.
Corbyn’s own Labour Party representatives have also joined the criticism of the press which is a great deal of justice.
This has insulted the people, thought that the workman was a representative of Kate Green's broadcaster in the BBC radio interview.
Green thinks Corbyn should have joined the song.
Last night the Memorial respected the fight against Luftwaffe, Germany, the British Air Force pilots, in 1940.
The Labour Party defends Corbyn in its official opinion and stresses his respect for the pilots by taking part in the event.
We are all in a tremendous debt of gratitude for the heroism of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood respectfully silent during the national song, highlighted in the opinion.
Corbyn's choice to be a party leader has divided the labour lines.
In particular, there are those who fear he will expel moderate voters with their radical views.
Corby is in favour of unilateral disarmament, ending savings and increasing public expenditure.
Corbyn is to be present today for the first time in the House as a party president at the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corby has asked the public for proposals on what we should ask Prime Minister David Cameron.
Cameron was hanging on Twitter on weekends to choose Corbyn as a party leader.
The Labour Party threatens our national security, economic security and the security of our families, the Prime Minister referred to it on his own account.
The cause of Minnesota's family death is still unclear - the father of the family was waiting for a trial.
South Lake Minnetonka police have been investigating the family death of Minnesota Greenwood for a week.
The five-family family was found dead in their homes on September 10, and a few days later, the police confirmed that the shooter was the father of the family Brian Scott Short, 45.
After shooting at the shotgun, his wife and three children, Brian Short killed himself in the garage.
Days already dead
The family was found after the school was concerned about the absence of children.
According to this report, the police went to the house for inspections and found a huge house on all sides of Short's family dead.
According to StarTribune, it's possible that the victims had been dead for days.
Million House and a successful company
The investigation of the South Lake Minnetonka police chief Michael Sitar case is still underway.
The motive for blood works is still unclear.
The shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his property for nurses on the social media site of AllNurses.com.
In 2014, the StarTribune interview Short reported that there were four million visitors on the site every week.
I've been offered 50 purchases in the last ten years.
I've abandoned them all.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
The success was seen, among other things, by buying the Short family from Greenwood in 2011 for two million dollars.
The property is advertised as a dream of a car collector in Zillow: there are not only 12 rooms in the house, but also eight car garages.
We're on trial.
According to StarTribune, however, the father of the family was waiting for a case.
Achieve Test Prep had challenged him for comments on the AllNurses.com website.
According to Achieve Test Prepin, the short site had not been deleted from the preppari courses, and they had therefore lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the trial had had a significant impact on Short business.
Vesku Loiri offered cake.
In addition, the owner-third was rewarded at the restaurant event with the monthly horse owner of Hippos in Finland.
It's great, Loiri commented on his charming table.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned EUR 100 000.
The artist legend Loiri was still confused about Fabrice Duo's success in the great competition.
I still don't think it has happened.
According to Loir, the coach of the successshevose will be able to work with the horse for full work.
Pekka decides where the horse is taken to compete.
And I'm gonna shut up, Loiri crawled.
"The greatest athlete of all time."
Montreal Canadiens' superstar P. K. Subban has given 10 million dollars (approximately EUR 6.7 million) to the hospital of the children of Montreal.
According to the medical report, this is the single donation made by the largest athlete in all the time in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban has committed itself to assist the hospital in another fund collection for the next seven years.
Subban made an agreement with Canadiens a year ago worth eight years and 72 million dollars.
Subban’s contribution is therefore significantly higher than his nine million dollars’ annual contribution.
For the award of his donation, Subban will receive a subway space carrying his name from the hospital.
The players in the Canadiens have used to help local hospitals considerably.
A year ago, long-term Captain Jean Beliveau gathered millions of dollars, including the same child hospital, and Saku Koivu collected a huge amount of money for another city's large hospital to get to the hospital a PET scanner for cancer studies.
You can order a wife from the Japanese cafe for tonight, serves the food with only bikini and a bikini on your head.
The thematic cafes are a tough thing in Japan.
There's already a goat cafe, a chicken cafe, a vampire cafe, a halikahvila, and now a wife cafe.
It hits lonely, social and hunger.
Metro's on the news.
From the Tokyo Ore no Yome coffee store (in my wife), you can order yourself a wife or a husband for the evening.
It's a waiter who pretends to be a client's spouse.

It will soon be 150 million vehicles connected to the network: Attacks against the security of cars started to be equipped
In addition, the Board of Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) supports technological developments and innovations in the sector, reports the Intel publication.
The panel is composed of top security experts from all over the world.
ASRB researchers will carry out continuous safety tests and inspections aimed at standardising best practices and design recommendations for advanced cyber safety solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel published the first version of best practices for cybersecurity.
The company will continue to update the report on the basis of ASRB's research results.
The International ICT Research and Consultation Company Gartner estimates that by 2020 some 150 million vehicles in transport have been connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share online data.
We can and must improve the cyber security of cars, Chris Young says.
ASRB allows Intel to establish the best safety practices and support the view that cyber safety is an important ingredient in each network-connected car design.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB Board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovatives in the processing of data.
Ford Focus RS will pay about EUR 52 000 in Finland!
Fordin Focus RS has been expected for years as the six rises.
Finally, the car begins to be in the perspective of Finland.
Ford released RS data now that the car world's eyes are in Frankfurt's car show.
Ford's new four-wheel RS is accelerated by its 350-wheel engine, which has 2,3 litres, and has a peak speed of 4.7 seconds to 100 and 266 kilometres per hour.
The price is also interesting in Finnish, and it is reported to be EUR 52 000.
The car is already available, although when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford will not tell you when it comes to Finland.
The favourite brand Kia presented two news in the Frankfurt car exhibition - such as the new Sportage and Optima
The new fourth-generation Sportage, where Kia intends to capture the ever-growing streetstorm market, is certainly more important than two in Finland.
The new European design director, created by Gregory Guillaume, is more rounded up than before.
There's another cent in the axle range and outskirts here, and the car is more efficient than the air.
The engine selection is mainly unchanged, but 1,6 litre turbo with 177 horsepower.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption are reported closer to sales.
We're gonna have to wait a little longer, because we're gonna have a new Sportage in the spring of 2016.
Even before the change of the year, the new Kia Optims got to our country.
Quickly, the news doesn't seem to change, but it's a new car.
Kia intends to conquer the hearts of higher middle-class buyers with better driving properties, lower noise levels and higher-level equipment.
Optims with 1,7 litres turbodiesel and 2,0 litres petrol engines are provided at the start.
Next summer, the pace accelerates when the Optima GT with a 2,0 litre turbo engine comes along.
At the same time, with that income, the sale of the Optima farmer begins.
Chisu returned to the stages... blew up in a brave shaft.
The singer Chisu is involved in the Life for the child concert with other domestic stars.
The electrical blue pants have a visible, open neck hole.
The apartment is beautifully presenting the singer's sleeve of the siro.
The total crown is golden metal belt and red lipstick.
During the three-year break, the mother-in-law singer has been cured by mild exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter will soon be a year.
The singer published his first single on a new album in August.
Back to the stage, and getting ahead of the general public after a long break, I'm not really excited.
I've missed everything to do with music, the singer tells me.
Chisu will publish in a few weeks a new album called Polaris.
The new situation in life has inspired us to make new songs.
At this point, I'm wondering if people find my new album, Chisu wonders.
Kim Kardashian's maternity style is resentful.
The true TV beauty of Kim Kardashian is giving the subject to each other.
He presents his pregnancy swabs and chest equipment with sexy clothes, last night at a time in America, when he left his sister's Kourtney Kardashian's husband Kanye West's job.
The black maternity dress is transparent at the breasts.
It reveals the skin-colored breasts under the lightning dress of lightning lights.
Last time Kardashian dressed for an amateur motherhood, she visited her friend at a dinner party in New York just a few days ago.
The black boots of the knees highlighted the point.
The third special maternity suit is as fresh as last week’s Friday, when she had pregnancy waxes at the show.
The hard laws of the model world: No home, you're lonely, competition is terrible
Manon Leloup wanted to understand that the model world would be a pure glamour and champagne party.
He made his own documentary, Speaking Dolls, where Leloup and his colleagues speak clean about the model business.
The Harpeer's Bazaar magazine assembled six hard truths from behind the scenes.
Every season starts with nothing.
Even if during the previous period you would have pose in top designers' suits, the new season will start again with castings.
And every season there will be new, fresh faces that compete with the cons.
The models rarely have a place they can call home.
The work is continuous travel and can take a year so that the accommodation is a hotel room or apartment where fashion houses accommodate their models.
If you are very young and you can't travel with your mother, loneliness can be unbearable.
New York and Paris are the most stressful jobs they want, but they are the most stressful.
There's not just one kind of weight.
Agent New York might ask to drop pounds, but in Paris, they say you're too thin.
Getting a job is a risk game all the time.
The designs and designers are all the time together and operate as a support network.
When the fashion sticks run out, the difference is shaky.
The models want to be in this sector because of the opportunities it offers, but the fact that everyone thinks the work is just a presentation of clothes.
The models want to be their own people, too.
The work makes the models feel like they're actors with some role.
But in the work of the model, you can also express yourself.
You're modeling last night in the Tory Burch show.
In New York, we are currently having fashion weeks where designers will reveal their models next year.
Roope Salminen, who changed his style, presents the most unknown Assistant Musician in the movie
In a film based on the early years of the Assistant Association, Roope Salminen presents the founding member of the band, Antti Lautala.
The Lautala founded Assistant with Toni Wirtase in 1991, but separated from the band in 1994.
It's a pretty big challenge for me, because I'm a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this movie I play a 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen laughs.
I've never wanted to meet the real Ant before the descriptions, because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly unknown to the people of that group, so I think it's good to learn his playstyle from the video only.
I don't want to make an admiration about a person.
The man who created the Roope Salminen and the dogs doesn't go into the role.
The Punk-Mans come with the man in nature.
The stars, the stars, in the punk episode, surely many saw the premaits, as well as if they've ever been to our jobs.
Our performance has never been anything small, but we always go full.
Assistant in 1993-2004, Tuukka Temosen directed by the Basso, you made us the main actors of a beautiful film were published today.
The nuclear force that became known to the band's audience will be presented to the public by young actresses, who are not yet quite familiar.
Rumpali Sipe Santapukki presents Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirtasta Tatu Blueisalo Base Tuukka of Temo Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen told me about his future pestilence last night, when he mysteriously prepared for the most important day of his career in Snapchat.
The Roope has already published a picture of his new look in Instagram yesterday, which he had to perform for the film.
The Roope, seen earlier in the flies and jaws, has been driving his face into siloposch, and dyeing his brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: This is how you tell children about refugees
Many parents have in recent days had to consider how to inform the child of the situation of refugees seeking Europe.
Or should I tell you anything about it?
We do not need to talk about this by force, a member of the SPR crisis group, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff.
It is worth protecting smaller children, for example, not allowing them to watch the news alone.
Small children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can stay in mind and be distressed, he says.
However, if a child has encountered television news photographs of refugees or has heard about it elsewhere, it is worth talking.
It is good to attend the debate on the basis of the child and to listen carefully to what he asks.
The fears of the child may be surprising.
They may not be the ones he thinks he's afraid of.
You shouldn't scare a child for nothing, even if you'd be distressed and scared.
The smaller child closely monitors the conduct of his parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child will experience safety.
The older children are likely to encounter a debate on refugees at school, with friends or online.
It is good for parents to take the matter with them if the child is concerned.
The fact is, not all people in the world are doing well.
Parents, together with children, can reflect on how our family feels about this.
We still think that the world is a safe or unsafe place at the end of the day?
Parents may also have different aspects of education - some may want to protect their children from anxiety as far as possible.
On the other hand: If the family also talks about difficult matters, the child will be a model for dealing with the challenges ahead of life.
This could be useful for him in the future.
Social Psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Teaching your children to help the weaker"
My own power at the end?
You can still be a good parent to your child.
Ballosalamaa, which hits the blood, is difficult to control
In the middle of the summer, the Perttu North swept the Apila Ballosalama into the attack.
It only squeezed profits and two places until the end of July the collapse of Tampere raves.
Since the ori fled to the bottom, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered time from the veterinarian.
An explanation for the extinction survived in the spotlight.
The horse had an inflammation of the throat.
The disease wasn't the least of the head, but it took two curtains to squeeze it.
Since the Apilan Ballosalama had to be in light exercise, the North says that he was positively surprised by the last race of the horse.
It was in Turku on record time after the Taruntuule.
The Apilan Ballosalama was very stressful when it could have been driven normally only a few weeks.
Those things, with a small tendency at the end, were understandable, North says.
The coach assumes that a good competition made a blade for the slaves.
The horse must have moved forward, and I hope it would also have been settled.
Apilan Pallosalama has been so-called humor horses.
After it hasn't been fun, it could have thrown fat without any illnesses.
On the good day, the Ori have removed the lightning letter that the opponents have been wondering.
In a quick speed, competitors can't manage the Pallosalama, where even warm bloody rides are removed.
The hopes of the north have a pee run at Vermo.
However, the different thing is how Apilan Ballosalama agrees with it.
It's kind of hard at the time of departure, and it could be a little bit of a bus under the boom and that kind of thing.
I hope the slave would be more calm than leaving Turku.
Apilan Ballosalama can also come out of the bow when it's okay, and we're going to drive with it from victory, coach permit.
That's why you can't get rid of the wrong iPhone programs.
Tim Cook, Managing Director of Apple.
At least some of the programmes that come with Apple's iPhone phones may sometimes be removed in the future - but not all.
Apple will potentially remove some of its own programs from iPhone phones in the future, explains Tim Cook Buzzfeed's CEO in the interview.
Apple's iPhone contains a set of programs that are relatively rare to use: such as FaceTime calls, Lehtikioski, Health, Exchange, Podcasts and Vinkit.
The latest addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which came as an obsession with iPhone phones, although it is necessary only for the owners of Apple's smart watch.
According to Cook, the removal of Apple's programmes is more complicated than it seems.
Some applications are linked to another iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook will tell Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which apps of Apple's iPhone are working firmly together with other programs.
There are other programs that don't work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them, Cook added.
According to Cook, Apple is investigating it, since the company does not want to waste memory on the iPhone phones of the users.
Inflation of the euro area fell to 0.1 per cent in August
In August, the euro area’s consumer prices rose only scarcely, i.e. 0.1% of the year-on-year, and Eurostat reported today by the EU statistical authority.
The rise in prices was drawn down by the cheaper energy.
Eurostat thus reviewed a two-week guarantee of 0.2% of the preliminary estimate slightly downwards.
In July, the inflation rate was 0.2%.
The so-called base inflation fell to 0.9 per cent in August from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat's estimate of base inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy in the euro area was 7.2 per cent cheaper last month than one year ago.
The average inflation in the EU-wide of 28 countries was zero in August.
In July, the increase was 0.1 per cent.
The highest number of euro countries, i.e. 1.4% of consumer prices, rose in August in Malta.
In Cyprus, inflation was the lowest at 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent negative according to the harmonised EU price index.
Inflation in the euro area remains firmly distant from the European Central Bank (ECB) objective, which is a two-percent price increase in the medium term.
The ECB forecasts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area this year.
The increase will rise to 1.1% next year, the central bank will expect its new inflation forecasts in early September.
The United States Fed's next attempt to blackmail monetary policy
The next fall in the United States begins at its speed in less than one year, but more certainly within three years after the country's central bank Fed again starts to raise its interest rates for a long time.
And the downturn in the financial markets begins before the next recession.
The Fed has suggested that the interest payments should be started even this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
Thus, the next recession can be pressed on by the fastest by the next autumn and as a financial market coursery before it.
Or, at least, this will happen if the world's largest economy and financial markets work the way they've been doing, and if they react to the blackmail of Fed's money hanks as they have done before.
Such conclusions have been concluded by the German Bank of Deutsche Bank’s London Market Survey Strategies Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in their extensive long-term market and economic cycle study.
The Bank distributed a study report of over 60 pages to its international major customers last week.
The strategies drawn up by the study and the report do not believe that they know when exactly Fed will start raising its interest rates or what will happen in the economy and on the market.
Instead, by means of the cool facts and calculations of economic statistics, they present how the economy and the market have previously been acting at the time and after Fed's increases.
In addition to historical observations, they will look at what the key parameters of the economy and the financial markets are now the same or the other model as at the time of the previous increases - and what may result from it.
It is clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a more humid state to face the rise in interest rates than once before in the 1950s.
Not a year before the recession
Fed's monetary policy and its current uptake have been pointing out by the leaders of last summer and the beginning of autumn that the time to raise interest is beginning to grow.
The first interest payment for over nine years can be reached this week.
The issue will be resolved within Wednesday and Thursday, when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Board of Fed meets at its two-day meeting.
For the past time, Fed raised its so-called Fed funds’ guidance rate in June 2006.
At that time, a series of relatively regular, but at a time of two years of interest rates of a small of 0.25 percentage points ended by Fed raising its interest rates from 1.25 per cent to 5.25 per cent.
The symptom of the financial markets started in 2007 from the difficulties of the most risky housing funding in the United States, and a year later the financial crisis broke into a global nightmare.
A major recession occurred in 2009.
Last time, the serious constraints on the financial markets and the real economy began slower than since the previous Fed increases have typically occurred.
Similarly, the trials were harder and rougher than once since the laceration in the 1930s.
Deutsche's strategics have screened the rises and falls of the world's largest economies, as well as the backwards of the financial markets since 1950 and in place from the beginning of the 18th century.
Fed's interest rates and their economic and financial impacts will be explained since the 1950s.
The first interest purchase has taken less than one year, mostly less than three years, and less than three and a half years on average.
The increase in the financial market has ended within two years of the start of the Fedi increases.
Fed has in turn raised and in turn declined its guiding rate from the beginning of the 1950s to a dozen different cycles.
Each time has differed in some respects, and there are relatively few times in the review, so it is hardly possible to conclude any certain effects of the subsequent increases.
The strategies remind me that this time many things are different.
Not just better.
Rates too low for too long
Notwithstanding the crucial reasons for the financial crisis, those who are guilty may not be found undisputably even through decades of research.
But three points for the causes of the crisis and its destructive power must be somewhat undeniable:
1) In the 2000s, the Fed, the euro area ECB and the other largest central banks in the world viewed their guiding rates too low for too long.
They fixed the tech bubble tracks, and at the same time raised the following.
2) In the various parts of the finances and real economy, over the decades, the amount of debt increased even more by the overlapping of central banks as a result of monetary policy.
The biggest debt bubble of the so-called economic history was born.
3) In particular, the low-principle debt finances packed in the financial economy, most of the financial markets have spurred the largest price bubbles of the so-called economic history from shares to real estate, debt securities and commodities.
Even so, it is hard to argue that the financial market that increased to heights with more complex debt lines was rarely dangerous and unstable when Fed and other central banks last set up interest rates.
The financial structures set up in the reserve of debt instruments, notwithstanding that the valuation bubbles lasted until their time after the start of the interest payments and the cost of debt financing had risen.
The risks were realised as a financial crisis, followed by a large recession.
Larger bubble and more debt
The Deutsche Strategies do not guess what will happen next, but give the subject of nuclear activities to mention, for example, the following:
1) The Fed and other large central banks have now viewed their monetary policy more lighter than before the financial crisis.
If the interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they have now been even lower.
2) For a long time, debt has not been cheaper than it was ten years ago, but now the debt money is literally cheaper than free.
Thus, the debt load of the financial and real economy has not been lightened, but now in the various parts of the economy, the debt burden has been much heavyer than before or at any time before the financial crisis.
3) Liquidity from the central banks is mostly left on the financial market and has slowed down the key securities and assets mostly the top or ever before the financial crisis.
And not only the latical atmosphere with the warning signs of the financial market, they also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and for decades from the hardest recession to the model than it has been before.
The euro area economy has hardly recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is unusually weak, but the pressures and risks of the financial markets are equally higher than before the financial crisis, when Fed next starts to tighten its money.
Perhaps the French Bank of Societe Generale's strategy, Albert Edwards, isn't as odd as it may be.
He has for good time trained the Bank’s international investor clients for the following full translations:
First Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles go out, and soon Fedin's time to turn off the financial fires with even greater QE cash injections.
Hewlett-Packard (HP), which produces computers and printers, intends to reduce up to 33,000 jobs.
Most of the reductions relate to the corporate service party of HP, the company says.
HP is distributed in November to the Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which focuses on business sales, and the HP Inc., which focuses on pc machines and printers for consumers.
HP had the highest staff in 2011, with 350000 employees.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302000.
The company accounts for the single costs of $2.7 billion (approximately EUR 2.4 billion) of the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard from Enterprise will be reduced to 25,000-300,000 employees.
Deductions from the consumer side remain at 3300 within three years.
HP intends to transfer its activities to low cost countries so that 60% of its employees would be in low cost countries in 2018.
The company tells us that he has already balanced his business so that none of its customers will be responsible for more than 10 % of its operating profits.
In the second year, the three most significant customers brought 65 per cent of their business profits.

Yle: Minister Berner has acted in the government of the tax havens company
According to Yle, Minister of Transport and Communications, Anne Berner (central) has acted as a member of the Board of the Tax Paradise Company.
According to the above, the company’s activities were related to so-called tax planning.
This is a Luxembourg Saltri II LuxCo company, appointed by Berner as a member of the Government in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner is still officially a member of the Government.
Berner himself says he left a notice of membership in May this year.
I checked it out, and that's enough for me to leave a notice.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the registration chains take place within the agreed timetable, Berner says in Yle's interview.
Membership after fusion
Swedish Kährs ownership is managed through the Luxembourg company.
Kährs is a parket manufacturer who merged with the Finnish parket manufacturer Karelia-Upoflor in 2012.
Berner operated in Karelia-Upoflor's Government in 2010-2013 and after the merger in Kährs' Government and in Luxembourg.
According to the top, Kährs' ownership in Luxembourg is through a multi-step ownership structure.
Berner tells Yle that he received a government membership at the second largest owner of Kährs at the Luxembourg company.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I've been involved in the government of Karelia-Upofloor owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was sought with a partner found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a capital investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I realized that my own job was to take care of the benefits of the capital of the Finnish family company.
It is important that we ensure that revenues from our Finnish companies are taxed in Finland and that the starting point was secured in this context, Berner says.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital's holdings in the company are not related to tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure set up for tax havens is due to the fact that the largest owner of Kährs had a capital fund in Triton for ownership already prepared by a Luxembourg holding company.
Espoo opens the company's maintenance reception centre
In Espoon Otaniemi, the first reception centre operated by the company opens for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 inhabitants from 6:00 a.m. today.
The number of locations can increase within a week for up to 300-400 people.
The Finnish Immigration Service will establish a reception centre for the former Rescue University real estate.
The activities are maintained by Luona Oy, whose sector is particularly the production of healthcare and medical services.
The City of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy agree together on the security arrangements of the Centre.
STTK prepares an alternative work-life blackmail package
The STTK will prepare an alternative package for government extortions.
The organisation also hopes that other recipient centre organisations.
According to President Antti Palola, the attention is currently in the Friday demonstration.
Alternative ways to lower the price of work will then be returned.
Everyone understands that life will continue after Friday, Palola pointed out the organization’s regime meeting to journalists at a break.
The fire estimates that, instead, the Central Economic Union (EC) is not prepared for discussions.
The TTK's economists have calculated that the change security contained in the Government's Competitiveness Package is estimated to cost the employer EUR 30 million when the second half of the package is EUR 2 700 million.
I don't know if it's a party's terrible enthusiasm to have a conversation if there's one relationship with 100.
Ball: Negotiation connection has been constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) has hoped for alternative proposals by Wednesday, since the government is to submit its own package to Parliament a communication and start preparing reforms.
The fire did not take a position on whether the timetable is realistic.
The connection between the government and the government exists according to Palola, and it has been constructive for him all the time.
In particular, the operation of Sunday personalities in the STTK field is a sick place according to Palola.
The organisation requires the government to withdraw from forced legislation to implement part of the extortions.
According to Palo, the STTK does not warm up to the preparation of the alternative package with the SDP that has held the matter.
Employees will meet on Friday to Helsinki to oppose the work life blackmail package presented by the government last week.
As part of the package, inter alia, the wages of the first day of illness are cut, overtime allowances half, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
The TTK emphasises the fact that the central organisations have invited employees to protest and that they have not been planning a strike.
Fjäder's adventurous.
Mr Fjäder, President of the Programme, thanks the STTK report on the preparation of an alternative package.
According to Fjader, the STTK now comes to the same lines with the Opening Plan, since the Opening Plan has already outlined an alternative model for the government's presentations.
Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also be included in the alternative package, because without the SAK the package is not sufficiently comprehensive.
The President of the Programme, Sture Fjäder, hopes that the SAK, led by Lauri Lyly, will come in and prepare the presentation as an alternative for surgery.
The STTK of Antti Palola told me earlier that he was preparing new proposals on Wednesday.
We want change security and working time banks.
The plan informed on Wednesday that it has been preparing its own proposal for a long time, in which it is prepared to negotiate the 5% competitiveness of the government of the country as an alternative to cuts.
The plan has always been ready to negotiate, and we have long been writing an alternative model for government presentations.
We are ready to look at the terms of the service relationship as part of the agreement.
In response, we want change security and working time banks, says President Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also come to the Open Lines, as the STTK has done before Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
Now, together, we prepare a model that goes to the government and employers of the country, Fjäder says.
The agenda bureau will meet on Thursday at 15 a.m. of the decision on the possible content of the agreement.
"Same boat, coal, tallos" plays bingo when Sipilä talks tonight
Green Left of the University of Tampere
Viva's Bingokupon for the Green Left of the University of Tampere for the evening.
The Prime Ministers have previously held exceptional speeches during Mäntsälä’s rebellion and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of the Finnish economy in Yle's channels on Wednesday nights at 21.05 p.m.
In applying for the previous speech of the Prime Minister, Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was the Prime Minister when he had a famous radio call, which meant the beginning of the end of the rebellion of Mäntsälä.
After that, the President and ministers held a number of radio calls during the winter and consecutive war.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho held a new year's speech instead of President Mauno Koiviston, but it was more ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen discontinued the strike of train drivers on television.
Solitary call, monarchist makeup
Sparkling speech has brought up criticisms and guesses about what to come.
In Twitter, Paavo Arhinmäki, President of the Left League, said that "Sipilä could hold a speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a statement by the Prime Minister, which would also allow the speech to be discussed".
According to the Green Ville Niinistö, "a single call has already been seen.
The leadership includes dialogue, listening to people.
The Erkki Judge of the SDP in Facebook condemned "monarchistic techniques: the Prime Minister tells the people what's best for it".
The president of the SDP, Antti Rinne, challenged the Siply dialogue: "A little six months from the elections.
There is no single presence from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
We've been trying.
What are you afraid of?
Public service
According to the Government's Office, Sipilä's speech has been recorded in advance and will take about 15 minutes.
According to the SAK, the SAK president Lauri Lyly and CEO Jyri Häkämies of EK commented directly.
Your pride has been criticised for the presentation of the Sipilä speech.
We considered it and stated that it was part of the public service task to promote the full publicity of Finland, a line in the news of Ismo Silvo Yle, the director of Yle's publications.
It's like Me at the Tammelos
The speech has also provoked irritation.
The evening dinner will be enjoyable in good time, the children will be combed and dressed for their best.
My mom puts on the most beautiful collar, and my dad makes a tie on his neck.
At 9:00 a.m., you'll be quiet down to the television as you used to be at Me Tammelos' time," writes blogger Saku Timonen.
"Does Prime Minister Sipilä, in his speech, also explain why the Finnish Government is sitting in tax havens with millionaires hiding its capitals, who are drawing up pardon laws for his fellow tax makers, while at the same time claiming to the people that it must be cut when the state has the end of the money?" asks Pia Lochikoski.
About what Sipilä says, one guess is presented by Viva, the green left of the University of Tampere.
It's published in Facebook a bingo below.
Do we hear about the same boat, coal, debt and team spirit tonight?
Coupons and pens ready, it starts at 21.05 and channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
In Ahtisaari Guardian: the Western countries rejected the Russian proposal on the exclusion of al-Assad
More than three years ago, the Western countries rejected the Russian offer that led to the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad being renounced, tells President Martti Ahtisaari Guardian.
According to Ahtisaare, the Russian UN Ambassador proposed a plan to remove Al-Assad from power in style after a while.
However, the Western countries did not take the proposal because they believed that Al-Assad would fall otherwise in a few weeks.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaare, Russian ambassador Vitali Tshurkin, in his bilateral discussion, listed three points: the opposition was not allowed to be armed, the opposition had to be contacted immediately between opposition and Al-Assad and the abandonment of the Al-Assad power had to be undermined.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree with all things, but we are able to discuss them openly.
I told him what I was doing there, and he said sit down, Martti, and I'll tell him what we have to do, Ahtisaari remembers the Guardian interview.
Diplomatics do not comment
Ahtisaari tells us that she sent a message from Tshurkin to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurk did not confirm the content of the debate for the magazine, but Ahtisaare said there were no two words.
The UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaare's claims, but said that the Al-Assad troops had already committed a number of mass murders at that time and that the main opposition groups refused all the agreements in which he would have fallen.
Sir John Jenkins, former Head of the Middle East Department of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has hesitated to address Ahtisaare's speeches, since his experience suggests that Russia was never ready to discuss the fate of al-Assad.
Russia has officially supported Al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaare’s claim is that Tshurkin spoke with the mandate of Moscow.
If he had told me about what Tshurkin said, I would have said that I would like to hear the same thing from President Vladimir Putin so that I could take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, even in that case, he would have suspected that it would have been Putin's stunt to hold power on some al-Assad supporter.
Refugee flow from our own actions
During the negotiations in Ahtisaare, about 7,500 people were killed in the Syrian crisis.
The United Nations estimates that the number of victims exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of the current year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to escape their homes because of the war.
We should have stopped this disaster.
The flow of refugees to Europe is our own work.
I see no choice but to take good care of these poor people.
Now we're paying the bill that we made, Ahtisaari says to the newspaper.
Reserve for asylum seekers in Tornio
The organisation centre for asylum seekers designed by the Government in Northern Finland is likely to be set up in Tornio.
The center would be set up in a building in a empty building in the center of the city of Tornion.
The Ministry of Interior has sought a suitable place to better manage the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
On Tuesday, the Helsinki sanomamat news that the Council had already decided to present a school building as a spatial solution to the Ministry.
According to Sauli Hyöppisen, Vice-President of the City Council of Tornion, that is not true.
When the whole council was not together and part of the group wanted an official decision, we decided to invite the Council meeting to decide on the matter next Monday, he would specify to the STT.
At the time of the debate, 36 of 43 were authorised.
The Centre was opposed by 13 mandates.
On the basis of this, you could expect the decision to be positive, Snoopinen says.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city received contact on Monday, and quickly responded.
There would be an estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time.
The expert has checked that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is two hundred metres from the border, so it would be working in that sense, says Nousiainen.
Chip still hopes that the labour market is an alternative to excitement
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central), half the holidays in the public would only manage part of the government's desire to calculate the price of the work.
However, the government would be happy to accept an alternative package if the labour market organisations were able to agree on that.
In Parliament, Sipila told journalists that he had not contacted labour market organisations.
He also did not know how seriously the organizations are looking for substitutes for extortions reported by the government.
If such a agreement comes into existence, we will be happy to accept it as part of the overall package.
In the view of Sipilä, half the holiday money would be an instrument, since it would be directed to almost all employees, unlike the operation of Sunday personals envisaged by the government.
Labour Market Organisations could agree on the operation of holiday money as they are registered in collective agreements instead of law.
The government will inform Parliament on Wednesday next week of extortion of working life as a communication from the Government Council.
According to Siple, the proposals of the organisations should be known before this.
This isn't the final back limit either.
Legislative work then moves, i.e. the train is on the move and it gets more difficult all the time.
It's a good time.
It won't take long in such a matter if there's a will, Siply formulated.
The list published by the Government last week contains, among other things, the conversion of the lopi and helatorsta into unpaid leisure days without shortening the annual working hours.
In addition, the wages for the first day of sickness are cut, overtime benefits are pooled, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
The reforms will be implemented as a forced legislation over trade unions, which has raised strong criticism.
As a result of the activities, the wagers' centre organisations are organising a major demonstration on Friday, and several trade unions have declared political strikes.
The Tohmajärvi Council approved the extension of the stock of juice hall
The Tohmajärve Council unanimously accepted the expansion of the stock of the Nordic Koivu Oy Hall, i.e. the juice hall.
The fact that the project was bigger and more expensive than the originally spoken was caused by the criticism.
A busy timetable is also brutal.
It was also a little wondered that the condition was not known a year ago when the previous extension was decided.
At this stage, the expansion of stocks in 400 to 450 square metres was approved for the investment programme, but the funding will be decided at the same time in the context of the interim report.
The agenda was still discussing the investment of between EUR 150 000 and EUR 200 000, but at the meeting, the Technical Director Erkki Ikonen reported that the price would be estimated to be EUR 300 000.
The investment was supported on the basis of the fact that it brings work and tax revenues to the site.
The municipality has no risk because the company pays the investment as a rent, Vesa Väistö (ps.) justified.
A place for Karelia in Joensuu
The city government enlightened its previous steep position to bring cattle-speaking streets to the center of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and right in view of the preservation of the animal tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu does not declare itself as the capital of the cattle’s tongue, because there are no historical grounds and the cattle’s language is a natural part of the area’s identity.
The language spoken in Joensuu has been more part of the Eastern Savos fractures.
Even after a new decision, there will be no cattle-speaking street signs.
However, the city of Joensuu is in a case-by-case discretion also prepared for the use of the cattle language, for example, in the information tables and in the marketing of tourism.
The same approach is recommended by the city to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a monolingual municipality, it is also worth considering the use of the cattle language now that multiculturalism is living and changing strongly in North Karelia.
The language of Karelia is still the specific characteristics of the county, as well as the image of Joensuu as the whole forest capital of Finland.
Both of them can well be used to benefit from the various types of marketing of the province.
Traffic termination cuts the province's vitality
Train links are surgeons that hit the province's vitals with a hard hand.
Transport links directly affect the economy and competitiveness of the province.
And it affects whether there is a chance to live and work here at all, the mayor of Joensuu Kari Karjalainen wonders.
He also highlights the air transport, which has also been on several occasions in the report.
It is important for the entire province that we do not have the opportunity to reduce the measures taken by the government, as it is now happening.
The impact of these terminations on employment, for example, should be seen, Karjalainen emphasises.
The deterioration of traffic connections causes additional challenges to the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services here are, such as transport connections and housing, the easier it is to have students and employees, Director Jukka Mönkkönen of the University of Eastern Finland says.
He points out that poor connections also affect the research community, which is very mobile and travelling a lot for research.
Marko Junkkarinen, the recruitment director, says that the marketing of a university towards Western Finland is already difficult because the links are in the cross-sectional direction.
At the moment, about half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland come from outside Eastern Finland.
Some 10-20% of them are from New Zealand, which is partly explained by direct train connection.
Joensuu became one of my war voices for the war of Siu
The view of the City Government of Joensuu on the regional war project of Siu seems to be unanimous, but there is one of the sora voices.
Pentti Kesksalo, a member of the City Government, in the picture, presented a resignation of the entire project at the government on Monday, but his presentation remained unreasonable.
The Government approved Kari Kari Karjalainen's decision-making proposal, which will be reviewed at the beginning of October before the City Council meeting, which will give a final opinion on the project at the same time with all other municipalities.
One train shift from Kouvola to Kouvola ends next year
Passenger rail transport from Kouvola to Kouvola will continue to be maintained, although one train couple is fewer than one train shift.
There will be changes in passenger train traffic between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One train couple leaves out, but five times a day still gets out of the Eagle to Kouvola and the opposite.
The contractions are due to State savings measures.
The purchase appropriations of the Ministry of Transport and Communications for the next four years will be reduced by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes will be completely shut down.
The VR will draw up new schedules by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed onto the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys got out of the place.
The Rescue Department released a 12 - year - old climbing from the torch to the roof, who couldn't get down on the roof with his own help.
The situation was born in Tornionmäki, Ketoti, at 6:30 on Tuesday night.
There's an old two - layered wooden house, where there's no ladder that takes you to the roof.
It did not stop the boys who decided to climb onto the roof of the house along the mast of radio amateurs next to it.
The other boys got down the same route, but one didn't.
As a result, others sneaked out of the place, and the passers alerted the rescue body to help with the draws of the last roof safely back on the surface of the earth.
FedEx's turnover variations, weaker prospects for the financial year 2016
FedEx published its weaknesses in the last quarter. The transport sector failed throughout the year after the output forecast was due to the decline in demand for freight services and increased costs for land transport.
The company intends to hire 55 000 seasonal workers for a holiday period.
During this time last year, FedEx announced that he was hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
The company's share decreased by approximately 2.5 per cent 45 minutes before the real trade opened on Wednesday.
FedEx's forecast is between 10.40 and 10.90 dollars for the financial period ending in May. The forecast has a decrease of 20 cents compared to the previous forecast.
According to FactSet's investigation, the analysts predicted $10.84.
The forecasts have declined on average, despite price increases of 4.9%, and increases will enter into force on 4 January.
The company is still expecting income growth since the previous year due to cost cuts, increased turnover and growth in online trade.
The President and Managing Director Fred Smith pointed out that the company has completed a well-foreseeable weaker economic situation, which has in particular tested production and global trade.
The periodic recruitment plans were notified one day after the competitor UPS announced their plans to employ mostly seasonal workers as last year, i.e. 90 000 to 95 000 people.
At the end of August 31, FedEx’s operating profit was USD 692 million, which means a six-percent increase.
The result per share was $2.42, so the forecast of Zacks Investment Research's 12 analyses of $2.44 left.
Turnover rose by 5 per cent to 12.3 billion dollars.
According to the six analyses interviewed by Zacks Investment Research, turnover was expected to be 12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has been undergoing a reduction in shipments of the international class 1, which has led to the deterioration of the company’s Express unit.
The strong increase in network trade has confirmed the results of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter the turnover of land transport increased by 29 per cent, but the increased costs of large-scale shipments and insurance were seen in business profits.
As a result of higher basic charges, the Express Unit produced better, while the return on freight business decreased due to higher labour costs.
About an hour before the real trade opened, the FedEx share price had fallen to $3.85 or 2.5 per cent to $150.15.
On Tuesday, the shares fell to 11% of the average of the year and 17% below the highest quote recorded on 11 June.
This week, the Presidents of the United States Central Bank Fed will meet for the most expected meeting for years, and a number of people will sit at the diameter of the Honduras tree table to decide whether it is time to raise interest rates for the first time for almost a decade.
On the wall of the central bank’s decorative two-layer meeting room, the wall painting of the United States is charming.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Central Bank Janet L. Yellen and his colleagues must put the financial interests of the State above all the other interests.
The central bank has a double order from Congress: maximize employment in the United States and keep prices stable here.
However, after the great divestment, the central bank's management has noted the third unwritten mandate: economic stability.
This mandate may be a missing piece of a disgrace decision. On Thursday, the Central Bank will be required to indicate whether the US economy is ready to start a withdrawal of an unforeseen irritation which has been offered by short interest rates which have remained at zero near the end of 2008.
Although the majority of the data show a steady growth in the economy, the recent deterioration of the financial markets can already be done by the officials of the careful central bank to scare the increase in volatility by increasing the reference rate of the federal tax, even in the quarter of the percentage unit.
"The labour market and inflation are, of course, the first and most important in monitoring their practice," says Lindsey M. Piegza, the main economicist of the banker Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I believe, however, that if the central bank is looking for an excuse not to raise taxes, the increased uncertainty of the global market is to give sufficient reason to wait further," Piegza continues.
Those who are considering the matter do not agree on what the central bank intends to do, which in itself causes nervousness.
About half of the economists in Bloomberg’s study curbed interest rates this week.
However, the financial markets are considered to be expected by the central bank, and according to the main indicator, there is only 30% of the potential for increase.
If the central bank raises its guiding rate, the share rates may be calculated unless the decision-makers soften the attack by allowing another increase.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index cut 228,89 points or 1.4 percentage points to 16 599,85.
"In the background of the fall, there were expectations that the central bank would keep the guiding rate stable this week," said Mr Lonski, the main economicist of the Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the central bank raised interest rates at this stage," he said.
"If this happens, the central bank should consider carefully how to keep the hands of those operating in the financial markets shaking."
On the other hand, experts pointed out that by raising interest rates, the financial markets could be reassured and the uncertainty of when the central bank operates.
Only a month ago, the central bank seemed to be more expensive to increase interest rates by 0.25 percentage points in this month, which would be the first small step in tightening the conditions of financing and thereby strengthening the recovery of the United States.
Yellen has observed that during the spring and early summer he was expecting to raise interest rates this year – despite the fact that the liberals believe that economic progress is needed.
While job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
Unemployment rate fell to 5.1 per cent in the last month, which is now at the lowest level for seven years and close to the level the central bank calculates for full employment.
The wage income seems to be reinforcing
Although inflation continued to fall below the annual targets of 2 % of the central bank, the decision-makers stated that the key reason for this was a drastic temporary impact of oil prices.
"The House can manage higher interest rates and needs them, as long as it takes into account the strict situation on the labour market," said Pantheon Macroeconomics's main economicist Ian Shepherdson.
However , financial markets throughout the world did not scare in the last month when China devolved its currency .
Dow Jones's industrial average dropped up to 16 percentage points from the May record height, and investors feared that the decline in China's economy would also have an impact on global growth.
The market has been cheered this month, and Dow Jones has already fallen by almost 10% of the May summit.
The failure of the market means to the decision-makers of the Central Bank that the consideration of the increase in the guiding rate will be further complicated.
"The work of the Central Bank will be complicated despite what happened on the financial markets and what news of China's economic deterioration has been reported in recent weeks," said UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate's senior researcher and former central bank official Stephen D. Oliner.
Now he believes that the central bank will wait at least a month to deal with the effects.
"There is great uncertainty about what will have an impact on the US economy, and there is little reliable information on the situation following the recent development of the Chinese economy," said Oliner.
The reconciliation of the world economy is not the main concern of the Central Bank, so in principle it should not affect the decision-making of the Central Bank.
In practice, however, the central bank is the most powerful player in the world's monetary economy.
The impact of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
In 2013, only an indication from the silencing President Ben S. Bernanken that the central bank could reduce the scope of its operations was caused by a phenomenon around the world.
In today’s world, markets and economies are closely interconnected, and in addition to monitoring the world’s trends, the central bank also requires contact with other central banks and experts to have a good picture of the global economy.
"The decision-making process of the Central Bank is more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, the head of the global strategy of Envestnet Inc.
President Jeffrey Lacker from the Regional Central Bank of Richmond stated this month that the central bank has previously overreacted to the movements of financial markets which do not seem to have access to the basic pillars of the economy.
Mr Lacker, who was entitled to vote on the Federal Open Market Committee (Federal Open Market Committee), has called for an increase in the guiding rate, highlighting the decisions taken in 1998 and 1999.
"The economic crisis in Asia led to the decision of the central bank at three meetings to calculate the guiding rate of 0.75 percentage points, although there were only limited penalties for US economic growth," Lacker said.
A year later, the central bank revoked the decision.
"The Central Bank should focus on monetary stability only in a major crisis, as in the 2008 economic collapse," said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England interest committee.
The last bruise does not even approach the situation in the chairs," he said.
"There is no point in fear of the increase in the chores because of the shock of the market," Peterson Institute for International Economics Posen added.
"The Federal Reserve Act still has a double mandate, and it does not mention the stability of the financial economy, and before this change, I should not go ahead with things."

The Brazilian Rio Grande Child Doctors Association promotes proper diet for breastfeedings
The Brazilian Rio Grande Association of Children's Doctors SPRS has developed a blinding way to teach women the meaning of a proper diet. They are presented with pictures of babies breast-feeding, with pictures of unhealthy food.
The human breast milk consists of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, thus giving the baby all the food needed and developing a strong immune system.
As a result of additional energy consumption, pregnant women are advised to increase their daily calories by approximately 500 kilocalor.
In addition to increasing the number of calories, the new study suggests that other changes to diet should be made.
Robert Waterland’s recent study of the Texas Baylor College of Medicine revealed that a pregnant woman’s healthy diet may affect the baby’s genes and protect the baby from developing tumours.
Unfortunately, unhealthy diet was found to have negative effects on the child’s immune system.
Seven Sunrise's most viewers, even though Nine is trying to reach a lead on Today Show's
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson would send Canberra a morning program on the post-maining of the election leaders of the Liberal Party, which did not very much improve Today's viewers.
The Nine Channel morning program was sent from the capital of Malcolm Turnbull, out of Tony Abbott.
The morning program created by David Koch and Samantha Armytage was sent from London, and special broadcasts for the week are also sent from Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
It seems that the distance had no relevance to the Australian television viewers, since Sunrise was viewed as an average of 397 000 viewers in five state capital cities, and 339 000 viewers of Today.
Today’s viewers increased slightly last Monday (317 000) and Tuesdays (283 000), but last Thursday’s reading remained (343 000).
Today has caught a distance from Sunris in the last few months.
In August Today, on average, there were 318,000 viewers, 330,000 on Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000 audiences.
In September, Sunrise has reached its average 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000 viewers.
This is the most interesting event this morning.
Changes in the winds affect Parliament more this morning.

Seven had a significant news series of 800 Words with the former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The news drama recently tells of a widowed father who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with his two children. The new series reached the great 1,219,000 viewers.
The critics have doubted whether Thomson would be enough for a hit series star alone without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
According to yesterday's viewers, the answer is clearly positive.
Sevenin The X Factor maintained its strong position on 1 136,000 viewers. The series was glorified by The Block (838,000) and the TBL Families series (726,000).
Seven of The Chase Australia has captured viewers in a variety of ways.
From the first half-hour of Andrew O'Keefe’s new sketch series (17.00-17.30), on average, 446,000 audiences followed.
On the second half hour (17.30-18.00), the number of viewers rose to 623 000, which was more than Eddie McGuiren Hot Seat (613 000).
On Monday night, The Chase Australia’s first half had an average of 520 000 viewers, and the second half gathered a huge 720 000 viewers.
Hot Seat's audience was 620 000.
The Chase Australian second night's viewer figures showed to the Nine channel that Hot Seat was going over again at 17.30.
The Chase Australia replaced Million Dollar Minute who couldn't challenge McGuire's show.

The final colonel believes that Sam Wood is really a dream-boyman — but who is the man to choose?
Did the secret reveal?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unintendedly revealed the choice of dreams' bachelor.
Sam Wood's final choice of dreams has been a very secure secret.
The three remaining women do not squeeze a word of who has received the last rose from the male man.
We asked Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markosk and Lana Jeavons-Fellows before one of the threes was dropped, and women could involuntally suggest who would be the winner.
Sam Wood's lips are tightly sealed to the final of Thursday.
All three women were thrilled that Wood was a perfect man, and women praised the sense of humor, ambition, family values and positiveness, and thought he was a suitable partner for their own qualities.
When women were asked who would be the most suitable partner for Wood, if the last rose wasn't on their own, their answers could give you a share of who takes the bachelor's heart.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay after themselves the most suitable partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have all been easy since the beginning.
"As soon as I came to the house, I noticed that Sarah and Sam agreed well. This feeling has remained throughout the program," said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah has legs on the ground, and he's a really fun company," Markoski added.
"I've seen them together, and I have to admit there's chemistry between them.
They seem like a natural couple.
Sarah Mackay thinks he's a good partner and Sam Wood.
Mackay told me he realized at a home town date last week that Wood could be the right one.
"When I saw him with my friends and my family, I realized that this was not just a competition, and now I'm putting our relationship in full," Mackay said.
When they asked Mackay who Wood should choose if he didn't choose him, she answered mysteriously:
"I can't say," he said.
"I like other girls as much as I love, Snezana and Lana are equal.

Mr Jarryd Hayne has several options to start the NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in Hayne, as amended by the United States, and several other associations were interested in the man after the last year's impressive open day of practice.
Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and the choice seems to have hit the button.
Some coachs would have kept Hayne's bench, as a man went to Australia's rugby team, and Hayne shredded the winning of the return team on Tuesday from Minnesota from 20 to 3.
But Tomsula showed that he trusted Hayne and gave the man a new chance to return the fire. Coach held Hayne's game after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula also continued his lineup in the costume after the game.
He didn't rob the newcomers in front of the rest of the team. He encouraged them.
Tomsula also defended Hayne publicly at a press conference after the game.
The 49ers special editor Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised Hayne to forget the failed capture and focus on the next game.
Jarryd Hayne's been spooking in the first quarter of the game against Minnesota Vikings.
Hayne and his Australian fan forces had been waiting for another man from the NFL-debyy.
After the failure, Hayne left the field raining and later told Hamish and Andy the channel 2DayFM 104.1 that he couldn't have imagined a worse start for his NFL career.
"This happens, and we have to move forward," Hayne said.
In 2007, Hayne compared a mistake to its Debits in the State of Origin series, when his feed was opened to Queensland in its own region.
In his entire life, the experience was still incredible for a 27-year-old young man.
Hayne published a picture in Instagram where he pose together with the fans and Australian flag.

Four dead cops shot by rubber odds in Nepal
Four people died in South Nepal, the source of authority told me Wednesday, and the police shot a bunch of people with rubberodes in a demonstration against the alleged new constitution of the country, and there was a four-year-old boy among the victims.
Violence occurred Tuesday night in the Rupandeh region, about three hundred kilometers away from the capital city of Katmand.
According to the district manager Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, over 1,000 demonstrators had met outside the police station, some of which threw stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal told me that the police used tears and fired the air before shooting rubbers.
He said 20 cops and five civilians were wounded.
It is not entirely clear why rubbers, yes, can kill but which are generally considered to be less devastating, were suddenly so lethal.
It was the most recent confrontation of the protests that continued for weeks at the southern Republic of Nepal, where, according to the Madhes tribe, the new provinces based on the new constitution would undermine their political influence.
Protests have also been seen in West Nepal, where the Tharus tribe requires its own state.
At least 40 people, of whom 11 are police officers, have died in violent bulls since 10 August,
When the four major political parties signed the agreement on the distribution of the country into the provinces, a significant step towards the new constitution, but the subject is very sensitive in Nepal, where the administration has been centralized for centuries.
The new Constitution has been worked since 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after thousands of people died in a shocking earthquake in April.
Legislators have voted on the constitutional clauses in Katmandu this week, and the authorities believe that the new Charter could be adopted by Sunday.
NHC Hurricane Centre: 60% probability for cyclone on the south of Cape Verde
From a large low pressure area about 560 kilometres from the southest parts of the Cape Verde islands, 60 percent of the probability of developing a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, the United States National Hurricane Center (National Hurricane Center) informed on Tuesday.
According to the Miami Air Science Institute, Cape Verde and the Piente Antills are also located in the middle of a clear low pressure center, with 60% probability of developing a tropical cyclone over the next two days.
Google intends to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced to launch a campaign aimed at collecting $11 million for humanitarian aid organisations that help thousands of people who escaped war and poverty across Europe.
Google announced a donation campaign in its blog in a special personal way.
Instead, the campaign was launched by a Google employee, Rita Masoud, telling about his own experiences. He was only seven years old when he fled from Kabul with his family.
"We traveled on a train and bus in the dark, and we had hunger, thirst, cold and fear," Masoud wrote.
I was lucky.
As the European refugee and migrant crisis has evolved, many families in a similar situation need very much help.
Gifts are allocated to non-profit organisations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Rescue Children's Association and the UN Refugee Organisation.
Once the donations have been collected at google.com/refugeerelief via 5.5 million dollars, Google will promise to donate the corresponding amount, which will amount to 11 million.
The European Refugee Crisis, then, is the worst in the Second World War, and the situation, in particular, is worsening the four-year civil war in Syria, which has caused over four million people to flee their homes this year.
The war must also be fled from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Mildly overweight diabetes may benefit from obesity surgery
According to the new study, mildly overweight type 2 diabetes mellitus may benefit from obesity surgery for at least five years.
However, it is too early to say whether mildly overweight type 2 diabetes after obesity surgery is longer than those receiving unoperative treatment.
"Admission of mortality data takes time", said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a fatty surgery expert who dealt with a new study in JAMA Surgery.
Fatness surgery, i.e. bariar surgery, reduces the stomach bag by different methods.
Surgical methods reduce famine and limit food absorption in the body.
During the years, bariatric surgery has been identified as effective treatments in type 2 diabetes, but most of the studies have been conducted in patients with a diseased overweight body weight index (BMI) of at least 35.
The weight index indicates the weight and length in which the normal value is 18,5 to 24,9.
When the weight index is more than 25, the person is overweight and the weight index above 30 indicates a significant obesity.
You can count your weight index at 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In a new study, researchers from Min-Sheng hospital in Taiwan benefited from data collected since 2007 in a study comparing two obesity surgery techniques, gastrointestinal surgery and leakage surgery, patients with mildly obesity therapy in type 2 diabetes.
After obesity surgery, the mean weight index decreased from 31 to 24,5 by the end of the fifth year of study.
The weight index of those who received surgery was maintained in the 29 sense.
Diabetes treated with surgery improved by 36% and partly by 28%.
In the drug-treated group, diabetes improved by only 1% and partly by only around 2%.
The study also showed that blood pressure, triglycerides and malignant LDL-cholesterol were better in the surgery group.
Investigators also followed haemoglobin-A1c levels in patients, which reflect the development of blood sugar levels.
According to researchers, the recommended haemoglobin-A1c level is below 7%.
After surgery, haemoglobin-A1c decreased from 9% to 6% on average.
In the drug-treated group, the value remained unchanged by approximately 8%.
However, the study group leading to Dr Chih-Cheng Hsu noted that this did not reduce mortality over five years.
The study group also compared the consequences of two different surgery methods.
In the fifth year, weight loss in the gastric cross-section group was higher than the thin surgery group (18.7 and 14.2 kg), the weight index was higher (7.4 and 5.1), and the haemoglobin-A1c levels (3.1% and 2.1%).
However, according to the Swedish study of the Blackstone University of Arizona College of Medicine, surgery was not able to show a lower mortality after five years.
In a Swedish study, the probability of mortality during the 15 years was reduced by 29 per cent compared to the conventional treatment group.
However, although no lower mortality was observed in the new study, Blackstone found that it was confirmed that persons with a weight index below 35 could benefit from the measure.
"This is the most important discovery in the study, because it says that the surgery is safe in the lower weight index group, and it does not increase the risk of loss or kidney diseases," Blackstone wrote.
According to Blackstone, people and doctors should take weight seriously when the weight index is 27-30.
"We wait too long for people to start taking the situation seriously," the researcher said.
"When genetic changes have been accumulated in human body, which are prevalent to obesity and diabetes, it is really difficult to turn the situation around."
"Everyone cannot come to Europe" Dalai Lama – RT News
Europe is unable to receive all refugees, the Dalai Lama has said, and he believes that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The leader of the Buddhist Tibet has called for the end of violence in the countries of refugees.
Dalai Lama discussed the refugee crisis in his speech in the United Kingdom. Dalai Lama spoke at the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion, which focuses on ethical research in Oxford.
According to the Dalai Lama, humanity must be put ahead of individual countries or continents in the present situation.
He also stressed that although the reaction of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis needs to be admired, it is not sufficient in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," said the Dalai Lama in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama thanked the German and Austrian actions in the event of a crisis, he stressed that the solution was only temporary.
"Government of thousands of refugees is a great act, but at the same time we have to think about long-term solutions and how we can achieve genuine peace and real development in these Islamic countries, mainly through education," Dalai Lama stressed.
"We must, at the end of the day, consider how we can reduce killing in these countries.
The use of power must be reduced.
The forces have never solved problems," he added.
In talking about violence, the Dalai Lama commented on the activities of George Bush during the 11th September terrorist attacks and argued that in response to the terrorist attack, the United States created an uncontrolled chain of events.
"After the 11th September attacks, I expressed my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution was made through violence.
I know that his purpose was good, but he took advantage of the forces that had unpredictable consequences," said Dalai Lama.
Handdes swallowing in children four times in four years
According to the Georgian poisoning centres across the United States, the alcoholic strength of children under 12 years of age has been reported by nearly fourfold in cases of severe hands-on swallowing since 2010.
According to Gaylord Lopez, the head of Georgia’s poisoning centres reported handdes swallowing events in children under 12 years of age increased from 3 266 in 2010 to 16 117 in 2014.
"These products are more and more accessible to children, and unfortunately some of the children are being put to emergency care," Lopez told the CNN.
According to Lopez, children drink hands with purpose, part to impress their friends and part of the social media.
YouTube videos have teenagers who drink disinfection because of cheap drunk.
Teins are reported to mix alcoholic oral water with a disinfectant to make it stronger.
You can attract smaller children to the smell of handdes.
"The child doesn't think it's bad," said Lopez.
"A large part of the attractive hand reproductions has just been odoured.
There are strawberries of strawberries, grapes and oranges that appeal to children."
The alcoholic strength of disinfectants is between 45 % and 95 %.
A small number of young children can cause alcohol poisoning.
"The alcohol content of my hand is very high", Stephen Thornton, the medical director of the Kansas University Hospital Poison Center, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
"No one would leave whiskeyshots to children, but if hand disinfection products are often left away from children, they will quickly receive a large amount of alcohol."
A six - year - old Nhaijah Russell recently enjoyed four strawberries of strawberries in the school, and a girl was delivered for emergency care.
"The girl's blood alcohol content was 179, which is double than the adult drunken limit," says the girl's doctor, Chris Ritchey, who cares for the Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Nhaijah was sopers, and he couldn't walk when they brought him to the emergency.
The doctors followed the girl's room overnight in a separate child hospital for brain damage because she had fallen and beat her head after drinking alcohol," Ritchey told me.
"Your house was really scary," said Nhaijah's mother Ortori Scott to CNN.
My daughter could have died.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products and disinfection wipes in addition to the need to move your hands into children's reaches.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two ontario women died after swallowing handdess containing toxic substances that had not been reported.
The health authorities considered that the product contained fatal methanole instead of ethyl alcohol, although the latter has been reported as the active substance in the product leaflet.
According to the police report, three fourth grade students in the north of New York State planned to kill a "scary" teacher by putting antibacterial products around the classroom.
The teacher is highly allergic to the handdes and forbids it to be brought to the classroom.
The police considered that the agreed plan was irrelevant and urged the schoolwork to take disciplinary action.

The Dutch need an old Scotland couple – de Boer
The former Rangers' middle field player and the Dutch country team player Ronald de Boer have said that the interest of Dutch football fans has been disrupted against Celtic because there is no longer any chance of being followed by the double fights of Celtic and Rangers.
De Boer, head of the Ajax team, said: "There are no more highlights in the Celtic game. Why?
'Cause the Rangers aren't involved anymore."
"It's not just about the return of Rangers.
We're talking about Old Firma.
The Dutchs need double-playing between the teams.
Old Firm's games have a huge tension, and they are also interested outside Scotland's borders."
I'm turning the situation back, Deila convinces me.
RONNY Deila admits that Celtic is difficult, but the Norwegian credit assures that there will be a change.
The company lost to Malmöl fell from the Masters League and lost ten players to Aberdeen, who now has a five-point lead at the top of the table.
"Celtic has had some difficult episodes before, and we're gonna get up again," said Deila.
"We want to increase our situation as quickly as possible.
The situation is very frustrational, and in many cases it causes anger or sorrow.
We have to move on, too, but we have to move on.
We need support from the supporters of Celtic because it reaffirms players considerably.
The common spirit is really important now."

Even though only a few weeks ago, the Rangers Boss Mark Warburton pointed out the tables in January, he will be careful about the transfer system and say he wants to jeopardize the unity of the team.
"January player transfers differ significantly from summer transfers," said Brentford's ex-coach.
"The team-related players in the summer will be able to get used to the team before the beginning of the season, which has been successful in our composition during this period.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes unnecessarily purchases of players can cause more harm to the team than benefits."
Michu, Celtic’s goal of retirement
Swansea's attacker Michu has been associated with Celtic in playlist talks, and Michu has been suggesting retirement after the end of the Swans Agreement.
Michu, a 29-year-old, has been struggling for years, and he couldn't get a move from Wales in the summer.
Hearts ready for SFA on Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2 to 1, when Paterson was removed from the field. The team eventually lost 3 to 2. The defendant's red card was later revoked. This is already the third Collum's red card in eight months, which will be revoked.
However, Neilson stays behind his words. "I didn't question honesty, and I did not comment on performance.
Griffiths swear to avoid Tynecastle.
Griffiths was reproached when the man admitted that he was slandering songs from the former Hearts player, Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in the pub in the Edinburgh Roseburn region before the Edinburgh local match in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"There was a local match, and the atmosphere was intense," the attacker said. "I can guarantee I'm not going back to Tynecastle except Celtic."
Tannadice’s Board of Directors believes in Dundee United’s Training Management – Donnelly

We're getting the boys ready to fight," said Donnelly.
McInnes welcomes the Hamilton victory with a dirty game
Derek McInnes admits that Aberdeen had desperately endured against Hamilton in front of his seventh consecutive league victory, winning Aberdeen captured five points of neck at the top of the Celtic serial table, which is thanks to Adam Rooney's punishment in the first half.
"There is no cup or league team that would not have won such games," McInnes said.
Unemployment unchanged in Scotland, growing in the British islands
The employment rules remained unchanged in Scotland in May-July. The number of unemployed in the United Kingdom increased at the same time by 10 000.
According to the UK Statistical Centre (Office for National Statistics), the unemployment rate in Scotland was 5.9 per cent when it was 5,5 per cent in the United Kingdom as a whole.
There are 12 000 employees in Scotland less than three months earlier. The number of employees now is 2 612 000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent in the quarter, the average employment rate in the United Kingdom as a whole is 73.5 per cent.
David Mundell, Minister of Scotland's Affairs, commented on recent figures: "The long-term plan of administration has created a basis for a strong economy."
Almost a year ago, Scotland made a historic decision on the preservation of the United Kingdom.
The labour market situation in Scotland has improved over the past year: and unemployment has declined.
Why am I following the execution of Oklahoma?
Later today, unless there is a legal basis for revocation, I will follow the execution.
If the execution is carried out, what I do not hope, I will sit in the prison of Oklahoma State when Richard Glossip is executed with a poison injection.
The Glossip has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses.
In January, I received an invitation through the man's best friend and despite my shock, I responded positively.
When the day comes, I'm terrified.
Then why did I do it?
I agreed because I thought I could tell you this way about the death penalty of the true story.
The view would be unique.
Suppliers will be able to follow executions in the United States, and since there are more applications than places, the participants will be selected as a macaber.
Oklahoma has reduced journalists from 12 to five.
The selected are following the execution moderately.
I can't do it.
I'm sitting next to the closest friends of Richard Glossip. I've created a man in a personal relationship because we've been on the phone several times over months, and one visit lasted two and a half hours.
I like this man.
We laugh often when we talk.
According to the prison staff, I can't be present in both the witness and the supplier, so I can't take the notebook and the pen to make notes.
All I have to do is try and press the details into my mind.
I was accused of jeopardising neutrality in Twitter by one of the oklahoman journalists.
"The thought of the family is this:
When you tell the convicted story in a way that pleases him, you'll get close to him."
I gave the reporter my different opinion.
The editor acknowledged that he could have shaped his word more carefully, but he still considers my actions to be the wrong one.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I've said and written.
He doesn't decide what I'm writing, and even if he's trying to order, I wouldn't obey.
I've told him that he can remove me from the witness list at any time.
However, he wants an international journalist who can write about what happened.
If Glossip dies, he believes that the public will contribute to the movement against the death penalty.
The Huffington Post reporter, Kim Bellware, will sit next to me.
If you want more information on the subject, you can listen to my podcast.
I will not repeat the details in this context.
I can't say Richard Glossip is innocent.
After the murder of Barry Van Trees, his actions would make him guilty after the crime.
However, I believe that it is very likely that man Glossip has not committed murder.
I am absolutely convinced that there was insufficient evidence of the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
From this point of view, I'm following her execution.
I can't say I'm completely neutral.
You can read an undeniable description of other journalists' cases.
I'll tell you what it feels like to watch a man die for nothing.
The man was tempted from Canning River after the watery police hunt.
Constable in the Canning Vale area stayed dry when a man was tempted up from the Canning River.
The attempt to escape the Perthiläis man carried you into a low muddy water, and a police officer in a few metres from where you landed a man back to a dry land.
The Canning Vale police received a call on Tuesday from unauthorised stay in Beckenham.
When the police arrived, the police found a suspect who was trying to eliminate the police by heading to the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"The man standing in the water announced that he would not come out of the water and urged the police to pick him up," said Sergeant Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec's dress was not tempted, so he chose a safer tactic – a negotiation.
"Once upon other occasion, the attempt to escape makes people take advantage of the funny means," said sergeant Castledine.
The case of the soccer champion Ben Cousins is a remarkable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid police blowing and tried to swim across the Swan River.
The man's company was convicted of destruction, but the stunt urged the locals to plan Ben Cousinsbiathlon.
According to Peter Moody, journalists tried to spy, and he threatened to stop competing.
Peter Moody accused Racing Victoria's journalists of the spy company last year, and he threatened to stop competing immediately.
Moody claims that journalists and Racing Victoria's integrity department have personally attacked him, and the rejection of Lady Tatai due to recent treatment on the race day was the last drop on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always trying to work for competition. Moody's been in a difficult situation when Lidar found cobalt in the sample, and he couldn't explain the finding.
Moody has kept his tongue under control from the spy charges for a year and a half, and he didn't want the charges to be impressed by a bitter man.
"I wasn't going to bring it up, but I thought about it for a long time, but sometimes frustration is dissolved with one shot," said Moody.
"They know what really happened."
"Sometimes I have to react and accept the consequences, and now I have to accept the space after I open my mouth.
I'm going home and sleeping well.
I want to go upright, and I want horse owners to believe I'm doing my best.
If the owners don't believe it, I don't want to continue as a horse coach anymore.
I'd have to consider my future as a licensed coach."
Moody dropped the bomb earlier in the Racing.com interview where he told about the infamous department's spying companies on his stable.
"Since a year and a half ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Brian Stewart sat in the same room and offered a man a job in my stable to spy on my actions. I'll tell him the name on request," said Moody to Racing.com.
"They clearly believe I'm a fraud.
If that were the case, they'd like to present the evidence, for I have not been caught in any unlawful.
The former president of RVL Robert Roulston, the current President of RVL, David Moodie and the current CEO of RVL, Bernard Saundry, were aware of the operation at the time and now.
Should I think of the situation as a personal chase?
Should the RVL take real action and take responsibility for the situation of the sector for non-trainers?
I'm in a position to be detrimental?
Am I really a bad thing to do?
Maybe a lot of people think that.
Maybe I'd still have a training license and push me away from my duties, and no doubt I'll get a lot of people to think that through my speech.
But I'm at the point that I don't care anymore.
It's really sad.
I'm pushing them to make their decisions.
My family supports me, and I can retreat."
The long - lasting study of Lidar's cobalt values and the recent neglecting situation led the coach to finally frustration in such a way that the man threatened to give up his license.
Moody is best known as the unbeatable master Black Caviar coach, and he described the rule of the race day to be ridiculous after a clay on the horse's feet was unrestricted.
"The treatment is against the rules.
I'll take full responsibility for it," says Moody.
"The person who belonged to me was mistakenly putting savi on the horse's leg.
The clay treatment could have been done last night.
It could've been done last night, and that's what happened.
But it happened on the race day."
Moodya may expect a three-month ban on clay treatment against the rules that the organisers have started to resolve.
"This is a joke.
The rules have been drawn up by someone who doesn't know horses at all.
Everyone understands that rules are needed, but this is going too far," Moody said.
Arrested from Cobram's crash site
The police have arrested a man who ran into a biker this weekend who ran away from the crash site.
The bikeman was taken to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with a helicopter, and he got serious injuries when he hit him by Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
According to the police, the man who drove a car escaped the place and left not to help the injured biker.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia reported to the Shepparton police.
The man is likely to be accused of neglecting stopping and assistance obligations in traffic accidents and other traffic violations.
The 40-year-old bicycler from Cobram is still in hospital care, and his condition is stable.
Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy refers to opponent paintings
Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy considers the criticism of the team's gambling game as the two too popular activities of the NRL.
According to Sydney Roosters Coach Trent Robinson, the judges gave Storm to wrestling as the trouble of Melbourne's hosts in Sydney on Friday night.
Coach of Brisbane Broncos, Wayne Bennett, hardly covered the reference to Storm's Broncos winning quarrel final Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game as a model match and noted that the Queensland was given special attention to painting.
Bellamy defended his own team's fights and said they were just focused on a contact when they fought.
Bellamy added that his trust in his own team added that two top team coachs criticised his team. Bellamy sees this as evidence that the coachs worry about losing Storm.
"Trent Robinson said nothing about painting when his team won us 24-2", Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I guarantee that we haven't changed our defence system or our techniques all year, and for the last six weeks we've only put us in contact games and fights, which has turned us upside down.
Trent's been on his mission for three years, and the loss might have been a shock to him because he's got a great team that hasn't used to losing.
It is funny that the same thing always comes up at the same time of the year.
Bellamy did not agree with Bennett about what is an interesting football, and he reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George-Illawarra Dragons won the league in 2010 by playing boring football.
"Wayne talks about an interesting football.
He compared his own team from Saturday to our Friday game and considered their game interesting," said Bellamy.
"In 2010, St. Georgea received a lot of criticisms in part of his boring game. Wayne said that the criticism did not give him a moment.
Now he has a team that can play so-called football, especially his young, fast middle-runners.
That's the kind of football you want to play when the player's arsenal is like this.
He highlighted this in 2010. Now he wants everyone to play in his style, and not all teams have central winners like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt.
I get more confidence in this when other coachs are so worried about meeting my team that they're going to take advantage of this.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think they'd meet us in big games.
Bellamy also mentioned that more paintings were made in Storm and Roosters than when Broncos and Cowboys met.
Broncos's game was probably a good game. I haven't seen it, but what was the outcome? 16 to 12?
The result of our game was 20-18. There were more situations in our game, but is it interesting football?
Or are game cuts and low-landers interesting football?
I think the targets make it interesting.
If they mention us, we'll probably meet them."
Storm has a free weekend, as the team will be able to visit the North Queensland Cowboys Cronu on the next Saturday at the AAMI Park, and the tickets will be sold on Tuesday morning.
Serbian man freed for $200,000 guarantees in a drug case
A man waiting for a lifetime sentence of 40 kilos of cocaine in smuggled to Queensland has been released against $200,000 guarantees.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men arrested last month by the police found a hundred kilos of cocaine cargo in Solay, which had come through Vanuatu from South America and arrived at the Coomera port in August.
The police observed the meeting of Maksimovic and a criminal partner in a boatboat for the morning, and then surprised two later from the Coomera Roadhouse coffee shop, and a 40 kilos of drugs were found in the Toyota Echo car in the parking lot.
Even though Maksimovicia expects life-long possession of drugs for commercial purposes, according to the husband’s lawyer, there is no evidence that his client would have tried to take over the whole batch, but he could have been in the cafeteria for innocent purposes.
According to the Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan, there is a risk that Maksimovic is trying to escape the country.
"Maksimovic has clearly links with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," said the judge at the court on Wednesday.
"He lied to the police about his place where he lived."
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather together paid 200 000 guarantees against which the man was released.
"After reading the conscientious certificates of both persons, it is clear that $200 000 is a real financial burden for them," said Judge Flanagan.
"But that is not enough to prevent a man from running away alone," the judge warned.
Maksimovic was released on condition that he will give up both Australia and Serbia's passports, report daily to the police and stay at home from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to get the pedophiles to send photos.
The pedophile used a 11-year-old girl's phone to take over photos of children being exploited.
Stevan Hogg took the phone when the girl was sleeping and logged in to an online message service where he got another user to send inappropriate images of the children.
Later, after she woke up, she noticed the phone disappeared, and she found her sleeping in Hogg's hand.
When she explained the content of her phone, she found some shocking messages and told her mother immediately.
Five of these images were notified to the police, and after examining the computers found at the address, the police found disturbing internet searches using searches for unsuitable children's images.
Hogg claimed to the police that he was trying to mislead pedofiles on the Internet and presented the police to scare pedofiles.
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson said at the local judiciary at the Dundee Sheriff Court: "The man claimed to be dependent on the scaring of people.
He admitted that he had done the graves on the computer, but he claimed that he did so to pretend to be a policeman and thus to scare the pedophiles.
Hogg was asked about discussions with an unknown person who had sent the photos to him and who Hogg had asked for more photos.
Hogg claimed that his purpose was to mislead the pedophiles.
He told me he had disturbing thoughts when he drank and wanted to watch pictures of rape and murders.
Robertson added, "After I found the messages from the phone, the girl shouted her mother shouting and crying."
The girl saw the inappropriate photos on the phone, and then Hogg was questioned.
She told me the defendant used the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who look much younger.
23-year-old Hogg Dundeen from Ward Road confessed to the inappropriate child photographs held on 14 June last year. Hogg infringed his release against guarantees on 25 January this year and refused to come to the court for hearing on 24 March this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to be placed in the sexual offences register, as it can be considered that there was no significant sexual features of the crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the declaration to October due to the background reports of social work.
Hogg was exempted from guarantees in this case, but was held in prosecution on other grounds.
Hogg was added to the sexual offences register before the date of the judgment.
Mr Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe, holds the wrong speech in Parliament
The oldest head of state in Africa, Mugabe fell to the speaker’s height in the leading stairs earlier this year.
Mugabe was not injured, but the video of the event spread quickly in social media.
Parliament's openings were also contradicted by the arguments made by the opposition legislatures that they have received anonymous threats of killing in which they are warned that they would be forced to the Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, the representatives of the People took the opportunity and interrupted the speech on the situation of the President in Parliament, which held the same speech on Tuesday.
Mr Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition policies have received text messages in which they are urged not to disturb Mugabe's speeches.
"The message has been sent from an unknown number, but the title of the message is "death", Gonese told the journalists after Mugabe speaking.
The message warns the recipients that representatives outside Parliament are no longer in immunity.
According to the party, the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai is concerned about the threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard intends to reduce 25 000 to 30 000 jobs as part of the restructuring and savings of business services.
HP is distributed to two stock exchange companies later this year and separates computer and printer business from growing business equipment and service activities.
According to HP's release, the company records the one-off costs of $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter.
"The new arrangements allow a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said HP CEO Meg Whitman, leading the company after distribution.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be a smaller and more concentrated company than HP, and we have large and deep portfolio business that will help companies move into a new business style." Whitman said.
As a company, our position is better than ever and we can better respond to the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise's annual turnover is over $50 billion and the company concentrates on delivering unique integrated technology solutions to companies.
The company founded in the 1930s by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, the Stanford University, is now divided by two, and the two set up an electronic company in a garage located in Palo Alto, which is now considered the birth of Piilaakson.
In HP, massive reorganisations have been carried out when traditional table computers are moved to mobile devices.
The second largest computer manufacturer in the world and the largest technology companies in the United States are the latest changes in HP in the area where it is believed that concentration will bring success.
Captain Mikel Arteta of Arsenal: The team must support the injured Jack Wilshere before meeting Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger has also stressed Wilsher that it's only September, and if everything goes through the rehabilitation plan, there's no reason why she couldn't return to the field in December.
The best possible scenario means that Wilshere will certainly have to miss at least the following four country team games in England, which is clearly unclear in the history of the man's participation in the European Championships.
The biggest problem of the last problem is that Wilshere decided strongerly after the last season and seemed to return to his former steel during the new season.
"This kind of injury isn't a career threat," Wenger said.
"The bone didn't cure properly.
It's not a serious injury.
This was just an accident.
It was not related to his ankles or previous injuries."
Medically, it may be this way, but as Wenger said, additional injuries may come when the player tries to return to the field in the middle of the season.
There is also an unpleasant conformity here.
Premier Injuries Ltd lists 23 different efforts since Wilshere debytoed six years ago.
He also played in Arsenal's rows only 65 of the total 157 leagues over the last five seasons.
The wider picture of Arsenal is that from the period 2007-2008, the team has been one of the most deprived teams since the period 2007-2008.
Wenger accepts a potential witch circle, but Arsenal believes that last year's improved injury statistics continue to develop in a better direction.
"Sometimes the post-injurious return can be associated with a vulnerable period when we need to strengthen the body and apply for competition powers," Wenger said.
"Jack's young, so he'll get through this.
I hope that he will get his body balanced, and I believe in it, and he will continue his career as he deserves."
Arsenal will start his Master's League on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb. Then the team will meet Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday. Wenger will prepare small changes to the configuration.
Hector Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, so Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger can also put in the opening meeting to replace Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroudin Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to take care of the balance of the team and give rest time to those who need it," Wenger mentioned.
Although Arsenal is a clear favourite for the F group to continue, Maksimir Zagreb has the most frightening stadiums in Europe.
Dinamo has also been invincible for 41 times of the game.
The stadium was shaking Tuesday night when the country was shaking at 3.2 Richter's scale.
This year, the tenth in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned his last season's homework after having to tend to Monaco, and that he is still motivated by a far-reaching wish to create the team towards the European championship.
"We have a huge energy charge," Wenger said.
"Arsenal hasn't yet been hit by this title.
We were very close in 2006. On the other hand, I am also a realistic experience.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers."
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us truths about the friendship between men
A similar description of his absence in other series is remarkable, especially when it is noted that the need for men to open up is greater than ever and that young men's suicide statistics are highest for 15 years.
In 2013 suicide was the most important cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain. Suicide is three times more common among men than women.
Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) addresses the problem by declaring the year 2015 men. The campaign aims to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking the help they need.
Friendship is the ultimate idea of the challenge.
In the recent study, 2,000 high school students were interviewed and the study suggests that the potential for improvements to depressive symptoms is better if there are enough healthy people around them.
The likelihood of unsymptomed persons was also half-life if there were persons with no mental health problems in their neighborhood.
But all of this is based on friendships.
Today's communication is dominated by social media, and the communication style is often more important than content.
With the digitalisation of life, the need seems to be strong, fun and successful doubled, even though isolation is reality.
The values, money, image and societal positions that come from externally related to surface success, all draw attention from internal values and from our natural personal growth and friendship demand. Inner values seem deeper to our mental health.
A millionaire in the video game recently stated that money actually cannot buy happiness.
The finest thing about Frendie was that the series turned the focus on her head.
No one of the characters in the series was defined by the profession but by personality. This was seen in friendship relationships.
In the series, Joey and Chandler were humiliating or watching football on their TV chairs, and we often saw Ross miss Rachel, and it was clear that the men were able to match this, even though they weren't reluctant to feel full.
One volunteerer explained this to me: “When I heard people depressed and suicidal, I have learned how much the smallest reactions of friends can be.
Men contacting us often cannot speak to their friends.
The traditional idea that men should succeed is strong; the man is easily considered weak if he speaks of his problems."
"Frends are one of the series of long-term survival mechanisms.
In the series, small moments of friendship between men were highlighted.
Through the phone, I can offer help from outside at a time of despair, but long-term support is provided from the close neighborhood of friends and families."
For the honor of Comedy Central FriendsFest, the series of stages have been raised to life. So if you participate in the event this weekend, you should take your friends to coffee in Central Perk.
Or do something even better. Smile and say hello if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks.
Never know how important a friendship can get out of it.
Comedy Central sends the whole Frendit series – all 236 episodes – #FriendsFest honor
Di Maria's hit helped PSG to defeat Malmo
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan after making a goal against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria succeeded in the painting of the Master's liiga debyyte and helped the PSG to hit the Swedish team Malmo on Tuesday.
Read the game report and the evaluation.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were attacked when Paris Saint-Germain started his work at the Master League by hitting Malmön Parc des Princes Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria made a goal when the debut game had been played for less than four minutes. He confirmed the position of the French champions immediately in hand. However, PSG shook a number of targets before they finally could add their lead: Cavani painted glass when the game had been played for 60 minutes.
The A block also includes Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, so the PSG needed a strong start against the Swedish master. PSG is not only seeking a follow-up in the drop-off games, but also seeking to improve its positions for the quarter-term match in the remaining three matches.
Even though SPG caught the points, the game was not the perfect show of the team created by Laurent Blanch. Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost the painting position and the man got replaced when he had his former home club, where he started his hilarious career in 1999.
"In the Master League, it is not easy to win at home or in guests, so 2 to 0 wins and good shots give a good foundation, even though we still have a cheating season," Blanc said.
"This knows good.
We were thirsty of victory and we were able to do it, although we couldn't make one or two extra paintings."
Ibrahimovic returned to the team after the injuries, and the team was forced to be satisfied with the 2-2 2nd match in the Lague 1 series against Bordeaux. However, Di Maria left her shadow in Ibrahimovic at four minutes.
Last month, the Argentine Platform moved from Manchester to the PSG lines was appointed as the PSG solver, which raises the team to a new level in Europe. He proved to be worthy of the name when he crawled the ball from Marco Verratt's input over Malmo's defence and then fired the exact match across the back of Johan Wiland.
However, those who were expecting the bruising profit of the PSG had to be disappointed.
Malmö fell in Celtic's drop-off games, marched nine international players from the start. The team of five men's defenses and two attackers' tactics was difficult to win.
Nikola Djurdjic's shot just went a little past Kevin Trappi's goal from the back of the game in 34 minutes. The team did not attack very actively.
Instead, the PSG fell into an unfavourable filling and weak finishing, and not least Ibrahimovic, who lost five targets only during the first half of time.
However, Ibrahimovic showed his fingernails in the feed game. From Ibrahimovic's feed Di Maria shot a tour kick over Wiland at 52 minutes.
The second goal was born at the time of the county, thanks to Cavan, and the sixth-time swamp swamped by a swamp who fired him from the left swamper Maxwell.
Malmo's letter ended to the second goal, and only in Wiland's top fight from David Luiz's close range to shooting the bullets were kept in line, and the goal of Ezequiel Lavezz was abandoned with the ends.
Malmo's bullet Åge Hareide admitted afterwards that PSG was in his own class. "We played the previous game of the Masters League in December of last year.
After that, we have played only in the Swedish League, where the level is not the same.
It's not enough.
A hat for the couples.
This was a top match from them."
Glencore collects $2.5 billion on the stock.
The Swiss mine dumped Glencore, which was subject to the calculation of raw materials prices, collected $2.5 billion in the mid-week stock as part of its debt reduction strategy.
Glencore, listed in the London Stock Exchange, stated in his opinion that he sold new shares with a value of GBP 1.6 billion to reduce debts.
The company’s market value decreased by 57 per cent this year, with the price deterioration of raw materials, while the Chinese economy’s downturn impairs demand and burdens the market.
With the stock, Glencore's share price was affected at the top of the London market on Wednesday morning.
The share increased by 2.77 per cent to 131.60 per cent in the FTSE 100 index, which opened up to 0.69 per cent.
Glencore announced last week that he was going to collect $2.5 billion in stocks as part of the strategy to reduce $30 billion in a third of his debt.
The company sold new shareholders at a price of 125 pounds, with a decrease of 2.4 per cent of Tuesday's closing price.
The company issued 1.3 billion shares with a total value of up to 9.99 per cent of the whole group.
The concern of the continuation of the Chinese economy's recession has led to a fall in the price of iron malt, while the fall in coal, copper and other commodities has been between 20 and 40 per cent.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
The Communication published by the White House on Tuesday confirms that the Chinese President Xi Jinping will travel to the United States at the end of the month.
Xi Jinping arrives for his first official visit to Washington on 25 September. This is a visit to President Barack Obama following a visit to Beijing last November.
After the bilateral discussions of the Heads of State, the President of the United States and the spouse of the President Michelle Obama will organize dinners for Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan for the honor of public visit.
"The visit of President Xi Jinping allows for the extension of cooperation between the United States and China in the areas of a wide range of global, regional and bilateral issues, while President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping have the opportunity to have constructive discussions on topics of which we disagree," the White House Communication states.
Xi Jinping's visit was first announced in February, and he is expected to visit Seattle to meet several American technology leaders, and the President of Seattle would first proceed to Washington and from there to New York at the UN General Assembly on 28 September.
Obama and Xin are expected to raise a number of controversial issues, such as Washington's concern about Chinese alleged cyber-smuggling and the increased efforts of the country in the controversial waters of the South China Sea.
Matt Damon deduces diversity in filmwork.
Matt Damon talked to the African-American Effie Brown very intensely and noted that there was no need for diversity behind the camera.
The actor experienced in the HBO Project Greenlight series, presented on Sunday night, interrupted Brown when this explained the importance of considering the different views of the project with regard to the dark manuscript selected for the main person.
"The reality is taken into account in the role of the movie, not in the role of the program," Damon claimed.

I don't think he's gonna stay here and talk about it any more.
He's just happy with his performance.
He has received a great deal of praise from the fans.
Britten is a great guy for whom the family is important.
