I ran into the house.
I ran into the house.
I spontaneously.
All right now?
Wasn't it enough for you to ruin my life?
Isn't that gastric?
I sold it this afternoon.
Sometimes I'm sad.
Sometimes my stomach hurts.
I sleep sometimes.
Is there far away from Paris?

I still can't tell you why.
That was seven or eight years ago, exactly where were you?
I still don't understand anything.
I still don't know why you did it.
I still have a lot of time for fun.
There's one or two things left to put in the suitcase.
I'm gonna have to have breakfast.
I still think that's the best choice.
Tom Christian?
Tom's cooking well?
Tom's a good cook?

I came to see you today, but you weren't home.
I stopped talking.
I learn about two hours every day.
I'm studying hard at school.
I suggest you talk to Mari.
I suggest you talk to Tom.
I guess you're packed and ready to go.
I'm sure I've heard that sound somewhere.
I swear to God, I'm gonna make up for this.
I swim regularly.
I swim two and a half miles a day.
Is your daughter feeling better?
Are you doing a dangerous job?
Is your mother home?
Is your mom home?
There's no doubt about it.
It affects everyone.
It's not over until we get through it.
I'll take your place.
I go to work on a train every day.
I talked to Tom a few times.
It's up to you.
It came out of nowhere.
It could be better with your sister.
It's with the love I feel for you.
It cost me a lot more than I expected.
That's two euros.
It could be a problem.
It could be expensive.
I'd be ashamed to see all of that work ruined.
It clearly freaked me out.
He didn't break.
I wasn't bad.
That didn't help much.
The snow didn't stop.
The snow didn't stop.
Lets you be freezing.
He's not doing anything!
No matter who started it and why.
It doesn't seem that complicated anymore.
That doesn't look right.
I teach Chinese.
It's like they've been poured on me.
I realized I misunderstood him.
It was the last day.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for your confidence in me.
This happened at the beginning of the last week.
That's exactly the day we got married, honey.
There must have been some reason for this.
It happened suddenly.
This happened when he was out.
It happened to me several times.
It happens sometimes.
It happens to everyone.
It doesn't taste good.
I've got your own value.
It's been raining since Tuesday.
I think every fat man should die.
I think everyone's hungry.
I don't think he can help you.
I think you'll be fine with your neighbors.
I find your novel boring.
I think there's a few film cubes.
I think I can do it.
I don't think I can kill.
I don't think I could kill you.
I don't think I understand you.
I feel better.
I think we have the answer.
I think I'll buy it for Tom.
I think I'm dying.
I think I'm starting to lose my head.
I think I'm ready to change.
I think I need more time.
Like I saw a rat.
I think I still have time to do that before Tom gets here.
I think it's better that way.
I think it's correct.
His probability is very small, I think you'll be able to do it by yourself.
I think he's going.
I think it's time for a career change.
I feel like it's time to take a break.
I think it's unfair.
I think it's true.
I think Tom was the one who helped Mari.
I think you better go now.
I think my idea is better.
I think my neighbor might have died.
I think you'll be fine with your neighbors.
I think there's someone in the door.
I think something's wrong.
I find the spiders cute.
I think he's at home right now.
I think my idea is better.
I think he's coming.
I think Tom said something else.
I think that should be forgotten.
I think that would explain everything.
I'm thinking, so I drink.
I'm thinking, so I exist.
I think there's no point in trying to convince him.
I think you've done a great job.
I guess that's exactly what Tom wants.
I don't think that's enough.
I think this medicine will do you good.
I think time will solve this problem.
I think Tom was there.
I think Tomi's annoying.
I think Tom's still unemployed.
I think Tom must be hungry.
I think Tom might be older than me.
I think Tom needs more.
I think Tamás wants to do it tomorrow.
I think Tom's gonna be able to help.
I think Tamás wins.
I think we can handle it.
I think we need to be patient.
I think we're in the wrong direction somewhere.
I think we need to be careful.
I think we're safe now.
I'm guessing you're all out right now.
I think you called the wrong number.
I think you know him.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know the name of Tamás's girlfriend.
I think you're gonna approve.
I think you look great.
I guess you'd like it.
I think you misunderstood.
I think you should go in personally.
I think you're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
I think you're the only one who needs help.
I think your work is very good.
I think you smell nice.
I feel like you weren't convincing enough.
I think you were right.
I was thinking about Tom.
I thought if we went to someplace to eat, that would cheer you up.
I thought I could trust you.
I thought I'd go with him.
I thought I knew him.
I thought it might be worth something.
I thought it was clear what I wanted.
I thought my head was blowing up.
I've reconsidered my future.
I thought it was a good idea to put the key under the towel, but it didn't prove it.
I thought Tomi was still living in Boston.
I thought you trusted me.
I thought it was Tom coming.
I thought Tom was still home.
I thought you were him.
I threatened the neighbor to kill him.
It hurts!
That hurts.
I'm under his influence.
I was very impressed.
It's an accident.
It's a historic act.
It's hard to put it into practice.
It's hard for everyone to think about.
It's hard to make it for everyone.
I have doubts if it's gonna work.
It's getting too late.
He's gone.
We'll be in half an hour after midnight.
Some people are hard to understand.
It's about time you started a new business.
It is important that we propagate our language in any way possible.
It's basically your fault.
He's in the kitchen.
Wonderful.
It's noon.
This is my bedroom.
We need to prepare for the future.
You need some rest.
It's never too late to study.
It's good to see you again.
It's not easy to solve the problem.
The smoke marker cannot be turned off.
It's not the best solution.
That's not the right solution.
It's not too much to say he's a genius.
It's not a secret.
I'm not the one Tom has a problem with.
It's not that expensive.
This isn't the 19th century.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not working.
Maybe he's lying.
It doesn't fit to talk full of mouth.
It's snowing.
It's still moving.
Wow, it's really bad today.
You're fucking expensive.
Thirty-five feet long.
It's time to go to bed.
It's a very easy task for him.
It's on you.
It's a useful information.
There's a lot of heat in the night.
It's very important that you wash your hands thoroughly after you replaced the baby's diaper.
It just didn't work.
It's gonna be dangerous.
It'll be dark by the time we get home.
It'll be ready by then.
He'll be ready by the time he's needed.
It'll take a while to get used to wearing glasses.
He'll be gone soon.
It'll work if I change the polarism.
Consequently, it looks bigger.
It looks good.
Looks like I'm not needed here.
You could use a shave.
Looks like you don't feel so good here.
You seem to have thought about everything.
That makes me sad.
It matters.
It could be a long time.
Maybe it's a trap.
This could save your life.
Maybe we'd like to try it.
Maybe I'm gonna be late.
You need to wash it.
You have to report something.
It must have been love.
They must have stolen it.
You have to fix it.
It never existed.
It should never have happened.
Despite that, I lied to him that I didn't want to.
I told him I'd do the best I could.
I told him to come.
I told Tomi not to give up.
I told Tom where I bought my bike.
I told you, but you didn't listen to me.
I told you I'm fine.
I told you not to walk.
I told you three weeks ago.
I told you you'd like Tomi.
I have a question, too.
I've been bathing for a long time.
I've been in the tub for a long time.
I've arranged it.
I went on 58th.
I was sure you were on our side.
I took my cat to the zoo yesterday.
I took my shoes off.
I totally forgot.
It'd probably be cheaper somewhere else.
The rain broke up yesterday morning.
It fell yesterday.
It's raining a lot.
I train two hours a day.
I traveled all over Russia.
I crossed the United States.
It actually works.
It's really sad.
I tried everything I could to keep her alive.
I tried to forget.
I tried to help Tomi.
I'd trust my life, too.
I'm trying to keep telling you.
I'm trying to get my thoughts together.
That's a nice flag.
It's a big cat.
It's a little early for drinking, isn't it?
It's a boring word.
It's a delicate situation.
It's a dictionary.
Good plan, at least on paper.
It's a grey stone building.
This is a housekeeper dog.
It's half an hour till lunch.
It's a hot day.
It's a kitchen.
It's completely dark outside.
These are all mine.
It's all right, it's over.
That's a nice and good theory, but will this work in practice?
It's all your fault.
It's 7:00.
It's already in progress.
It's ten o'clock tonight.
One of my dreams was that I lived next to a river.
It's always the same.
It's an environmental disaster.
It's a dirty business, Watson, a dirty, dangerous business, and the more I see it, the less I like it.
That's too bad.
Too bad I'm late.
Too bad Tomi's leaving.
It's a pretty big carpet.
It's a nightmare.
It's cold.
It's just as art as science.
It's the past.
She's in school.
It's a very dangerous sport where a little mistake can lead to serious injury.
It's a very old book.
It's a waste of money.
That's a weird question.
That's terrible.
It was a crazy week.
It was a long day.
It was an amazing journey.
It's an exhausting day.
It's a tough day.
This is what happened earlier.
It wasn't just a week.
Two years ago, he left me.
That's better.
It's a better night to squeeze the garden.
It's hot.
Goodbye.
It's cheaper to get on a bus.
That's Chinese to me.
It's closed on Sundays.
Closed on Sundays.
It's closed on Sunday.
It's closed on Sunday.
It's cold at home.
It's cold, I'm skinny.
It's cold outside.
Why don't you get yourself a sweater?
It's known that the bear loves honey.
Whatever Tom did or didn't.
It's totally normal.
All right now.
It's dangerous here.
It's deep here.
That's very delicious.
It's done!
It's easier not to start than to stop.
It's easy to be brave from a distance.
It's easy to understand why Tom doesn't like Mari.
It seemed like an eternity to me.
Looks like the bus was late.
That sounds ridiculous.
Looks like it was just yesterday that we went to school together.
Looks like nothing's changed.
She looks very strange.
Looks like it.
Looks like he's lying.
Looks like Tom's not in a hurry.
It's like you don't want this to happen to me.
Looks like you're honest.
Looks like you're wrong to me.
Looks like we're gonna have an extraordinary guest.
It's embarrassing to be late for a date.
That's exactly what they want.
Dear.
It's fair that you get the same salary for the same job.
It's not perfect.
It's far from ideal.
This is for you.
You know, that's funny.
It's starting to freak out.
It's getting serious.
We're going to have a tough winter.
It's not gonna be easy.
You're lucky to see a dead star.
It's good to be gay.
It's good for learning.
I'm glad you could come.
I'm sure you're gonna laugh.
It's hard not to come to that conclusion.
It's hard to believe it's been clean and sunshine all this time.
It's hard to write it down.
It's hard to find a bench in this town that can sleep on.
It's hard to put it in words.
It's hard to say with words.
It's hard to steal a thief.
It's delicately beautiful.
He's got an unreasonable head.
He's tall.
The kids are already in bed.
Don't make money out of it.
It's warmer than usual tonight.
That's illegal.
It's important.
It is important that parents stand on the same side when they are raised.
It's important that we help them get in trouble.
That's impossible for me.
You have to drown in here.
You can't breathe in here.
It's impossible to meet your expectations.
It's impossible to meet your conditions.
I don't know what tomorrow brings.
Unbelievable, you know?
That's inevitable.
That's inspiring.
It's just an instinct.
Just move on.
It's only a matter of time before Tom gets back in trouble.
It's just a phone.
I just don't want to die today.
It's hard enough.
That's pretty important.
It's really nice of you to take me home.
That's nice of you to say that.
It's late.
It's washing today.
It's like a submarine field, and turtles over them and sharks like flying creatures.
It's closed.
It's me again.
It's me again, Tom.
It's me!
That's me.
It's pathetic, the way he lives.
It's too cold to swim.
This is my horse.
This is my life!
This is my life!
That's my problem.
This is my suitcase.
Now it's my turn.
It's never too late to be what you could have been.
It's none of your business.
Not a bad idea.
It's not a bank.
It's not as creepy as it sounds.
It's not complicated at all.
That's not enough.
This won't happen.
It's not your job to change Egypt.
This isn't mine.
It's not my fault.
No negotiation.
It's not that far.
It's not that simple.
This isn't the 19th century.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not what it looks like.
It's not what you're doing, it's how you do it.
It's not worth screaming about him.
I didn't talk to you.
I'm not talking to you.
I didn't tell you.
There's no point in confessing to the priest if you don't show repentance.
It doesn't make sense to be bitter in the past.
The snow's raining.
Obviously it's broken.
Obviously impossible.
Obviously weird.
Obviously very painful.
It's okay if some of you think they're peasants.
It's okay if you're gay.
It's been three months, and Tomi's already saying that he speaks the French fluidly. — So, it's at the top of the stupid thing. — What peak?
It's only three days.
It's on the other side of the park.
Sounds good.
It's over, isn't it?
It's over.
It's personal.
It's like I'm making it out of a jewellery.
He opened his wings.
It's quite amazing.
It's pretty persuasive.
It's quite simple.
It is quite obvious that the purpose of these mysantropical theories is to show in the apprehension of the working class, liberating imperialism from the responsibility of bloody wars that it has engraved, and to believe the core of the thought that the causes of infinite wars are the aggressive tendencies of man.
It's very urgent.
It's raining in my heart.
There are little big gardens in Japan.
It's real, isn't it?
That's a big deal.
It's right there.
It's uncomfortable to ask someone how much he's earning.
They say the Czech girls are beautiful.
They say they're leaving Tokyo soon.
Shit!
It's just disgusting.
It's snowing here.
He's snowing in Boston.
It's so good to stay home.
It's still moving.
It's suicide.
That's technically possible.
That's the best book I've ever read.
That's the least I can do.
Theoretically possible.
It's the same for everyone.
Same old problem.
You still have to answer that.
It's time we took our tent trees.
It's time to get out of here.
It's time for us to go.
Time!
It's time to fix the problem.
I should cut my hair.
It's time to rest.
It's time to tell the whole truth.
It's about time we did something about this.
Tom has his birthday today.
It's Tom's decision.
Tomi's word is against Mari's word.
It's too dark to play ball.
It's expensive to me.
It's too hot for this.
It's too late.
It's too late to worry about that.
It's typical autumn time.
It sucks to cold.
It's ugly, destructive yellow, and it doesn't harmonise anything, but at least they don't fall in the dark.
It's under the table.
Maybe he's not as stupid as you think.
It's unlikely that anything serious will happen.
It's up to them now.
It's up to you that we're going there or not.
Very attractive.
Very boring.
It's really cold in this room, isn't it?
Very disturbing.
Very entertaining.
It's a lot to live here.
That's very nice of you.
That's very white.
It's hot.
That's the deal.
It's your only chance.
A thorough learning of a language requires about 10,000 lessons.
You have to be brave to succeed.
It took almost three years to build my house.
It took me almost three years to build my house.
Everyone's got it unexpectedly.
It took just an hour.
It took me so long to write this book.
It took me more than a month to heal me from the cold.
Tom took a long time to pick a pair of shoes.
It took me a long time, but finally, we found him.
I went to a little alley.
I've swamped it.
I'm turning left.
It was a beautiful summer day.
It was a difficult time.
It was a friend's competition.
It was a mistake to do that.
It was fun.
It was dark night.
It was a real challenge.
That was a stupid question.
That was a stupid idea.
It was a tragic accident.
It was really great food.
It was just a waste of time for all of us.
It was awfully strange.
It was a lovely day.
It was a wonderful night.
It was a catastrophic.
It was definitely very enjoyable.
We had a good time yesterday.
It was hard at first.
He was hopeless.
It was hot and wet.
It was hot, and it was warm.
It was just a trip.
It was just too easy.
I told you.
That's what I wanted.
It was almost dark.
This was not long before John had an idea. John always knew a way out of seemingly hopeless situations.
That wasn't a very interesting novel.
It wasn't easy for me.
It wasn't easy to keep my promise.
It was a belt under attack.
It wasn't interesting.
I wasn't the one who cut the door.
It wasn't my fault.
It wasn't intentional.
It wasn't our fault.
It wasn't that bad.
It wasn't the first time they did this.
It wasn't Tom.
It was a joke.
I only knew his real intention when I met him.
It didn't hurt.
It fell last night.
It was kind of weird.
That was really interesting.
It was really fast.
It was really sad.
It was a hurry.
That was great.
That's all I could think about.
It was the worst pain I've ever experienced.
Tom's next.
It was kept completely secret.
He was unsure if he was going to marry him.
