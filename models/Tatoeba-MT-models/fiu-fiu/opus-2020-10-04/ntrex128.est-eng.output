The members of the Wales National Assembly fear they look like Muppets
Some of the members of the National Assembly have advocated the recommendation to convert their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament or a member of the Welsh Parliament).
The theme has begun from the plan to turn the name of the National Assembly into the Welsh Parliament.
Representatives of all political trends in the National Assembly are concerned that this can lead to laughter.
One member of the National Assembly of Leiborists said that his groupmates are concerned because it rites with the words “Twp and Pwp”.
For reasons of explanation for readers outside Wales: the word daft means naka and pwp means poop.
A member of the plastic said that the whole group was “no pleasure” and has offered other names.
A member of the Wales Conservative Brigadier said that his group would view the change of name "responsive" but noted that the word "MWP" is very similar to the word "Muppet".
For explanation: in kõmri language, the vote of the letter w is similar to the pronouncement of the English of Yorkshire.
The Committee of the National Assembly, which is currently drawing up a draft law on the change of names, said: "The final decision on all names with which members of the National Assembly are invited will, of course, be made by the members themselves."
The Law of the Government of Wales 2017 gave the Wales National Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on proposals for names, which supports the idea of a widely renamed the National Assembly as the Wales Parliament.
On the terms of office of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission preferred the name ‘Wales Members of Parliament, WMP’, but the participants in the public hearing favoured the most option ‘MWP’.
Members of the Assembly are likely to propose other names, but the agreement may be a challenge for President Elin Jones, who should submit a legislative draft on amendments in the coming weeks.
The Act of Reform also covers other changes to the principles of the work of the National Assembly, including the rules on the withdrawal of the rights of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the Committee.
The final vote on the appointment of members of the National Assembly will remain to the members of the legislative debate.
Macedonians shall hold a referendum on the change in the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will vote whether to rename their country as the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum will be held with the aim of solving the dispute with Greece, the neighbouring country, which has its province, Macedonia.
Athena has long argued that the name of his northern neighbour represents the requirement for this territory and has repeatedly objected to the applicantship of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he intends to disregard the vote.
However, the referendum voters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zajev, claim that the change in name is only the price that the country would pay for joining the EU and NATO.
Holy Martin's watches remain silent because Harlem's churches are struggling in difficulty
“The older people I've been talking to have said that one bar and one church were on every corner,” said Mr. Adams.
"There is no more either."
He said that the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
“Mans communicate differently today, ” he said.
"Bars are no longer the living room of the neighbourhood, where people stay every day."
However, regarding the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets does not last as long as the leaders hope, and, “before or later, they will be back at the beginning”.
Adams added that churches can be replaced by apartments full of people who do not provide help to the rest of the neighbourhood’s sanctuary.
"The vast majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings are white," he added, "that is why they accelerate the arrival of the day when all these churches close their doors because it is unlikely that most of the people living here will become members of these churches."
Both churches built the white congregations before Harlem became the Metropolitan Community in 1870, ten years later.
The original white methodite congregation left in the 1930s.
The congregation of blackskins, who had so far worshiped God, took over the property of the building.
The congregation of African Americans, the Holy Martin Church, took the lead with Reverend John Howard Johnson, who also led the main buyer of Harlem's 125th Street poodles against the bocotti if they refused to hire or promote the blacks.
In the fire of 1939, the building was severely damaged, but when the members of the Johnson congregation planned to rebuild the building, they introduced a carilion, or clock game.
Father Johnson’s son and successor at St Martin’s church, Reverend David Johnson, called the clocks of poor people with pride.
The expert who played the jury gave it a second name: "cultural value" and "unreplaceable historical tool".
The expert at Tiffany Ng Michigan University also noted that this was the world's first Karill played by Black Musician Dionisio A. Lind, who continued to play a bigger karill in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said he was not replaced by the St. Martin Church.
In recent months of the Holy Martin Church, the story of architects and contractors, some of whom have been involved by the secular leaders of the church, other bishops.
In July, the congregation’s leading body, which consisted of world leaders, complained to the bishop in writing that the bishop “will seek to deliver the costs,” although it was not even related to the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the Bishop.
Some members complained about the poor transparency of the bishop's actions.
In California, the shark injured a boy diving after the 13-year-old lobsters.
According to the authorities, the shark attacked and injured the 13-year-old boy who dived in California on the opening day of the lobsters.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. in Beacon's Beach near Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the San Diego KSWB TV that he had been dipping with friends on Saturday morning for about half an hour when he heard the boy's help screams and then swim over to help him get out of the water.
According to Hammel, he originally thought that the boy expressed his enthusiasm about the arrival of a lobster, but “I saw the boy shouting, ” “I was bitten!
I was bitten!".
The whole skull had been naked," Hammel described the vision he saw when he came to the boy.
"I called on everyone to come out of the water, "The shark is in water!"," adds Hammel.
In a life-threatening situation, the boy was taken to Rady's child hospital in San Diego with a plane.
The type of shark that attacked hasn't been known yet.
The Savior and Captain Larry Giles said at the press conference that sharks had been spotted a few weeks earlier in the area, but then it was established that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim's injuries were in the top of the body.
The authorities closed access to Ponto Beach in Ecinita for 48 hours from Casablad to Swamin for research and safety purposes.
Giles added that there are more than 135 shark species in the region, but most of them are not considered to be dangerous.
In Sainsbury's plans to take power in the UK's beauty market
In Sainsbury, he's taking over the Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains, creating supermarket-like sneakers, where expert advisors also work.
As part of the major invasion of the United Kingdom's 2,7 billion pounds of beauty market, which continues to increase in sales of fashion and home goods, the wider ranges of beauty products across 11 stores across the country will be tested, taking them into account in other shops next year, if they are successful.
Beauty products are invested because supermarkets are looking for ways to use the shelf space previously allocated to televisions, microwave ovens and home goods.
Sainsbury's said that he plans to double his beauty product selection up to 3000 products, including for the first time trademarks such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr PawPaw.
The existing product options from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees are also given more space in branding areas, as is currently available in Boot's stores.
The supermarket will also re-market its makeup product series Boutique, where most products are suitable for vegans, as young buyers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, Fragrance Shop is testing the parfym retailer's exclusive sales licences in two of the Sainsbury stores, the first was opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the other is opened this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and switching to the daily purchase of small quantities of food from local food shops means that supermarkets need to try more to convince people to visit them.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe has said that the sales sites are becoming increasingly similar to supermarkets because the supermarket chain is trying to fight against cheap sales chains such as Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and industrial goods.
In Sainsbury, Argos has put its sales places in hundreds of stores, and the same has been done with Habitat's sales, since Sainsbury's purchased both chains two years ago, which allegedly supported the sale of food products and made acquisitions more profitable.
The former Supermarket attempt to renew the departments of their beauty and therapeutic products ended with failure.
Sainsbury experimented with Boots at the beginning of the 2000s, but it ended with a riie about how to share the income from the sale of pharmaceutical goods in supermarkets.
The new strategy was designed after the sales of the 281 sons in Sainsbury for the pharmaceutical business three years ago for GBP 125 million to Celesio, which belongs to the whole Lloyds Pharmacy store.
In the strategy, Lloyds also plays its role by adding its four stores to the product selection luxury skin care products, including trademarks such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Sainsbury’s business manager, Paul Mills-Hicks, said: “We have changed the appearance and nature of our beauty products to improve the environment for customers.
We have also spent money on specialised staff who are always ready to advise.
Our trademark option meets every need. However, an enlarged environment and comfortable locations mean that we are now a competing destination for beauty trade, which can change the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones is furious because Holly Willoughby gave up a pound of 11 million.
The Dragons Den star Peter Jones left the "harm" when the TV director Holly Willoughby gave up the 11 million pounds of transactions in his lifestyle brand business to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby is short of time for home goods and clothes for Truly.
A couple of business is compared with Gwyneth Paltrow brand Goop.
The 37-year-old head of this Morning television announced his departure in Instagram.
Holly Willoughby left the Dragons Den star at Peter Jones's wrath, leaving their luxury lifestyle brand out of the last minute to focus on his new successful contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The Sources said Jones was a "maruvihane" when the TV stargirl acknowledged at a tense meeting on Tuesday at the man's business empire headquarters in Marlows Buckinghamshire that his new contracts worth 1,5 million pounds mean that the woman no longer has enough time to commit to Truly's trademark of homewear and clothing.
The business has been compared with the Gwyneth Paltrow brand Goop and was considered to double Willoughby’s estimated 11 million GBP assets.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced in Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones left Britain in one of his holiday homes.
One source said: “Truly was definitely Holly’s main preference.
It had to secure his farther future, so she thought that she would deal with it for the next few decades.
His decision to leave left everything in complete amazement.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, because it was so close to placing the product series on the market.
There's a warehouse in Marlow's headquarters full of ready-to-market goods."
Experts believe that the departure of one of the most paid celebrity in Britain, the head of this Morning, can pay millions to the company, because the products whose choice extends to clothing from soap pillows and candles and home costumes, are invested in a cost-effective amount of money, which can also result in the later placing on the market of the product.
This could mean the end of one long friendship.
The mother of three children, Willoughby and his husband, Dan Baldwin, has been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Cappi for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Cappi in 2016. The 52-year-old Jones joined the brand as president in March.
Couples are on holiday trips and Jones has 40% shareholdings in Baldwin's teleproduction company.
Willoughby becomes a brand-owned M & S and replaces Ant McPartlin ITV on TV "I'm A Celebrity".
One of Jones's close sources said last night, "I don't want to comment on his business."
Hard talk, "after what we fell in love"
Trump was joking about the criticism that was targeted in the news for the comment that some believed to be "presidents" and for the excessive positiveness of North Korea's Head of State.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said with his curious "new aunt's voice":
"I haven't given up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump welcomed their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step towards the resignation of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
However, the negotiation of nuclear weapons has stopped.
More than three months after the summit held in Singapore in June, the North Korea Summit at Ri Yong Ho World Heads at the UN General Assembly said on Saturday that North Korea did not see the US 'conforming response' to the original disarmament positions of North Korea.
He noted that the US would continue with pressure on the country.
The attraction of Trump stimulating speech was much more fun.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
“The war with North Korea was beginning.
Millions of people would be dead.
It's all right with us now."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought good results: there are completed missile attempts, they have been helped to release hostages and have been arranged to bring American servants to the homeland.
He also defended his unusual communication with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be primitive, but instead of letting 10,000 people wait outside to get to this full-top stadium, it’s better if we have around 200 people here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of us.
Tsunami and earthquake destroy the Indonesian island, killing hundreds of people
When the consequences of the earthquake of Lombok were eliminated, foreign NGOs were told that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than ten percent of the Lombok population had to be relocated, a national disaster was not declared as a prerequisite for international assistance.
“They have often expressed very clearly that they do not want international assistance, so that the stories are a little complicated,” said Mrs. Sumbung.
While the organization Save the Children puts together a team to go to Palus, it is not yet clear whether foreigners can work in the area.
Mr Sutopo, President of the National Disaster Office, said that Indonesian authorities will assess the situation in the request to decide whether international authorities will be allowed to contribute to the grant.
Given the frequency of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is surprisingly little prepared to deal with natural forces.
Although they have been built in Aceh for the tsunami, they are not particularly common in other coastal areas.
Although warning for tsunami was given, the apparent lack of tsunami warning siren increased the number of deaths likely to be observed.
Travelling between numerous Indonesian islands is also quite challenging at best times.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stopping to treat the victims of the earthquake in Lombok is headed to Palus, but it takes at least three days to arrive at the new accident site.
President Joko Widodo changed Indonesia's fragmented infrastructure to the central part of its electoral campaign and has distributed money on the roads and rails.
However, the budget deficits threaten Mr Joko's government, as far as the next year there are new elections.
In Indonesia, Mr Jokot is also pressured by tensions among fellow believers, where the majority of the Muslim community members have turned to the oldest form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands left their homes due to the fights between the Christian and Muslim forces in the streets where they used machetes, vibes, arrows, and other original weapons.
View: Liverpool Daniel Sturridge is hitting the link gate against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge rescued Liverpool from the loss of Chelseale in Premier League, slicing the status of 89th play minutes at Stamford Bridge, in a Saturday game in London.
Sturridge was eaten from Xherdan Shaqir, around 27 metres from Chelsea Gate when his team headed 1 :0.
He hit the ball on his left before he hit it in the remote direction of the mail.
The ball flew highly across the penal zone and hit the upper corner of the network.
It fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabala and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to get a position like this, get to the ball, and players like Shaq give the ball as much forward as possible, so I just tried to win as much time as possible for myself,” said Sturridge on the page LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I made a touch, and I gave a longer blow without thinking."
After the end of the first half, Chelsea 1 : 0 led to the gate of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in 25 minutes.
In this game, the Blues attacker fed the ball back to Mateo Kovaci before he turned around in the middle field and hit Liverpool.
Kovacic gave me a quick shot in the middle field.
Then he created a beautiful air feed, leading Hazard to the punishment area.
Hazard got through the defense and hit the ball with the left foot of Liverpool's player, Alisson Becker, along the remote post to the network.
Liverpool plays with Naples in the subgroup of the Masters League on Wednesday at 15.00 at Stadio San Paolo in Naples in Italy.
Chelsea faces the Videoton UEFA Euroliiga game on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The number of tsunami dead in Indonesia increased to 832.
In Indonesia's earthquake and tsunamis' deaths rose to 832, said the State disaster agency on Sunday morning.
A large number of people were trapped on Friday and 18 metres of giant waves brought together by 7.5 magnetic earthquake, and said the press representative of the Agency at the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho press conference.

The 44-year-old woman's body was found at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews on John Street.
The police are calling to contact people moving in the area who may have seen or heard something.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “It's just a very early start, but I would ask everyone who was near John Street and heard or saw something suspicious, to contact us.
I would also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers whose on-board cameras could record something, to contact us because they may have vital information for our investigation."
The police press representative confirmed that a woman found in a building was a local resident of Birkenhead.
This afternoon, a woman’s alleged friends asked questions about where she was found in the morning.
The investigation is underway, and the police said they were informing the women's relatives at the moment.
The taxi driver in Grayson Mews wanted to go back to the apartment, but the police told him no one could enter or leave the house.

The shape of Parliament's Cromwell is the last memorial which is the cause of the "Rewriting the History" dispute
The elimination of this would be a poetry of justice for the destruction of so many cultural and religious objects in the Taliban style of the man’s unhuman neighbours.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's recommendation as a foolishness and attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was impossible for Oliver Cromwell to remain in touch with the memorial mark before the Westminster Palace.
Cromwell did not take pictures of the English civil war itself, and did not tell others to do so.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell man was sacrificed for his ancestors Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent presentation of Cromwell is proof of the 19th century opinion and part of the history description of the person who, according to many people, should still be honored."
Mr Goldsmith said to the newspaper The Sunday Telegraph: “A lot of people preferd at the end of the 19th, rather than today, to protect the Cromwell Parliament from external pressure, and in this case, of course, to protect the kingdom.
It's an infinite historic dispute.
It is sure that the mid 17th century dispute has shaped the development of our people and that Cromwell clearly represents one side of this gap.
His achievements as the Lord's Defense also deserve celebration and remembrance."
With a killer, the Chinese peasant died.
According to local media reports, the farmer in southwest China attacked the pig that killed the man on the market.
The man who was identified only by the surname Yuan was found dead with the damaged artery and covered with blood near the liupanshu market in Guizhou province on Sunday, reported the South China newspaper Morning Post.
On 30 May 2005, the Seakeeper manufactured in the province of Qinghai in Xining, China to vaccinate pigs in its table.
He was allegedly coming from Yunnan the neighbouring province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, he found his cousin dead and found that the sideline was open.
He said there was a big, bloody mouth squirrel in the wilderness.
The investigation of an expert confirmed that 249,47 kilograms of slavery had been reported to kill the farmer.
“My cousin’s legs were all bloody and bleeding,” reported the victim’s cousin Wu’s words in the newspaper Guiyang Evening News.
The security footage showed that Yuan entered the market on Thursday morning at 04:40 in the morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found almost an hour later.
The animal that killed the man belonged not to Yuan or to his cousin.
The Market Manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up so that he could not attack anyone else until the police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market leaders allegedly discuss compensation for the death of a man.
Although rarely, it has also been observed that pigs attack people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in their Massachusetts farm.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 294,83 kilograms pounded to Wales's farmer's tractor until the man's wife frightened the animal away.
In 2012, when a farmer of Oregon had eaten his own pigs, one farmer of Manitoba told CBC News that the pigs would normally not attack, but because of bloody flavor, they could go out of their heads.
“They're just gambling.
They're very curious marrows whose purpose is not to hurt.
They just have to be respected enough," said the man.
Orkaan Rosa's after winds bring extensive rainfalls in the southwest of the United States
According to forecasts, the hurricane Rosa will weaken, moving across the norther coast of Mexico towards cooler waters.
Nevertheless, Rosa will bring rain attacks flooding over North Mexico and Southwest of the United States in the next few days.
Sunday morning, at 05:00 p.m., Rosa was classified as the first class of winds blowing 136,78 miles an hour in the east coast, based 619,59 kilometres southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
It's supposed to be Rosa moving north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a low pressure on the Pacific will emerge, moving to the east west coast of the United States, and on Monday, when Rosa approaches the tropical tormin to the Baja California Peninsula, it will lead the deep tropical moisture towards the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa arrives in Mexico, where it rains up to 25,4 centimeters.
The tropical humidity responding to the approaching low pressure then creates extensive rainfalls in the southwest of the country in the near future.
At the same time, 2.54 to 10.16 centimetres of rain are caused by dangerous sudden fires, flood water and possible paintings in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture causes an increase in the amount of rain to five and a half centimeters per hour, especially in South Nevada and Arizona.
It is also expected that between 5.08 and 10.16 centimetres of rain in certain southwest regions of the United States, especially in Arizona.
Sudden lights are possible with rapid deteriorating conditions due to the dispersion of tropical rains.
Certainly, if there is a risk of tropical rainfalls in the wilderness, you should not move on foot.
A strong rain may cause canons to become rapidly flowing rivers and occasionally outbreaking wind attacks and fluid dust.
The approaching low pressure brings acute rainfalls in the south-California coastal areas.
It is possible that the total amount of rain is more than 1,27 centimetres and may cause less flood water and slippery roads.
It would be the first rain in the region.
The tropical rainfalls will approach Arizona on Sunday late and Monday early morning, rainfalls will become extensive on Monday evening and on Tuesday.
Strong umbrellas reach Four Corner on Tuesday and stay until Wednesday.
In October, the United States predicts high temperature fluctuations caused by the cooling of the Arctic, while the temperatures remain high in tropical areas.
It sometimes leads to major temperature changes in small areas.
Sunday weather is an excellent example of significant temperature variations in the central part of the United States.
The temperature variations between Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska) as well as St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa) are almost 20 degrees.
In the next few days, he's trying to rebuild himself in a long summer warmth.
A large part of the Central and Eastern United States is expected to be expected to start the warm October with the temperatures of 80 soybeans around the southern plane to the northeast of the country.
In New York, on Tuesday, 26,6 heat wires are expected, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows that in the east of the United States the probability of high average temperatures in the first half of October is.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial looked at over 20 million people.
On Thursday, over 20 million people watched the confessions of the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman accused of sexual violence in the 1980s involving Christine Blasey Ford.
At the same time, the political conspiracy continued, where broadcasters interrupted the display of regular broadcasts to reflect the last minute of Friday: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake made a contract to the FBI to arrange a one-week prosecution.
Ford told the Senate Legal Commission that he was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh grabbed him drunk with his head and tried to rip her clothes off at the high school prom.
Kavanaugh's confession in his shrine was absolutely certain that it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen’s report, it is likely that more than 20.4 million people looked at the transfer on Friday.
The company calculated the average audience on TV channels CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other channels, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen is also usually having problems with calculating the number of people who look at the transfers in the authorities.
For comparison, it's about the same big audience as the final tournament games or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel's opinion leaders, who strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all networks on average with 5.69 million viewers throughout the day, said Nielsen.
With ABC 3,26 million viewers, the other one stayed.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, said Nielsen.
Interest became great after the trial.
Flake was the central character of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican bureau announced that he was voting for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras hit the man on Friday morning when he had fallen under the demonstrators' armour, trying to go to the judiciary meeting with lift.
He stood eyes down for several minutes when he was accused and it was transferred directly over in CNN.
“I stand right here, in front of you,” said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the state?"
He was said: “You have power, while as many women are completely intensified.”
Mr Flake said that his department issued a statement and added before the lift was closed that he had more to say at the meeting of the Committee on Legal Affairs.
Cable television and broadcasting networks reflected the direct transmission several hours later when the Legal Committee had to vote in order to send Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate Assembly for the vote.
But Flake said that he's only doing this in the sense that the FBI's next week investigating the charges against the candidate, which the minority democrats have demanded.
Flake partially persuaded a conversation with a friend of the Democrat senator Chris Coons.
After a later discussion with Coons and other senators, Flake made his decision.
The Flake decision had an effect, since it was clear that the Republicans would not be able to summarise Kavanaugh's voices without confirmation of the investigation.
President Trump initiated a FBI investigation on Kavanaugh's charges.
British Prime Minister May blames Brexit's critics for the political game
The Prime Minister blamed the interview given to Sunday Times on those who judge his plans to leave the European Union, the "political game" with the future of Great Britain and the detriment of national interest.
The British Prime Minister Theresa May will arrive at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview to the newspaper Theresa May, with former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, pressured Johnson to put his attack in the direction of the May plan of the Brexit, saying that the proposal for the United Kingdom and the EU to collect each other's tariffs is ‘firstly brain-free’.

The police arrested a man suspected of shooting a 20-year-old LSU basketball player at the death of Wayde Sims.
A 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned with a second-grade murder charge, said Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities published a video of opposition between Sims and Simpson, and the police added that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA, informed the CBS TV channel WAFB.

The coroner of East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report on the death of a bullet wound in the head neck area on Friday.
The department thanks the State Police Police Operations Group, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the South University Police and the people living in the area for the investigation of the aid that led to the arrest of the suspect.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the regional law enforcement bodies for "setting care and justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
A man of 1.98 meters grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball in LSU as well.
His last season's game average was 5.6 points and 2.6 table balls.
In the morning of Friday, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the whole team was "shocked" and "shocked" because of Wayde's death.
“This is something that you always worry about,” Wade said.
The volcano's blowing ash over Mexico City
Ash from the volcano called Popocatepetl has reached the southern urban parts of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Centre warned the Mexicans to stay away from the volcano, as the crater again began to record 183 cases of gas emissions and ashes in 24 hours.
The center picked up a number of noises and tremors.
The images shared in the social media were presented in the various parts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco, of the ash-coated car.
Geophysicists noticed an increase in the volcano activity of 72 km south of the capital after 7.1 magnitudes of earthquake raped the middle of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano named Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Before the anniversary of the independent vote, the police are facing collisions with the Catholic Separatists
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after the collusion of the protesters of independence with the martial law. Thousands joined with protests to celebrate the opposition vote against Catalan.
A group of disguised fighters, who were held back by the moist police, attacked the last eggs and powder colors, creating thick dust clouds on streets that are usually full of tourists.
The ruselus also occurred later when the police had to use them to control the fights.
Several hours of "No Forgiveness, No Forgivement" singers collided with the country's consensus promoters who called "Life Spain."
According to the local press, 14 demonstrations of medical aid received minor injury.
The efforts will continue in the area of independence a year later, when Madrid declared the referendum on 1 October to be illegal, but which were, however, celebrated by the Catholics in favour of resignation.
The voters decided overwhelmingly to benefit from independence, although the electoral activity was low, because the vote was largely ignored by those who opposed the withdrawal.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to prevent the vote against the entire region's electoral divisions, which resulted in violent collisions.
The self-esteemists had spent their night before the voting divisions in Friday night in order to avoid supporting demonstrations by national police.
However, the statements were made, but they had to take another way.
A 68-year-old electrician Narcis Termes, who participated in the demonstration of resignation with his wife, said that he was no longer hoping to see the prospects as independent of Catalanity.
“In the first year, one of the best moments of our life took place.
I saw my parents crying gladly about the opportunity to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite the important but small victory in the regional elections in December last year, the political parties to support the independence of Catalan have been difficult to maintain this year, since many of the most well-known leaders have either gone to exile themselves or have been detained and are waiting for a judgement over their part of the referendum and subsequently announced independence.
A 42-year-old mechanic, Joan Puig, who records a demonstration to support the police with his cell phone, said that the fight was pushed by politicians on both sides.
“The situation gets more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders, who have been in the preliminary investigation prison since the previous year, announced that he would attend the European Parliament elections next year.
“In the election of the European Parliament, the best way to condemn the recession of democratic values and the repression of the Spanish Government is,” he said.
Londonderry: The man was arrested because the car ran into the house.

Also, at some point, the car was shot in the direction of a bowl.
Menga strike gives Livingston 1 to 0 wins in front of Rangers
Dolly Menga's first gate for Livingston.
Edged Livingston open Rangers to lead Steven Gerrard to another loss in 18 games, when the man has been the manager of the Ibrox Club.
The Dolly Menga hit was decisive when Gary Holt raised the level to Hibernian in a second.
During this season, Gerrard will be won by the first league of the aliens and will be opposed to the leading Hearts, who will be landed by eight points next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday in Euroliga.
In the meantime, Livingston expanded his invincible attack to seven games, while Chief Coach Holt still felt the flavor of loss since Kenny Miler was replaced in the last month.
Livingston loses the chance for the visitors of the wrinkles
The Holt team should have run a long time before hitting the gate, as far as their immediate game style caused any problems to Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but his efforts were rising in front of the gate, where Alan Lithgow made efforts to catch Craig Halkett over the gate.
The strangers slowly let Rangers play in front of themselves, knowing that they could cause problems to guests in certain places.
And that's also the way a defining gate was hit.
Rangers gave up the free beat and Livingston had a chance to play the game Declan Gallagher, Robinson and Menga, who took the ball and succeeded in the middle of the punishment area.
By that time, the Rangers were predominantly holding the ball, but could not penetrate the protection, so the gate guard Liam Kelly was mostly calm.
The same pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos once forced Kelly to protect the gate.
The Rangers Gate Guard Allan McGregor blocked Scott Pittman's hit and Lithgow shined brightly in another teamwork in Livingston.
The strikes continued to reach Livingston's punishment area and were continuously swept away from it, and they also deployed two punishment strikes, one of them for attempting to replace the Halketti Glenn Middleton and another for touching the ball with the hand.
Fenomenal achievement from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont Tony Macaroni Stadium
Fenomenal performance and result from Livingston.
Each player was great, crossing the ladder, moving upwards with full expectations.
Their game style and players have barely changed since they returned to the top level, but Holt needs to be respected for how he has punished the team since they arrived.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was enormous, organising excellently organized protection while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the back of the game.
But the Rangers had little enthusiasm.
Notwithstanding their intermediate good level under the leadership of Gerrard, this was limited according to the examples here.
Their last possession of the ball was incomplete: access to the home was only once, which could function as a alarm bell for the Rangers in the middle of the table.
Contradictory response to Erdogan in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September), Berlin had both smiles and concerns when the heads of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast.
This is the last day of the controversial German visit by President Erdogan, aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They have been excluded from issues relating to human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city is the largest Turks community outside Turkey.
The police referred to security by banning the gathering of 25,000 members of the population before the Mosque, but many supporters appeared close to it to see their President.
Hundreds of Erdogan, a large part of which are deaf, also made their voice heard, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German Government's decision to host the President of Turkey in its country.
Fighting demonstrations show that the attitude of the guest is divided: some Turks living in Germany welcome him as a hero, while others despise a man as a self - ruler.
Traffic accident on Deptford Road: the bicycle died as a result of an impact on the car.
In London, a bicycle that smashed against the car died.
The collision took place near the Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street crossroads in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, about 10:15 a.m., according to the British summer season.
The driver stopped and the help arrived to give ambulance doctors, but the man died at the scene.
The collision occurred a few months after another bicycle died in an impact of almost two kilometres from the Saturday accident on Childers Street, where the driver who hit the bike escaped the scene.
The London police said that the authorities are involved in identifying a man and informing his loved ones.
In the event, traffic is closed and buses are redirected, and motor vehicle drivers are recommended to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six prison officers were injured in trouble
The prison office announced that six prison officers were injured in trouble in very secure men's prison.
The peace broke out in his Majesty Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at 09:30 p.m. and has not yet been completed.
One wing has been concentrated on the troubles associated with eight prisoners, and professional mammals have been involved.
Prisoners were treated with lighter face injuries at the scene.
“ Prisoners with special training have been invited to resolve the ongoing case in HMP Long Lartin prison.
Five crew members received medical care due to injuries.
We do not tolerate any violence in our prisons, the responsible are handed over to the police, and their prison sentences may be extended."
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the prison manager was sent to hospital after the prisoner attacked him.
In October of last year, however, a mob police force was called to prison to silence serious restlessness during which prison officers were attacked with biliary bullets.
The Orkaan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden fires (the orcan may be useful for the areas of the ground)
The tropical low pressure does not often hit Arizona, but this is likely to happen at the beginning of the next week, when a raging hurricane Rosa moves across the southwest of the United States of America, bringing the threat of sudden fires.
The National Weather Service has already arranged for a sudden follow-up on Monday and Tuesday in the West of Arizona, the southern and eastern part of Nevada, the southern part of California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaffi, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
According to the prosperity, Rosa heads straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching the area on Monday with rainfalls.
Phoenix’s National Weather Service blinked that “in 1950, only ten tropical Cyclones have preserved a tropical storm or low pressure levels in the radius of 321.86 kilometres from Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that passed 64.37 kilometres from the border of Arizona."
The latest models of the national orphan centre predict the rainfall of between 5.08 and 10.16 cm, which can reach Arizonas Mogollon Rim in limited areas up to 15.24 cm.
In other outer parts of the United States deserts, including the central part of the Rocky Mountain and the Great Witch, the number of rain is likely to be between 2.54 and 5.08 centimetres, reaching a limited area up to 10.16 centimetres.
Rosa’s rainfalls may be a blessing to the acute tolerance of the landscape.
Although floods are very worrying, such rainfalls are likely to be useful as the drought in southwest America.
According to the U.S. drought monitor, at least 40% of Arizona is extreme, or another category of drought, informed weather.com.
Firstly, Rosa Baja is above the island of California in Mexico.
Rosa, which was still on Sunday morning with the largest windlines of 6,43 miles an hour, is now 619,95 kilometres south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19,31 kilometres per hour.
The storm is exposed to the cooling waters of the Pacific, and that's why it's slowing down a little.
Therefore, Rosa is expected to arrive at the land of Mexico with the strength of the tropical storm on Monday afternoon or afternoon.
The number of rains in certain Mexican regions may be high, leading to a significant risk of floods.
“Baja from California to the northwest of Sonora may expect rainfalls of between 7.62 and 15.24 centimetres, reaching approximately 25.4 centimetres,” reported weather.com.
Then Rosa heads north of Mexico's tropical storm, reaching the Arizona border early on Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure that moves across Arizona and reaches the southern Utah on Tuesday night.
“A threat that follows Rosa or its consequences is a very strong rainfall in Baja California, the north-western part of Sonora and the southwest desert of the United States,” said the National Orcan Centre.
These rainfalls can cause life-threatening sudden floods and flood water in the deserts and paintings in the mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests related to attempted murder.
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested with a suspected murder after a 16-year-old boy found in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace region in Midsomer Norton on Sunday at 4:00 a.m.
The victim was taken to a hospital in a stable state.
A 17-year-old, 18-year-old and 20-year-old man was arrested at night in the Radstock region of Avon and Somerset, said the police.
Officials are asking to contact anyone who may have cell phone records from the case.
Trump said that Kavanaugh was "catched" under the Democrat Party of "anger and wickedness"
“The support of Congressman Kavanaugh is a voice against the unrestricted and unacceptable tactics of the Democrat Party,” Trump said his excitement speech in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh “carried” during his appointment process under the Democrat Party of wickedness and wrath.
Kavanaugh filed witnesses before Congress on Thursday, postponing the charges of Christine Blasey Ford, according to which the man attacked him several decades ago when they were teenagers.
At the meeting, Ford also witnessed his charges.
On Saturday, the president said that “America saw Kavanaugh’s glory, quality and courage on that day”.
The voice given to the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to appoint one of the most appreciative lawyers of our time with an impeccable background in public service," he said to the supportive population of West Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment, while talking about the importance of the Republic's electoral activity in the elections.
“Fifth weeks have remained until one of the most important election of our lifetime.
I don't apply for it, but in fact, I'm applying for it," he said.
"That's why I'm everywhere to fight for excellent candidates."
Trump argued that the democrats had a mission aimed at "to resist and prevent".
The first main procedural vote on Kavanaugh's application on the Senate floor is expected to take place at the latest on Friday, said to CNN by the senior leaders of the Republican Party.
The earthquake and the tsunami in Indonesia have killed thousands, the number of dead is rising
At least 384 people were killed and many were suffocated when the giant waves invaded the beach after the strong earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawes in Indonesia, the authorities announced on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had come together on Friday to the beach festival in Palu’s city, when at the time of the building, six-foot waves hit the beach, killing a lot of people and destroying everything left on the road.
Tsunami followed 7.5 magnitudes of earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people still did their activities on the beach, and did not escape immediately, in this way as victims,” said BNPB Press Officer Sutopo Purwo Nugroho Jakarta at the press conference on Indonesian disaster mitigation.
“Tsunami didn’t come alone, but took cars, logs and houses with him, wiped everything off the ground,” said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami traveled on the open sea at a speed of 800 km an hour before it reached the shore.
Some people climbed to the trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres of Palu.
The air photographs published by the disaster agency showed a number of destroyed buildings and stores, broken and collapsed bridges and mosses surrounded by water.
Consequences in the coastal city continued on Saturday.
A region with 2.4 million inhabitants had to know the wave of earthquakes.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Implementation Office (BPPT) stated in its statement that the energy released after a strong earthquake was nearly 200 times higher in Friday than the nuclear bomb landed in Hiroshim in World War II.
The geography of the city in the long and narrow Gulf could increase the strength of the tsunami, said BPPT.
Nugroho described the damage as “patient” and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, supermarkets and hotels have collapsed.
He said that some of the victims were found under the collapse of buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were lost.
Nugroho said that the number and damage of the dead could be higher than the 300 miles north of Palast in a coastal area called Donggala, which was closer to the earthquake.
Notices from Donggala “they are completely incomplete and contain no information,” said Nugroho.
“There are more than 300 000 inhabitants in the area,” said the Red Cross in his statement, adding that its team and volunteers are heading to the affected places.
“It is already a tragedy that can get worse,” he said.
The Agency was widely criticised on Saturday because it did not inform the tsunamist in the city of Palo, although the authorities said that the waves reached the beach while the warning was issued.
Amateur coachs in social media can see a man on the upper floor of a building that warns people on the path below for a tsunami approaching people.
I'll get the waterwall to the beach later, carrying houses and cars with him.
Reuters couldn't immediately confirm the accuracy of the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive interruption of electricity that prevented communication in the Palo region and made it difficult for the authorities to carry out rescue work.
The military has started sending transport aircraft from Jakarta and other cities to help, said by the authorities, but evacuators still need food and other basic needs.
The airport in the city was reopened for rescue operations, remaining closed until October.
President Joko Widodo intends to visit evacuation centres on Sunday.
Due to the Indonesian tsunami, the number of deaths increased over 800.
It's very bad.
Although World Vision workers from Donggala saferly arrived in the city of Palu, where they were hidden in the presents in their officeyards, they saw incredible sights on their way, said Mr. Doseba.
“They said that they saw many destroyed houses,” he said.
It's very bad.
While the aid forces strongly initiated disaster mitigation operations, some complained that the workers of foreign assistance organisations with great experience were prevented from traveling to Palus.
According to Indonesian rules, funding, stocks and support forces can only be sent abroad if the accident site is declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
“It continues to be a disaster at province level,” said Arrian, a press representative of the Red Cross of Indonesia.
"When the government says, "Okay, it is a national disaster," we can begin adopting international assistance, but this status has not yet been announced."
When the second night arrived, the Palm after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, the friends and families of the missing people were still full of hope that they were close to the wonderful cases that relieved the synagogue of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was lifted out of the sewerage.
On Sunday, saviors released a woman who was trapped two days next to her mother’s body.
The Indonesian national slider shield team coach Gendon Subandono trained two missing slider shields for Asia games that took place in Indonesia at the beginning of this month.
The rest of them trapped at Roa Roa's hotel are his students, added to Mr. Mandagi.
“I have a personal burden as a slide shield,” he said.
Mr Gendon spoke about how he desperately sent WhatsAppi messages to the competitors at the beach festival after the Roa Roa hotel collapsed.
But his messages were marked with only one grey bird instead of two blue birds.
“I think that means that the messages didn’t make it,” he said.
Vargad owned EUR 23 585,88 during the execution of the banking machine at the Levees Newport
In the morning of Friday, the thieves stole from the Brinki banking machine at the Levees, EUR 23 585,88, published in the Newport Police Department press release.
The driver emptyed the machine in the entertainment facility and manufactured to bring more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
When the man acted, “the other man runs behind the Brink employee” and stole the bag for delivery, which was full of money.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, writing a press release, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
All who have information about the early persons are asked to contact the Newport police on the phone (+01633) 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper takes his new name Ye
Rabbit Kanye West turns his name Ye.
On Saturday, the man wrote, “Former Kanye West.”
From the age of 41, Westi has been called by the nickname Ye for a while and the man also used the name as the title of the eighth album published in June.
The change takes place before his presentation on Saturday Night Live, where a man is expected to publish his new album Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grandet, who renounced his concert “tunnel”, said you will have the author.
In addition to the abbreviation of the man’s present name, West has previously said that it is a religiously important word for him.
"I think "ye" is one of the most used words in the Bible, which means "you" there," West said earlier, discussing the name of the radio broadcaster Big Boy.
“I am you, and I am you, and these are us.
I changed my name from Kanya, which means "this one", the name Ye, which is just a reflection of our good and bad, our confusion, and everything else.
The album is a more reflection of who we are."
Kanye West isn't the only rapper who plays his name.
Sean Combs is mainly known as the names of Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year the musician announced that prefers the names of Love and Brother Love.
Formerly co-operating with West JAY-Z has also used its name with and without a imagination, with large and small letters.
Mexican politician AMLO promises not to use military forces against civilians
At a time when the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the attacks against students, the Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised that he would never use military forces against civilians.
Lopez Obrador said on Sunday at Tlatelolco Plaza that “not ever use military forces to control the Mexicans. ”
The military attacked a peaceful demonstration on the field on October 2, 1968. Killed 300 people at a time when the entire Latin America had to carry the left student movements.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young mexicans, paying students monthly grants and opening more free national universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities draws young people towards criminal gangs.
The US should double the financing of artificial intelligence.
“When China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount allocated to research in this field,” said Kai-Fu Lee, a funder and an engineering intelligence agent, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments were published after the various parts of the US Government made statements on artificial intelligence, although the US does not have an official strategy on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, in the past year, China presented its plan to be an author for the modernisation of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"Twice the budget of intellectual research would be a good start, given that other countries are so much behind the US and we are working for the next artificial intelligence breakthrough," said Lee.
The double funding would double the likelihood that the next major artificial intelligence achievement would be made in the United States, said Lee CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinnovation Ventures, which funded one of the most outstanding artificial intelligence companies in China Face++.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University with an artificial intelligence system that won the best Othello player in America. Later he was a man in Microsoft Research and the president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee acknowledged the previous US Government's technology competitions, such as the US Defence Department of Research Projects Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next competition would take place to help identify the next dreamers.
“US scientists have to work hard to obtain funding from the government,” said Lee.
“China is not who takes over the branches, they are companies,” said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired enormous scientists from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could help the USA to support artificial intelligence efforts.
“I think that people who have received a doctorate in the field of artificial intelligence should automatically offer a green card,” said the man.
The Chinese Government published the next generation of artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
“The Chinese National Sciences Fund shares funding to people working in academic institutions similarly to the way the National Research Fund and other Government Authorities allocated money to US scientists, but the quality of academic work in China is lower,” said Lee.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence set up a connected industrial intelligence centre aimed at inclusive partners from both industry and educational institutions. However, the White House announced the establishment of a selected artificial intelligence committee.
This month, DARPA announced that it started financing the Al Next initiative with two million dollars.
But the National Research Fund finances research related to artificial intelligence at a rate of over $100 million a year.
At the same time, no amendments have been made to the US legislation aimed at establishing a National Security Commission for artificial intelligence.
Macedonians vote on a referendum on a change in national name
The Macedonians voted in the Sunday referendum on whether to convert the name of the country into the Republic of Northern Macedonia, which would also resolve a decades of dispute with Greece, which has prevented the confirmation of the declarations of accession of Macedonia to the EU and NATO.
Greece, where the province is named Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour represents a requirement for this territory and has prohibited Macedonia to join NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments agreed on the new name of Macedonia, but the opponents of the nations claim that the name would damage the national personality of the Macedonian slave population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he was not going to take part in the referendum and that the irregularity campaign has raised doubts as to whether the electoral activity will achieve the 50% level of participation needed to apply the referendum.
The referendum asks: "Are you in favour of Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU by agreeing with the agreement with Greece?"
The supporters of the nominal change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is the price to pay for Macedonia, one of the countries created after the collapse of Yugoslavia, to join organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I came here today to vote for the future of our country and for the young people of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, a 79-year-old in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough Members have said that they will follow the result of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority of Parliament is needed to change the name.
The National Election Commission said that there were no reports of irregularities at 3:00 p.m.
However, the electoral activity was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent of the previous parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of the registered electorates voted.
“I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted in the capital of Macedonia in Skopje.
On 30 September 2018, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica and their son, Dushko, voted in the Macedonian referendum on amending the name of the country, which would give them the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the Parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage, raising the tents to those who ignore the referendum.
“We want to be part of NATO and the EU, but we want to join our heads up, not through the door of the servants,” said Kavadarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they do not want us to be Macedonian, we can turn to other people, such as China and Russia, and become integrated between Europe and Asia."
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would generate the necessary investments in Macedonia with an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
“I believe that a large majority will support the change of name because more than 80% of citizens are in favour of EU and NATO,” said Zaev after giving their vote.
He said "yes-word" would be "affirming our future".
The results of the survey published by the Macedonian Political Research Institute on Monday revealed that 30-43% of the referendum is going to take part in the referendum, which is below the required electoral activity.
The survey conducted by Macedonian Telma TV revealed that 57% of respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them said you'd say yes.
The success rate for the referendum is 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failure of a referendum would constitute the first serious blow to the government's Western policy after the government took over in May last year.
See: Manchester City Player Sergio Aguero goes through all Brighton's protection for the gate
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling invaded Brighton's protection by guaranteeing the victory of Manchester City 2 to 0 on Saturday at the stadium of Etihad in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look like the gate he hit on the 65th game minutes came ridiculously easily.
The Argentine attacker passed the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He penetrated through three Brighton's defenders before he got to the open field.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He invaded another defender before he ran across several players at the Brighton Penal Code.
Then he hit the ball on his left where Sterling was.
The English attacker used the first shot to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right leg to hit the Brighton Gate Guard Mathew Ryan on the right side of the network.
"Aguero is a problem with legs," said Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola reporters.
“We said he was playing 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he created the gate at that time."
But Sterling was the one who gave Sky Blues the initial advance in the battle of Premier League.
The gate was hit in 29 minutes.
Aguero got a ball in this game clearly in the Brighton territory.
He sent the ball to Leroy Sane on the left side of the air nicely.
Sane got to hit the ball a few times before he drove Sterling beyond.
Sky Blues hit the ball on the grid just before it slipped out of the borders.
Manchester City plays with Hoffenheim in the subgroup of the Masters League on Tuesday at 12:55 Rhein-Neckar Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a cheerleader against Rockiese.
When the Nationals left out of the final tournament games, there was no big reason for the new start.
Scherzer, a fighter, hopes to kill Colorado Rockiese on Sunday, but only if Rockies, who runs NL West with one game to Los Angeles Dodgers, still have hopes to get to the final.
Rockies guaranteed at least 5-2 wins over Nationals on Friday night, but the team still wants to secure its first division.
“Although we do not play for anything, at least we can try, knowing that in this atmosphere with the audience and the other team, playing in Denver is probably higher than any other game ahead of me this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete here?"
Nationals have not yet called a Sunday opening player, but they are alleged to tend to Scherzer's eating in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be for 34th feeding, made on Thursday a warming and feeding routinely on Sunday.
This Washington right-handed player runs between 18 and 7, his ERA is 2.53, number of slashes 300 and favourable opportunities in his 220 2/3 in this season.
Trump's having a stimulation call in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation surrounding the election of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, while talking about the importance of the Republic's electoral activity in the elections.
“All we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before our lifetime is one of the most important elections.
This is a big event that I do not apply, but I actually apply, and I am therefore everywhere to fight for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You will see this terrible, terrible group of extreme democrats, and you will see this happening in front of your own eyes.
And they've decided to take back power using any means.
They don't care who they're hurting, who they're going to have to drive over in the name of power and control, the only thing they want is power and control over everything, and we're not giving them it."
Democrats are in his claim a mission aimed at "resistant and preventing".
"And you have seen it in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "hate, wicked, naked, and false."
He referred to the Senate Democrat member of the Committee on Legal Affairs, Senator Dianne Feinstein, who was shouted loudly among the audience.
“ Remember his answer?
Did you leak this document?
Uh, huh, what?
No, no, wait – it was one of the worst body language examples, actually the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Leiborist Party is no longer a great connection.
This is intolerable for those who express their opinions
When my local party Momentum activists voted to condemn me, it was not surprising.
After all, I am the last of the campers on the list of Members of Parliament to whom you are told that you have not welcomed, and all of this for publishing your opinion.
My colleague from Parliament, Joan Ryan, became part of the same treatment because he was strongly responsible for the anti-Jewishness.
In my case, the judges judged me for not consulting Jeremy Corbyn.
Responsible economic policy, national security and European issues, which are strangely similar issues, for which Jeremy was in disagreement with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Party Communication stated that “We would like meetings to be inclusive and creative.”
For the most part, the experience of my eight-year local camper with the meetings of the General Assembly on Friday evenings is exactly this.
Unfortunately, in today's day, this will no longer apply to most meetings, and the promise to be "love and generouser" in politics has long been forgotten when it was never remembered.
It is increasingly obvious that the different perspectives are not acceptable in the Leiborist party and that each opinion is assessed as acceptable to the party's board.
It began just after Jeremy became the leader. A co-worker with whom I thought earlier about sharing political views was waiting for me to change my mind and accept the positions that I would never otherwise have accepted, whether it was a matter of national security or the single market in the EU.
Whenever I step up publicly somewhere, whatever I'm actually saying, it will be followed by condemnation in the social media, inciting my revocation, ignored the party's policy and saying that I should not be part of the Leiborist party.
And it's not just my personal experience.
Indeed, I know that I have been more lucky than some of my co-workers because my comments are mostly political.
I admire the competence and decision-making capacity of those coworkers who face sexually or racist abuse every day, but never fall down.
One of the most disappointing positions in this policy area is how the levels of abuse have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Leiborist Party should promote a tolerance culture.
The reality is, however, that we are no longer such a great association and that every 'loyalty' initiative or election rules will become narrower than the party.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last two years to keep my head down, to talk less, and "then it's all right."
But I didn't come to politics.
From the moment that I joined the Leiborist Party as a school student 32 years ago, motivated by the neglect of the Government of Thatcher, which had literally left my great classroom at the edge of the collapse, I have tried to speak for better public services to those who most need it, acting as a minister of both the local council and the government.
I've never hidden my policy, including in the last elections.
There is no way that no one in Nottingham East was confused with my political positions or with the local leadership on non-consultation.
To all those who promoted the movement on Friday, I would like to say that if the country is moving towards Brexit, which damages households, businesses and our public services, I do not want to spend my time and energy, being loyal to the leader of the Leiborist Party.
But in fact, it is not the only message I have, for Mr Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, regardless of whether they belong to the Leiborist party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that not one threat or political consideration of the return is not stopping me from acting for what I think is in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Invincible Ayr moves to the top
Two late events may have somewhat led to the outcome, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves the first winner of this wonderfully entertaining Tennet too.
They're now the only unraveled team among ten at the front end of the table.
After all, it was the team's high level of protection and better risk-taking, which led to the home team and coach Peter Murchiel has a full right to be satisfied.
“We have been tried all the time during the games and we are still invincible, so of course I am happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie Melrose said: "I tell Ayrist, they used their options better than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14th game-minute test, taken over by Frazier Climo, gave Ayri an advantage, but the Scottish captain, Rory Hughes, who gave Warriors the game, gave Melros the yellow card a chance where Jason Baggot failed the attempt.
Climo increased Ayri's advances with a penal strike just before the end of the halftime, reaching a single event at the end of the halftime for the benefit of 17 to five Ayri.
But Melrose started the second half successfully, and Patrick Anderson's attempt to take over Baggot reduced the difference by five points.
Then there was a long delay due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knotti, after which the man was taken away at the cander station. In the course of the game, Ayr continued to increase progress thanks to Stafford McDowall's attempt by Climo.
Ayri tegevkapten Blair Macpherson was then with a yellow card, but the player of Melrose paid again for the failure of transmitting the test after strong pressure.
However, the team playing on the home field gathered strength again, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for preventing Climo without the ball, MacPherson put the ball behind the Ayris that were progressing.
Climo forwarded the ball, as he did almost immediately after the game continued, when Kyle Rowe tried David Armstrong's box and sent a side-defense Gregor Henry to go on the fifth test of the team playing on the home field.
Still Game Star wants to start a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game Star Ford Kieran seems to be ready to enter the hosting area, after finding that a man was appointed director of a recognised restaurant company.
56-year-old actress plays Jack Jarvi's well-known BBC TV series, which he writes and where he plays with long-term comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
A couple have announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series and it seems that Kiernan will make life after the new plans of Craiglang.
According to official records, he is director of the company Adriftmorn Limited.
The actress refused to comment, but Scottish Sun's source suggested that Kiernan would like to enter Glasgow's flourish restaurant business.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia without sea borders hopes that the court will reopen the road to the Pacific
Marines are patroling the Navy headquarters in La Paz.
Ocean blue flags floating above the buildings of the authorities.
For sea basins from Lake Titicaca to Amazon, a leading sentence is: “Meri is our right.
It's our responsibility to restore it."
In Bolivia without sea borders, there is a memory of the coastline that was lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century, still alive.
These hopes are sometimes the highest in recent decades because Bolivia is waiting for a decision to be taken by the International Court after five years of negotiations on 1 October.
“The spirit of unity and peace in Bolivia is a momentum, and the country is naturally waiting for a positive outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivia's diplomat.
The crowd of Bolivias across the country will look at the decision of the International Court on large screens, hoping that the Hague Court will decide to benefit Bolivia, after which Chile will be obliged to negotiate with Bolivia after decades of intermittent discussions in order to give the last independent way to the sea.
The Bolivia's charismatic presidency in the country, Evo Morales, who is waiting for a controversial battle in the next year, is considering a great deal in the Monday decision.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he swore at the end of August.
However, some analysts think that the court will probably not vote for Bolivia, or if, it would change very little.
The United Nations authority in the Netherlands does not have the power to surrender the Chile territory and it has provided that it does not determine the outcome of the possible negotiations.
The fact that only six months after hearing the final statements indicates that this was not a "complete case", said Paz Zárate, an expert in international law in Chile.
And as far away from the additional causes of Bolivia, the last four years may have deteriorated the situation.
"The problem of access to the sea has been robbed by the current Bolivia authorities," said Zárate.
Moralese’s warrior beauty talk has lost all the remaining Chile’s goodwill, he noted.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but after all, the debate will be extremely difficult.
Two countries have not changed their ambassadors since 1962.
The former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who is a representative of Bolivia in the Hague, rejected the idea that the decision-making was inadmissible.
Monday gives Bolivia a “special opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile” and the opportunity to end 139 years of conflict with mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most famous Presidents of Latin America, is using the marine issue to express political viciousness.
“Bolivia never abandons its right to access the Pacific,” she added.
"The reason is to see that we must overcome the past."
North Korea said that the release of nuclear weapons will not take place until the State can trust the United States of America.
Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho of North Korea said that his people will never give up nuclear weapons first unless they can trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Meeting.
He called on the United States to review the promises given to each other during the Singapore Summit by the leaders of competitors.
He comments on the case when US State Secretary Mike Pompeo almost seems to be reopening nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with the North Korean leader Kim Jong Uni.
According to Ri, these are air-storms, in the view that the US continues to restrict and refuse to terminate the war with Korea makes North Korea surrender.
Washington will be careful about such a statement if Pyongyang does not take the first important steps towards arming.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want another summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang intends to seriously give up armed practices, which the State is likely to see as the only way to ensure its own safety.
Pompeo intends to visit Pyongyank next month to agree on another Kim and Trump summit.
Paris Moe Rows bring to the viewer a series of massive headgears to buyers in their neighbourhood buyers
If you want to increase your hat collection or protect yourself completely from the sun, you don't have to look anymore.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne brought a series of strange headgears to the stages during their 2019 summer season, which blinded the Paris fashion week.
High and unpractical hats will be in the fashion of Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their striking creations to the way.
Valentino’s top was the overpacked beige hat covering the heads of the models, which was decorated with a remarkable wide extremity.
Other extremely large clothing included jewelry, magic hat and even ananasses, but their purpose is not to heat.
Also, Thom Browne showed the strange choice of masks, doing it exactly in time before Halloween.
Most of the colored masks were chopped up, so they reminded Hannibal Lecter more than high.
One part of the creation reminded me of the diving costume with air tubes and glasses, while the other remembered the melted ice cream.
And if you continue with the giant mournings, you're lucky.
Moegurts predict that superb headgears can also reach shopping streets near you.
The overwhelming hats are coming immediately on La Bomba, a 60 cm wide shoulder hat, seen in the head of all the celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
A largely unpractical hat created by the social media, a cult mark sent another large piece of work – a bracket of shoulders, which is almost the same as the bikini model.
The dark orange raffia bag, with raffia narmas and white leather sang, was in Paris in the fashion week Jacquemus La Riviera of the summer collection in 2019.
Luke Armitage, a celebrityist, said to FEMAIL: “I look forward to seeing large hats and beach bags in the next summer.
John Edward: language skills is important to the citizens of the world
Private schools in Scotland have remained at the forefront of the academic level of excellence and continued in 2018 with the following outstanding exam results, reinforced by personal and joint success in sport, art, music and other community activities.
These schools, where more than 30 000 students are studying all over Scotland and represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), try to provide the best service for their students and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, their chosen profession and their place as world citizens.
As a sector of education capable of designing and implementing a curriculum adapted to the conditions, we can see that modern languages are still well-known in schools and desired curriculums.
Nelson Mandela said: “When you speak to a person in the language he understands, it will come to his mind.
When you talk to him in his mother tongue, it'll come into his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot only rely on English if we want to create relations and trust with people from other countries.
From the recent examination results of this year, we see that at the front end of the tables, the languages for which the level of examinations is the highest among private schools.
Overall, 68 percent of the students who studied foreign language became a high result of A.
Data gathered from 74 SCIS schools indicate that 72 percent of students became mandarin grades A, the same prices became 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students.
This shows that Scottish private schools support the foreign language as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages that are now among the choices of the schools are the same in private schools and other schools curriculums as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
The study carried out by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 revealed that, among the reasons why employers are difficult to find workers for free jobs, 17% of respondents had no language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly mandatory to prepare young people for their future work.
To the extent that more hopeful job offers require language skills, such skills are becoming essential in the global world.
Notwithstanding the career choice made, the acquisition of another language will give a real advantage to a person in the future, as language skills are lifelong.
The ability to communicate directly with foreign citizens will immediately give a competitive advantage to a multilingual person.
According to the survey carried out by more than 4000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent of respondents do not speak any foreign language well enough to discuss this conversation. The only language with two-digit skills was French at 15%.
Therefore, funding for language learning is important for children today.
A number of languages, especially the languages of countries with an evolving economy, will provide children with better opportunities to find good work.
In Scotland, each school teaches different languages.
A large number of schools focuses on classical modern languages, while other schools teach languages that are considered the most important in the United Kingdom in 2020, such as mandarin or Japanese.
Notwithstanding the interests of the child, private schools always have the opportunity to choose between a number of languages taught by experts in their field.
Private schools in Scotland are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares and supplies children with the skills necessary to achieve success, regardless of what the future brings them.
There is no further denying that languages in the global business environment are essential for the future of the country, which must also reflect in education.
It is true that modern languages should be regarded as “international communication skills”.
Private schools continue to offer young Scottish people a choice, diversity and excellence.
Il faut bien faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
LeBron's doing his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
The eager admirers don't have to wait to see LeBron James make his debut in Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers Coach Luke Walton announced that James was playing in a Sunday seasonal open game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the number of her toys is still to be determined.
“This is more than one and less than 48,” said Walton Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell was shining that James would probably play a number of minutes.
After last week's training, James was asked about his plans for the six-game pre - season schedule in Lakers.
“I do not need my career at the current stage of the premature games to warm myself,” he said.
Trumpi Western Virginia election campaign event, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins his campaign event series tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is a campaign event scheduled for the next week by Trump from five, including stops in friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
At the same time as the approval vote stands until Trump chooses to appoint the Supreme Court for the free position, it will try to increase its support for the forthcoming interim elections, as the Republicans are threatened to lose control after the vote in November at the Congress.
What time is Trumpi's campaign event tonight in West Virginia and how to watch it online?
The Trump campaign event in Wheeling, West Virginia, will take place today on Saturday night 29 September 2018 at 7 a.m. on the east coast.
Trumpi Western Virginia campaign event can be viewed online through YouTube flow.
Trump is likely to speak of candidate Brett Kavanaugh's meetings this week, which became tense about sexual abuse charges, while the Senate's approval vote has been suspended for a week until the FBI investigates the matter.
However, the main objective of the series of campaign events is to help the Republicans, who are facing difficult elections in November, build a new boost.
Thus, President Trumpi’s campaign leader said that the purpose of these five events next week is to “speak volunteers and supporters if the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority of the events belonging to them in Senatis and in the Chamber of Representatives”, Reuters provided.
“Inspecting the Congress is so important for the president’s agenda that Trump is going to go to as many states as possible as possible during the season of the electoral campaigns,” said Reuters, a press representative of the Trump campaign who did not want to mention his name.
Today's campaign event, designed to take place at the Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling, can bring supporters from Ohios and Pennsylvania and also receive a reflection in the Pittsburgh media," reports West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday it is a second time when Trump visits West Virginia over the last month. It is a state where a man received more than 40 percent of the votes in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republic of West Virginia, the Senate Patrick Morrisey, who is on the basis of the surveys, runs forward tables.
“For Morrisey, it is not a good sign that the President has come to encourage his results,” said the University of West Virginia politician Simon Haeder, announced Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team has a nerve for the competition, keeping hopes high before Sunday alone games
After three unilateral sessions, Saturday afternoon game occasionally had just what Ryder Cup needed.
The fluctuating rotation point pendulum is a completely fictional concept of sport, but players believe in it really, especially in competitions like this.
So, where do they think the turning point would be now?
“They led by six points, which have now become four, so I think I can consider it a small turning point,” said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Europe has an advantage, it is clear because it is driven by four points and there are still 12 points in the game.
According to Spieth, the Americans feel that they have not enough wind in the sail, but they have much encouragement, especially Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each got three points out of four.
Spieth has been struggling for both the tire and the grain and shows an example.
The victory sacrifices from the throat became more and more loud with every round, concealing a presumptuous bug that would lead to a fourth match after he and Thomas were on the ground with two.
His pile that won at the 15th match sent a similar cry, showing a man's belief that the Americans aren't out of the race.
“You just have to play more focused and worry about your match,” Spieth said.
That's the only thing players can do.
18 holes to leave a trace.
The only players who have more points after the last two days than Spieth and Thomas have Ryder Cupi on undeniable stars in Francesco Molinar and Tommy Fleetwood
Europe is strange, but the loved couple is four out of four, and nothing can go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't hit bogey on Saturday afternoon, avoiding the bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back on 9 Friday mornings.
This game and the way their energy flows in such a noisy crowd, when it comes back, strengthens the opinion that players with whom are competing on Sunday, and that if the sun looses over Le Golf National, there is no way to confirm the European victory as the most famous player of Fleetwood or Molinari.
At the same time, both in different holes.
However, the talk about European glory is premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made Sergio Garcia, a four-ball hero in the morning, a quick job when a man was put together with Alex Noren.
In the first nine of Bogey and two doubles, they dug the Spanish and the Swedish into such a deep hole that they had no hope of digging themselves out of it.
But on Saturday, there's no one to help you out of the hole.
Four-balls and pair games are extremely close to looking at communications between couples, advice to each other, no advice and how five can change in the moment.
Europe, as a team, has so far played better and has become a strong leader for the last day, but this four session showed that the United States team is inclined to fight with the nerve that some, especially Americans, have doubted.
Europe is located in Ryder Cupi's last day 10-6 leading
Europe will be a good success in Ryder Cup's last day, after Saturday four-balls and couple games, leading 10-6 to the United States.
The great duo, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, led two winning Tiger Woods in difficulty to raise their score in Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European party, who contributed two years ago to the preservation of the pasture lost in Hazeltine, ruled after failure in the American side in the morning in four-ball, winning the 3-1 series.
The USA offered more resistance in a couple of games by winning two games, but they couldn't replace the shortcomings.
Jim Furyk's party needs eight points of the Sunday 12 single game to keep the cup.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner, who won four points in a row, together with Molinar, who, after the sovereign weekend, is called Molliwood, who has won four points in Ryder Cup's history.
After destroying Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls, they continued in the same spirit, defeating Woods and the American beginner Bryson Dechambeauveski more firmly: 5-4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, showed an accidental shine, but now he lost his 29 four-balls and a pair of 19, having seven losses in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested in four balls for the morning, returning to a couple game with partner Henrik Stenson, winning 2-1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are in the world order for the first and third.
Europe did not succeed, although the competition was held in a pleasant and windy weather south of Paris.
The three-fold great winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the Americans a benchmark of two points on Saturday.
They won 2-1 of the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-ball game, returning later and winning a couple of Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 after losing two opening doors.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history has the team returned from a four-point deficit, going to single games, although as owners of Furyk's half needs only a vibe to store the carcass.
Although two days were better than the second place, after a Sunday counterattack, it seems that they will not succeed.
North Korea says that "nothing" does not make them armed unilaterally because of lack of trust
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea told the United Nations that the continuation of constraints would deepen their infidelity against the United States and that the country would not, under such conditions, abandon its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
At the annual meeting of the World Organisation, Ri Yong Ho said that North Korea has taken "significant goodwill measures" over the last year, such as the suspension of nuclear and missile techniques, the dismantling of the nuclear test site and the promise not to disseminate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“But we do not see that the United States would have answered it,” he said.
"Untrustless to the US, our country lacks security and, in such circumstances, we are in no way willing to unarm ourselves unilaterally."
Although Ri repeated the familiar complaints from North Korea regarding Washington's opposition to a "continuous" approach to nuclear-freeisation, under which North Korea would be rewarded when taking progressive steps, it seemed important in his statement that it did not reject unilateral nuclear-arming, as Pjongjang has done in the past.
Ri referred to Kim Jong Uni and Donald Trump's joint statement on 12 June at the first summit held between the President of the United States and the leader of North Korea in Singapore, when Kim promised to move towards "renowning the Korean peninsula nuclear weapons" and Trump allowed security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea has requested the official termination of the Korean war between 1950 and 53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to relax the strict international constraints for North Korea.
"The U.S. demands "the first release of nuclear weapons" and increases the pressure on the restrictions to achieve their goal by force, even opposing the declaration of the end of the war," said Ri.
“It is a dream for people who do not know us.
But the problem is that the continuation of constraints will deepen our intrust."
Ri did not mention the plans for Kim and Trump's second summit, which was highlighted earlier by the U.S. leader in the United Nations this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the meeting between the three leaders of Kim and South Korea Moon Jae in the last five months and added: "If the issue of nuclear weapons would be one of the parties to South Korea, not the US, the subject of nuclear weapons in the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a doom."
However, Ri’s speech differed sharply from last year when he told the United Nations General Assembly that the return to the United States of America with North Korea’s missiles was inevitable after "Mr. Paha President" Trump called Kim’s suicide mission "missile man".
Last year, Trump, who threatened to completely destroy North Korea, in the United Nations, praised him for his courage to take steps towards unarmed, but added that there is still a lot to do and that the restrictions must remain in force until North Korea has abandoned nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no timetable for this, saying: “It takes two years, three years, or five months - it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia believe that the United Nations Security Council should reward for the measures taken by Pjongjang.
At the same time, on Thursday, U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo said to the United Nations Security Council that: “The enforcement of security restrictions must continue vigorously and without fail until we can fully and definitively confirm the release of nuclear weapons.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased the restrictions applicable to North Korea, seeking to prevent the financing of Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Riga next to the United Nations General Assembly and later said that he would visit Pyongyan again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, although the last trip did not go very well.
Following the meeting of July Pyongyang, he said that progress has been made, after what was understood by North Korea only within a few hours after “gangsterlike demands”.
North Korea allowed the launch of missiles and nuclear complexes at the meeting with Moon this month if the United States were to implement ‘conform measures’.
He told him that Kim had told him that under "conforming measures" it meant security guarantees allowed in Trumpi Singapore and moving towards the normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn how to rest enough
This year, the Harvard University offers a new course where students need to sleep more to fight an increasing aggressive culture, where they learn through overnight learning marathons in caffeine rich.
Students who love the academy of the world's best university are often helpless when they are fundamental to care for themselves.
Professor Charles Czeisler of this course, sleeping doctor at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, believes that this is the first character in the United States.
He encouraged the creation of a course after he spoke about how sleep disturbances affect learning.
“In this end, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why is this to me just now, in my last year of school?’
He said that no one ever told him the importance of sleep - it made me a piece," he explained to Telegraph.
The course, which came to study this year for the first time, explains to students how good sleeping habits contribute to academic and sporting results and also help improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, psychiatric professor and university health director of the Harvard Medical School, said that the university decided to take a curriculum after it was found that the students were in a serious sleeping evasion during the working week.
An hourly course covers a number of reciprocal tasks.
One part of the picture is presented in the common habitat. Students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports footwear and books, and explain how caffeine and light affects the effects of sleep deprivation and the importance of the practice of sleeping.
The second part explains how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
The university city map, together with interacting symbols, encourages participants to think about their daily habits.
“We know that does not change the behaviour of students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know about the health impact of cigarette smoking," added Professor Czeisler.
According to her, overnight learning marathons are still proud, adding that modern techniques and increasing pressure on students mean that sleeplessness is still a growing problem.
"Securing a high-quality sleep age should be a secret weapon of the student to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety," he added. "This will even help to increase weight, because the lack of sleep makes the brain hungry, making a person hungry."
A 19-year-old chemistry and physical biology student from California, Raymond So, helped Professor Czeisler to create a course when he attended one of his classes in the previous year of Harvard.
Raymond said that the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to help create a university-wide course.
As a next step, he wants all graduate students to carry out a similar curriculum before joining the competing institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set a wake-up clock for both sleeping and awakening, and that they should be aware of the harmful effects of electronic screens and LED light caused by the "blue light" because it could damage their daily rhythm and cause problems with sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: The Menga Gate defeated Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered from another poor guest game when Dolly Menga's hit by Steven Gerrard brought 1-0 to Livingston.
On Ibrox, he hoped to get his first guest victory since February, when 4-1 St Johnstone was defeated, but Gary Holt's team only caused Gerrard's second loss as a leader in 18 games, leaving Ladbrokes Premiership in eight points behind Hearts.
Menga created his gate seven minutes before half time, and the poor preparedness of Rangers couldn't recover from it.
So Rangers falls to the sixth position, Livingston rises to the third position, staying under Hibernian with only one gate.
For Rangers, the problems may not be over, because their attacker, Calum Spence, needed a head wound treatment after he got hit with the apparently thrown object.
Gerrard made eight changes on the side that led to Ayrist and Betfred Cup's semi-final.
But Holt went along with the same Livi 11 who took a point from Hearts last week and would have been satisfied with the way his well-trained boys choked their opponents at every step.
Rangers may have been more predominantly dominant, but Livingston did much more with his ball.
They should have hit the gate on second openings when Menga's first shift sent Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's gate, but the semi-protecter did not take advantage of his chance.
The deep Keaghan Jacobs free strike then found Captain Craig Halkett, but its defendant Alan Lithgow was able to make only a wide-arcing post.
The Rangers achieved control, but they seemed to have more hope than faith in the last third of their game.
Alfredo Morelos surely felt that he should've had a punishment strike when he met Steven Lawless on the 15th minute of play, Judge Steven Thomson did not satisfy the complaint of the Columbia player.
Rangers managed to make only two shots to the target in the first half, but Liam Kelly, the former Ibrox Gate Guard, was not concerned about Lassana Coulibaly's headline or Ovie Ejaria's event.
Although Livi's 34-minute open strike may have violated the rules of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it purely for their performance.
Again, Rangers couldn't control Jacobs' deep heavy performance.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher hit a ball for Scott Robinson, who kept his peace and chose Menga, who just took the plan to the end.
Gerrard acted during the interim, switching Coulibaly against Ryan Kent, and this exchange almost cost himself when the edge player cut off Morelos, but the impressive Kelly slammed his place to stop him.
But Livingston continued to attract guests to play exactly the type of game that fits them where Lithgow and Halkett picked up long balls.
At the end of Holt, McGregor could have promoted his leadership, but he was firmly standing by preventing Jacobs before Lithgow hit the corner with a big corner.
Glenn Middleton, the replacement of the Rangers, applied for a retreat when he went down with Jacobs, which Thomson did not satisfy again.
Almanahh: inventor of the Geiger counter
And now page of our Sunday Morningu Almanahhis: 30 September 1882, today 136 years ago and LOENDADES ... the day when the future physicist John Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity. It was an invention that eventually led to a device known as a Geiger counter.
From this science element, Geiger also became a pop culture platform, as in the 1950 film "Coronado watches", where in the main parts they were seem to be unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man, "What is this?"
Rogers: “This is the Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When wearing these ear valves, it is possible to hear the pottery of mineral atoms released from radioactivity."
Evans: “Don't tell me, it's just going to hang! ”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention bearing his name continues to live.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see more” fraudulent cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see more” deceptive cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to be familiar with fraudulent cells as part of treatment
The method includes the use of immunocells from the patient and the modification of these cells in the laboratory
Then they can “see” a common protein for many cancers and will be injected back.
The study vaccine shows promising results in patients with different cancers.
In a woman who was treated with an immune system with a vaccine that taught the detection of fraudulent cells, her ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method includes the removal of immunocells from the patient. These cells are modified in the laboratory so that they can obtain a “skin” protein that has spread to different HER2 cancers and then they will be reinjected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesdas in Maryland explained: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “directes the growth of many types of cancer”, including breast, ovaries, lung and colonectal cancers, explained professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach in which the immune cells are taken from patients and are taught to target cancer cells has been used to treat certain types of leukaemia.
Kanye West started with Trumpi's support tribe, carrying SNL directly in the MAGA hat.
It didn't go very well.
You will receive the Saturday Night Live studio in Kanye West, a degrading whistle cream, after his confused speech, in which he commended US President Donald Trumpi and announced his application for the same post in 2020.
After that night his third song, which was named Ghost Town, and where he was wearing the hat with a letter Make America Great, he began to be against the most defensive democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
“I have spoken so much to the white people who ask me, ‘How can you like Trump, is he a race?’
“If I was so concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago, ” he said.
SNL started the device with Matt Damon, where Hollywood's celebrity was joking about Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judges Committee regarding Christine Blasey Ford's alleged sexual violence.
Although this part of the show didn't go to the eeter, wester's noise scanners were loaded into a comic Chris Rock social media.
It's still unexplained that Rock was trying to look at the West post.
He also complained to the audience that he had a pretty difficult time behind the celebrities of his hat.
“They fooled me behind the stage.
They said I wouldn't go there, hat in my head.
They fooled me!
And then they say that I'm drowned in a place," he said according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: “You want to see a drowned place?
Try with love."
His comments triggered the illusion of the viewers at least twice, and it seemed that the SNL team was embarrassed. Variety said, “The whole studio remained dead.”
West was brought to the show at the last moment to replace Ariana Grande because the singer's ex-boyfriend Mac Miller was dead a few days earlier.
West amazed many of the songs "I Love it", when he presented it, he looked like a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the Head of the Conservative Group of TPUSA from Candace Turner, who shines: “To a single courageous soul: TIME, WHEN THE JULGES GOVERNED TO THE RAHVAMAS.”
But the escort director Karen Hunter's shining that West was just "the one who he is, and it's absolutely wonderful."
“But I decided to reward someone who believes and disseminates the world view of my community (in the form of my music or clothing).
He's free.
Like us," he added.
Before the show, the rapper in Twitter reported that he changed his name, saying that he was now “the former Kanye West.”
He's not the first singer to change his play name, following Diddy, who's also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Also the rapper Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion and, of course, the newly dissolved music legend Prince, who turned his name into a symbol.
Assassination of murder in connection with the lashing of Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with a murder trial after another man was stabbed at a restaurant in Belfast's eastern part on Friday.
According to the police, there was a case in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Court on Monday.
The prosecution will be reviewed by the public prosecutor.
Troons game fame Kit Harington does not approve of the guinea masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-flaming role in Jon Snowina HBO's violent medieval fantasy series of Troons.
However, an aggressive hero's stereotype (31) puts down, saying that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they have to be tough.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit thought that "something has gone wrong" and raised the question of how to solve the problem of masculinity of the plot in the age of MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his Troon game co-heart with Rose Leslie (31), acknowledged that he felt "very strong" that this problem needed attention.
“I personally feel quite strong at the moment that we have gone wrong with manhood,” he said.
“What have we taught men when they grow up in relation to the problem that we now see? ”
Kit believes that the rise in masculinity is partly due to TV because there are supermanial figures.
He continued: “What is born and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets gives young boys the feeling that they must be just like that if they want to be men.
I think it's really one of the bigger questions of our time - how to change it?
'Cause obviously something has gone wrong for young men."
In the survey, he also acknowledged that after the end of the series the next summer, none of the Troons would participate in the order of the game, saying that he was “together with their battlefields and horses. ”
Since November, Kit Sam will participate in the revival of the True West, which is a story of the filmmaker and his robbery brother.
An actor recently revealed that he considered meeting his wife Rose to be the best thing about the Troons game.
“I met my wife in this series, so it gave me my future family and my future life,” he said.
Rose played a fantasy series with Emmy in Ygritte, Kit's character Jon Snow loved.
A couple married in Leslie's family home in Scotland in June 2018.
HIV/aids: China reports 14% of growth in new cases
China has announced that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
Health care professionals say that more than 820 000 people suffer from this disease.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of the new cases have been caused by sex, thus changing the past.
In some parts of China, the HIV spread thoroughly through blood transfusions.
However, in this way the number of people infected with HIV had fallen to almost zero, confirmed by Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province.
Over the year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
The spread of HIV through sex is a serious problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was regulated in China in 1997, but the distinction between LGBT people is allegedly large.
Because of the state's old-fashioned values, studies show that 70-90% of men having sex with men will finally marry women.
Many disease transfers are related to insufficient sexual protection of such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has allowed overall access to HIV medicines to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denys the leak of the worker's GOP senator data, saying that it's "safety lies" and "safety claims" theories.
On Saturday, the U.S. representative Maxine Waters condemned the claims that his employee had posted three Republican US senator personal data on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
Los Angeles Democrat confirmed that such claims are distributed by "ultra-right" trolls and their websites.
“Vales, lies, and even more despairable lies,” Waters said in his Twitter statement.
The information published allegedly included home addresses and telephone numbers of the US Senators Lindsey Graham (South Carolina) and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch (some of Utah).
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday. It was posted by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during the hearing of the Senate Panel with regard to the claims of sexual misconduct against the candidate Brett Kavanaugh of the Supreme Court.
The information was leaked a bit after three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
The old-fashioned websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address, which detects the source of the post, was linked to Waters' office and issued information from the staff member under Waters, reported Hill.
“This unjustified claim is complete and absolute lies,” continued Waters.
“My employees, whose identity, personal data and safety are endangered by their fraudulent and false claims, are in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
This unjustified claim is a complete and irrevocable lie."
Waters' statement was quickly evaluated on the Internet, including one of the former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is due to anger,” wrote Fleischer.
“This indicates that he has an emotion that is not suitable for a member of the Congress.
If someone's been accused of something they haven't done, they can't get angry.
They can't be trotting.
They must not question the motives of the prosecutor.
They have to stay calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare the Waters response to the criticism of the Democrats against Judge Kavanaugh, who was too angry by critics during the Thursday hearing.
The candidate of Republicans Omar Navarro, who applied for Waters during the interim elections, also expressed his thoughts in Twitter.
"It happened when it was the truth," he shined.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had warned “the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities regarding their fraudulent claims”.
“We all do to find out about the criminals,” he continued, “and to put them legally in charge of all their actions that are devastating and dangerous to all my employees.”
Film Johnny English Strikes Again Overview - Underreserved Rowan Atkinson Spy Parody
It is now customary to look for the meanings of Brexit in all the new British films and it seems particularly appropriate in the parade of Johnny English, which started in 2003 with Johnny English, and started in 2011 as a result of the revival of Johnny English Reborn.
Are you humiliating about yourself about how clearly foolish we are in the new export option of the country?
In any case, incompetent Johnny English has been able to do things again in his handsome way - and that this wide comic creation is intended for film territories that speak non-English.
Of course, it is a secret agent who, despite his strange pretensive smudge glamour, reminds some of Clouseau, some of Mr Beani and a bit of a character who gave a tone to the Chariots of Fire's story at the opening ceremony of London's 2012 Olympic Games.
It is also based on a traveler of the character and an international mysterious Atkinson, who once played in the forgotten Barclaycard TV advertising, leaving only chaos.
There's only one or two pleasant moments in this last JE movie.
I liked the approach to Johnny English helicopter when he wore medieval iron cloth and helicopter wings for a second.
Atkinson's ability to make a physical comedian is seen, but humor seems to be less and strangely over-excessive, especially when "serious" spies such as 007 and Mission Impossible also provide self-confident comedians.
It seems that this humor is more meant for children than adults, and for me, Johnny English's intentional adventures are not both inventive and concentrated as Atkinson's dark films as Bean.
It is now an eternal presumption that Britain is in serious distress.
The cyber hacker has invaded the United Kingdom's high-secret spy network, exposing the personalities of all the British secret police officers, making a major disappointment to the local agent - a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last beer for the Prime Minister, who is a party and in distress, who suffers under the burden of political unpopularism: Emma Thompson does it greatly to the character of Teresa-May, but there is not much in the manuscript to work on.
His intelligence advisers suggest that since all active spies are threatened, he must call back someone who has retired.
And that means Johnny English, who now works as a colonist in a proud institution, giving secret lessons about being a secret agent: here are a few good places where English offers the School of Rock spy school.
English will be flyed back to Whitehall and reconnected with his former long-term partner Bough, who will be played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to the captain of the submarine, where the talents of the actress Vicki Pepperdine have been seriously wasted.
So Batman and Robin, his Majesty's secret service's disgraces are re-acting, meeting Olga Kurõlenko with a beautiful femme fatale with Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is dangerously falling under the hand of charismatic technology-billionaires, and it claims that he can solve all British computer problems: unhappy Jason Volta, who plays Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start with their janty odyssey: hiding as waitresses, they put a fire onto the French restaurant; they create chaos, smuggling the Volta luxury hunt on board; and English starts a genuine order when he tries to use the main set of virtual reality to get to know the inside of the former house.
In this last section, no brakes are used, but as sweet and stiff as it is, the whole thing is on the side of the children's TV maic.
Pretty mediocre stuff.
And as with the other Johnny English movies, I caught myself from the point of view: Does the British film industry really have no role to give to Rowan Atkinson that would be fair to his talent?
The Working Party refuses to draw up a plan where the British are working four days a week, but they are paid five days ago.
Jeremy Corbyn's Work Party has considered a reverse plan that provides that the British are working four days a week, but they are paid five days ago.
The party would like the company's superiors to forward the savings resulting from the artificial intelligence evolution (AI) to workers, giving them one additional free day.
This would be a three-day weekend for workers, but they'd get the same salary.
According to the source, this idea would fit the party's economic agenda and so it would be planned to hug the country for the benefit of workers.
Thursday working week has been approved at the Congress of Commerce, so that workers can use the changing economy.
The source of the Working Party said to The Sunday Times: “It is said that the revision of the draft will be notified before the end of the year.
“This is not happening overnight, but the Thursday working week is an effort that is compatible with the party’s approach to balance the economy for both workers and the party’s overall industrial strategy.
The Working Party is not the first to support such ideas because the Green Party allowed a Thursday working week during its 2017 electoral campaign.
However, the effort is currently not supported by the Working Party as a whole.
The press representative of the Working Party stated: "The four-day working week is not the party's policy and the party's not discussing it."
Vice-President John McDonnell used the Labour Party Conference last week to clarify his vision of the socialist turn in the economy.
McDonnell said that he has decided to take back the power from the "prospected leaders" of the communal companies and the "profit-services".
The plans of the Deputy Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of the water companies may not receive back all their shareholdings because the Working Party could make 'deductions' in relation to the perception of misconduct.
He confirmed his plan to put employees in company management and to create ownership funds in order to provide 10% of private companies' equity to employees instead of providing annual bonuses up to EUR 561,65.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are talking about "60 minutes" on the show whether the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The investigation by the FBI of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on the referendum to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question whether the findings of the Office could affect the termination of support for the Republican Senators.
In a Sunday interview, you're gonna have 60 minutes from Scott Pelley's Republican Senators, John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, asking if the FBI could reveal something that could make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"I said I was going to an interrogation, and I said I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charges came out and asked him, "Did you do this?"
He was decisive, sure and unimportant."
Graham's voice seems to be rocky.
“I am sure of my decision regarding Brett Kavanaugh and could only be changed in a bomb,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know how this happened, but I know that Brett strongly denied it," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And everyone he has called could not confirm it.
It's a 36-year-old thing.
I can't see anything new coming."
What is the global Citizens' Festival and has it contributed to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, the annual music event will be held by the New York Global Citizen Festival, which has an enormous impressive participation in fame and the same impressive goal: to lose poverty from the world.
Now the seventh time Global Citizen Festival sees tens of thousands of people in Central Park's Great Lawn not only to enjoy singers such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also to raise awareness of the real purpose of the event, which is the ending of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival launched in 2012 is the expansion of the global poverty project Global Poverty Project. It is an international lawyer group that hopes to end poverty, increasing the number of people fighting it.
In order to obtain a free ticket for the event (if you do not want to pay the VIP ticket), concert visitors had to carry out a number of tasks or voluntary activities, send an e-mail to some world leaders, call or do something else important to help raise awareness of their objective of eliminating poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen been if there are still 12 years to achieve their goal?
Is the idea of giving people a free concert is a real way of convincing them to demand action, or is it just another clicking problem where people feel they're doing something important, signing an application on the Internet or sparks?
Since 2011, the Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million "actions" for its supporters, trying to achieve a number of different objectives.
Accordingly, these measures have helped world leaders to inform more than $37 billion of commitments and policies affecting more than 2.25 billion lives by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group referred to 390 obligations and notifications resulting from their activities and of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The group appreciates the direct impact of guaranteed funds on around 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main obligations include the partnership between investors and implementers in the United Kingdom, The Power of Nutrition, which is committed to “to help children exploit all the capabilities of the child”, allowing Rwanda to give $35 million to help the country to stop underfood after over 4700 sparks from Global Citizens.
“In the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens, like you, we can turn subsumption into a historical line of social injustice,” said Ambassador The Power of Nutrition to the population of Tracey Ullman during the London concert in April 2018.
The group also announced that after more than 5,000 activities in the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of the mothers and children, the government announced the financing project of The Power of Nutrition, reaching 5 million women and children who need food intervention.
In response to one of the FAQ's websites, which says, "What makes you think we can stop extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: “This is a long and difficult road - sometimes we fall and fail.
However, as we face great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we are sure of our success, because together we are more powerful.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Card B, Janelle Monáe are only a few performers who will attend this year's event in New York, led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the naval "block" to prevent Russia's energy exports - Minister for the Interior
According to Washington Examiner, Washington may, if necessary, use its marine forces to prevent the capture of the Russian energy market, including in the Middle East, has been published by the US Home Minister Ryan Zinke.
Zinke argued that Russia's participation in Syria, especially if it works at the request of a legitimate government, is a pretext in the investigation of new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to intermediate energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, on the South European owl," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to solve it.
“The United States of America has this opportunity through our Navy to ensure that the sea lines are open and, if necessary, blocked to ensure that their energy is not placed on the market,” he added.
Zinke's statement was turned to participants in the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance of consumers. It is a non-profit organization that represents the voice of the US 'energy consumer'.
He went to compare Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, stating that they are essentially the same.
“Iran and Russia’s economic choice is more or less, enhancement and fuel replacement,” he said, while referring to Russia as a “one trick to a pony”, whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements will come at a time when the Trump Government is responsible for increasing the exports of natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, the officials of the Trumpi administration, including President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to expel the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, turned Berlin to Moscow "convicted".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion dollar Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which doubles the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is purely an economic project.
Kreml claims that Washington's strong opposition to the project has been driven by just economic causes and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool of pressure to publish and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose suppliers," said Russia's Minister for Energy, Aleksandr Novak, at a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US's attitude has been a retreat from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The German leading industrial organisation, the German Industry Union (BDI) invited the USA to stay away from the EU's energy policy and Berlin and Moscow bilateral agreements.
"I have a major problem if the third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, Director of the German Industry Union (BDI), following the recent German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren seriously weighs the presidential candidate in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday that he was seriously considering the candidate for president in the interim elections.
Warren confirmed his application in the Holyoke House in Massachusetts.
“It is time for women to go to Washington and improve our broken government, including the first Lady,” said The Hill.
"In November 6, I seriously consider applying to the President."
Warren also evaluated the activities of President Donald Trump in the district house, saying that he “will take the country in the wrong direction.
“I am seriously concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy,” he said.
Warren has published criticisms towards Trumpi and its candidate Brett Kavanaugh of the Supreme Court.
Friday's brilliant Warren: "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, the survey published on Thursday showed that most of Warren’s own voters do not think that they should apply in 2020.
According to the survey of the University of Suffolk's political research centre/Boston Globe, 58% of the 'probable' voters of Massachusetts believed that the senator should not apply.
32% supported such candidates.
The survey showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidate, 38% supported potential candidates and 48% opposed it.
Other high-profile democratic names, discussed with regard to possible candidates for 2020, include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden said it was officially decided by January, announced by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes Donald Trump at the gathering of Track Palin PTSD
Track Palin (26) spent the year in Iraq since September.
He was arrested on Monday night in connection with a domestic violence case and was accused of.
“What my son will live through, what he will experience when he comes back, I can connect myself to other families who know the consequences of PTSD and the wounds that our soldiers will return,” he told the audience at the gathering of Donald Trump in Tulsa in Oktahama.
Palin invited his son to be arrested as a "presidency in the room" and said in connection with his son and other veterans, "they come back a little differently, they come back in the way they were punished, they come back, thinking about whether there is sufficient respect for what soldiers and pilots and all the other soldiers gave to the state."
According to Dan Bennett, he was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and the press representative of Wasilla Police Department, he was accused of domestic violence against women, in the report of domestic violence and in the possession of a gun in drunken state.
18 states and the Colombia region dispute a new asylum policy
Eighteen countries and the Columbia region support the legal challenge for a new U.S. policy that prohibits asylum for victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
The representatives of 18 countries and regions submitted a brief statement of friends in Washington on Friday in order to support the call for policies relating to the asylum seeker, NBC News reported.
The full name of the applicant, Grace v. Sessions, was not published in the US Civil Liberties Union against Union policy in August.
The woman said that her associate “and her violent gang boys” abused her, but the U.S. officials did not accept her asylum application on 20 July.
He was arrested in Texas.
The national lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries producing large numbers of U.S. asylum seekers, among whom gangs and domestic violence are a major problem.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed the decision of the Appeal of Immigrants in 2014, which allowed unauthorised immigrants to flee domestic violence to submit an application for asylum.
In the Friday declaration, the Prime Prosecutor of the Columbia region, Karl Racine, said that the new policy “fails decades of national, Union and international law”.
“The federal law requires that all asylum applications be resolved in accordance with the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and that requirement infringes this principle,” stated a brief statement of friends.
In the short statement, the lawyers also argued that the ban on entry of immigrants would impair the US economy, saying that they would probably become entrepreneurs and “promote the necessary labour force”.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions commanded immigrants in June no longer to provide asylum for victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
“The application for asylum is available to those who leave the country because of persecution or fear in relation to race, religion, nationality, or a certain social group or political opinion,” said the Session in its Communication of 11 June.
The purpose of the asylum was never to mitigate all the problems, even all the serious problems that people face every day.
Entertaining rescue operations Request where deaths have doubled in the fight to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was becoming more and more threatening.
"The situation is very tense," said the 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, who comforted her fever in the evacuation centre of the town of Palu, with a small store.
“In every minute, new people with an ambulance arrive.
There's not enough clean water."
The inhabitants returned to their destroyed homes by sorting things that were flooded and trying to save everything they found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by 7.5 magnetic earthquake were overloadable.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris strangling his back and shoulder, rested outside the Army Hospital of Palu, where the patients were being treated in field conditions due to strong postures.
The tears filled his eyes when he remembered how a strong earthquake shaken his fifth floor hotel room, which he shared with his husband and daughter.
“Free time to save yourself.
I think I was pushed against the wall in the ruins," said Haris Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to him and my baby.
I hope they're not in danger."
The ambassador of the United States accused China of being "communicating with the work of advertising"
A week after the Chinese official newspaper published four pages of the US's daily news regarding the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the U.S. Ambassador in China accused Beijing of the use of the American press to disseminate propaganda.
The US President Donald Trump referred to the addition paid by China Daily last Wednesday in Des Moines Register - the largest tirage of the State of Iowa - in the newspaper after Chinese accusation of the US Congress elections on 6 November in intervention, which China denys.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to intervene in the US elections marked what the US officials described to Reuters as a new stage in the Washington enlargement campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is common that foreign governments make advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a growing trade war where each other's import tariffs are adapted.
The Chinese countermeasures at the beginning of the tariff war were intended to catch States such as the exporters of Iowa because they supported the parties of the Republic of Trump, the Chinese and US experts have explained.
The US Ambassador in China and the former Governor of Iowa, as well as the largest Chinese exporter of agricultural products, Terry Branstad, said that Beijing injured American workers, farmers and companies.
Branstad wrote in the Sunday Des Moines Register opinion article: “China has now doubled his temptation by publishing enthusiasm advertising in our free press."
“In disseminating its propaganda, the Chinese government uses American precious freedom of expression and free press practice, putting its payable advertising in Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the other hand, there are only limited voices in the Beijing street, and there are no real different opinions that the Chinese people might have on the worrying economic direction of China, given that the media is under the firm hands of the Chinese Communist Party,” he added.
He added that one of the most outstanding Chinese newspapers refused to publish his article, but he did not say what newspaper it was.
Analysts warn that the Republicans alienate female electorates before interim elections with Kavanaugh fiasko
While many Republicans are waiting and defending the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, accused of several sexual attacks, analysts have warned them that they will see a retreat during the forthcoming interim elections, especially women.
Feelings surrounding the situation have been in the ceiling, and most Republicans have already shown that they want to go further by voting.
These things cannot be taken back," said the professor Grant Reeher of the Political Sciences at Maxwell School at Syracuse University on Saturday published to The Hill.
Reeher expressed doubt that the last minute attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) in connection with the FBI investigation is sufficient to calm the angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow or November,” said the senior adviser of the progressive group MoveOn and the national representative of Karine Jean-Pierre Washington DC.
On Friday morning, demonstrators repeated the November coming to the Senate Corridor, because Republicans, who control the Committee of Judges, decided to go along with Kavanaugh's candidate, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"Democratic Indices and Inner Structures are going to remain out of schedule," said Stu Rothenberg, an informal political analyst for the newsletter.
“The people say it is already high, it is true.
But it may be higher, especially among female electorates in the suburbs, and among the youngest electorates aged 18-29, who often dislike and disvoke the President."
Even before Ford's public testimony, which described his claims of sexual assault against the candidate of the Supreme Court, analysts predicted a retreat when the Republicans were going on with confirmation.
“This has become very confusing for GOP,” said Michael Steele NBC News, former president of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of the last week.
"This is not just about the Commission's vote, the final vote, and whether Kavanaugh is appointed, but also about the way the Republicans have dealt with it and how they have treated it," led the Priorities of the United States (the group that helps the democrats to choose) to the head of Guy Cecil's attention to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to have been slightly divided, who believe in witnesses after Ford and who support Kavanaugh but a little more by first.
YouGov's new interview showed that 41% of the respondents believed in Ford's testimony, probably, while 35% said that they believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said that Kavanaugh must have lied during his testimony, while only 30% thought the same about Ford.
Thanks to Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the claims submitted by Ford and at least one of the other charges against Deborah Ramirez, announced The Guardian.
Ford confessed to the Senate Judges Committee last week that Kavanaugh attacked him when he was 17.
Ramirez argues that the applicant of the Supreme Court showed him his genitals when they participated at a party in Yale during the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventor intends to start a new internet that would stick a chest with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the World Wide Web inventor, launched a start-up company trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of the Technology Legend Inrupt is a company that builds the Berners-Lee open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and which people have been given access to information.
In an exceptional questioning to Fast Company, Berners-Lee made fun that Inrupt's goal is "world governance".
"We have to do this now," he said about the start-up company.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their "personal online database" or POD.
This may include contact lists, lists of tasks, calendars, musical collections and other personal and competent tools.
It is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, which is all available in one browser and simultaneously.
This personal online database makes it unique for the user to choose who can access this information.
The company calls it “to grant personal powers through data”.
According to John Bruce, Inrupt's idea is that the company would bring sources, process and appropriate skills to help Solid be made available to all.
Currently, the company consists of the security platform purchased by Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, some developers hired to work in the project, and a community of volunteers' coders.
Since this week, technology developers worldwide can create their decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to “Facebook and Google, whether to introduce a complete change when all their business models are fully supported overnight.
"We don't ask their permission."
On Saturday, in the post published in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s goal is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created on the basis of Solid."
In 1994 Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Technology Institute.
During the last few months, Berners-Lee has had an effective voice in the negotiating neutrality of the network.
Even when Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute will be founded and director.
“I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the web,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: opened the memorial stone of a clergy that was baptized in World War I Victoria
The only Church of England, baptized in Victoria during World War I, celebrated the 100th anniversary of his hometown.
Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann fought his prize on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But four days later, he died through a sniper bullet, and he didn't know he had received the highest British army mark.
His two grandsons opened a memorial stone on Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it would be "genically symbolic" if the stone would be opened exactly 100 years after the grandpa's prized fight.
According to London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin “through a very thick fog and rifles and ammunition guns.
Later, he rushed into the line of attack and moved it on with the “greatest galaxy ” before he rushed alone to a single shooter, and three opponents snapped out.
On October 4, 1918, the German sniper, Lieutenant Colonel, was killed by a German sniper, when only a little more than a month had remained until the end of the war.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather’s activity was “something I know that I can never repeat, but for what I always appreciate.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, set up a parade that was run by Brentwood's concerted youth band.
Michael Vann said that he “is very honored to participate in this parade” and added that“the presence and support of many people shows that the true hero is appreciated.”
The MMA fans were Bellator 206 to watch up all night, but you only saw the Pork Peppa.
Imagine you've been up all night looking at the Bellator 206, but you're not gonna see the main event.
San Jose's match included 13 fights, including six of the main cards, and it was shown on channel 5 in the United Kingdom throughout the night.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald made each other's breasts, UK viewers kept their mouths on a ammunition, because the screen appeared in Põrsas Peppa.
Many were not enthusiastic, especially those who had stayed awake until early to see this fight.
A fan in Twitter described the switch to children's comics as "somewhat hurting joke".
“This is the government regulation that at 6:00 the content was no longer suitable and they had to switch to the children’s program,” explained Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior Vice-President on marketing and communication, when the transfer was asked.
"Screw Peppa, yes."
Bellatori President Scott Coker said that they are going to work on their timetable to take more account of the UK viewers in the future.
“When I think about the reintroduction now, I think we can solve this problem in the future,” said Coker.
“But when it is 6 Sunday morning there, we cannot do it before our own Sunday, which is their Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program was modified, there was a lot of text back and forth and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical disorder.
But it wasn't, it was a government rule.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We're going to show a reference instead of six fights - as we usually do - to give more fans, and we just went over with time.
It's an axle situation."
Desert Island Disc: Tom Daley felt "subvalued" in relation to sexuality.
Tom Daley of the Olympic Winner says that he grew up feeling that he was lower than others because of his sexuality, but it gave him motivation to succeed.
A 24-year-old young man said he didn't realize until high school went, "Everyone's not like him."
By taking part in Lauren Laverne's Radio 4 in Desert Island Discs, he said he was talking about gay rights to give hope to others.
Being a parent also changed his view of winning Olympic games, giving the feeling that it was no longer so important.
You will receive the usual long-term broadcaster Kirsty Young had to take a few months off because of his disease.
In Laverne's first show, Daley told me that when she grew up, she felt less than the others, because it was socially unacceptable when you liked boys and girls.
He said: “As far as today, these emotions are that I am not worthy and feel different, giving me power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was worth anything, and he didn't disappoint others when they finally found out he was sexual.
The double winner of the pronx-olympia has become the leader of the highly-estimated LGBT campaign, using its appearance to the games of the People's Community this year in Australia to turn to more countries for the decrimination of homosexuality.
He said he was talking about it because he's lucky he can live openly without consequences and he wants to give hope to others.
The Triple World Master said that the fall in love with men - the American film artist Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013 - “wired him as a surprise.”
Daley married a 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he said that the age difference never was a problem.
“When you live so much while you are young,” he went to his first Olympic games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – then it was hard to find someone the same old who had experienced similar rising and joy.
In June, a couple got parents, they have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his "full outlook" has changed.
“If you had asked me last year, everything was involved in winning the gold medal,” he said.
“But you know, there are much more important things than the gold medals of the Olympics.
My gold medal of the Olympics is Robbie."
His son received his name after his father Robert, who died at the age of 40 in 2011 after diagnosing the brain tumour.
Daley said that his father refused to die, and one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets to London in 2012 because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, Father, you can’t sit in the front row because by then you’re no longer there,” he said.
“I kept his hand when he finished breathing, and only after he was actually finished breathing and dead, I finally acknowledged that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze.
“I just knew that it was what I had dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of the home crowd in Olympic Games, there’s no feeling better,” he said.
It also inspired her first song selection - Heather Small Proud - that helped her prepare for the Olympic Games and still creates her chicken skin.

Mickelson was removed from Ryder Cup on Saturday.
The American Phil Mickelson will make a record on Sundays when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to fix his form to avoid unhappy mail.
Mickelson, who plays record 12 times every two years, was removed from the game by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's couple and four-ball.
Instead of being at the heart of the business, as it has often been for the United States, the five-fold winner divided his day into two, being a stimulant and working on his game, hoping to improve it.
Never the most direct hitter, even not at the top of your career, is not suitable for 48-year-old especially to play on a narrow Le Golf National golf field, where a long harsh track punishes constantly misleaded blows.
And if the field itself is not scary enough, Mickelson will stand on Sunday, in his ninth competition, face the exact British Open Master Francesco Molinari, who has joined forces with the beginner Tommy Fleetwood to win all four contests this week.
If the Americans, who are behind 12 individual games at the beginning of four points, start fiercely, Mickelson's competition can be extremely important.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, but he had nothing else to add.
“He fully understood his part of today, smashed me on his shoulder, put his hand around my shoulder and said he was ready for tomorrow,” Furyk added.
“He is very confident.
He's a celebrity, and he's given as much to our teams both in the past and this week.
I probably didn't see him playing two games.
I saw more, but that's how it went, and we had to choose this way.
He wants to be out, like everybody else."
Mickelson passes Nick Faldo record on Sunday as the most Ryder Cup playrs.
It may celebrate the end of his Ryder Cupi career, which has never answered his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven fives, but Furyk said that his presence has given the team a further spiritual contribution.
“He is funny, ridicule, funny, he likes to have fun with people, and he's just great in the team room,” he explained.
“ I think younger players had a lot of fun going against him this week, and it was nice to see it.
He offers much more than just a game."
The European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great success may soon disappear.
The European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows from his experience that the great leadership of Ryder Cup's last day at the beginning of the single games can easily become an unpleasant experience.
The Danish appeared to the public at the 1997 competition in Valderrama, where, together with Captain Seve Ballesteros, five-point advances were held before the Americans, but when it reached the final line, it was drastically deteriorated, the victory was only achieved with 141⁄2: 131⁄2.
“You even remember that we had a great leadership position in Valderrama; we also had great success in Brookline, where we lost and where we won Valderrama, where we won, this victory came very close,” said Bjorn in the picture after Class of 2018 5 : 3 Friday and yesterday 10 : 6 Le Golf National.
So history shows me and the whole team that it can happen again.
You're going to do the best you can tomorrow.
You go out and do the right thing.
It's not over until you've got the points.
We have a goal, which is to win the cup, and we will therefore focus on it.
I've always said, focusing on 12 players who are on our side, but we are very aware of who are our opponents - the best players in the world."
Being pleased by his players on this difficult golf field, Bjorn added: “I will not rush in advance.
Tomorrow, there are totally new obstacles.
It's a lot of personal performances tomorrow, and that's why it's something else.
It's nice to be with the opponent when things go well, but if you're there personally, you'll be tested as a golf player.
That's the message you have to send to the players - do your best tomorrow.
Now that you're leaving your partner, he's got to go and do it himself."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk hopes that his players act better personally than with their counterplayers, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who received from four points three.
Furyk himself has experienced both of these last days, being part of the Brookline winning team before becoming part of the loss when Europe defeated the “Medinah wonder”.
“I remember every damn word,” he said as a reply to the question of how Captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999 encouraged his players to put all their games on the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you have to start fire, like in Brookline and like Medina.
If the hook goes in one direction, it will put a lot of pressure on average competitions.
"We set up our team accordingly and put the boys in the field in a way that we feel like this could be a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to run the competition, and he is best in response to Rory McIlroy, together with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the best Europeans in the competition.
“I put my boys in this order, because I think we are properly covered,” said Bjorn of the choice of our individual games.
Germany's new warship pushed again
The German Navy's latest rapid sailboat should have come into operation in 2014, replacing the old cold war warships, but this would not happen before the following year due to faulty systems and the cost of snowballs, local media reported.
The introduction of the new Baden-Wuerttemberk class ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ commander ship has now been postponed to the first half of 2019 according to the Military Press Releases published in Die Zei.
The ship should have joined the Navy already in 2014, but worrying post-transmission problems did not make the destiny of this ambitious project easy.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberk class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will be replaced by the aged Bremen class’s rapid sailboats.
It is understandable that they have a powerful cabinet, a number of anti-aeroplanes, and some hiding techniques such as reducing radars, infrared and hearing signals.
Other important options include longer maintenance periods - the latest high-speed sailboats should be able to be sent out from home for up to two years.
Continuing delays, however, mean that high-level warships, which allow Germany to strengthen the power abroad, will become older by the time they enter the service.
The unhappy F125 rapid sailboat appeared on the news last year when the German Navy officially refused to use the ship and returned it to the Hamburg Blohm & Voss Shipyard.
It was the first time the Navy sent the ship back to the shipbuilder after he got it.
The reasons for returning were little known, but the German media quoted a number of important "software and hardware shortcomings" that made the warship ineffective if they were used in the battle mission.
The lack of software was particularly important as Baden-Württemberk class ships are managed by a crew of about 120 seafarers - only half of the workers of the older Bremen class of explosive sailboats.
It also found that the ship is considerably overweight, reducing its performance and limiting the marine capacity to add future innovations.
The 7000 tons of "Rheinland-Pfalz" is probably twice harder than the same class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the poor hardware, the price of the entire project, including the training of the team, becomes a problem.
It has been said that it will amount to EUR 3.1 billion (EUR 3.6 billion) - compared to the original EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems related to the newer rapid sails will become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the German navy capacity will decrease.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German Parliament's Committee on Defence, acknowledged that the Navy had actually ‘exited ships eligible for exit’.
The official said that this theme has grown as a snowball over time because the old ships were removed, but there were no replacement ships.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttembers of the class's explosive sailboats could not join the Navy.
National Trust is investigating the secret life of bats
A new study in the mountainous area of Scotland aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to search for their food.
It is hoped that the results will provide new light on the behaviour of these unique mammals flying and will help guide future protective measures.
The survey of researchers of the National Trust in Scotland monitors the normal and soprane peppers in the Inverewe gardens in Wester Ross, as well as the brown long-distance and Daubenton leather mill.
Special recorders shall be placed in the main places of the area to monitor the operation of leather mills throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers also carry out field studies using hand-held sensors.
The competent assessment of all records shall determine the frequency and the activities of the leather coats.
There will then be a map and a report of habitats to create a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour.
NTS Nature Consultant Rob Dewar hopes that the results show the most important habitats for leather mills and how different species use them.
This information will help to determine the usefulness of habitat management, such as the creation of moisture and how best to preserve forests for leather mills and other related species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, the leather industry has declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect their habitats and their disappearance.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flying papers and chemical processing of some construction materials, as can be the attacks of pet cats.
The leather shields aren't really blind.
But because of their night hunting, their ears are more useful to catch the harvest than their eyes.
They use complex well-being techniques to identify insects and obstacles on their flight path.
Over 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land are very serious in the country.
They have ten trained experts who regularly conduct studies, inspections and sometimes save them.
The organisation has even created the first and only special bat reserve of Scotland in Threave in Dumfrie and Galloway, where eight of the ten types of bats in Scotland live.
Real estate manager David Thompson says that this area is the perfect area for them.
"We have a big area in Threave for leather mills," he said.
“We have old buildings, many old trees and a great place to live.
But there is still a lot to discover about the leather mills, so the work we do here and in other areas helps us to understand better what they need."
He stresses the importance of checking bats before starting maintenance in real estate, as the undesirable destruction of one place of pregnancy and childbirth may kill up to 400 mothers and young people, and even destroy the whole local population.
The leather shields are protected and killing, disturbing or destroying them are illegal.
Officer Elisabeth Ferrell has encouraged the public to contribute to the Defence Union of Leather Shields.
He said: “We still have so much to learn about our leather mills, and we just don’t know many of our species and how their surgicals feed.”
Ronaldo rejects the rape charges while lawyers are planning to sue the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has rejected the rape charges for him as a "debt", saying that people want to "promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers intend to sue the accusations of the German newspaper Der Spiegel.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping Ameriklanna Kathryn Mayorga in the Las Vegas Hotel Room in 2009.
He has allegedly paid women EUR 330 643,10 to avoid the incident, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
Turning to Instagram's direct video for his 142 million observer's half-hours of charges, Ronaldo (33) reported that it was “deceased news”.
‘No, no, no, no, no.
It's the wrong news today," said five times the winner of Ballon d'Or to the news.
They want to advertise themselves with my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous with my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and all right," added the player smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to appeal to Der Spiegel’s court in relation to “promising unacceptable suspicion in relation to privacy”.
Advocate General Christian Schertz said that the player is seeking compensation for “moral damage corresponding to the difficulty of infringement, which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged case occurred in a Suite in Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009.
After meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayor were allegedly returned to the player's hotel room where he was allegedly raped on the basis of documents submitted by the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell kneel after the alleged case and told him that he was “99 percent of the good man”, “one percent fails”.
The files say Ronaldo confirmed a couple of sexual relations, but it wasn't unanimous.
Mayor also claims that he went to the police and took photos of injuries at the hospital, but later he agreed to an out-of-court solution because he was afraid of "payment" and was concerned about "public reduction".
Now, 34-year-old women say that they are now trying to reverse the solution because the alleged case continues to traumatize him.
Ronaldo had left Manchester United during the alleged attack and joined Real Madrid, and this summer he moved to Italy with a giant Juve of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: The U.S. can begin to regret the leaving of car manufacturers forever
The United Kingdom would "two for eternity" if he lost his position as head of the world's automotive industry after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that the Toyota YK had told BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without agreement, it would temporarily stop their production at a factory located near Derby in Burnaston.
"We're looking for an agreement," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of the cross-border stands without the Brexit agreement can be paid for jobs.
The Burnaston plant, where vehicles are manufactured in Toyota Auri and Avens, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that when Britain starts leaving the EU at the end of March, we will see a stop in our factory production process," said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Burnaston Toyota.
Other UK car manufacturers are also afraid of leaving the EU without agreement, with concerns about the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says that the Mini plant in Oxford will close Brexit for a month.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are related to the risks of the supply chain in the absence of a Brexit agreement.
The Toyota production line operates as appropriate where the spare parts arrive from both the United Kingdom and the EU every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement concluded on 29 March, there may be disturbances on the border which industry has shown to cause delays and some shortcomings.
Toyota would not be able to keep more than one day's stock at its Derbyshire factory, so production must be stopped.
Clark said that the Theresa May Chequers plan for future EU relations was “calibrated precisely to avoid such controls at the border”.
"We want the best solution to enable what we want and not only to make use of the current success but the whole opportunity," he said to BBC Radio 4 today.
"The facts, not only about Toyota, but also about other producers, show that we must be able to continue what has been a very successful supply chain set."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term it warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and ultimately pay jobs.
For 24 years in Burnaston, a representative of Unite’s trade union Peter Tsouvallar said that his members are increasingly concerned: “We know from their experience that if they lose jobs, they will not come back.
The government press representative said: "We have submitted a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
The Trump meeting with Rosenstein can delay again, says the White House
Donald Trump's major contributions to the meeting with D.A. Rod Rosenstein may be delayed for another week, since the fight against the highest-level candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House has announced on Sunday.
Rosenstein monitors the work of Special Commissioner Robert Mueller, who examines the intervention of Russian elections, the links between the assistants of Trump and Russia and the possible obstacles to the presidential justice.
Whether Trump fires the Deputy Attorney General and thus threatens Mueller's independence, he has been launching the Washington rumors for months.
At the beginning of this month, New York Times announced that Rosenstein discussed the use of interrogation tools for recording conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the President through Amendment 25.
Rosenstein didn't confirm it.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, announced that he was going back.
Instead, on Thursday, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN in New York.
Trump said he did not want Rosenstein to be fired, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid coincidence with the Senate Judges' Committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, gave both hours.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation on charges against Kavanaugh, postponing the Senate vote.
Dr Trump's press representative Sarah Sanders showed up on Sunday's news technician Fox News.
When he was asked about the meeting with Rosenstein: “This date has not yet been set, it may be this week, but it may be delayed for another week, taking into account all the matters involving the Supreme Court.
But let's take a look at it, and I'll keep you informed of the press, as always."
Some journalists would argue that Sanders has not held a White House press conference since 10 September.
Ambassador Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the shortage of information hours was not due to the despair of the TV journalists, although he added: “I do not argue against the fact that they have been disappointed.”
He then recommended direct contact between Trump and the press.
The President makes more questions and answers than any president before him," he said, without adding evidence: "We have looked at these numbers."
Sanders confirmed the information lessons, but “If the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly from the President of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.
We are trying to do this a lot and you have seen how we have done it in the last few weeks, so that this will take place during the press conference if you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences with guests.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week, in New York, the President may have shown why, before the gathering of journalists, at a free visit and sometimes with strange appearances.
Minister for Health wrote to EU employees NHS in Scotland about the fears of Brexit
The Minister for Health has written to EU workers in Scotland's NHS to express the country's thanks and wishing for their stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman's MSP sent its letter when the United Kingdom has been out of the EU for less than six months.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the costs of the established status of EU citizens working in its public service services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “The summer has continued negotiations on the resignation between the United Kingdom and the EU, heading towards its autumn expected decisions.
However, the UK Government has also made preparations for a possible non-contractual scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for you.
That is why I wanted to repeat how much I appreciate every employee's contribution, regardless of his nationality.
Professional partners from the EU to the rest of the world produce valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare and benefit patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie passed emergency surgery after headache
Tennessee State Tigers support player Christion Abercrombie passed an emergency surgery after Saturday's headaches and defeat 31 : 27 Vanderbilt from Commodores, published Tennessee Mike Organ.
Tennessee State Chief Coach Rod Reed told the journalist that the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He fell on the village and just collapsed," said Reed.
Coachs and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the village before being placed on the cander station was taken away from the field for further inspection.
Tennessee State official told Chris Harris (WSMV - Nashville, Tennessee) that the Abercrombie operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center has ended.
Harris added that there are no details of the type/existence of the injury and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second year student with a red shirt, was in Tennessee State in his first season after Illinois.
On Saturday before leaving the game, he had five battles that totaled 18 matches this season.
Foreign buyers must pay higher stamp fees when purchasing property in Great Britain
The foreign buyers must pay higher stamp fees when they buy property in the United Kingdom using this extra money to assist homeless people on the basis of new Tory plans
This step makes Corbyn's effort to attract young electorals
The Temple Tax shall be charged to those who do not pay the tax in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance hopes it will create up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers must pay a higher rate of stamp tax if they buy property in the United Kingdom using this extra money to help homeless people, Theresa May reported today.
Movement is considered an attempt to disrupt Jeremy Corbyn’s effort to attract young electorates with promises to offer them affordable housing and target high-income people.
The Temple Tax is taxed on individuals and companies that do not pay tax in the United Kingdom by directing extra money to the government's desire to fight homelessness.
The premium - which is in addition to this stamp tax, including the higher levels established two years ago for purchases related to the second home and further lease - may be up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance hopes that this movement will create up to GBP 120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13% of purchased London property belongs to non-United residents, which raises prices and makes it harder for first buyers to get foot when buying housing.
Many prosperous regions in the country - especially in the capital - have become ‘building cities’ thanks to a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy will only arrive a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the temple tax to help young people acquire their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices when they purchase land but do not use it, and called on May to give up affordable home quotas in order to improve the british “a disgrace related to dwellings”.
Corbyn has announced the reform of the vicious housing economy, including the lease control and the end of the bullying of innocent people.
It also wishes to give the council greater powers to build new homes.
May said: “In the first year, I promised that I would be committed as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream - that life would be better for every new generation.
And that means improving our broken housing market.
Britain is always open to people who want to live here, work and build a life here.
At the same time, it is right that individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies located abroad, are as easy to buy homes as hard work on British residents.
For too many people, the dream of having a home has become too far away, and the harsh conditions of sleep are normal reality."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is management of Scotland"
Jack Ross, Sunderlan's leader, says, his "final goal" is to be the leader of Scotland at some point.
The Scotland (42) welcomes the challenge of revitalising the North-East Club, who is currently in the third position in League One, with only three points behind.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after taking St. Mirren back to the Scotlands League.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I reached class B, and that was limited," said Ross BBC Scotland to Sportsound.
“But I grew up with my father, looking at Scotland in Hampden, and it is always something that has drawn me back.
But this option will only come if I'm a successful club leader."
Ross' predecessors have been Head of Sunderland, Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former leader of Alloa Athletic says that he did not feel fear of such great and well-known names, having previously endured both Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, it's a success right now if I can take this club to the League of Masters."
Due to its structure and facilities, this club is undoubtedly part of the League of Masters," he said.
"Access is not an easy task, but I can only see myself successful if I can bring the club back there."
Ross has only worked as a leader for three years, prior to being Vice-President of Dumbarton and 15 months of Hearts' leadership staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from falling to a third level and turned the lowest position of St. Mirren into the winner of the next championship.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now when he was in his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was a real crossroads,” he recalled the takeover of Alloa.
“I truly believed that management would be better suited to me than to play.
It seems strange because I did it, got a reasonable income, and enjoyed a few moments at the top.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things to do every week.
I still experience this in terms of the tension and pressure of my work, but the management just seems more appropriate.
I've always wanted to drive and now I'm doing it. I feel more comfortable now than I've ever been in adulthood."

According to the study, the best time for the tape is Saturday at 17.30 p.m.
Summer warmth has improved the turnover of British pubs in trouble, but increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures showed that the turnover of pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, but the restaurants fell by 4.8%.
These figures were compiled by the CGA representative of the business consultation company, Peter Martin: “A longer participation in world championship than sunshine and England was expected meant that July was similar to June when the turnover of the pubs increased by 2.8 per cent, except that the restaurants became even more difficult.
In June 1,8% of the declined restaurants trade worsened even further in July.
Drinking-based pubs and bars were the most successful stores and the poorest restaurants try to please.
Food-based pubs also suffered from the sun, although not as dramatic as the restaurantkeepers.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
The sales of drinks between grey pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent over the month, while food sales decreased by 3 per cent."
Paul Newman, an analyst of leisure and hospitality, said: “These results continue to develop the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The effects of the weather and major social or sports events remain the biggest factor in selling outside the home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant chains continue to fight, although sales declines by 4.8 per cent compared to the previous year are particularly painful in addition to current price pressures.
The long and hot summer could not have come to a worse time for food business, and only time will show if the more moderate temperatures we have experienced in August give some essential relief."
The increase in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown of trade mark-related authorities.
The sales monitor of the Coffer Peach Tracker industry in the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyses the performance data of the 47 operating groups with a total turnover of more than GBP 9 billion and is the benchmark of the industry.
One of the five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
The study concluded that one of the five children, some of them 11 years old, have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers
20,000 gymnasist studies found the growth of “deficit Insta” pages
The news raised the fear of posting sexual content
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "basic account" for parents.
The study resulted that one of the five children, some of them only 11 years old, creates secret social media accounts that they hide from adults.
The study carried out among the 20 000 gymnasists found a significant increase in “deficit Insta” accounts (reference to the Instagram).
The news raised the fear of posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said that they had a “basic account” for parents as well as a “basic account”.
One discoverer of his 13-year-old daughter's secret paper saw that the teenager invited others to rape.
Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of the 11-18-year-olds had two profiles and half of them recognized the existence of personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, HMC leader, said: “It is annoying to see that so many teenagers are tempted to create accounts on the Internet, where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be a sports speaker in Scottish Athletics' board.

Breast pump advertising, comparing women with cows, distributes the internet to two
The company of the breast pump has shared on the Internet with two camps of advertising, comparing the sucking mother’s milking cows.
According to the talks, the technology company targeted consumers to celebrate the “the first quiet breast pump in the world” published similar advertising of Elvie’s ironic video in order to present the freedom that this new pump provides for mothers who want to live.
Four true mothers dance in a table filled with the hay, and sing with cows, and say, "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see my tail," and, "If you haven't noticed, these aren't owls, they are my breasts."
The verse repeats: “Pump, pump, feeding children, pump, pump, fill my ladies with milk.”
However, the advertisement published on the Facebook page of the company has produced contradictory views on the Internet.
77,000 video viewers, with thousands of comments, are in a different view, and many of them say that it illuminates the tentacks of the dairy industry.
“The use of animals for advertising of this product was a very poor decision.
Like us, they have to become pregnant and give birth to milk, but the difference is that children are stolen from them in counted days after birth," wrote one.
Elvie's chest pump does not snap from the breast-feeding chest to the eye (Elvie/Mother)
Another commentator said: “It is clearly traumatic for both the mother and the child.
But why not use these children to promote the breast pump of mothers who are still being kept?"
Someone added: Totally irrelevant advertising."
Some of it's for advertising, one woman thought it was amusing.
“I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd buy myself one if I were still breast-feeding.
Pushing milk made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but let's take it the way it is.
It's a brilliant product," wrote one.
The second commented: “This is a fun ad for mothers who pump and feel themselves as cows.
This ad does not praise or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveals that they've all been dancing in bras with no-speaking pumps.
The campaign idea is based on the saying that many women pump milk from breasts feel like a cow.
But Elvie Pump is completely quiet, no wires or pipes, and does not appear to be an eye of a breast-feeding chest, giving women the freedom to move, keep children and even walk outside when pumping.
Mother’s partner and ECD Ana Balarin commented: “Elvie Pump is such an innovative product that it deserves a bold and irritating introduction.
By comparing women's opportunities for expression and the cows in the dairy industry, we wanted to highlight breast pumping and all its challenges, while presenting an extraordinary liberty in the entertainment and familiar key that the new pump creates.
It's not the first time the news has recorded Elvie pump.
During the London fashion week, the mother of two children carrying Marta Jakubowski’s product appeared on the stage.
Thousands of Migrants' children went quietly to the Texas border to the telegraphy
The number of children in arrested migrants has risen sharply, although the monthly crossings have remained quite the same. Partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies enforced by the Trump administrator have made it difficult with the help of the sponsors to set up the children.
Usually, most sponsors are immigrants with documents and have feared to violate the possibility of continuing to stay in their country, in order to require the right to care for the child.
The risk increased in June when the national authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adults belonging to the household could provide fingerprints and data are shared with the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, senior Immigration and Customs Administration Officer, admitted to Congress last week that the Agency arrested a dozen people who applied for financial support for not accompanying minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested persons lacked a criminal history.
‘An additional 80% of sponsors or sponsors’ households are illegally present in the country and a large number of them are criminal backgrounds.
So let's keep tracking them," said Mr. Albence.
To deal with children more quickly, officials enforced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of arrest.
Many will protect their legal content before the Immigration Judge by means of a video conference to come to the scene.
Unsuitable for release shall be sent out of the country quickly.
According to asylum workers and on the basis of reports published in recent months - the longer the child is in custody, the more likely they become nervous or depressed, which may cause violent demonstrations or attempts to escape.
According to the lawyers, these concerns are more effective in large detention facilities such as Tornillo, where a fall in child’s difficulties can be missed by size.
They added that moving children to the campus without having enough time to get used to or to say goodbye to friends can cause trauma that many are already in difficulty.
Syria calls for the immediate departure of the US, French and Turkish occupation forces
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem invited Syrian refugees to come home at the UN General Assembly, although the country has been in war for the eighth years.
Moualem, also Deputy Prime Minister, said that the external forces on Syrian surface were illegally assaulted and dealt with accordingly.
“They must leave immediately and unconditionally, he said in the Assembly.
Moualem claimed that Syria's “war against terrorism is almost over”. Since 2011 more than 360 000 people have died and millions have left their homes.
He said that in Damascus, “the battle in this holy war until we have cleaned the entire Syrian territory” from both the terrorist groups and the“something of the illegally present external forces”.
The United States has around 2000 forces in Syria, mainly training and consulting both Kurd's units and Syrian Arabians, who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
In France there are more than 1,000 forces in the country of war.
Speaking about the warriors, Moualem said that the conditions for their return were appropriate and accused of unreasonable fears preventing the arrival of refugees in the West.
“We asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to help their neighborhood,” he said.
"They politize something that is merely a humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be given recovery aid until there is no war ending between Assad and the opposition.
According to the UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey, which creates the last rebel support point in the Idlib buffer zone, has created an opportunity to move forward with political talks.
The Russian-Turkey agreement prevented the widespread capture of Russian supportive Syrian forces in the province of three million inhabitants.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "self deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would hit the warriors of the Jews, including the Al-Qaeda-related Nusra Front, who would be "destructed".
Ambassador of the United Nations, Staffan de Mistura, will soon convincing the new Committees of the First Meetings of Government and opposition to design the post-war Syrian constitution and embark on the way to the election.
Moualem made demands for the Syrian Government to participate in the Committee, saying that the panel's work could be limited to reviewing the articles of the present Constitution and warned against intervention.
Why Trump is elected for another term of office
According to this logic, Trump could be won in the following elections in 2020, unless the post and scandal have been completed by its presidency, as probably by the liberal viewers.
Of which, undoubtedly, the most exciting ending of the presidency!
At the moment, the viewers don't show signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the top-hour ratings have doubled in CNN by more than 1,05 million and in MSNBC almost tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at the top hour. Compared to the four-year-old 1,7 million viewers, the number of viewers has risen. MSNBC receives the 3.5 million cable by The Rachel Maddow Show, the viewer has kept this rating high during the main evening news.
“This is the tension that we are involved in because we do not understand it,” said the ABC Drama Designated Survivor on the Secretary of State, who will be the President when the attack destroys Parliament’s building.
Nell Scovell, who has experienced comedy writer and the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," author, is another theory.
He remembers the pre-election taxi ride in Boston.
The manager told him he was voting for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" he asked
“He said he'd make me laugh,” Mrs. Scovell mentioned to me.
All this chaos has a sense of entertainment.
Obviously, not as the rest of the TV shows, Washington's rumors can become destiny to the future of Roe v Wade and to the families and the global economy of immigrants who want to reunite.
Avoiding the subject is merely the luxury of viewers.
But a six-hour talk of Bob Woodward's "basic background study" for his book "Fear" and Paul Manafort's 13 225,73€ costly jaanalinnuha Bomber jacket (Washington Post said this in "breathing clothes") and Stormy Daniels' thoughts about Mr. Trumpi's anatomy, the viewer is more than an educated citizen.
For example, I will never look at Super Mariod again with the same hour.
“One of his activities, which may seem to be a real life series, is that he shares something every night,” said the CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the "Panking Kings" series composer Brent Montgomery Trump with intermediate actors and day-to-day plans with the hosts of the NFL, praise Kim Jong-un.
You can't miss a squad or you're out of time.
This week, when Fleiss met at his house, there was 80 degrees warm on the north of Kauai, but he had been in the room to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't give up on seeing Brett Kavanaugh deal with the Senate Legal Committee and the fate of the Supreme Court hangs onto his hair.
“I remember doing all kinds of crazy show in our time, and people said it was the end of the Western civilization,” Mr Fleiss told me.
"I knew it was a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Other sources of money move to the most acute White House intermediate
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district will receive a cash flow due to the restructuring of the congress area, bringing two dominant companies to the same place.
As a result, the first number of the district of Pittsburg was re-elected from the Democratic Republic of Conor Lamb, who won the extraordinary elections in the previous spring in the second division.
Lamb's opponent is Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the previous Pennsylvania 12 division, which is in the larger section overlap with the new 17.
The cards were amended after the decision of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court of January, and the old divisions were therefore divided into anti-military constituent constituents, favouring Republicans.
The new 17th election has triggered a campaign in which the financial departments of the largest political parties - the Congress Committee for Democrats (DCCC) and the National Committee for the Republican campaign (NRCC) are drumped up with money.
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after the short winning many viewed in March Pennsylvania 18. Congress in extraordinary elections.
This place has happened by a Republican for decades, and President Donald Trump won 20 points in the district.
Political publicists have given the democrats a small advantage.
US El Salvador was punished for supporting China and then renounced
The diplomats noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama already acknowledged Beijing, which was a small retreat to Washington.
Mr Trump met with Panama President Juan Carlos Varela in a friendly atmosphere in June 2017 and owned a Panama hotel until the partners threw out Trump's administrative team.
The officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to return from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to the heads of the American diplomatic mission because Heather Nauert of the Ministry said earlier this month that these countries had recently ceased to support Taiwan.
However, only El Salvador was planned to be punished, who received aid from USD 140 million from America in 2017, including drug monitoring, development and economic stimulation.
The penalties proposed, including the reduction of financial assistance and visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American State and its high processing and the number of killings.
During the internal meetings, the North America and Central America officials postponed a high-level consultation aimed at security and economic prosperity in order to arrange a similar meeting in the previous year, which was seen as a development in efforts to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
However, in mid-September, high officials explained that they wanted to continue their consultation and to stop discussing any sentences of El Salvador.
According to diplomats, Vice-President Mike Pence will now be evaluated, who will speak at the mid-October meeting to talk about the government's positions.
And three American ambassadors returned secretly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without the new hard news or punishment of Washington.
The White House Press Officer, Mr Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss national discussions on anonymity.
Their discussions were confirmed by a close analyst to the government, who also spoke with anonymity.
Study history
The next may be that Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller will publish a report on the possible justice of Trump, which has many evidence in the state archive.
Mueller is also allegedly investigating whether the Trumpi campaign is related to the Russian attack on our elections.
If Congress is to change the party, Trump will have to report in this institution as if he would go back to talk to the electorates and perhaps even his elderly judges.
There are a lot of butters here, and I do not want to point out that Trump or his European prosecution is inevitable.
We all have to make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic that affects the duration of the fight.
In 1938, the German officials were prepared to reign against Hitler if only the West had prevented him and supported the Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We smashed and missed the possibility of avoiding the subsequent multiannual slaughters.
History moves around such turning points and the unloving way of democracy is getting closer or delays.
The Americans are now facing a number of turning points.
What do we do when Trump fires the Deputy Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in the spring water since it was announced that he proposed a secret recording of the President last year and speculated inappropriate for that post.
Rosenstein says The Times statement is inaccurate.
“How to react if Brett Kavanaugh’s newly requested investigation is not complete or fair - or if it is confirmed to the Court of Justice despite the credible accusations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And in particular, are we voting for the Congress in the middle elections if Trump should be responsible?
If these tests fail, democracy will take a long winter holiday.
But I don't think we're going to fail because we've learned from Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was convicted by Auschwitz, the same Nazi regime that ever took over and used our ambassador home.
He survived, moved into America, and 60 years later, he sent me a sabbath light on a table with a hammer.
With this legacy, how should I not be optimistic about our future?"
The Brookings Institution's senior official Norman Eisen, who is also the leader of the Washington Civilians Responsibility and Ethics Union and the book “The Last Palace: Europe's restless hundredth in the fifth life and one legendary housing” auror.
Rangers' Graham Dorrans is optimistic before the Vienna battle.
Rangers will organise Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that he will win over Australia, which was followed earlier at the beginning of that month on the impressive link against Villarreal in Spain, they will set a strong position to become a Group of the European League of G.
The knee injuries did not allow the middle player Graham Dorrans from the first appearance of the season before 2 : 2 games with links against Villarreal, but believes that Rangers can use this result as a jumpboard for better results.
“This was a good point for us because Villarrea is a strong opponent,” said the 31-year-old player.
“We went to the game, believing that we could achieve something and left the game with a point.
Perhaps we could have achieved more, but it was usually a fair result.
They were better at the first half of the game and we were better at the second half of the game.
Thursday will be another big and important European night.
Hopefully we get three points, but this will be a difficult game, because they got a good result in their last game, but since the people support us, I am sure we can gather ourselves together and get a good result.
Last year was hard, thanks to it, I was injured and there were changes in the club, but now we all feel good inside.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it; training is good.
Hopefully we can now move on, leave the last season behind and succeed."
Women cannot sleep because of the fear of pension insurance
Despite the fact that participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few discussed it with their family members.
About half of Nationwide's researchers said they were talking about long-term care costs with their husbands.
Only 10% said he'd talked to his children about it.
“The people want family members to take care of them, but at the same time they do not speak about it,” explained Holly Snyder, Vice-President of Nationwide’s life insurance activity.
However, this should be started.
Talk to your husband and children: You cannot prepare your family for care if they do not know your wishes in advance.
Work with your advisor and family, discussing where and how to get care, as these options can be extremely important in relation to costs.
Please consult your financial advisor: Your advisor may have a good plan to pay for their costs.
The opportunities for your funding in relation to long-term care may include, for example, traditional long-term care insurance policy, hybrid financial value life insurance policy to help cover these costs, or as long as you have the necessary funds.
Prepare your legal documents: Stop any possible legal battles already in the eo.
Get yourself a health care authority to determine a trustee who will monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals will follow you at your request if you are unable to communicate.
Consider also the trustee with regard to your financial assistance.
Choose a trustworthy person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid even if you are incapable of failing.
Don't forget the small details: imagine your old mother has a medical emergency and she's on her way to the hospital.
Are you capable of answering medicines and allergies related questions?
Write down these things so you can be ready if necessary.
“It is not just a financial side, but it is also important who would be doctors”,” explained Martin.
“What medicines are needed?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Put it all in place."

Federal prosecutors in NYC apply for a rare death penalty suspected in the terrorist attack
New York's federal prosecutors are seeking a death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of the terrorist attack in New York, where eight people were killed, and this rare punishment has not been executed for federal crime since 1953,
Saipov (30) allegedly used the Home Depot rental car to attack bicycle roads along the West Side roads on Sub-Manhattan, both on its way in October, both pedestrians and bicycles.
According to the report on the application for a death penalty in the southern of New York, the prosecutors must demonstrate that Saipov deliberately killed eight victims and also caused serious body damage.
In both cases, on the basis of the case-law, there is a possible death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal convicts across Saipov filed a 22-point accusation containing eight murder charges, together with the blackmail used by the federal prosecutors generally in organised criminal crimes, and the accusation of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack assumed "intensive planning and planning," said the prosecutors, describing the activities of Saipov "screepy, cruel and disgusted."
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco’s family and friends,” says the intention.
Five victims were Argentina's tourists.
The last death proceedings of the District Court in the South of New York have been over ten years.
The accused Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers, but as a result he was sentenced to life sentence in September 2009.
The last death penalty was executed in 1953 in Julius and Ethel Rosenberg’s federal case, when the couple was executed after the convicted conspiracy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an indigenous believer, showed lack of regret in the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he had told the investigators that he was pleased with what he had done.
According to the accusation, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack on the ISIS videos on his phone.
According to the police, he also wanted the ISIS flag to be issued in his hospital room.
In a 22-point charge, he hasn't taken charge.
David Patton, one of the Saipov national defenders, said that they were “selfly disappointed”.
“In our view, the decision to apply for the death penalty extends the trauma of all the persons involved in the situation without a lifetime sentence, without a chance to be released,” said Patton.
Previously on Saipov's defense team asked the prosecutors not to apply for a death penalty.
According to Mr Tory, NIGEL FARAGE should be appointed to lead the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage allowed the protest of today's Tory conference to "mobify the armed force".
The former head of UKIP said that politicians were supposed to feel the “hot” of Eurosceptics because one of the members of Theresa May's own Parliament recommended that they lead negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, a simple conservative sub-house leader, said on Marsil in Birmingham, that UK “was already outside” if Mr Farage was the secretary of Brexit.
However, Mrs May faces the problem of reconciling his deeply fragmented lines, which were highlighted by the conservatives who support the stay, joining in the city with his protest against Brexit.
The Prime Minister is in trouble keeping his Chequers plan on the track of Brexit's supporters, residents and the EU's attacks.
The allies demanded that they continue the transaction with Brussels despite the counterattack and force Eurosceptics and Liberals to choose between their package and "chaos".
Bone said at the Leave Means Leave meeting in Solihulli that he wanted to abandon the plan for Chequers.
He recommended to take Farage as a partner and to give him responsibility in the negotiations with Brussels.
'He's responsible, we'd be out by now,' he said.
Mr Wellingborough added: "I am standing outside for Brexit, but we must give up the Chequers plan."
In reflecting his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be subordinated.
We want to create our own laws in our country."
Mr Bone rejected the recommendations that the public opinion had now changed since the 2016 vote: "The opinion that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is not true."
Andrea Jenkyns, who supports Tory Brexit, was also on the marshal and told the reporters: “I say only one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Chequers plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular among our party and among our activists who actually go across the streets and choose us at all.
Please leave the Chequers plan and start listening."
With a message addressed to May, he added: “The ministers can keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage said that the politicians who were at the meeting must be put to feel "heart" when they intend to betray the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them, "We won't let it happen."
In his message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want you to make our political class at the end of the treachery of Brexit feel uncomfortably.
"We mobilise the national army of this country that gave us victory with Brexit, and we will not rest until we have reached independent, municipal, proud Britain."
At the same time, the residents marched through Birmingham before the two-hour gathering at the center of the city.
A handful of activists shined the "Products against Brexit" series after creating a group this weekend.
Lord Adon of Liberals mocked the conservatives for the security issues that became part of their party's application when the conference was opened.
“They are people who say that IT systems can be set up and the whole technology can lead to Canada and even more, a smooth cross-border, cross-border trade to Ireland,” he added.
“It is a complete farce.
There's no such thing as good Brex," he added.
Warren is seriously considering being a president.
According to US Elizabeth Warren, he is considering being a president after the elections in November
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future on Saturday at the West Massachusetts raehouse.
Warren, President Donald Trumpi’s frequent criticism, will apply for the following elections in November against GOP’s National Representative Geoff Diehl, who was Deputy Chairman of Trumpi’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
Speculated that he might become opposed to Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event at Holyoke was his 36th meeting with the electorates in the district after Trump joined.
The deputy asked if he was going to be a president.
Warren replied, “Women’s time to go to Washington and improve our broken government, which means that it is also on the front page.”
Arrested in the shooting of LSU Sims
The LA Police at Baton Rouge announced on Saturday that the suspect of the shooting death of the LSU basketball player Wayde Sims was arrested on Friday.

Simpson was arrested without incidents and arrested at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
Approximately two-metre young man Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games last season, 10 of them in the original composition, on average 17.4 minutes, throwing 5.6 points and taking 2.9 table balls per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship after the team record gave him victory over Sebastian Vetel
From that moment, it was clear that Valter Botta qualified for Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team's order plays a major role in the race.
Bottas became a good start and almost forgot about Hamilton when he first defended his position and invited Vetteli to attack his teammate.
At the first time, he went to the box stops and left the Hamilton group behind in a tight traffic that should have been decisive.
Mercedes went to the box stop later and came out after Vetel, but Hamilton went to lead along the side of the condition when Ferrari's leader left the inner side loose after the third curve attempt to protect it with a double movement.
Max Verstappen started the contest from the back of the square line and was the seventh place at the end of the first round for his 21-year-old birthday.
He then led the competition most of the time, traveling to the final of the rubbers and passing from Kim Räikkönen, taking the fourth place.
He finally drove to a box stop on the 44th round, but he failed to increase the speed of the last eight circles, which gave Räikkönen a fourth place.
It's a difficult day, because Valter did a good job all week, and he was a real gentleman passing by me.
“The man has done a wonderful job to have one of the two,” said Hamilton.
It was a very poor body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein on Saturday's gathering because he did not leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing the nomination of the Supreme Court in the sexual harassment of Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking of the West Virginia meeting, the President did not directly address the certificate given by Ford to the Senate Legal Commission, but instead commented on what was happening at the moment in Senate, which shows that people are “nasty, disgusting and false”.
“The only thing that may happen and is at present that the senate has happened in a few days is that you see anger and angry, wicked, disgusting and false people,” he said.
“If you look at press releases and leaks, they say: “Oh, I did not.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Do you remember his answer to the question ‘ Did you leak the document? ’ — Ah, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
Wait a minute.
Did we leak... no, we didn't leak," he added with the senator's face.
Ford sent a letter to Feinstein in July about the charges against Kavanaugh and it was leaked at the beginning of September, but Feinstein denyed that the leak came from his job.
The Hill reported: “I did not hide Dr. Ford’s charges or leak his story,” said Feinstein to the Committee.
“He asked me to keep confidential, and according to his prayer I did so.”
But his denial was not suitable for the president who commented at the time of the Saturday gathering: “You know what, it was a very poor body language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but it's one of the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to protect the candidate of the Supreme Court, accused of sexual abuse of three women, the President pointed out that the democrats used these charges for their own purposes.
“They have decided to take the power back without choosing funds.
They don't care who they're hurting, who they need to drive over to gain power and control," said the President of the Media.

Micronesia flight accident: Air Niugin's airline says one man disappeared after the lagoon flight accident.
Although they used to say that all 47 passengers and crew were evacuated from a safely drowning plane, the air carrier, who was headed of a plane crashing in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, now claims that one man is missing.
Air Niugini said in his statement that since Saturday afternoon they could not find one male traveler.
The airline said that they were working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find a man.
The air carrier did not immediately respond to the details of the passenger, such as questions about his age and nationality.
Local ships helped save other passengers and teams after the plane landed on the airfield of Chuuk.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still at the hospital on Saturday, but they were stable.
The circumstances of the accident and the exact chain of events are still unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said that the plane landed far from the lagoon airway.
Some of the Witnesses thought the plane was crossing the plane.
The American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said that the plane was flying very low when it landed.
"This is very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and the other passengers were able to suppress the drowning plane in the belt height to the emergency exit.
He mentioned that the cabin crew had panicked and screamed and had a little headache.
The U.S. Navy and sailors, who worked on the nearby yard, also helped to save people, using full - drained boats to take people to the shore before the plane crashed about 30 metres below the water.
Aeronautical safety network data indicate that 111 people have died in air accidents associated with air carriers registered to PNG over the last two decades, but none of them were related to Air Niugin.
The analyst will draw up the schedule of the evening when the woman was burned alive.
The prosecution closed the case on Saturday for a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Ministry of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett spent several hours as an expert in the analysis of intelligence data.
He brought out to the jury how he used the records of cell phone calls to reconvene the 29-year-old alleged victim Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim of Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said that he received location information from several mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers the night when she died, which was contrary to the earlier claims of a young man.
When the data showed that he had been with Chambers, the young man himself had argued that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, so the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford entered the courtroom on Saturday and admitted that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car, Sanford said that Tellis was lying because my car was in Nashville.
Another inconvenience was that Tellis said that he had known Chambers before she died about two weeks ago.
The records on the phone showed that women had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that some time after Chambers died, the Tell erased the messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
“He erased her from her life, ” said Hale.
The defense intends to make his trial on Sunday.
The judge said he thinks that the case would go to the jury after the same day.

Another black?
New York's granddaughter complains about a racist message for a couple of courts
New York’s nanny complains about the dismissal of discrimination in court after a couple of years of uncanny messages, where her mother complained that her babysitter was “continuous black”.
A couple deny that they're racists compared to extortion.
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed his anger when he found out that his new lasage care provider Giselle Maurice was black when he first came to work in 2016.
Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote a message to his husband, saying: "EIIIIIIIIIIII, MUSTANALINE"
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Miss Maurice.
According to the New York Post, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt uncomfortable after his prohmaka understanding to Ms. Maurice, claimed that their social custodian who was a African-American had done a bad job and he had been waiting for a filippinian instead.
Ms. Maurice was paid for one working day and then sent home with Uber.
Now Maurice is appealing to a couple of courts to get the reimbursement of what he wishes to receive every day in the sum of $ 350 for the next six months, and the same work he was initially hired to do, but without a contract.
“I want to show them to see, so to do,” he said to The Post, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
A couple have rejected the claim that they were racists, saying that terminating employment with Maurice was a reasonable thing because they feared that after insulting the lady, they could no longer trust him.
“ My wife sent her something she did not think of.
He's not racist.
“We are not racists,” said the wife’s wife’s wife Joel Plasco newspaper The Post.
“ But would you give your children to keep a person with whom you have been rude, even if it was involuntary?
Your newborn?
Come on."
Commenting on the comparison of extortion, Plasco said that his wife was two months away from the birth of the child and was “in a very difficult situation”.
“Would you go against someone like that?
This is not very nice now," added the investment banker.
Although the case continues, the public opinion has condemned a few quickly in the social media where they are highly evaluated because of their behaviour and thinking.
The new letter reveals that Paddington’s writers feared that the readers would not communicate with the speaking bear.
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bond, who was born immediately after the adoption of the book, said: “It is difficult to put himself in the shoes of a man who read it for the first time before publication.
It's very fun to know what we know about the great success of Paddington."
He said that his father, getting an inspiration to write a children's book about a little game bearing, worked as a BBC cameraman, would have been optimistic for his job to reject, and added that the 60th anniversary of the book was with a nucleus shield because of the death of his father last year.
For Paddington, whom he described as a “greatly important member of our family ”, he added that his father was quietly proud of his final success.
“He was quite a quiet man, and he was not a proud man, ” he said.
“But because Paddington was so real for him, it was as if your child had accomplished something: you are proud of them, even though it is not your achievement.
I believe he looked at Paddington's success in this way.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always acknowledged himself in Paddington."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
His daughter was taken to Nice Hospital, Louis Pasteur 2, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“They called regularly to say that the daughter’s condition was very bad and that they did not believe she would survive,” said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
“ Then I received a call from Nad, who said that my daughter will die in two minutes, and I must say goodbye to her.
And I did it.
I said: “Tashi, dear, I love you so much.
I'll see you soon.
I'll be with you soon.
The medications that the doctors gave him to keep his heart down, started to disappear quietly and leave the body.
He was dead a while before that, and now all the systems started to work.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing what's gonna happen.
I couldn't scream, scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep myself together."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperous, who now mourned his daughter, went to a plane with other passengers who did not know anything about his experience.
"No one knew that," he said.
“ I kept my head down and tears flowed all this time.
It's hard to explain, but on this flight, I felt a terrible pity for Nadi.
He needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her."
A mourning woman's postcards prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost their lovely suicidal raids work together to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have dressed cards on the Wales Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Miss Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he suffered from depression, and 18 when he killed himself.
“I do not want any parent to feel what I know every day,” he said.
45-year-old Miss Davis, who lives in Lydney, said his son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
“All knew about her smile.
They always said that his smile makes the whole room shine."
Nevertheless, he stopped working before his death because he “was in a very bad place with himself. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he had taken his life.
Mrs Davis said, "I am constantly concerned that it has a domino effect."
Ms. Davis created these cards “to let people know that there are people to approach and talk to, even to their friend.
Don't shut up, you have to talk."
Ms. Humphreys, who has been a friend with Mrs. Davis for years, lost Mark, a partner with his 15 years, not long after her mother died.
“He did not say that he was feeling bad or depressed or nothing,” he said.
“ We noticed a change in his behavior a few days before Christmas.
During the first Christmas, he was at his lowest point – when the children opened their gifts, he had no eye contact with them or anything."
Ms. Humphreys said that the death of a man was a terrible trauma to them, but they need to deal with it: “It tears the wound in the whole family.
It's gonna cut us apart.
But we have to go on and continue to fight."
If you have difficulties in dealing with it, you can call the Samaritans free of charge at 116 123 (Suurbritannia and Ireland), contact jo@samaritans.org or go to the Samaritan website here.
Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs on the hair while the FBI starts research.
“I believed that if we could actually have something that he wanted – a limited study of time and extent – we might be able to achieve unity,” said Mr Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the Committee would “collect” in the middle of the permanent partisan congestion.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate it?
Their opposition was due to timing.
If the Republicans do not go well, they are well weakened in their intentions to become the desired man to the highest court in the world.
George W. Bush has taken the phone to call Senators, doing lobbying work to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI presents its report?
The vote will take place in a senate with 51 Republicans and 49 democrats at the moment.
At the moment, it is not clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to give a decisive voice and affirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
The number of military runners under the Government of Kim “depresses” of North Korea
South Korea's legislation has been said that the number of North Korea's force runners to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, quoted by the Ministry of Harmonisation of South Korea, said that compared to the 2011 force runners (2706), the number of them has declined last year (1127).
Mr Park said that the main factors are stronger border controls between North Korea and China and a larger number of traffickers.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
South Korea citizenship has been offered to a large number of North Army runners.
According to Zeoul, more than 30 000 North Koreans have been illegally crossing the border since the end of Korea’s war in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest country border with North Korea and which is easier to cross than a strongly protected demilitarised area located between two Koreas.
China prefers to take force runners as illegal immigrants rather than as refugees, and often sends them back to the country with power.
The relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still in war, have improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the heads of two countries met in Pyongyang to negotiate the abolition of stopped nuclear weapons.
This happened after a historic meeting in June between the US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they generally allowed them to work towards the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, the Foreign Minister of North Korea accused Ri Yong-ho the United States of America of a lack of success in sanctions.
"Untrustless United States of America, our country has no security, and in such circumstances we are in no way willing to unarm ourselves unilaterally," said Mr Ri in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelos called Brett Kavanaugh "hysteeric" and said that he was unsuitable to judge the Supreme Court.
The Head of the Chamber of Representation Nancy Pelos appointed Judge Brett Kavanaugh as a “hysteeric” and said that the man is temperally inappropriate to serve as Judge of the Supreme Court.
Pelosi delivered an opinion at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, Saturday.
“I noticed inevitably that if a woman had appeared in such a way, she would have been called hysterical,” Pelos said about his reaction regarding the certificate given to the Senate Law Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotionally denying that he had been sexually attacked by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both teenagers were.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening speech, describing his family and high school years, at times he almost shouted and was occasionally unspeakable.
He also explicitly condemned the members of the Democratic Party in the Committee by appointing Hillary Clinton's accusations against the loss of presidential elections in 2016 as organised “grotesque and coordinated main murder”.
According to Pelos, he believes that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that the man is not fit for judges of the Supreme Court because it showed that he was hit against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with their statements and the way he attacked Clintons and Democrats,” he said.
Pelos remained modest when he was asked whether he would try to withdraw Kavanaugh if he had to get the majority of the Democrats in the House of Representatives.
“I say so much – unless he tells the truth to Congress or the FBI, he fits not only as the Judge of the Supreme Court but also in the court where he is now working,” said Pelos.
Kavanaugh is currently the judge of the appeal court of the Columbia District.
Pelos added that as a democrat, he is concerned about the decisions against Kavanaugh's possible Affordable Care Act (Health Act — Comment of the Interpreter) or Roe v Wade (Abort’s legitimacy Judge — a comment of the translator) as a conservative judge.
At his confirmation session, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would revoke some of the Supreme Court’s decisions.
“It is not now a time for a hysterical person to become a judge and expect us to say that isn’t nice,” said Pelos.
And women have to wear it.
It's a fair expression, an overflowing hatred of months and years, and it won't get away with it.
“We cry when we get angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do I?"
He continued: “I got help from a woman who was in charge; he said that he was crying when he became angry, but he developed a method that stood up when he became angry and started crying, and he said to a man he was talking to, “You can think that I would cry because I am sad.
I'm angry."
And he just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are partially accepted as an outrage because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories is from an early job in a majority of men's office where I once found myself crying out of a rage, when one older woman — a strict leader I had always feared — grabbed me from the collar and dragged me to the stairs.
"Don't ever show them how to cry," he told me.
“They don’t know that you are furious.
They think you're sad and it'll give them satisfaction."
Patricia Schroeder, the congressman of the Democratic Party of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in the presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart intervened on board a hunt called Monkey Business and ended the campaign, Schroeder, who was deeply upset, thought that there was no reason for him to think about being a president himself.
“It wasn’t a well-designed decision, ” he said to me by laughing 30 years later.
"Juba applied for seven candidates, and the last thing they needed was joining someone else."
Someone said it's like "Snow White and seven thumb boys."
Since the campaign was over, he was late to collect money, and he promised not to apply if he didn't get two million dollars.
It was a hopeless battle.
He discovered that some of his supporters who gave the men $1,000 gave him just $250.
"Do they think I'm getting an advantage?" he said.
When he held a speech in which he announced that he did not launch an official campaign, the feelings — the feeling of gratitude for people who supported him — the irritation of the system that made it difficult to return to the money collection and to the electorate instead of the delegations — and the anger for sexism — he was so overcome that he had tears in the throat.
“You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown, ” recalled Schroeder’s press reaction against him.
“You could have thought that Kleenex was my sponsor company.
I remember thinking about what they write on my tombstone.
"He cried?"
How the US-China Trade War can benefit Beijing
The opening breaks between the US and China were complaining, and although the battle is far from over, experts say that the cross-border gap in Beijing can be useful in the long term.
The President of the United States Donald Trump made a first warning this year by setting taxes on important Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation took place this week with new tariffs for a value of USD 200 billion (150 ml of GBP), putting in place essentially taxes on goods coming from China to the USA.
Beijing has answered the same thing every time, spreading the last five to ten percent tariffs at a value of $60 billion to the American goods.
China has promised the US to respond, and the second size of the world is likely to not blink soon.
Getting back to Washington would mean resignation of demands, but publicly worshiping before the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, the experts argue that, if Beijing’s cards go out correctly, trade war with the USA can support China in the long term by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that cause the loss of control over the economy in another country is actually much more dangerous than the outsiders have previously acknowledged,” said scientist Abigail Grace, who focuses on the Asian investigation at the Center for New American Security.
According to the Foreign Minister, Syria is ready to return refugees
According to Syria, the country is ready to return to volunteer refugees and asks for the reconstruction of the country after more than seven years of war.
When speaking with the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country would improve.
“The situation is now more stable and secure in the territory of the country thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government will continue to restore normality to the destroyed regions of the terrorists.
There are now all the conditions for refugees who have left the country because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures affecting everyday life and living, to return voluntarily.
According to UN forecasts, 5,5 million Syrians have fled from the country since the war started in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would be happy to accept aid for the construction of a devastated state.
At the same time, he stressed that the State did not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe took the Ryder Cup Competition races in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup Competitions in 2018, defeating the Le Golf National golf course in France near Paris with the end result of 16.5 vs 10.5.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on the European surface and has not won Ryder’s carcass in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn's team received 14,5 points to win the United States.
During the whole tournament, the United States star Phil Mickelson swinged a brick on a par-3 track 16 waters, giving the victory to Francesco Molinar.
Italian golfer Molinari shines in all his rounds, becoming one of the four players who have achieved the tournament in the current 1979 format 5 : 0 : 0.
To the American Jordan Spieth, 5+4 was done by the lowest dancer in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen.
The world's best player, Dustin Johnson, promoted an English Ian Poulter with two and one, who might have been the last of the Ryder Carnival Championship.
Eight of Ryder's Cup Competition veterans, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the most winning European in all the time.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t hold back.
It's been a hard year.
I'm grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy, so happy we got the cup back.
This is about the team's spirit, and I am glad to be helpful," said the emotional Garcia for Europe's victory.
He's giving the tortoise to a compatriot Jon Rahm, who won the US golf game with Tiger Woods 2&1 on Sunday.
“I know extraordinary pride that I won Tiger Woods – I grew up looking at him,” said Rahm, a 23-year-old.
Woods lost all of his four matches in France and now he has a career in Ryder's Cup Championships score 13 : 21 : 3.
Strange statistics for one of the best players of all time who have won 14 big competition titles, leaving Jack Nicklaus alone.
The U.S. team was a whole weekend with fairways found in a mess; with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high-level golf throughout the tournament.
After the disappointment of the team, the U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said: “I am proud of the guys, they were stubborn.
There were moments in the morning when we put pressure on Europeans.
We fought them.
A hat down in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players did a very good job.
Let's get together, we'll work with the American PGA and our Ryder Care Championships Committee, and we'll go on.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
We've got to get the hat up.
They played better than us."
New information on water flowing: decreased concentrations in Pinella, Manatees and Sarasota

According to the FWC, there are reports of more infinite prosperity in the counties of Pinellase, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which refers to decreasing concentrations.
The water flow is approximately 130 miles (209 km) along the coast from the north of Pinellas county to the south of Lee county.
The sites can be found 10 miles (16 km) away from Hillsborough County, but the places have remained less than last week.
Water flow has also been observed in Pasco County.
