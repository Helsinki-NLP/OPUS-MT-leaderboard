European inflation has slipped on food
The accelerated inflation in the euro zone is mainly due to the temporal increase in food prices.
In the 13 countries of the euro zone, the November price increase was higher than expected, and after 2.6 per cent annual inflation was registered - the EU's Luxembourg statistical office reported.
The official forecast was only 3 per cent probable - reported by Bloomberg.
The European Central Bank (ECB) did not cut the baseless, unfavourable, unlike the American, British and Canadian central bank, saying that the reduction would lead to an inflation spiral with rising raw materials prices and reduced unemployment.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate up to 2% but close to that.
According to an analyst, the ECB is in its twenty-two trap: "speaking out of inflation" so that it does not have to act on this subject later.
In Germany, the value of November inflation is 3.3 per cent as a twelve-year record; in Spain it has increased from 3.6 per cent.
Eurozone inflation has been drained by jumping food and energy prices.
The time-limited wheat notes increased by 88 per cent and the price of soya beans has also reached the highest value since 1973.
The food oil and dairy products also had to be paid more substantially in 2007.
The world market price of petroleum increased by 52 percent this year, and in the past month it cost almost 100 dollars a barrel of black gold.
According to the ECB, inflation is jumping from 2.1 to 2.5 per cent in 2008, but it is dropping from 1.9 per cent in 2009.
The average annual rate of inflation of 12 months remains around 3 per cent in the next 3-4 months, but is 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to reduce interest rate twice during 2008.
He sees a government crisis in Gallup
Since the long stagnation of the supporters of Fidesz, it increased significantly from the beginning of December, so since 2002 it has now been the largest camp, while Gallup has not previously measured such low, 13 percent socialist support.
The difference between the Commissioner's parties - because of the greater determination of the opposition voters - would represent a support of more than two-thirds (71%) against the support of the MSZP of fifteen percent (20%).
According to the survey, MDF and NDSZ are below the parliamentary threshold: their total population support is two per cent.
Among the Commissioner's electoral parties, both camp supporters are one percent more.
The economic public voice is still deteriorating from the previous point of view - it has never been so high, 41 per cent of those who considered the country's economic situation to be very bad, while 46 per cent of the additional situation is rather bad.
The changes in their financial situation are now considered more pessimistic after spring and summer prospects.
For the next year, the majority of the population account for further deterioration and only a decade of improvement.
In December, more than 71 percent of Gallup’s previous surveys, the Prime Minister thought that he was rather poor than doing his work well.
In Ferenc Gyurcsány, 13 percent of the people asked trust or very trust, while Viktor Orbán has 38 percent of the supporters.
54 percent of the head of government do not trust at all, 27 percent of the President of Fides.
One of the indicators of the development of the political situation is how much society feels that it can be treated with the Prime Minister without a change of government.
While 35 per cent of the government and the head of government considered it desirable to remain after the disturbances in October last year, this rate is now only 20 per cent, while the relative majority (33 per cent) only sees the solution in describing new elections.
The interest in the referendum is that 60 percent of the questions asked respond to the question of the intention of participation, that he would definitely go, and another 20 percent said he would probably go.
As a comparison, only 55% of the national elections to be held on this Sunday would be sure and a further 15% would consider their participation likely. The result of the referendum would not be questionable on the basis of the intentions that we have now.
The tuition fees for people 74, the visit fee 79, and 84 percent of the hospital's daily fee would say no.
If we only look at the same proportions of their participation in the referendum among the Commissioners, 81, 84 and 89 percent of the voters would withdraw the introduction of tuitions, examination fees and hospital daily fees.
The most expensive Auchan raised Tesco by almost the fifth.
In the Budaörs commercial triangle, hypermarkets held an average price increase of 16 per cent last year, with the difference that this year the VAT has not increased.
Article of the solar economy
This year, the average increase in the annual Christmas basket in the Budapest commercial triangle was 16 percent, but in each hypermarket there was a large increase in the value of thousands of HUF.
Since last December the prices in the food stores have already been "departed", there was no drastic excitement in percentage compared to the previous high base.
However, it is obviously scary for consumers that what they have received over nine thousand forints last year is not available for even ten thousand.
The solar basket crossed the ten thousand forints of psychological boundaries with at least 91 forints in the hypermarkets.
The highest cart value was 10 573 HUF.
(In 2003, the basket came to HUF 6800).
The price of Unicum and living fish was almost on the last year, but the turkey gloves, nuts and nuts were very expensive.
The KSH followed the price of flour and bread in the stores, although we found a kilogram of bread in Auchan for 139 forints.
The competition did not undercut the price of the product below 200 HUF.
It was also surprising in this business that the price of two-litre reversed bottles of Coca-Cola was below 200 HUF, so they requested only 257 HUF with the deposit fee for the product.
However, this year Auchan showed the most expensive in the solar basket, while Cora is the cheapest.
According to our calculations, Cora 15, while Tesco and Auchan increased the prices in the solar basket by about 18-18 percent compared to last Christmas prices.
Last year's most expensive and lowest basket value compared to this year's difference was 12 per cent, whereas between the cheapest and most expensive 21 per cent last year's growth.
Forint's average growth was 1480.
Last year the average price increase came to 1206 forints, feeling the effect of price increases in VAT last Christmas.
This process has just broken down trade, and apparently the stores have not been able to decide how much price they would use for a product, because they were unable to calculate the impact of price change on consumption.
(If the trader is planning the speed of a product in turn incorrectly, the price adjusted to the market intensity may have a significant benefit.)
Because of the VAT last year, the price increase of the solar basket was so extreme that the price difference was more than HUF 1720, while the price difference was only HUF 844.
This extremism did not appear this year, because the most expensive 1630 HUF was more than last year, and the cheapest one was expensive with 1284 HUF.
Compared to the two Christmas seasons, a catastrophic price increase was seen, with over 30 per cent of daily consumption in hypermarkets in less than 20 months.
(In any event, this does not indicate the KSH data: the statistical agency has a price increase of more than 30 per cent over 12 months for some basic foods.
For example, beside the flour with the egg.)
According to the solar basket, the latter seems almost incapacity, as the price level of the fairly expensive product already last year produced almost 10 per cent price increases compared to the base in the worst case.
The flour suppliers seem to have been in a stronger position than the eggs, and the drastic price increases have also been tricked in multipliers.
In the trade gold triangle, hypers are not complaining, they keep reporting a good year.
According to our experience, the number of customers in the three shops visited is no longer interested in prices.
They're buying a lot of everything, taking durable food in a platostos.
On Wednesday morning, all three stores developed a lot before the cash prices because suddenly the number of visitors increased.
However, we know that traffic in rural areas is weaker, many complain about the research companies that even their plans are missing revenue, not only for food, but also for durable consumer products.
Saving in many places on disinfectants
More than a thousand infections have been reported this year in hospitals, mainly due to inappropriate use of antibiotics.
The hygiene conditions of hospitals, the congestion of beds, the overload of staff do not favour the stopping of infections, stop the head of the National Epidemiology Centre.
They save in many places on disinfectants.
MRSA has recently been diagnosed in the traumatic class of John's Hospital.
In a male after a serious accident, the antibiotic-resistant bacteria were shown.
The patient was separated.
Similar infection occurred at the beginning of the year.
Her severe car accident was released from the hospital, but soon later she had to return with MRSA infection, and she has not been able to perform an important surgery since then because of the bacteria in her body.
By 1094 December this year, a hospital infection caused by a multiresistant disease was reported to the National Nodecomial Surveillance System by the Head of Department of the National Epidemiological Centre, Böröcz Karolina.
This means that the infection caused by such a multiresistant pathogen must have been registered in hospitals, not known about the rest.
Approximately two thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, i.e. methicillin-oxacillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria is carried by a third of people without causing disease.
The infections caused by SA (e.g. inflammation of the throat, inflammation of the almonds, skin infections, inflammation of the skin) are well responding to antibiotics, well cured.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inadequately, a bacteria that responds well to antibiotics develops a highly resistant bacteria that is rapidly spreading under inadequate hospital conditions.
In the event of transient or persistent malfunction of the immune system, severe hospital infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning, may occur in patients with weakened organs, elderly or small body weight.
According to the medical director at the John Hospital, MRSA infection has nothing special, such infections belong to the day-to-day practice of hospitals.
The infection should not be mixed with the disease, MRSA is not only there, said Nyulasi Tibor, where they do not examine the presence of the pathogen.
Resists against antibiotics
"These patients are separated, the care staff are carrying the patient in rubber gloves and masks, and they have the appropriate antibiotics for their treatment," said Tibor in Nyula.
Patients entering the hospital will be evaluated as to whether MRSA is present in their body, but the infection can not always be avoided.
Non-fashioned sampling
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA would be preventable, however, the current hospital conditions and circumstances are not favourable to prevent the formation and spread of multiresistant pathogens, states Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection occurs in hospitals, in elderly homes, hospitals should check patients entering and patients carrying MRSA should be immediately separated.
However, in Hungarian hospitals there is no fashion for microbiological sampling.
It also plays the role that the National Health Insurance Fund does not finance these tests.
Most cases are thus exposed when the patient is infected with MRSA, said the head of the epidemiological centre.
The European Union has strong recommendations for the proper use of antibiotics in human medicine, and there are domestic directives to cure certain infections and diseases.
It should be sought to target antibiotic therapy, i.e. microbiological studies should be carried out so that no resistance to medicinal products can occur, but hospitals do not comply with this in any case.
Microbiological samples are even more rare in the patient’s or primary supply, reported by Böröcz Karolina.
Saving on Disinfectants
Scientific evidence demonstrates that MRSA covers one of the patients most often through the mediation of healthcare staff.
Therefore, the hand washing, the gloves, the use of the mask, but there are also significant deficiencies in hospitals.
MRSA is spreading with cellular infection, contact, but under domestic hospital conditions there is always no possibility of separating the infected patient.
In fact, the hospitals often stirred, often the beds are very close, where patients should be at least 1.5 metres away from each other from the epidemiological point of view.
Unfortunately, it is also experienced, noted by Böröcz Karolina that in unfavourable financial hospitals save in disinfectants, few are nurses, many patients, thus even more chances of infections.
According to Böröcz Karolina, where appropriate precautions are taken, there can be fewer such infections or stopping the prolongation of the pathogen.
Government programme against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection causes huge costs to health insurance, so they fight everywhere.
In England, for example, the government programme included reducing the prevention or occurrence of MRSA.
According to the evidence that the programme has been successfully reported, MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Disease Prevention Centre (ECDC) priorities include the prevention of multiresistant pathogens (including MRSA) and hospital infections caused by such pathogens.
He wasn't drunk by the police captain who caused the death accident.
The official expert opinion has been prepared for the death accident caused by the XXII district police captain.
It is unlikely that, in a drunken or degraded state, the XXII district police captain resigned from his post, who hit a pedestrian on Tuesday's death, informed Morvai Attila, the spokesman of the capital DA on Friday after the expert opinion.
The expert opinion supported the primary study result, which has already established that the former police captain did not consume alcohol before sitting behind the wheel.
At that time, the head of the XXII district station hit a 55-year-old man who did not want to cross the road across the street of Kossuth Lajos in the district of XXII.
(The latter, therefore, that the pedestrian did not cross the zebran under the CRRESZ rules, is not a mild condition, and the car driver should also give priority.)
The pedestrian lost his life after transporting to the hospital.
Because of what happened, the district police chief resigned from his post and asked him to retire, according to the police, because the case was so shocked.
The case is being investigated by the Prosecutor General of Budapest.
Mr Attila Morvai also argued that the former police captain was working with the prosecutors in the investigation from the start.
New EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Three credit framework agreements with the President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), Ms János Veres, Finance Minister and Ms Gajecka, signed a total of EUR 400 million.
The European Development Bank (EIB) approved a €300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental projects under the Cohesion Fund (EIB) in 2006, of which 100 million credit agreements have already been concluded by the parties, the Treaty now signed is about the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
Education-related projects also provide budgetary funding for the 150 million euro loan agreement.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary, the remaining EUR 150 million may later be used by extending the credit agreement.
In the field of innovation, a contract of EUR 50 million has been signed by the parties, which will be used primarily for the research and development project of the University of Debrecen.
The meeting also discussed subway four.
They agreed that when Hungary finalises the details of sub-financing with the EU, they return to whether and how to amend the original contract.
According to John Veres, this can take place in the first quarter of 2008.
The EIB has financed 113 projects in Hungary with a total of EUR 8.4 billion since 1990.
The EIB shall provide loans without an EURIBOR-related, 8-year-old period and an availability fee.
Bulgaria is the EU real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is amazing - the attention of Europe as a whole is directed towards a few countries mentioned earlier in the Balkans.
What, where and who buy the EU is still the cheapest, but quickest market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most skilled Eastern European property purchase destination is now undoubtedly Bulgaria, cheap ski apartments and beach houses.
Among the mountains, the most popular areas of Banszko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa, and on the beach Albena, the Gold Beach, the "Napos Beach", the ancient Sozopol and Nesebár, are looking for more and more real estate in the area of Kavarna and Balcsik.
According to the analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, the central part of the country will sooner or later raise the interest of investors - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and more and more are buying around Rus.
The capital, Sofia, also attracts opportunities, and the commercial and office spaces promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is moving on the best way to become one of the most attractive European golf paradises, so in addition to the summer and winter season, it will be a priority for the other two years.
Foreseeable investors are therefore already largely buying, for example in the Bansko region.
The analysts say that in Bulgaria, property buyers are also trying to change their lives and lifestyles.
Most customers are English, but come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cyprus investors are also present, and in the Black Sea and ski paradises there are traditionally many Russian buyers.
Foreign customers can be classified into three groups - says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Residents or renovated properties are purchased at a price of €50 to €100 000 or destroyed old houses for €5.15 thousand and then renovated.
They require good access and communication opportunities, important to them a major city, shops and usually local doctor's proximity.
The second category is the holiday shoppers (Bulgaria has entered the first 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group is created by business investors who buy in the hope of medium or long-term increases in value.
The abundance of capital properties is constant, as demand is increasing.
In the European Union, however, the lowest property prices in Bulgaria have increased by 21 per cent in the last five years.
The increase in real estate prices is essentially beyond the increase in payments.
Fodor and six Hungarian percent
According to Mr Gábor's information, experts' meetings will be finalised on Tuesday and after the official opening of Wednesday, the negotiations of the Ministers will continue to be held by the International Climate Management Organisation after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries of the world discuss the Bali Road Plan, which provides for efforts following the emission reduction period set by the Kyoto Protocol 2012.
There is currently a strong debate on this between developing and developing countries.
The United States has also indicated that it is currently unwilling to negotiate precise numbers, although it is inclined to agree to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40% by 2020 compared to 1990.
Another major issue of the conference is whether developing countries are also committed to reducing emissions in order to provide both material and technological assistance to the countries that need it.
There was also an agreement on support to developing countries.
The support fund provided by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by the Board of Directors of 16 Members, expected to be read in the Market and Profit within the UN Global Environment Fund (GEF).
6% of Hungary
Mr Gábor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to preserve the role of a flagship in global climate protection efforts and to facilitate the establishment of a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020, irrespective of the success of the post-2012 Convention, and will take up a maximum of 30% reduction if other highly developed regions of the world and developing countries are willing to assume their responsibilities and capabilities.
Mr Gábor pointed out that in 1997, a total reduction of 5.2% in the countries acceding to the Kyoto Protocol was targeted, including the EU - still 15 Member States - committed a minus 8%.
The Hungarian obligation is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent from the 1985-87 period, which our country will meet. - reminds us of the press release of the Ministry of Environment.
Balin's high bet, because within two years, the long-term international climate policy agreement should be undercover, otherwise its entry into force would certainly take place after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately be followed by a new international emission reduction system, which would be necessary in its latest report by the IPCC, the Nobel Peace Prize Committee of the United Nations on Climate Change.
This would lead to a delay in emission reduction and to an inevitable increase in Earth's average temperature above 2 Celcius, which, according to scientists, would be extremely severe and irreversible.
The British Army recruits on YouTube
Records of actions in Iraq and Afghanistan are published at the video distribution by the British Army units with which they promote themselves.
For the first time, the British Air Force (RAF) received the YouTube: the special development in Afghanistan has been uploading videos of their action against the Taliban since March 2006 - announced by BBC.
These videos of miniature cameras, equipped with helmets, will be checked at the command of the Air Force Katar, and then sent to London, where the domestics upload them to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
139 of the air force's soldiers have already been recorded on the internet in this form, and over 75 thousand of their channels have been viewed.
The British Ministry of Defenceheadquarters registered in the spring of 2007 and published videos on actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Ministry of National Community (Commonwealth Office) and the International Peacekeeping Units in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channels.
Introduction in Afghanistan
According to the initial intention of the Air Force, he put the videos for recruitment, and the Ministry of Defence says it is also good for the general public to learn the real purpose of the military's foreign presence.
The propaganda published in this form is almost in no way avoided from the traditional, television recruitment campaigns - said to BBC by Gordon Mackenzie's defence expert - but also in an indispensable way bears some political message, as it confirms in a specific form the right to military action decided by the government.
The Americans played a game
The army is also concerned that, along with carefully edited, censored footages, amateur videos are placed on the distributor, which, for example, show the death of the soldiers: in some hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, officers talk about losses, but they don't show the bloody side of the fight.
By the way, many videos from the Iraqi and Afghanistan have been released on the Internet, which were made on sharp missions, but the British army has only recently received it.
The Americans recruit somewhat differently, with the free downloadable American Army shooting games, where the player can hide directly into the skin of the soldiers as part of a more or less life-friendly simulation.
It's going to be a toasting Christmas at the ministries.
Minister of Employment Lamperth Mónika does not seem emotional: he will have an annual work meeting for his colleagues, who will be able to greet you with a snack and coffee from 2007 instead of a Christmas party.
There's a ministry where it's gonna be a live music party, and they're charging Christmas spirits in the heart of officials.
Party, Christmas mood, concerts and swedes - so entertain the power.
Public offices are ready for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas party of the Ministry is held by the Home Protection Wall this year, but the HM is not waiting for the ministries.
At the Christmas of Orphans, the children of the fallen soldiers are given gifts, and at the Mission Christmas they host family members of the soldiers currently serving foreign missions, but they also organise a press reception.
The wallet is 25 million for the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NFU) and the Ministry of Economic and Transport (GKM) are expelled from other wallets.
The GKM party is held at the Future House, with a total of 4 320 000 HUF, and there are about three hundred and fifty guests from the six hundred ministries.
At the wallet's celebration, they're gonna stick to the Christmas mood, but they're gonna be performers, and they're gonna be destined.
NFÜ Christmas was 4 700 000 forints, and there were concerts and dinners in the building of the National Justice Council (OIT) on Wednesday.
The landscape cost a million HUF, spent the remaining part on over four hundred invitations.
We understand that one class of the NFÜ is also official for another Christmas celebration: this is organised by a tender management company, the Hungarian Economic Development Centre, through EU money.
For the purpose, the Theatre building was rented.
The information has not been confirmed by MAG Zrt since we have failed to reach the competent.
You don't need a suit.
The OIT building was not only guest of the NFÜ, but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Luca Day ball on December 7, instead of Christmas.
He didn't ask for money from them to use the rooms of the OIT.
Five hundred people participated in the prom.
The party started with the Minister's toast, and it was possible to dance for live music after dinner.
The [origo] question was said: the prom was not obligated at all by the evening dress or suit.
Puritan's having a party with the health, employment, and the local government wallet.
The Ministry of Health organises a show and celebration in its own building for employees for HUF 400 000.
However, Lamperth Mónika's Minister for Labour is not officially waiting for a Christmas party, but for the end of the year's workshop.
They expect hundreds of eighty guests, who, the press department, will only receive coffee and mugs, so the party will be taken out of HUF 350 000.
However, Bajnai Gordon, Minister of Municipality, will simply go to the au of the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Rural Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organises a Christmas meeting in its own large hall, for which 436 employees are expected.
Every guest has $500 forints to go to the Christmas party - the sum of a svéd bet and a cake.
Since John Veres is the minister, the employees of the PM will Christmas like each year.
But there will be no party, but the formality will not only be reinforced by the Ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon time.
The farm wallet will give a new year-on-year reception on January 20, and the Ministry Christmas will be missed.
The bet is held in the Vajdahunyadvar, Cityliget, and according to the wallet, the wallet is sent to 100 guests over 1,000 HUF.
This, according to the press class, will be a very simple standing bet, for which only foreign graduates accredited to Hungary are official.
These annually organized bets begin with a short ministerial toast and end with a distraction.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture were not at all present with [origo] at the relevant press departments.
The price of the office Christmas of the environmental wallet could not be said in the press department.
In any case, more than 400 people were invited to the party held in the Museum of Applied Arts.
The forces of the giant strike are growing up
On Friday, the National Association of League Professional Organisations and Work Councils will be established by their strike committee coordinating the indefinite strike on Monday.
They're holding a session banning on Saturday, and on Monday, on the day of the final vote on the Health Insurance Act, the dismissal begins.
The operation will certainly cause a significant downturn in transport, as rail transport will almost completely stop and will strike for 13 hours at the BKV.
On Friday afternoon, the details of the Monday strike organized jointly with the National Association of Working Councils are presented by the League Professional Organisations.
The LIGA - MOS strike committee will also be set up, which will coordinate Monday operations.
On Saturday, the assembly is banned, and from Monday, the associations joining the strike will cease work for an indefinite period if they cannot reach an agreement with the government.
This means that it has not been marked - on the date of Parliament's vote on health insurance law - the date of the end of the initial strike.
If the National Assembly fails to adopt the Health Insurance Act, trade unions will immediately withdraw the strike call.
However, if the legislation is voted in favour, the strike committees will meet and decide on the continuation.
On the basis of the Monday agenda of the Parliament, it is also possible that they will only vote on the Health Insurance Act in late evening, perhaps in night hours.
Due to the strike that commences on Monday, it is possible to expect significant groundbreaks in transport: for the railway to end work for an unspecified period, for a part of the public transport in Budapest, more than half of the Volan companies, may be stopped in the morning.
At the same time, on many points of the country, there will be a halfway blocking.
A number of trade unions and civil society organisations have joined the strike call, and these lists are constantly updated on the League's day.
Certain organisations have indicated a strike for an indefinite period, others have announced a temporary dismissal.
Until Thursday afternoon, the Free Trade Association of MÁV and Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) has not even been able to agree on a sufficient service, while more and more travels on the railroads near Christmas holidays.
According to the communications so far, they strike at BKV, Budapest Airport between 7:00 and 9:00 a.m., four-hour strikes are held by LIGA Electroelectric and Heat Energy Professional Associations, the Pedagogs Professional Association and the Democratary Professional Organisation of Pedagogs called for 2 and 2-8 hours of employment.
The Hungarian Medical Association strikes nationally in changing times, a two-hour warning strike by the Social and Health and Social Industries Workers (EDDSZ).
The four demands put forward by League are key to the government's revocation of the proposal for health insurance reform and a new concept for social debate.
The second requirement is to progressively introduce a new method of retirement from next year.
Thirdly, the possibility of access to the system in the case of the early retirement pension is guaranteed before 2010.
The fourth reason of the action is that the Free Trade Organisation of Railway Workers of the League Trade Union (VDSZ) does not accept the offer of rail lines by the Ministry of Economic and Transport is expected to offer a different offer.
Political Capital: the Hungarian Guard raised the country's risk
The activities of the Hungarian Guard founded in August this year in support of the Move for Jobbik Hungary have raised the political risk of Hungary and the region according to the Risk Analysing Division.
In the "risk warning" of the company, the greatest political risk for the activities of the Hungarian Guard is that "with an intensification of ethnic tension between the gypsy and non-gypsy population in Hungary, there may be violent ethnic conflicts in the short term."
The main reason for this is that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy is supposed to provoke such an act - has been added by the Research Institute.
As it has been written, this can lead to one of the main failures of Hungarian political actors: "The public debate of the Roma has been transferred to representatives of radical and extreme political groupings who could build a political strategy against Gypsy-Hungarian."
This deepens the problem, inevitates normal dialogue, strengthens extremes and increases the probability of violent conflicts - they believe.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activities of the Hungarian Guard by a large domestic and international media observation "hack a significant deterioration of the image of Hungary in foreign countries, particularly as regards the country's stability and its democratic development".
It is recalled that since the autumn of 2006, the reorganisation of radical and extremist groups in Hungary has become a growing publicity and enthusiasm, which has become more and more so-called "national self-defense" associations since summer 2007.
"The common feature of these concentrations is to define themselves as civilian organisations, whilst they openly announce their members - whether armed - to prepare them for defence tasks (catastrophic protection, defence, police and military protection), in addition to the police, the army, which refers to the state's incompetence."
It has been noted that this is done in accordance with the method which, based on the political and impartiality of society, is trying to put different political ambitions into a civilian robe.
The emphasis of civil society and the form of association, therefore, is not merely to avoid legal failures in the legal register for these associations, but also to avoid a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk-enhancing factor for neighbourhood relations.
"In recent months, many neighbouring countries also refer to the Hungarian Guard as a potential threat, and some neighbouring countries' ultra-nationalist political actors want to demonstrate their own anti-English policy by referring to the formation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this affects the political stability of the region" has been said.
According to the research institute, the formation of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Eastern Central Europe, so political risks increased throughout the region.
As it was written, the operation of the Hungarian Guard is similar to the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard, announced in August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the formation of the Bulgarian Guard, there are mass Roman disruptions that occurred in one quarter of Sofia (Craszna Poljana).
The BNU has decided to start the gray, saying that the organization aims to "national self-defense".
In the last 17 years, they believe that there was a "cigarterror" in Bulgaria, but the state remained untrue and indifferent - reminds me of the political capital.
They added: the initiative had a strong debate in the Bulgarian public.
As has been written, the increase in the risk of ethnic collisions indicates that some Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced that they have created their own guard against resistance.
Since the operation of the Hungarian Guard has shown similarities to the functioning of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is therefore not possible to rule out that the Romanians in Hungary respond similarly to the threat by organising their own self-defense - in the policy capital risk warning.
Attila Juhász, Research Director of Political Capital, said to the interest of the telegraph office: risk analysis is one of the activities of the Research Institute.
As you have said, they will issue their risk analysis every year, and if they experience something that may affect the change of risk, they will inform the public as in this case by issuing a risk warning.
It's not a red letter all over the holiday
In Hungary, the law precisely marks the red letters, and around the holidays, the working day reorganisation has become a general practice, which will be less than next year.
The holiday is not unified in the EU and in America.
The Hungarian legal system differs from national and state holidays and working holidays.
Working holidays are mostly linked to church holidays, significant historical events.
We are also celebrating the new year: both the last day of the year and the first day of the new year, and the last one is to rest for the restors.
Anyway, we have a total of 11 red holidays all year.
The National Festival of the Revolution of 15 March 1848 and 23 October, the Memorial of the Revolution of 1956.
On 20 August, we celebrate the state founding, on 1 May, and on 1 November and 2 November, we remember our loved ones and friends.
We also have a two-day holiday for Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
Since our national, national or just religious holidays are rarely in the calendar for the weekend, the shift of work day has become practical in cases where we work only for a day before or after the red letter holiday.
True, the price of the extended weekends is that we are not staying away from the workplace school in the previous Saturdays.
The fact that the day immediately before or after the holiday is precisely when it is to be processed has been governed by a separate regulation for many years.
The legislation covers all employers and their employees, public employees and public service members.
It does not, however, affect non-interrupted operators and the establishments of service providers and institutions operating on holidays.
This year, the work schedule is only changing around the end of the year: from 24 December, life is almost stopped in the country, as experience shows that the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve are "slide" by most people, or for this purpose his spared freedom.
Next year, we have more holidays to the middle of the week and to the end, so it will be less working day transfer than this year.
At first, the calendar turns around the work holiday so that workers can stay at home for four days each time.
It will be Saturday, April 26, to be replaced by Friday 2 May.
The second transfer relates to the holiday of October 23: on October 18, you will have to work on Saturday instead of 24 on Fridays.
However, the end of the year can take full time in the holiday ticket for the next year, since from 24 December, a nonstop break is almost everywhere even when it comes to the New Year's Wednesday.
Six frightening little things to upset your colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, voice mails that we never get, innocent lies that we almost can't notice: they're "coloring" every day at work.
Question whether you get used to little discomforts or wear the gloves, and you are consciously avoiding misunderstanding situations that may cause vengeance to others.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that you were looking for the marketing class," says one of your colleagues.
That's why you missed a meeting?
In the best case, you will be sorry and try to make it right, you may call the marketing class to tell you, you forgot to pass the message (this is a less unusual solution).
Most of the time, an apology is done.
Before awkward apologies take place, it is worth considering what you can get your colleagues awkward moments and try consciously to avoid this.
Do you want to borrow something that isn't yours?
There's no more annoying than being touched for a document, office or your phone, and it's not anywhere.
Remember that you put your fireworks on the table yesterday, but by morning, his legs were on the table?
Maybe you'll cover your lost pen on one of your colleagues' desk?
Without asking, don't take anything away from your colleagues because they're rightly angry at you to rid their property.
Don't put your pockets on the office envelopes, post-its, because it may be uncomfortable if you're running out of time, and you're gonna need it right away.
Are you rumoring about the private life of colleagues?
There's no good way to stop the rumors that we've been talking about.
Who, who, what did he do?
Where and why?
Your information (conditions) about your private life should not be tied to everyone's nose.
If one of them shares the deepest secrets with you, don't relive with his trust.
Bury the hearings in yourself and do not negotiate with your colleagues in his absence, even if others know about your colleague's stuff.
Do you mean sick without reason?
When you call into the office and you mean a sick person referring to diarrhoea, because you have a bad feeling or feel like resting that day; think that your work, your postures, your deadlines are to be done instead of someone else.
Don't spot me with your colleagues.
If you know in advance that the next day you're not going to go into the office, or you could come in here to stay home, tell your colleagues and your boss not to face your shortage the next day.
Drilling, raining, phone calls
Did you get into the job, but that's how hard it's been for colleagues to pick up?
Did you unwillingly become an ear witness to a phone call that you wouldn't even have heard?
Don't disturb your colleagues by twisting, singing, talking loud (what you're going on over their heads) or by twisting, twisting, twisting, sound displeasure.
They can all be disturbing, even if they are not embraced in a single project (written, design and organisation).
Are you blaming others for mistakes?
If there's nothing left for time, you forgot to send an important letter, a message, and don't blame yourself for forgetting.
Don't refer to any chaos that may prevail in the office, your louder colleagues.
Admit it if you made a mistake, and it's the disadvantage of someone else, and eliminate the curtain.
Ask me how you can make up for your mistake, make up for your failure.
Do you feel too homey in the office?
Cheese pants and slippers: comfortable clothes for home, but it's not for the office!
Don't pull a comfortable outfit if your job is allowed.
Don't be shiny, your colleagues, and respect yourself by going into the office in a regular dress - if your job requires you to go in.
If you want to answer, you're not interested anymore.
The car's in the usual morning dock.
There's something special about the radio: a violin tone to which electronic effects are associated.
I'm rolling up the sound.
The music has become a tempo and a female choir will be connected as a real jewelry.
The Zagar Wings of Love is on mr2.
Domestic music life has long been hardly compulsive with a high-quality electronic pop.
But now it seems to be a different plug when you're listening to the new Zagar record.
The appearance of Yonderboi, some new and exciting productions coming from the home digital underground, changes the overall image slowly, and in vain fashion again in the guitar garage, the home electropsy proves: there is a new under the sun.
Zságer Balázs started from Pécs, and you played in Yonderboi's band until - maybe - two twists didn't fall in a bridge - went on his own road.
With its project (Zagar) and its music, which combines the elements of jazz, electronic dance music, pop, it began to break through when film soundtracks were asked to compose (e.g.
Turkish Ferenc Sezon).
At first, the formations played in smaller clubs were reported by a wider audience when the first album of the wan2 magazine was listed among the fifty most important domestic records and called Zagar, Yonderboi, to the most marketable domestic trendists.
No doubt, Zagar and his orchestra became "trendic," but of course no one asked them if they'd like to wear the label.
The band reacted as it had to: created a new, better record.
Instead of Cannot Walk Fly, the newly published album can open new paths for them, although the title itself wants to create continuity with the early Pécs years.
That was Zságer Balázs, one of the old bands there.
We would be in place with the airline, flying reference, but in addition to the airline of music, the effect of the louder guitar, rock and roll was now seen - according to the spirit of the age, trend.
In these songs, at the Millennium premiere of the album, the singer, György Ligeti, who is currently working with the Puzzle band in England, showed himself.
The album also produced a real radio slice of Mr.2 Petőfi, who played a popular music from the next morning to the night, started smuggling in the ears with the six home singers ("Underground Divas") recorded Wings of Love.
So everything is okay (?).
The hvg.hu asked Balázs.
hvg.hu: With this new player, he asks the question: How long have you got to play?
Zságer Balázs: The definition of layer music means not much to me.
I think there are two types of light music castes; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
The so-called alternative, underground music can be flattered, nothing-speaking, and they can be prepared to just sell, making them commercial.
But there's a good pop that's supposed to be a real move.
The host's attitude also works in this spirit regardless of language and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience for your music?
Zs.B.: Outside, especially west of us, light music has bigger traditions.
There's not only the age group of the ages of 12, but also the older ones.
They are more closely monitoring the changes around them because they are also viewed as part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role of the audience in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: Of course it feels good that more and more people go to our concerts.
But we never made music on the market.
The music for us is not for a purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the audience is more visible on the concerts, where the effect is already working, but it is only in the unbearable changes of the moment.
Still, I noticed that if you want to answer the audience, you're no longer interested.
hvg.hu: How much are you planning to follow Yonderboi's example?
He's working solo, and he's building his career more west of us.
Zs.B.: We're not really on his way, regardless of the occasional attempt to explain this to our music.
We're more of a team player who trusts the other musical presence and lets it open.
At first, of course, it was inevitable that our work was compared to Yonderboi's music, as many of us became out of his band and left on another road.
hvg.hu: At the top list of Mr.2 Petőfi, Wings of Love was first placed.
Many have first heard the name Zagar.
Did you open the most popular style to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn't have a plan to write a hit and then sell the disc.
This song is more than that.
We were meant to be the final of the album, which we were trying to unleash the audio orgy on the record and the harder topics.
hvg.hu: How did you choose six singers?
Why are they - what was the control?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel-like choir.
That's when the idea came that this choir should be made out of the good-sounded soloists of our own musical schematics.
This was how the six - member choir, namely Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Péterfy Bori, Hodosi Enikő [Neo], Németh Juci, which was then baptized as underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did the song just like that or did the girls make it?
Zs.B.: The number has long existed in an instrumental version, and then when the disc was compiled, we thought there was something else to do with this number.
The moment was attracted to my voice.
Even that night, I sang the song that girls later learned.
It was almost first and terrifyingly spontaneous.
I remember it was very flashed back then, but of course the Divas had to do it.
It wouldn't have worked so strong with my voice.
hvg.hu: Both on the disc and on the concert, it seemed that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo (except Judy Jay's short solo), they don't have their own role, they sing together and they don't sing more loud than music, so music does not just accompany their songs.
They were in the back of the stage.
Is that intentional?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were behind was just because of technical problems.
However, it is conscious that we didn't want to share solo ceremonys.
The number is also about forgetting a little of our ego, where he came from, where he's going, just let those wings, the wings of love lift us up.
I wanted others to feel the euphoric state we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: What was the most work with?
Zs.B.: There were harder pieces than mixing.
For example, the Dorian Gray's Dilemma, where I play a race piano, or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where he didn't want to operate the groove for a long time, and then it was pretty slowly everything was in place like a giant game.
hvg.hu: Which is your favorite number for the new album?
Zs.B.: It's constantly changing with the concert and by letting the disc go.
Now the Prophet is a fool, the Escape from the Earth and the Never The Same.
The traitor risked billions because of the feeling of minority of the broker
It's disgusting.
The owner of the Czech Trading Bank, the French Sociéte Générale banknote so calls his former employee Jerome Kerviel.
Because Kerviel lost almost 5 billion euros.
However, it seems that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to catch his colleagues at all.
Unlike the rest of the banks, he recognized the crisis in the American mortgage market in time.
"It's less intellectual," she said from the police officers who notify them.
However, as the French Le Monde reported, Kerviel’s statement shows that at the end of the last year it has earned a profit of EUR 1.6 billion.
Crime not only in America
"I just wanted to make money for my bank," she says in her statement.
In summer, he was able to earn half a billion euros in the US crisis.
The opportunity was already felt at the beginning of the year.
In February, news appeared that there would be problems with so-called subprime mortgages to customers with low income or past redemption problems.
However, this crisis should not have a negative impact on the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe in this and put me on a good horse.
The final profit of the year has reached EUR 1.6 billion.
"Although I was looking for the first half a billion, I didn't know how to report it," she admits Kerviel and adds that she didn't keep anything for you.
In his confession, he has falsified his reports so that he can't find out.
He managed to cheat on his bosses, even when the Eurex stock exchange started to be interested in his transactions.
Risk profit
Are you afraid you'll find out?
I'd rather not.
"I thought it was just the fact that I was looking for 1.6 billion for the bank, that he'd reassure them."
Where did you want to risk that?
He's got his position gradually.
After the University of Lyon, he worked at the Société Générale bank since 2000.
His annual payment moved around $55,000.
Two years later, he was a broker assistant, and in 2005 he became an independent broker with 90 thousand dollars a year.
Nevertheless, he knew that he would never earn as much as others.
"In 2005, during my first conversation, I knew they were looking at me with a bad eye.
Because of my graduates, my professional and personal development," Kerviel told the detectives.
Shortly after you entered, the first big success came.
Thanks to Allianz's shares, he sought a half-billion euro to fall in these shares during the bomb attacks in London.
And it started a lavina - she wanted more.
As long as you're looking, we'll leave you alone.
"This is like snowball," he told the police.
But his bosses allegedly knew everything, or they did.
"When I earned money, I lost eyes."
It's just that there was a blow in the beginning of the year.
In one day, he lost billion euros.
He wanted to hide in the middle of January on a weekend.
When he started working on Monday, he stopped working in the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that he lost $5 billion because of it.
And how did they figure it out?
Because of his freedom, he became suspicious.
"I only took four days last year.
The broker who doesn't have freedom is a broker who doesn't want anyone to see his reports," she finished Kerviel.
365 billion in Czech Republic
Ministers of the Czech Government signed nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, of which the Czech Republic can have €14 billion (approximately €365 billion) in the coming years.
This is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
The regions will receive about 125 billion kroons from seven operational programmes.
Czech companies will be able to obtain a sum of around 100 billion kroons from the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money, 150 billion kroons, is targeting transport.
The Transport Programme is the largest operating programme and represents 22 per cent of the funds available for Czech Republic.
These funds will increase the state base of the Transport Infrastructure, which will be funded by the next 90.8 billion kroons.
The Entrepreneurs and Innovation Programme helps entrepreneurs and companies to win tools for innovation businesses.
Companies should also obtain resources to introduce new technologies, industrial research, but more efficient organisational methods.
The Czech Republic is one of the least successful countries in winning the funds from the EU to date.
Ex-President Nicaragua has approved the 20-year prison sentence of the court
On Thursday, the Nicaraguan Appeal Court approved 20 years of prison for the former President of Arnold Aleman, which was sentenced to the financial fraud of 100 million dollars (approximately 1,8 billion kroons) in 2003.
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest in his homeland near the capital.
The fact that the former leader of this Central American country is going back behind bars between 1997 and 2002 is not clear, according to the AP news agency.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Perez, it will depend on the prison leadership whether Aleman's punishment is left at home or is going back to prison.
Four years ago, the court demonstrated that Alemand was regularly referring to the accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These figurative companies and their account numbers were relative and their nearest supporters in reality.
These funds were subsequently carried out at the Foundation, which was funded by the Almenan election campaign in 2001.
They approved our budget
That's right.
They accepted the public budget.
What makes this budget special?
This is the first budget, which has been adopted by the coalition majority, without the support of the opposition, drawn up by this government.
This went through last year with the support of the Social Democrats, as Minister Sobotka and the Czech Social Democratic Party could not accept it.
No drama has happened this time, unlike a loud debate on the distrust of the government before the vote.
The Parliament accepted this generally ignored, although the most powerful law.
It's a certain contradiction.
All governments start and end at certain chapters and headings of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential element of politics, but it is hidden behind the fights of government and opposition.
This is more grateful in the press, so much more attention is given to the media.
Political debates are much more interesting to the public than pure numbers.
The government budgets of the past Social Democratic Governments have been struggling with three deficiencies, which the 2008 budget cannot solve at the same time:
The first of them is the high proportion of compulsory expenditure law, which is not only the pension but also social benefits which the silent "coalition" of ČSSD and KSČM approved before the elections last year.
Secondly, the first deficiency is the result of deficit management.
The third limit is the deficits of public finances, i.e. the deficits of the budgets of cities and movements.
However, the greatest risk is not the deficit of the public budget.
This is subject to public and relative control.
The timed bombs are the deficits of the budget of cities and roads.
Many mayors can also make money for other investments other than taxes, fees and bank loans, undevelopedly issued bonds with disproportionate debt of their city houses.
In recent years, these debts have been redeemed by the mass sale of the shares of energy and other distribution networks that the State has received from privatisations.
They don't have that kind of source at the moment.
If we rely only on official and verifiable facts, it is concluded that:
Our economy has been going through a growth phase, like the rest of the world for a few years, with the Czech Social Democrat Party being constantly praised.
This was a unique opportunity for its governments to correct public funding.
Instead, the country has become more and more indebted.
The rest of the countries have farmed far more rationally than Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, Czech Republic, with two exceptions.
This is primarily the giant shame of former governments.
We belong to countries which are the least threatened by poverty in the global dimension.
For example, there is no need for enormous social programmes, which have unfortunately swelled into a gigantic size in recent years completely unnecessary.
Although this year it has been possible to eliminate the unreasonable population expenditure approved in advance of the elections, even if it is not possible to eliminate the border of retirement and retirement reform in the near future, any policy will actually end in this country and whoever is to govern it will be purely formalisation.
A little exaggeration can be said that the majority of the governor's politicians are usually retiring and social benefits become their mechanical distributors.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but can only stop the reduction of the expenditure by the authorising officers of normal expenditure.
The 70 billion deficit planned for 2008 would be absolutely unnecessary if the previous governments had not taken away everything that could have been possible in the past decade.
If we do not really want to become pure officials from the governor politicians, then we must be patient and we need to rest for the preparation of further reform laws to this unstable, understandable coalition government that the state can only issue as much as it can obtain from taxes and taxes.
This is the only way to progressively achieve the balanced budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the Great Britain, Switzerland and the Central Bank of Canada have decided to fight jointly against the crisis in financial markets.
The money markets are thus costing over $100 billion through the stock exchange.
This stock exchange raises the interest rate on the bank for which they are willing to lend money.
For example, the U.S. Fed puts $40 billion on its stock exchange and makes 25 more available to the European and Swiss Central Bank.
After the 11th of September attacks, the first thing is happening is that the central banks of each country have agreed on a coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step should solve the biggest problems of the economy, i.e. the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," said Bernard Baumohl, the Economic Outlook Group consultant, to its customers in his report.
"The coordinated operation of central banks in the United States reduced the probability of recession from 65 per cent to about 50 per cent," adds Baumohl in his report.
Banks already lost 60 billion dollars in the United States mainly because of non-repaid loans.
Elements are still expected to be billions of losses.
"The central banks may indeed fear what may be next if they have decided to do so," said ABN Amro’s chief intermediary Kieran Davies.
Looks like it's really bad," he said.
The central banks are afraid that if the banks themselves find it difficult to access their loans, they will also be more expensive to lend to their customers.
This would reduce the need and reduce the American economy to a recession with the potential consequences of global economic growth.
The central banks decided not to succeed. LIBOR, a reduction in the interbank supply rate used to borrow money on the interbank market in London.
This meant that banks were constantly afraid of inter-bank borrowing, even though the central banks of the USA, Canada and the Great Britain have reduced their interest rates a few times during the fall.
"This will have a similar effect to further interest reductions," told Reuters news agency Greg Salvaggio from Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not consider that the action of central banks will contribute to the resolution of the crisis, as it does not solve the underlying problem, the fall in the American real estate market.
Klaus: Incredible discussions between ecologers
Global climate change is the most threatened by developing countries.
President Václav Klaus reiterated an opinion on the problem of global warming.
This time, the UN criticised the international conference on climate change held in Bali.
The book Blue, presented in Vienna, not the green planet, said that ecologists’ discussions were incredible.
According to Klaus, not only the structure of the conference is unacceptable, which is a special mix of governments and representatives of civil society organisations, but also a fundamental difference between the retoric and reality accompanying it.
"The debate there absolutely denies the structure, it's just giggling with words, which are complementary to the solution of the current problems," said Klaus.
During the presentation of the Czech President's book, he stressed that he was very important to his subject, and he was therefore so committed to this subject.
He expressed his satisfaction that the book was also published in German translation, because, as he said, "I often meet my opinion's caricatures".
So now I'm interested to read your undistorted opinion.
Klaus reminded me that although he is not a climatologist, he believes that he has sufficient basis for the writing of such a book.
Because he was able to monitor and judge professional consultations as an academy in the statistics and economist.
In addition to the conclusion of the book, it indicated that climate changes are constantly changing, i.e. changes are normal, and that all scientists do not agree that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious, so there is no risk and that the efforts to influence climate development are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptable.
In addition, as a person with experience in totalitarianism, the use of uncertified opinions to others is unacceptable, which it considers as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
He repeatedly explained to the questions of the presenters that "it is not against a reasonable protection of the environment, but against militant environmentalism, which does not take account of the relationship between costs and benefits".
Similar topic Klaus talked about in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600 thousand could not replace their licenses
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and could not replace their old licence at the end of the year.
Today's last day is when you can still apply for the exchange, so that the agencies will be able to issue the new licence by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry does not fear that after the new year, hundreds of thousands of drivers would enter their journey without valid entitlement.
According to the offices, the licence was primarily not replaced by those who would no longer want to drive.
While the movements represent a severe fall in interest in licensing, the capital offices have been misleaded with applications for licensing, for which interest increased this week.
The mayor's office receives about 2,000 customers a day.
It's about half an hour in line.
In Prague, the licence was not replaced by some 140 000 drivers.
The issue of a new license will take 20 days.
However, the new licence may be subject to a short period of five days.
However, in such a case, the driver must pay more than 500 crowns.
Vehicle drivers who are unable to carry out the compulsory exchange of licences by the end of the year and who are deployed by an invalid licence will be threatened by a penalty from January onwards.
The culprit must pay up to 2,000 crowns.
However, the police may arrange for resignation by means of an agreement.
In the event of an administrative resignation, the sentence is 2500 kroons.
Based on the previous information from the city hall, you can also receive a fine who is not traveling anywhere.
He's supposed to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry has previously called for offices to be neglectful and punished by a maximum of thousands of crowns.
According to Karel Hanzelka, the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, however, tens of thousands of fines do not threaten anyone.
He thinks the licence is a document where people can decide whether they want it or not.
This is not an ID that must be valid for everyone.
Those who don't want to drive should cancel the license.
Enough to be taken or recommended to send it to the appropriate office.
By the end of the year, the licences issued between 1964 and 1993 are no longer valid.
However, drivers must gradually replace other types of licences.
For more than three years, those who have documents between 1994 and 2000 can replace them.
The licences issued between 2001 and 2004 expire only in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million additional documents.
The court reduced the punishment of cooperative detectives with Berdycchel.
Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík were suspected of confrontation with David Berdych's crime cooperative, and were sentenced to three and ten years of prison.
The Supreme Court in Prague has determined that one of them has reduced their sentences for two years.
The detectives of the Prágan Organization of Crime Division were originally threatened by a 14- and 12-year-old prison.
Today's decision can no longer be appealed; the review can only be applied to the Supreme Court.
Although Berdyche is also suspected in this case, she's only waiting for the first sentence.
In other cases, more than 16 years have already been punished.
You can't have any more.
In January, the County Court found that 19 people were guilty of robbery attacks, of whom the Supreme Court today negotiated 16 appeals.
Most of the defendants rejected the charges from the start of the investigation by imposing a speculative case.
According to the Central Czech Senate, the members of the police, after the agreement with Berdycche, were also provided with information from police sources, covered the individual robbery attacks and helped the gang to avoid prosecution.
The gang therefore gave Opava and Koňaři 30 percent of the robbery.
The case is about the crimes of the band between 1999 and 2001.
It is primarily about robberies that have often suffered serious health damage, but also the abuse of public authority and unauthorised arms.
Since the police found illegal weapons, steel-seed bullets, laser control or machine guns in the field of home search.
The gang charged 10 million kroons of robbery.
At the very least, 20 members of the gang have already been recognised by the courts in this process as guilty of other kidnappings in Berdych and many others.
Other members of Berdych's environment will testify in other proceedings before the court, and some cases have not yet been brought before the court.
The first-grade trial has so far avoided Tomáš Puta and Maroš Šulej, who are under prior arrest in Ireland, where they are waiting for a final decision on the issue of their criminal proceedings to the Czech Republic.
Account for Child Exchange: 12 million
For children exchanged in maternity, the lawyer of the damaged families, Igor Veleba, from the hospital in třebíč, demands 12 million kroons of pain plus court expenses.
Three million for mothers, two million for fathers and a million for children.
The hospital offers up to 200,000 per parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, disagrees essentially with the proposal of Mr Dostalba.
"We refuse such a claim because it's too much," said Dostal after the trial today.
"To give us an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need an expert opinion drawn up by the opponent.
We'll figure out if there's any value to be used.
But we maintain our view that this will be measured in hundreds of thousands," said Dostal.
He thinks the amount should move between 10,000 and 20,000 Kč for the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Jabloňov family wanted a million crowns every month until he raised their own biological daughter.
Veleba was given an expert criticism on the basis of the compensation negotiations, which was developed by the University of Motol in Prague.
According to psychologist and psychiatric experts, children’s parents have suffered various degrees of mental damage and stress.
The stress situation was better tolerated by men, even if they met such an oppression that they did not prevent the newborn from changing.
Women are worsening with the current history of experienced trauma and what is happening right now, summarised the content of Veleba.
Veronica and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the birth of třebíč on 9 December.
Last week, children returned to their blood-based parents - Nikola Čermaka, Přibyslavica, Veronika Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanov, Jabloňov.
At the end of October, Vysočina’s leader, Miloš Vystrčil, transferred 100,000 crowns to families to replace their expenditure, which was caused by the error of the hospital in Třebíčské, which is controlled by the walk.
All Czech hospitals have compulsory insurance under the law.
In the event of mistakes, they must apply to the reserve base, and, exceptionally, they may request the founder's assistance.
The courts have so far approved relatively low compensation for people, the amounts were calculated on the basis of a few hundred thousand, exceptionally few million kroon tables.
Polivika has lost his kingdom in Viansko
Bolek Polívka lost a trial for the title of the kingdom of Viansko.
According to the judge of the Ostrawas Court of Appeal, he used the name of King valachi first, but the project was developed by the team of Tomáš Harabiš, who collaborated with the actress, with many years of work.
Polivika didn't attend the trial today.
However, according to his legal representative, the case is probably not over and the client will appeal.
"The debate is about Mr Harabiš and his team living in the popularity of Bolek Polívka," said Polívka's attorney after the trial.
He thinks that in the words of the Valachi kingdom, everyone is actor-comic.
Harabiš also shares this opinion.
"We have almost ten years of work behind us.
Finding the money and finding out what's going on," he said.
He thinks the reason for the debate is money.
"In years, they found out that the project could succeed and win something from it.
They want to live from our work," he said.
Revenue business
According to the court, the name of King valachi was used in the first television show by Polívka.
In 1993 Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned it.
At that time, however, this was not linked to the purpose of building a figurative kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the thought of the issue of the valach passports.
The original student action became a business and profitable entrepreneurial activity, after which Harabiš founded the creation of a society of the Vikansko Kingdom.
In 1997, with the consent of the name and signature of Polivika in the passports, and even at the visit of his farm and theatre performances, these owners offer discounts.
Who holds the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabiš was using the idea only for the purpose of publicising the company in Manes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polivika helped the project of the Kingdom of Valach," said the judge.
However, he added that the spirit of the project was Harabiš and his team on that intensive work.
The co-operation of today's controversial parties continued until 2000 when the official coronation of Harabiš Polívka was organised in Vsetín.
Since then, however, the disputes between Polivika and Harabiš were gathered to redeem King I. Boleslav forever.
In the kingdom he took the leading role of Harabiš as a mother queen in Jarmila Šuláko.
In 2002, Polívka against Harabiš and his associates filed a trial which was rejected by the Court today.
The battle planned by Harabiš could bring light into the debate for the throne and half the queen.
This fight should be a new king.
He didn't want to tell me the details and the date.
"We don't want to catch anything.
This should be something like a victory in Slovácko.
The king should be elected for a certain time.
Mr. Polivika may also be willing to come in," added Harabiš.
Test of 207 SW 1.6 VTi Peugeot: missing prejudices
Honestly, I never liked Peugeo 206.
The characteristics of the run are nothing strange, the quality of the change, the management and production can be used as under average many times.
But Peugeot 207 is much better than the successor already present on the market.
And the comb called SW goes another step further, so there's nothing left for me to think more about.
When I tested Peugeot's 207 classic hatchback, for example, I complained in the back seat where I left the head.
This time, the complaint is over here, because the combi's arm means that there are no two-metre giants suffering in this respect.
♪ In the world ♪
I'm going to get through the inner space soon so I can't repeat myself a lot.
This is a relatively good design, where my only objection to the poor console is.
I'd appreciate some more designer invention here if the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable, and where are the times when we complained about the short bottom or arms of the seat.
The side management also improved significantly against model 206.
As far as the area is concerned, there is also evidence of an increase in the size of the cord.
In the comb, the head disappears in a few places that have been mentioned.
Skins in the trunk
So this car is the main package.
This is very accessible (as well as through the back window that can be driven out) and should be assessed as a spacious terrace.
Empty spaces are equipped with longitudinal rubbers, which are ideal compromises.
They're not in the way, they're distracted, and they can handle harder objects at the time.
But let's stay at the volume a little bit.
This is based on the tables in the basic arrangement of 428 litres, which is rather an average value against competition.
However, in Czech Republic, the most sought vehicle of this class is not against Skoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW with the product of the new generation of mlada boleslav, then we find that Peugeot will be long behind 52 litres.
This value is almost critical for foreign holidays or incorporation of a baby car.
But if I should highlight the positives, then I should mention the almost completely straight floor after pulling off the backs of the second line or the very low threshold.
120 horsepower in four rows
The car we tested was delivered with an engine of four cylinders with an output of 1,6 litres of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, that's how you should look like a thousand hundred people who run a family hatchback.
Silent, small consumption and mainly pulling.
If we compare it to the ðkoda-compliant, which often seems to be like a rag in his exhaust, so I can only enjoy it.
The price is high
The car's price is not cheap.
However, we need to remember that we tested a car with a spacious inner space and a very good engine.
The car's going to pick up 329 900 Kč with a four-wire alien engine.
The car starts with 410 990 Kč, which is quite a lot.
The equipment of the tested Premium will be discarded with an additional 80 000 Kč.
Except for us, we even had advanced airbags, automatic climate, automatic window wiper launch, back windows, we had electric remote control....
I mean, the car's going to cost 531 900 Kč with a hook train.
This is a lot, but count Fabia's supplementary equipment, and you get a very similar result.
So there's nothing left but a brand-side decision.
The integration of Slovak students in British schools is unsuccessful
In British schools, the Eastern European child is becoming more and more concerned about the further development of local schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently facing many obstacles.
British schools have already registered cases when disputes between immigrants and children of domestic residents became violent.
The problems relating to the integration of Eastern European children are illustrated by a situation in the North East where discussions between their places and Slovak immigrants are increasing.
Difficulties between students, bondages already characterize parental relationships.
The situation was so far that in Chatham, the police arrested a Slovak woman who had a ten-year-old student with a railroad.
Guilty defends him by insulting him with racist secrets.
The police also had to go after the attack of two twelve-year-old girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls say that the man was racist remarks and he was thrown with stones.
"When we were headed home, a boy climbed up to the bus stop and started to spit on us.
When I told him to stop doing this, he hit us with apples and fingernails and then exposed his naked back," the mother of Slovak students wrote the new unpleasant case for The Times.
There are complaints from both parties.
One of the local citizens classified the debates on Eastern European immigrants as a survival struggle.
The above-mentioned cases indicate that the British schools are starting to become tense between locals and immigrants.
In Great Britain, there are 70,000 jobs earning Slovaks.
Approximately 30 thousand Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba is the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
The island of freedom for visitors is indeed the island of freedom.
Whatever you're expecting from your vacation, it can be done if you choose correctly.
The golden horse and white shores, high waves, or sea, calm as a fisherman.
Palm trees and all inclusive with waiters offering pizzas, ice creams or marble cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
It can be found in full and even richer lists of the Caribbean islands.
However, there is much more on the island, and this is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island of the Great Antilles.
During the Spanishs, Cuba was the U.S. Conquest of their conquers.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place human eye ever saw.
Havanna has become a treasure store and reloader that the Spanish have been robbed and transported to Europe in America.
Then the American age was followed.
The Nacional Hotel was built at the end of the 20s.
Lucky Luciano, one of the heads of the American Mafia, was built because everything in the United States was welcomed as a criminal (prior to a styling), in Cuba, and supported drugs, gambling, prostitution.
They were among his guests, for example.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havanna, tower houses were built, on the highways of the 50th century Cult symbolized by cars.
Ernest Hemingway bought property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and had his own yacht in Cojímar.
The walls of Bodeguita del Medio are decorated by the signatures of the stars and politicians of the American show business.
And today?
The Bodeguita wall in Havanna may be provided with your handmark.
They're mixing a cocktail at the bar of the dear Nacional Hotel.
And the 50s Cult's cars are traveling to this day in Havanna, because the once-exported giggles and your sons have rotten in this salty and wet air a long time ago.
Although the oldest part of Havanna has been substantially destroyed, there is no such beautiful colonial monuments in the area anywhere else.
Other places are getting prettier than Trinidad.
Given that tourism guarantees so much money, its development has a green path.
In the last 15 years, new hotels were not only built in Havanna but also in Varader, the coast of Holguín and islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another unique beauty in the world, which is mostly appreciated by trainees.
From their expanded plantations, sugar cane was transported into the sugar plants by steam and motor trains.
Their motor parks have not been renewed for decades, so the machines operating there are visible, whose age partners have been seen elsewhere only in museums.
Where do we go?
Most well-known places are not avoided by the majority of visitors to Cuba.
So you don't need to write too much about Varader or Havanna.
Maybe we should just remind you that there is a museum on the Hemingway Birth, and who loves the writer doesn't need to miss visiting this museum.
One of the most paintful parts of the Viňales Valley Cuba in the western part of the island.
Her vegetation grows from a calculus.
Pesticides, molluscs and rocks are rising steeply from the bottom of the valley and gathered in their shells by fertile soil, which also covers fragments of dense crops.
The valley is a place where maybe the best-quality Cuban tobacco is produced.
You can meet in a final form when you visit one of the Sivar factory plants in Havanna.
Some might also find it interesting that Major Zeman's episode was filmed there.
Trinidad
Ancient city founded shortly after the Spanish island colonisation.
The name and glory of the slave and sugar trade brought.
The economy filled a body in the beauty and monumentality of the not too big city.
In four centuries the colonial architecture, which had been significantly influenced by subsequent French residents, has almost nothing changed.
Trinidad is so misleading between the Escambray plane and the sea that there weren't even roads in the 50s of the last century that would have linked this country to the rest of the country.
That particular isolation helped to stay outside.
They didn't build anything there, so they didn't break up, everyone was happy to have a roof over his head.
If a person has more than a afternoon to Trinidadra, it's worth watching the interesting locations of the area like the Playa Ancoon beach or the Valley of the Cucoryards.
And tonight, it's proper to go to Casa de la Música, which, after darkness, is going back to you, where the music will only be quiet by morning.
Baracoa
Some of the towns in the eastern part of Cuba are viewed as the most beautiful city.
I'm sure that's what the way is already affecting this opinion.
Both roads from Guantanamo need to fight high and tanned mountains, leading to almost the nature affected by human activity.
The eastern continent of Cuba, thanks to the uninterrupted nature there, was included by UNESCO on the World Heritage List.
Here is its best chocolate, in the church there is a cross of Columbus (who is actually made after the shipping of Columbus) and a hill where the former castle stood and today the El Castillo hotel is located, some of which are the most well-known El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, Sierra Meastro plains, the Gulf of Sinó and Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana Chamber, the Caridad del Cobra patron of Cuba, the Santeria, the African religion, which has been confessed by former slaves, can be written a lot about all of this.
I mean, as they say right, it's better to see you once.
Afghan allies are passive, claiming to be Americans
The shortage of soldiers and the lack of equipment also affects the United States' Afghanistan mission.
According to the Minister for Defence, NATO should set out concrete plans for the next few years.
The Afghanistan mission is not supposed to take place, and the leaders of the countries in Edinburgh in Scotland, which have units in the southern part of the country have agreed.
In addition to increasing resistance to the Taliban movement, eight participating countries will also discuss further plans and coordination of allies.
While the United States Minister for Defence Robert Gates has called for greater activity this week by NATO teams, Great Britain considers the strengthening of the Afghan Government and the strengthening of development aid.
"Afghanistan's development is tangible, but military forces can only be part of the solution.
The other is to enable the people to launch further development of the economy and security," said BBC to Des Browne, British Minister for Des Browne.
Ninety percent
According to American government data, the afghan rebels are the strongest in the last five years.
The number of violent acts increased by 27 percent compared to last year and by 60 percent in the southern Helmand province.
NATO countries have about 40 000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the south.
According to the United States, however, the allies have reached their borders in the organisation and equipment of their teams.
More helicopters, soldiers and experts were specifically requested to teach the Afghan troops.
"We need to think seriously about the specific objectives of the future and the methods for achieving them," řekl Gates.
He spoke to Jaap de Hoop in a similar spirit today, the Secretary-General of NATO.
"I'm not happy about what's in Afghanistan on earth and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment that we need, and that's little," said Reuters news agency De Hoop at the end of the three-day talk with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Out passive
In recent months, there are discussions among the participating countries about whether all all the allies offer maximum in Afghanistan.
Germany was criticised, for example, because of its passiveness.
"The Germans are in a relatively large number of people in Afghanistan.
However, they were recruited in areas where violence and fighting requirements are not as high as in the southern and eastern parts of the country," Gates said.
Sun's British tab this week called the German soldiers lazy.
"The Afghan nappops discovered: The Germans play while our sons fight," wrote Sun in the material supplemented by the photographs of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild attacked and published a picture of a British team in the southern part of Afghanistan.
State debt reaches a billion in 2009
Every Czech crown is 84,000 government debts.
By the end of September, the total debt reached the crown of 842.7 billion.
This year, the government intends to borrow 159,2 billion kroons.
By the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced this plan by 152.8 billion kroons due to the better development of the public budget.
At the end of September, the Czech Republic’s debt has reached the crown of 842.7 billion.
Over the nine months of this year, it increased by 40.2 billion kroons.
However, it decreased from June by 13.4 billion kroons.
The Ministry of Finance has thus today confirmed its state debt data from the beginning of October.
Each Czech crown will have more than 84.000 debts.
Last year, the state owed more than 11 billion crowns.
"To date, thanks to the lower deficit in the next year, it seems that the one-billion crown limit could only be exceeded in 2009.
The debt will move around 900 billion and a billion dollars in the next year," said David Marek, an analyst of the iHNed.cz server in Patria Finance.
Similarly, the analyst of Next Finance, Vladimír Pikora, sees this: "We can move through a billion dollars during 2009.
It depends exactly when, for now, on the unknown next budget.
If it proves that the situation would change in the policy area, the politicians would be willing to retreat more, it would be possible until 2010.
But I don't presume that change," he said.
Increased debts
State debt is formed by central government debts, primarily by accumulating government deficits.
The public debt is financed with cash tickets, public bonds, direct loans, or, for example, by loans from the European Investment Bank.
The government's internal debt has grown for the year to a maximum of 38.5 billion kroons of 719.4 billion.
The foreign debt of the State has so far increased by 1.7 billion to 123.3 billion kroons.
By the end of September, the so-called public debt was reduced by 803,3 billion kroons and 13,7 billion kroons from June.
The average amount of government debt increased for 6.5 years.
"The debt between the entire year has increased by 13 per cent in the first quarter, which is indeed quite much compared to economic progress.
Interestingly, the rise is primarily generated by bonds where the increase is 20 percent.
The wrong thing is that the debt is growing, but on the other hand, this shows that it will be because to trade when the pension reform comes here," Pikora commented on the data.
It's better than waiting.
The funding strategy and the management of public debt in 2007 shows that this year the government has planned to borrow 159,2 billion kroons.
By the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan by 152.8 billion kroons due to the better development of the public budget.
This is mainly the deficit of the public budget, which is likely to reach 76 billion kroons this year instead of 91.3 billion kroons.
In addition, the Czech Consolidation Agency is planning a maximum of 13,3 billion kroons, a ten billion reserve to pay pensions, a financing of state bonds of kroon 43 billion and a reimbursement of loans of 1,8 billion kroons from the European Investment Bank.
The teacher presents today in a cartel court for a name given to a plissi bear
A cartel court sentenced the British teacher to 15 days in prison and expulsion from the country on Thursday night in Sudan due to the violation of Islamic law.
The British woman was accused of being called Mohamed, but Islamic religion forbids any representation of his prophet.
Such action can be punished by bruise.
The 54-year-old British woman, the teacher of Unity High School, was arrested on Sunday at his own apartment. Based on paragraph 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, was accused of Islam’s violation and rebellion after the students’ parents complained several times to the Ministry of Education in Sudan.
The story began in September when the teacher asked his 6-7-year-old students to choose a name for the class's plüss bear.
"A total of eight names were proposed: Hassan, Abdullah and Mohamed were included," says Robert Boulos, head of the school.
Finally, 20 children from 23 voted for Mohamed's first name.
Of course, Mohamed is the name of the Prophet Islamic, but also a very common crossname in Sudan.
The kids then made a diary with the picture of the bear and "My name is Mohamed."
The problem is that any representation of the prophet is a violation of Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' colleagues at the same school in Muslim said that he knew him well and that the teacher would never have done anything that would hurt any religious belief.
Many students of the student agree with this opinion, they think the teacher treats the children very well, and they say that he never talks about religion in the class.
Let us not forget that Mohamed Great Britain is the second most popular crossname, and in English there are 14 different styles of writing.
This surname chosen so many times by the Muslim families is one of the ways of honoring the prophet. (Gyakran is given this name by the firstborn child of the family.)
But what rules apply to the use of the first name?
Can you get that name, for example, a game?
It's obviously a question of interpretation.
There was no agreement on the future status of the region at the last Vienna negotiations on Wednesday.
The outcome is failure.
Without the approach of the positions, the meeting between the Serbian and Kosovo Albania ended on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, the sixth and the last meeting on the future status of the Separatist Province.
"It is unfortunate that the parties have not reached an agreement on the status", said Wolfgang Ischinger at an EU diploma at a Vienna press conference.
The American Ambassador, Mr Wisner, stressed that in the region peace is at risk and urged Belgrade and Pristina to comply with their promises to maintain peace and dialogue after the negotiations.
"There must be no violence in the near future, but there is a very difficult period," he said, highlighting the existence of "public tensions".
On 10 December, the mediation will end
Last visit to Serbia and Kosovo on Monday is the mediator of the European Union, the United States and Russia.
The future of the 90 percent of Albanian residential province can be clarified after Ischinger, Wisner and the Russian intermediary Alekszandr Bocan-Harcsenko submits its report to the United Nations Security Council by 10 December.
The meeting near Vienna, Baden, reported the sixth and last meeting of the negotiations since the United Nations relied on the troy in August last year.
The Americans and Europeans consider their mediation mission to be completed on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already failed Kosovo's independence in the Security Council, will continue negotiations even after the expiry of the deadline.
"Russia was committed and remains a negotiating solution, in favour of the compromise," said Bocan-Harcsenko.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After Kosovo has been under the responsibility of the United Nations for eight years, western authorities believe that independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina has announced that it is ready to declare its autonomy unilateral if the Security Council decides not to benefit him.
Belgrade would continue to support greater autonomy.
Unfortunately, we have not reached an agreement, announced by the President of the independent region of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the baden hotel where the last chance negotiations have been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the uprising in Kosovo and the future Prime Minister of the province also expressed regret.
He added, however, that the idea of autonomy in Belgrade would be "continuation of the past that affects murders and deportations".
"Domino Effect"
The Serbian President, Boris Tadic, believed that the compromise was still possible, and the Albanian majority in Kosovo warned about the consequences of the unilateral pronouncement of independence.
Belgrade is still in an unstable region because of the wars of independence in the nineties.
"For Serbia, this does not preclude the possibility of a compromise", Tadic said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation reiterated that the decision would be exclusively for the Security Council, where the Russian ally had the right to waiver.
"The final word will be for the Kosovo Parliament"
"For Serbia, only a solution approved by the Security Council is acceptable", announced by Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"The negotiations took two years.
They must end at the same time where they began: in the Security Council".
Fatmir Sejdiu said to the journalists that "the final word will be for the Kosovo Parliament".
Bush urges an agreement between Israel and Palestine
On Tuesday, President Bush announced at the opening of the international peace conference in Annapolis in Maryland, that Israel and Palestina finally agreed to sign a joint statement.
According to Bush, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmúd Abbász agreed that they would immediately negotiate between their peoples in order to settle the debate for 60 years.
In the presence of the two presidents, Bush promised to support them in all possible ways in order to sign the "peace agreement" in 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must eliminate the "terrorism networks" and Israel should abandon colonial activities - Bush announced and reminded the two parties of their commitments with regard to the "béke synthetic plan" adopted in 2003.
The Head of the White House stressed that the objective of the negotiations between the Palestinian Authority and Israel was to "sign a peace agreement that solves all the problems involved, including central issues".
The latter are concerned with three difficult problems at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian debate: the future borders of Palestine, the situation of Jerusalem, and the fate of Arab refugees who have escaped from their homes during the 1948 conflict, who have lived in the territory of the state of Israel today.
Abbász, who spoke after the President of the United States, kept in mind that future negotiations would be "global and deep" and affect all areas of regulation, such as "Jeruzalem, asylum, national borders, colonies, water and security".
Then Olmert, who entered the platform, promised that future negotiations would be "intermediate and continuous" and that he would try to "end up even in 2008.
By the end of 2008, Bush set out the implementation of the "view of two states" of Palestinian and Israel.
Saudi Arabia stated that Bush made a promise to this before he decided to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia ( whose participation was booked by Annapolis as a success in Washington), with the support of all Arab countries, initiated a plan which guarantees peace by Israel if it is replaced by all Arab areas, including Eastern Jerusalem, occupied during the 1967 war.
Annapolis "is an answer in the history of the Middle East, especially because of the root of the problem and focusing on the central issues" - believes the Prince of Saudi in his interview with the Arab newspaper of Saudi.
The prosecutor says the police aren't responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As usually in such news, the official position and the vocabulary contradict each other.
How did the accident happen?
According to the first data of the investigation initiated by the National Police General Inspection Body (IGPN), a police car went to the Louise-Michel Street in Villiers-le-Bel, a few minutes after 17 hours.
"The car was patroled, so he wasn't in action.
The young "high speed" without two helmets was driven by a green, "not included in the official register, so it is not available on the road market" (see below) with Kawasaki brand engine.
"When they didn't comply with the right hand rule, the engine hit the left side of the police car," says the police.
The result of the alcohol test on passengers of the vehicle was negative.
The strength of the impact is well shown that the front of the car was rolled in, the windscreen star was torn in shape, and the pusher was shut down.
Attorney General Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry's extraordinary announcement last morning, said that IGPN and Val-D'Oise County National Security Directorate have been entrusted with the investigation that was initiated 'for the lack of human murder and assistance'.
During the afternoon, the prosecutor said at a press conference that, at the current stage of IGPN investigation, the responsibility of the police could be excluded.
According to the prosecutor, three witnesses interviewed the accident on Sunday night confirmed "the report of the police that the robber arrived relatively quickly from the left side of the police car."
On the day of the last day, from a strip, which undoubtedly the footwear pulled on the road, it was shown that the two vehicles were stuck together for a while until the police car managed to control it.
Vehicles were booked for technical testing.
The two victims were killed yesterday by the medical examiner.
What happened directly after that?
Last night, the Villiers-le-Bel talk spread as a runaway fire, saying that the cops quickly left the scene without helping the two young people.
In this regard, the IGPN is careful, but it excludes that the police have made any serious mistakes.
"This is the hardest part of the investigation, which requires even more thorough investigations and increased precautions," we learned from the police source.
Liveration met a witness who reported a few minutes after the accident.
One of your home windows is looking exactly at the location.
"My cousin, who's a hospital nurse, went down to try to revive them," tells the witness.
"We can't do anything."
Then he noticed "a cop who was completely disturbed and strangled.
The other two tried to revive one young, and the fourth called."
The tension amongst the presents was increasing, as the unwanted situation of the two young people became apparent, so the incoming police took their colleagues away from the scene by car.
We also know from the witness's announcement that the ambulance arrived "about 20 minutes after the police left."
They also used heart massage, but they didn't.
"I wouldn't say the police weren't trying to help young people.
Young people got a lot of help.
Firefighters arrived at the scene immediately.
They did everything to save them," the prosecutor stressed.
Increased tension in Pakistan
On Monday, the Pakistani police blocked the first demonstrations introduced by General Musarraf two days earlier.
According to witnesses, in the eastern part of the country, Lahore, about two thousand lawyers, demonstrating the measures introduced in the state of emergency, have been injured from light gas bombs used by police forces.
In response, they threw the cops with stones, many of whom were injured.
At least 350 lawyers were produced.
Similar events occurred in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where the police attacked and wounded the lawyers.
They've produced more people.
In Islamabad, registered lawyers of the Supreme Court have called for general strikes, and demonstrations have been filed for the arrest of around 500 opposition members, human rights warriors and lawyers on the weekend.
On Monday morning, streets to the Supreme Court were closed to prevent the gathering.
There were several demonstrations in Multan and in the northwest of Peshawar in the central part of the country.
Since Monday, the great Buthida Majlis-e-Amal alliance has supported the movement of lawyers to send flowers to those judges who disagree with the state of emergency and the eyes of those who swore before Musarraf."
"The promise of Musarraf is no longer valid."
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the exceptional measure notified on Saturday night.
The Court shall declare in the coming days the legality of the re-election of President Musarraf indirectly voted on 6 October.
The President of the Court of Justice, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been removed and has been replaced.
"What we are witnessing is illegal, anti-constitutional and contradictory with the rulings of the Supreme Court", the President said to the newspaper The News.
President Pervez Musarraf's promise to leave the army for the civilian presidential role, after the introduction of the state of emergency, he announced that Deputy Minister of Information, Tariq Azeem, was announced on Monday.
Musarraf had to decorate his military uniform until the end of his first presidential mandate until 15 November.
The Vice-President of Information also confirmed the news of postponing the January elections.
The Pakistani Government, by the way, disregarded the country-wide rumor that Musarraf would have appointed a place of forced dwelling as a general.
More than a third of the pregnancies are not designed
This result includes undesirable (24%) or inadequate or unplanned pregnancy.
Even today, more than a third of pregnancys (36%) are not planned - out of the study of the French National Democratic Institute (Ined) forty years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act liberalising contraception.
This result includes undesirable (24%) or inadequate or unplanned pregnancy.
Ined estimates that different contraceptive methods such as tablets or bees spiral are still failing in 5 to 6% of the cases.
However, according to the Institute, the liberalisation of contraception has made the "birth regulation" more effective. The study notes that only 5% of women aged 20 to 44 were taken contraceptive pills in 1970, but today this proportion is 60%.
Today, there are 8 of 10 pregnant women planned.
Each fiveth plans with a few months of accuracy, and if possible, it's spring, because it's the most favorable season for the child's reception.
Wonderful repair on space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) had to work for more than seven hours in space to implement the spectacular improvement of the solar panel essential to the scientific activity of the station.
This dangerous space has proven to be a record in several respects: repairs have taken a long time, very little time to plan, and distantly from the housing modules, the spaceshiprs had to do with "green" tools.
The problem occurred on Tuesday when the astronauts separated the Harmony module from Discovery. It is a huge cylinder-shaped element that will soon be the location of European and Japanese scientific laboratory activities (see the framed section).
This module is a kind of passage to laboratory modules.
However, we need to take care of their electricity supply.
The second task of the crew was therefore to relocate one of the modules producing electricity from the 17,5 tons of solar panels, which were already on the ISS, to its final location.
Then the crew began opening the 76-metre wide solar panels of the module.
One of the harmonicly cordable boards was then infringed by a closed cable in approximately one metre length.
In order to avoid further injury, the table has not been opened.
The task of spacecrafts was originally to make a check on the Discovery Space Rock and then to correct another malfunctioning cycle solar panel. Instead, they had to devote their full time to repairing the damaged solar panel.
Scott Parazynski was chosen to do the show on a 30-metre robot arm of the space slope on the crane of the station.
He's one of the best "space walkers" of NASA.
He's tall, strong, very good, has a muscle body and a long arm.
So the 46-year-old man with a doctor's degree had to "operate" the "injured" solar panel.
After thoroughly assessing the damage caused, he cut the wrong cable, and a few "bone" fixed the damaged area.
He also helped me with another "space walker" who stayed close to the safe passport, and from inside the other astronauts, including the crew captain, Peggy Whitson.
The tool he used, a mini hockeybot, which was designed to isolate against hundreds of voltages of solar panels, the astronauts of the station were assembled and "greened".
After the operation, Scott Parazynski waited until his associates fully opened the board and only then packed his tools and returned to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts had half a day's rest, and then they returned to Discovery Space Rock weekly to begin their scheduled return to the Wednesday.
Exchange rate of EADS shares decreased
The price of EADS stocks fell on the Paris stock exchange after the company that manufactured aircraft and protective equipment announced that the delay in the development of A400M aircraft will result in an additional cost of EUR 1,2-1,4 billion.
The exchange rate of EADS shares is currently EUR 21.96 after 4% reduction.
The company was forced to review its 2007 operating forecasts, since the development of A400M engines is delayed, which is likely to result in the delay of the aircraft landing.
The delay in the transfer of aeroplane in combat, declared in October, will cost between EUR 1.2 billion and EUR 1.4 billion, of which more than 1 billion affects Airbus, announced by the European EADS parent company.
Due to the occurrence of these expenditure, the EADS should report new figures on its operational performance in future Thursday 2007 when it announced its quarterly results, but it did not provide further figures.
The Group also indicated that the six-month delay was taken into account when preparing its new cost assessment.
In 2006, the EADS operating result decreased by 86%, mainly due to the delay in the development of another programme, the A380 giant machine, which also has a major financial burden on the company.
The company originally designed to transfer A400M to the French army in October 2009.
remain a status quo
There is no big surprise for Sunday elections: a large majority of Russians will vote on the Head of State of Putin, the Universe Russia.
This is the need for stability of the Russians, to say, self-government after a strongly manipulated campaign.
Today, three days before the parliamentary elections, the Russian Head of State Vladimir Putyin is speaking through public service channels in a television message to the electorates, which has already been recorded, but its content is still classified.
Putin is the leader of the Kremlt support party, the list of candidates for the United Russia, which is expected to win a devastating victory in the elections.
During yesterday's reception of foreign ambassadors, the Head of State did not tell us anything: it was just another explosion against the interventions of the Western countries, which was the subject he liked during the campaign.
"We know what the price for real democracy is, so we want absolute transparency and open elections without any infringement" he said.
However, according to the opposition, this is not the case.
The opposition condemns the campaign in which they believe that the electorals were under pressure.
The leader of the Communist Party, Gen. Zjuganov, says, "that's not a dirty choice in Russia, even in the time of Jelcin".
After the last weekend protests, the former chess world champion Garri Kaszparov was sentenced to five days for unauthorised demonstration, and his lawyer claims he's not allowed to visit.
"The Russians still think like "homo sovieticus"
The predictable election results raise two more obvious questions:
- Who's following Putin in the Head of State?
The date of the first round of the presidential elections was published yesterday in the Official Journal, which will take place on 2 March 2008 and the candidates may indicate their intention of departure by 23 December.
Since Vladimir Putyint was elected in 2000 and 2004, its mandate cannot be extended.
But your other successor isn't on the sights.
What role does Putin play in March?
Will he be the Prime Minister?
Or will he, as leader of the Almighty Uniform Russia Party or the majority of Parliament, decide on the government and the President?
Whatever happens, the departing power wins both in Parliament and in the presidential elections.
This is now a tradition.
"The Russians are still thinking about "homo sovieticus: they don't feel that they can control their fate", believes sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent center of Levada.
The historic history of the University of Saint Petersburg in Copenhagen is even further farther: according to his theory, the country became a Christian five hundred years later than Europe, so the development of civil society is late, and the traditional community spirit has hindered the development of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 90s, "Putyin returned to the paternalistic model, which was perfectly suited to the people, as this new paternalism was more than fearing, but accompanied by certain economic well-being" - believes Maria Lipman, a co-worker of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians "reject personal responsibility from their own minds", which appeared quickly after the Soviet Union was destroyed.
"Why should we think?"
The phenomenon affects all the layers of society, even the business world.
The administrative elite was interested in maintaining the current situation: the local lists of the United Russia are led by 65 governors, who are removed from the 85 Russian leaders.
The freedom imported from the West often carries the chaos, as was the case in the 90s.
The public opinion favours stability.
In this spirit, the Russians don't vote for extreme parties.
54-year-old teacher Tamara Cherednyicsko said, "Why should we think?
Those in power aren't so bad, why should we replace them?"
Reflecting memories
After more than 60 years of encryption, the Bad Arolsen archive has become public, documenting 17 and a half million victims of the religious regime.
The 47 million archive document, which occupies 27 kilometres of shells in Bad Arolsen, in the Hessen Province, has so far been searchable only for "humanitarian" purposes, i.e. only a unique and nominal visit to the victims or their descendants.
In May 2006, the 11 States, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, agreed to open the archive to researchers and historians.
After each state ratified the Convention, the archive was opened yesterday.
Confidential information
The opening of the Bad Arolsen file allows historians to carry out research on "the transfer of prisoners, the residents of the camps and the health status of the forced workers", explains Reto Meistern, director of the archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross.
Until now, several States, including Germany, have opposed the publicisation of documents as they contain names and thus confidential information.
Such could be the presumed homosexuality or mental disability of some deported victims.
The lists of concentration camps and the arrest warrants issued by Gestapo began to be gathered for practical reasons after the war. The goal was to search for civilians deported or convicted on these grounds and perhaps to provide evidence of their internship on the basis of which they could receive compensation.
More than 300 permanent workers in Bad Arolsen are currently dealing with the processing of tens of thousands of individual needs.
However, a part of the scientific community does not consider the opening of the Bad Arolsen archive to be of outstanding importance.
"These documents are essentially nothing new", announced in 2006 Professor Wolfgang Benz, Director of the Research Centre for the Antisemitism of the Berlin University of Technology.
The EU-India Free Trade Convention would be signed in 2008
The turnover of Indian bilateral trade at annual level already reaches EUR 60 billion.
The EU is the first trading partner in India and 18% of its external trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign the Free Trade Convention in 2008 - Peter Mandelson has announced the European Trade Commissioner and the Indian Minister for Trade in Kamal Nath.
Last April, EU Ministers for Foreign Affairs have already approved that the European Commission should initiate negotiations to sign free trade agreements with India, South Korea and the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN). The annual trafficking of Indian bilateral trade is now about EUR 60 billion.
The EU is the first trading partner in India and 18% of its external trade.
In addition, the EU is also the major foreign investor in India, but India is only the 9th most important trading partner in the EU, according to the figures of the European Commission.
Peter Mandelson said that "a free trade agreement could have an economic booster effect for both parties" and "India could thus increase its presence in a flourishing market of 450 million inhabitants".
The European Commissioner added the 10 most important products exported by India to the primary or secondary importers: the two giant products, Europe and Asia exchanged '47 billion euros' and '10 billion euros' each year, expressed Danièle Smadja, the head of the European Commission's delegation in NewDelhi. However, he expressed his regret that bilateral trade has not always achieved its full potential. In Friday, the EU and India, the President of the European Commission, meets in the eighth diplomatic summit in NewDelhi, involving Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and José Manuel Durao Barroso.

Response to concerns: Bank of England offers £10 billion to the money market for a five-week maturity
The Bank of England wishes to alleviate the negligence of credit contingencys, so it announced on Thursday that it pumps £10 billion on the money market, which, unlike 5,75%, is available at this time with a five-week maturity.
"We want to simplify the concerns that the financial market conditions will be particularly poor at the end of the year, and we would like banks to plan their liquidity position in a more secure way for this period. Therefore, a significant part of the Bank's reserves will be offered in the framework of an open market operation in the international financial market from 6 December to 5 weeks" - the bank's press release.
According to the bank, 10 billion pounds (EUR 14 billion) will be marketed on 6 December at 12:15 local time. The offer will be valid for the central bank's fund rate and the repayment deadline will be 10 January.
This is the first time that the Bank of England issues liquid funds for five weeks in the framework of an open market operation.
The duration of such operations is usually one week.
In the Bank of England press release, he added that it was "prepared to take further measures" in order to ensure that interbank loans are adapted to the central bank's basic interest rate.
The current interbank interest rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate was above the level of September 18: it currently stands at 6.6%.
Since the beginning of the summer financial market crisis, the Bank of England has charged significant criminal interest on the amounts pumped to the money market, which has prevented banks from using them.
According to the vocabulary (which only strengthens the exchange rate of the quid compared to the euro), many would have been more pleased with the resources offered by the European Central Bank, which could have benefited from more favourable interest rates and more discretion.
The UMP and the NC refuse to examine the socialist proposal on customer power
On Thursday, the UMP and the Nouveau Centre group closed off from discussing the articles of the Socialist Law proposal on Customer Force, which is equivalent to the refusal of the text itself.
The text, which was discussed at the meeting of the Socialists, included about ten measures adopted on Tuesday by the National Office of the Socialist Party, including 50% increases in employment supplements, the restoration of variable fuel tax, the introduction of a travel check and the limitation of rental fees.
Since the UMP and NC 180:115 voted against the examination of articles, the discussion of the government and the opposition at times with sharp voice changes ended in the end. This was only a few hours before President Sarkozy's television talk about the shopping force.
The head of the Socialist Delegation, Jean-Marc Ayrault, announced that his group will submit all its proposals again in the context of the amendment of the draft amending financial law, which will be on the agenda of the Parliament next week.
A New Festival is Born
A number of rumors circulated on the new Philadelphia Music Festival organised by the C3 Presents. However, the company organising the event has now announced that the Vineland music festival will be held in New Jersey in cooperation with the British producer company Melvin Benn, the Festival Republic.
"It's an honor to us that we can work with a person who is the launcher of today's American festival," said Charlie Jones from C3 to Billboard.com.
C3 also organises the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago and the music festival in Austin City Limits.
The Vineland in New Jersey is arranged on a festival summer, so there will be ways to take a tent.
The festival will be held between 8 and 10 August on a 500 - month private area located from Philadelphia for about 40 minutes.
The director of the Festival Republic, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is Melvin Benn one of the world's greatest honorary festival organisers.
He started the British Reading Festival in 1989, which attracts around 80 000 visitors each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn extended his palet with the Leeds Festival, and in 2006, the Festival Republic invited the Latitude Festival to life at Henham Park in Suffolki.
Since 2002 Melvin Benn has been a co-owner of the Glastonbury Festival's producer, license and organisational tasks. This festival is now able to accept up to 177 500 people.
The C3 colleague, Charlie Jones, the Glastonbury Festival, called it the most inspiring event he ever participated in. He added that his company and Melvin Benn's company work in parallel to the region's wealth of a European-style festival plan.
"The scene in Philadelphia has already been selected before, and with the Fairmount Parks Committee, we worked hard to arrange this in the center of the festival in Philadelphia," said Charlie Jones.
"We had a discussion with the city, and the Commission showed great enthusiasm for our plan.
Unfortunately, because of the political forces of the city leadership, the organization failed," continued Charlie Jones.
"We were happy to talk to Melvin Benn about this, and now we're preparing to organize a huge festival at another unique location, which will ultimately serve the interests of the people of Philadelphia."
The C3 Presents revived Lollapalooza in 2005 at the Grant Park in Chicago, after he proved his exceptional festival organizers at the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
The gross revenue of the two events in 2007 was 9.8 million and 11.3 million dollars.
Both festivals were held at a city location.
"Melvin Benn's European concept is based on the rural festival, while our festivals usually take place in urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to combine the two models in some way and to create both the European rural mood and the common sense of urban life in America."
Vineland is located around halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"Vineland's population, and even the mayor himself is eager to support the event," says Charlie Jones.
Although you are not talking about the details of the agreement, you are telling me that "the conditions are good enough to allow investment in such a big event at a location that will hopefully give the festival a home for a long time".
Charlie Jones says that the festival will be a "great" size, and its reception capacity is approximately 80 000 people in Bonnaroo's music festival in Tennesse.
The bands have already received the invitation to the event, but nothing is final at the time of the press release.
"The Vineland is basically going to be a rock festival, but we're planning a variety of musical offers that everyone can find something for his sake," says Charlie Jones.
Jones and his two partners, Charlie Walker and Charles Attal, together, form the C3 company, which has received the "best independent event organiser" award at the latest Billboard Touring Award.
Montreal faces the Terminator
It's not easy to seduce Hollywood directors to Montreal if you have to fight the Terminator with you...
"Seduction" is one of the tasks sent to Montreal.
The mission is "politically difficult", as Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger is opposed to shooting its own productions abroad.
Is it really hard to fight with the "Terminator Governor"?
"We need to be cautious, 'cause the movie industry decides what's best for the scene.
If you find that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, you will go there.
Our task is to offer the best possible conditions to be decided by us", says Schwarzenegger.
Race for Festivals
Denis Turcotte, however, focuses most on promoting Canadian films.
The competition for the Oscars started.
The aim is to present and promote more québeci movies at all American film festivals, whether Sundance Film Festival or Denveri, Seattle or San Francisco Film Festival.
The L'Âge des teénèbres was welcomed a few weeks ago at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival.
In January, they will also be thrown at the Palm Springs International Festival.
The Shake Hands with the Devil is presented in Santa Monica as well as in November 30 Starz Denver Film Festival.
Québec also represented himself with four short films and four play movies this month at the American Film Institute Fest event.
Will the end of the year be a rally on the stock market?
Nearly five weeks before the end of the financial year, investors are rushing their hands and looking forward to the usual end of the year.
This year, however, it is not clear for experts to see whether this will actually happen.
According to Banif, "from a statistical point of view in December, the stock exchange is usually acting positive.
However, only statistical forecasts are not necessarily appropriate, and even in the current situation there is uncertainty in the market, at least in the short term."
Experts do not preclude the end of the stock exchange year, although they say that "the stock exchange market is maintained in the presence of liquidity, this gives an opportunity to invest because there is no guaranteed alternatives, in particular fixed yield for which it is negatively affected by escape to quality securities, as long as in the short term".
Therefore, they believe that the stock exchange will be characterised by a side-driven movement without volatility, "especially as the impact of the Fed interest rate reduction is unknown, the price of raw oil is high and also threatens inflation tension".
Javier Barrio, the BPI's sales responsibility in Spain agrees with this, i.e. it would be risky to say that there will be rally.
According to the expert, "the situation isn't rusty."
The loss of Ibex is almost 4 per cent compared to the highest values recorded on 8 November when the index was closed at 15.945,7 points.
Despite all of this, not all experts are so scratchy.
According to the Intermoney analyst, Juan Solana, Ibex 35 may close the year closer to 16,000 points due to the reorganisation of wallets and payments to the usual pension fund at this time.
On the other hand, the expert adds that some change is expected this year, as the week after the long weekend on the Constitution’s Festival will take place by the second week of December.
The analyser considers volatility to affect market trends unlikely.
According to Inversis Banco’s analyst, Federico Olucha, we are close to the technical level and "that is why we can see the stock exchange index falls, which can rise depending on the news from the USA, as regards the consequences of the credit market crisis".
The analyst trusts that these will be positive.
The analysts agree on securities aimed at achieving the new maximum quotas of Ibex.
Solana, from Intermoney, stresses that "it's on big securities this year."
The expert would put two large banks and some construction companies on the list, "when the electricity sector will be very expensive by then."
Federico Olucha states from Inversis Banco that the increase is due to the banking sector and the industry.
Rally can also be positive for construction companies, of course if it does.
"The ACS has been trying to regain its positions for several months and we hope that Ferrovial and FCC construction companies will follow this way", says the expert.
Cyclical consumption will be the main player of the remainder of the year due to the increase in sales during the period of Christmas sale.
On the other hand, according to the expert, technology companies can also benefit, although the Spanish market is not very high in this area.
Five times in seven years
For the last seven years, only two falls in exchange rates have occurred in December.
The real rally at the end of the year could be observed in 2003 when stock exchange markets emerged from the crisis caused by the shrinking technological bubbles.
This year, when Ibex 35 corrected 28.17 percent, a 6.68% jump was registered in December.
Thus, it is still open that 2007 will be the fifth year afterwards profitable (Ibex shows an increase of 8.36% since January) and whether the final rally can occur.
Banco Popular Español opens a 12-hour account from Monday to Saturday from 200
Banco Popular Español has decided to renew most of its accounts.
A total of 200 branches located in the most commercially affected parts of Spain.
These accounts run under the Popular Max name and make a big change for the bank.
But for the rest of the Spanish institutions, this is the first group to be held open on a regular basis until 20.30 p.m. and even on a Saturday from 10:00 p.m. to 20.30 p.m.
The other group, BBVA, which has also repeatedly called for the extension of its accounts, has not yet taken the necessary steps.
However, he is now preparing to agree with trade unions that he would close 75% of his accounts to open up in exchange for one afternoon, although not for the public.
The experience of Banco Popular Español will be crucial for the other institutions, as they will decide whether to join a more favourable opening initiative.
This is exactly the objective of the Banco Popular Español project.
I would like to target private individuals, small and medium-sized enterprises, individual entrepreneurs and local business in these places.
The bank would like to operate 200 branches throughout Spain for 18 months, as this is not a new opening order, but an existing transformation.
To this end, the institution will modernise its branches in trade zones according to the needs of customers of each street.
In this way, the extension of the opening time will be accompanied by a new type of thinking of the nature of drawers, a more modern, colorful design.
Angel Rivera, responsible for commercial banks, points out that there is no need for major investment to be reorganised, but more employees need to be engaged, which represents eight or nine employees per branch instead of the current six.
The branches, in which even negotiaters for SMEs are established, will also sell non-financial products.
Favourable Experience
The initiative has already been implemented in the three Madrid branches of Banco Popular Español.
According to Ángel Rivero, the experience was positive.
In the streets of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía, Madridi had the choice, and Rivero said that the decision was correct.
Banco Popular Español currently has 2.500 accounts.
More 60 works under the name Mundocredit, specializes in immigrants, and also has a very favourable opening order, even on Sundays and holidays.
In the units mentioned by PopularMax, the BBVA model is not used where some branches offer a wide range of non-financial products.
"We don't want to create competition for our customers," Rivero shows.
Currently they have managed to agree with Telefónica and will sell mobile phones using external staff.
Telecinco's first double rival, Antena's 3 stock exchanges
"We did it."
With this sentence, Paolo Vasile, the commissioned consultant of Telecinco, expressed satisfaction yesterday when closing the market, when it turned out that his leading TV taxi doubled the value of Antena 3.
One thing, though, was making her happy: "It's just that it's not because we've risen more, but because we've fallen less," he said.
Even so, it stressed that we've fallen less on the weak market.
Telecinco closed last night with a 2,54 percent increase.
This increase puts its annual loss at 15.66 per cent.
52 percent of the company is Mediaset, 13 percent of Vocento, so the stock exchange value is EUR 4.488.88 million.
Rivala, Antena 3 lost 1.52 percent yesterday and has been booking 40.5 percent since January, so yesterday it cost half of 2.93.46 million.
The value of the other registered communication companies is 3.571 million for Sogecable; for Prisa (publicator of Cinco Días) 2.518.53 million for Prisa and for Vocento 1.779 million.
According to Vasile, comparison with Antena 3 can be found to be similar between the two companies.
The question is how much we can do on the same market, what costs, and how we can reverse this in the field of views.
Last week, Telecinco announced that this year he wanted to be a TV channel over the first gross 1 billion commercials, said Giuseppe Tringali, a consultant of Telecinco and Publiespaña.
In the event of the notified facts, compared to 965.4 million for the 2006 financial year, the TV channel would increase its advertising revenue by 3.6%.
The total net turnover of Antena 3 increased by 1.6 per cent in the first nine months of the financial year (so reached 734.4 million), while the net turnover of television increased by 0.7 per cent (630.4 million).
According to the analysts, one of the factors that triggered the lease of Telecinco's stock exchange is the high payout that has been maintained so far: in 2006, the shareholder of the company's profits of the President Alejandro Echevarria distributed 100 % of its shareholders.
Vasile says - although it's too early to decide - this rate may change after buying 33% of Endemol's mother company, associated with Mediaset.
"We have recently guaranteed the payment of at least 50%, although we have always shared much more.
I hope that this year our shareholders will be satisfied, because they have already benefited from the 33% of Endemol's purchase."
The analysts say that the market is currently characterised by some decay.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced their return estimates for Telecinco by 7 per cent in 2008 and 7 per cent in 2009.
According to their comments, this can mean that the estimated increase in turnover in 2008 will fall from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent and in 2009 from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent.
According to the same company’s forecast, Antena 3’s profits will fall by 4.5 per cent in 2008 and by 7.5 per cent in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
Ibersecurities: it proposes to purchase both securities, mainly due to the high lease and long-term sustainable potential of the dividends.
2.
Caja Madrid: Telecinco is more favourable (purchase) than Antena 3 (continuation) because of the "multiple attraction" and its business strengthening.
3.
In both cases, the JPM body proposes sub-weighting due to "similar risks" (supported market and less favourable economic climate).
The Congress approves the adoption of MiFID which entered into force on 1 November
In parallel to the parliamentary procedure - which has now been closed by a congress vote approving the Senate's amendments - the government has initiated a social dialogue on the regulation based on the law so that both of them can come into effect before the end of the year.
Representatives of the various groups have consistently highlighted the efforts made by representatives and senators in negotiations and agreements to develop the most favourable standardisation of investor protection and to regulate the activities of companies in order to function effectively in the market.
Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, allows the modernisation of financial markets, while strengthening the protection of investors, broadening the supervisory rights of the Spanish National Securities Markets Committee (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the various supervisors of the European Union.
The new directive allows financial advisory services to be established by companies specialised in this regard, but also by natural or legal persons, as well as by securities dealer companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies, a new form of financial advisory companies (ESIS), namely financial advisory companies (AFI).
In addition, the law increases the number of systems suitable for the implementation of operations involving funds, thus adding to regulated secondary markets to multilateral trading platforms and internalisation systems that compete with current stock market participants.
In addition, the Law obliges investors to market information on their aspects, risk-taking and risk-management methods, as well as the CNMV monitoring should be facilitated, registering all operations carried out.
The Congress Economic Committee has introduced a number of amendments, and it is of particular importance that the securitised debts are treated as a "complex" fund, namely because of the high risk for the investor. This is confirmed in the case of high-risk mortgage credits in the United States (subprime).
On the other hand, the transposition of the directive was also used to legitimate the scope of the activity of those with economic and business qualifications, and 30 years after the Royal Regulation setting out the professional functions that can only be carried out by economists entered into force in 1977.
Senate suggested that new actors be created in the financial sector, such as the intermediary agent who is working for another account, do not need CNMV authorisation, and at the same time more investor companies may market products or acquire customers.
Consumer Price Index increased by 0.5 points in November and reached 4.1%.
This indicator, which Eurostat takes into account in calculating the inflation rate of the European Union, shows the trend in prices in Spain for the month of November.
Its disclosure corresponds to Eurostat and the European Central Bank's strategy to provide data that can be compared with data from the United States, both in terms of the time and nature of their creation.
For the preliminary index, the calculation method is the same as for the calculation of the Harmonised Price Index, but the statistical modelling method differs from that for assessing information that are not available at the time of disclosure.
The Statistical Office underlined that the preliminary indicator is merely indicative and may therefore differ from the final data that will be made public on 14 December.
"The Consumer Price Index continues to show relatively high values."
Pedro Solbes, one of the vice-presidents of the Government and the Minister for Economic Affairs, stated that the increase in Consumer Price Index to 4.1% in November was only "timely-like", but at the same time indicated that the price index is expected to show a "approximately high" value in the coming months.
In Parliament's corridors, Solbes confirmed that "even though the figure is not very positive", the inflation rate in Spain within the monetary union remained more or less at the same level in recent years.
He added that the November month was "a less surprise" than the previous month when the government did not count on such a big growth.
The Minister for Economic Affairs acknowledged the value of around 4% of the data published today.
Through Northern Rock, he wants to reach EUR 42 billion in the Virgin in three years.
The deposits of Northern Rock have fallen by more than 50% and currently only GBP 12 billion (EUR 16 billion 800 million) since the crisis and urgent credit from the Hungarian National Bank in mid-September.
He then had a record deposit of more than 25 billion pounds, which gradually decreased over the last two and a half months due to the loss of clients' trust, despite the fact that the government promised the bank a hundred percent guarantees to the end of the crisis.
Virgin will operate this unit under his own financial, commercial name, Virgin Money. Virgin will have to obtain about a quarter of the British banks' revenues for the next three years to obtain the remaining Pounds of 18 billion and thus reach the 30 billion target.
In England, a large-professional businessman Richard Branson’s group of commercial campaigns has become known to spend about EUR 50 million (i.e. EUR 70 million) annually on advertising and marketing in order to achieve the target.
The Northern Rock has brought up the offer of the Virgin Consortium this week as best to avoid the bankruptcy.
Mayor Totana was arrested for a suspected corruption case
The Police arrested the Mayor of Totana (National Party) in the Province of Murcia this morning, as it is suspected that he was involved in the city corruption scandal that had elapsed this week.
Other than that, one of the secretaries of the City Hall and the local police chiefs were arrested.
In May, the former member of the city council took over the place of the People's Party representative Juan Morales, who, according to the official bodies asked by the SER radio channel, could be the head of the corruption network.
The police are further investigating the city's offices and the City Development Council, and it cannot be ruled out that further arrests are expected.
Juan Morales' attorney was also subjected to investigation as the major suspect of the corruption scandal this week.
According to SER's radio information, Juan Morales of the People's Party was arrested when he just left Morales in his bag with evidence of corruption.
According to police sources, the investigation is the presumed bonus that Morales received in exchange for signing a city development agreement with a Galician construction company to reclassify 200 hectares of land.
Right now, eight people are under arrest.
Bono accepts the appointment of the PSOE in Toledo and his President-in-Office of Parliament if they win the elections.
Former Minister of Defence, José Bono has accepted the offer of Mr José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero to lead the PSOE to the Toledo list in the next parliamentary elections and to fill Parliament's Presidential Officer if the Socialists win the elections.
This was announced by PSOE's secretary, José Blanci, at a press conference, and Bono himself confirmed the party's federal centre this afternoon after the meeting with Zapatero.
The governor justified his election to the former minister that "we have to count with the best" in politics, and Bono is "the best amongst the best."
In addition, he added that "probably" Manchai will be the candidate of the Socialist Party to Parliament's Presidential Officer if socialists win in the forthcoming elections.
Bono would take over the current position of President Manuel Marín, who announced on 15 November that he had no intention of taking up the next elections and giving up his political career, instead of fighting in scientific circles against climate change.
The former minister acknowledged that the Governing Director was constantly struggling to return to the political stage since two years ago, he abandoned active politics.
He also added that, since the electorates are aware of who will be the Vice-President in the event of the victory of socialists, the party would also have wanted to inform them of who will be the President of Parliament.
If Bono is actually going to perform the post, he would like Parliament to be "the stadium of respect and not of insultation or screaming" and to be more like the home of citizens.
"Sometimes, unfortunately, Parliament seems to be the only place in Madrid, where it cannot be quietly spoken, has already been interrupted 26 times in Senate's speech."
At the same time, he called the current President Manuel Marín, his "good job", but he did not want to mention himself as President, so that his opponents did not consider it "required".
Campaign for the Climate
Since the movement that promotes climate change is mercilessly persecuting both those who are skeptic against their forecasts, both those who favour political or social battles must be very strong.
In fact, he has to set himself up a political leader such as Governor Zapatero, who believes that the movement is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism, and declares that "we have to conclude a new agreement with our Earth".
However, this comment raises the question of the extent to which its government's activity or inactivity contributed to the failure of Spain to comply with the Kyoto Convention within the Union.
Who are responsible for the non-compliance of the Convention, which sector is affected and why did the Government not seek to avoid it?
Moreover, it should also be clear to explain to Spain what measures it intends to take to prevent climate change.
What companies will be affected by these measures, what habits of the population must be changed, what individual and social energy savings should we expect and what economic consequences will this have?
So who must sacrifice and who must pay to save our Earth?
But we didn't get it and we won't get an explanation for these questions.
It's because it's about sacrifice and money.
Climate change has taken measures, actual measures are always unpopular.
They are costly, uncomfortable and cost-effective for both companies and the public.
Even the increase in PSOE's gas prices would have been so unpopular before the elections that Zapatero quickly withdrawd.
That is, we need to save the Earth with nothing, mere propaganda texts, empty passwords free of actual consequences.
Conventions, committees, protocols, new duties.
The Earth agreement, as the Prime Minister says, who speaks so handsomely in the election campaign, does not demand, does not attack, or even builds election meetings and revives tenderness in us.
You know what I'm saying?
They arrested Mayor Totana and chief of police for a suspected corruption case
The Police Office arrested the Mayor of Totana, the Mayor of the Province of Murca, José Martínez Andreot, the local police chief, the Secretary-General of the City Hall, and a catering business operator for crimes related to urban development, were informed today by police resources.
The mayor was arrested in his home, then transferred to the City Hall, and currently resides with several police officers, many of whom are investigating the City Development Council and the Municipal Authority responsible for the management of the Industrial Facilities and Residents.
The three arrests were preceded last Monday in Galician, Madrid and Murcia for six persons in a case where two hectares of agricultural land were classified as an integral area to allow the Galician Nuaria company to build 4000 apartments after payment of unlawful remuneration to the leaders during their previous mandate.
Two other persons have not yet been arrested, but they are under investigation according to the information provided by the Court of Justice of Totana.
The first six arrested persons were handed over to the court.
According to official sources, former mayor of Totana, Juan Morales, who today is also under investigation by the independent parliamentary representative of the People's Party.
The former wife, who owns a real estate agency registered in Totana, is also examined as well as the former mayor's current friend who lives in Murcia's province center.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, Manuel N.A lawyer and entrepreneur were arrested in Nigren (Pontevedra), along with the director of the Suelo de Inmonuar company, Pablo José M.G., the latter company also belongs to the Nuaria Group and has managed the bribes.
The investigation shall be carried out by a group of criminal offences committed at the level of municipality of the Police Operational Unit, members of which were not subject to arrests, in particular in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
Totana was arrested by one person: the owner of a company in the area of well-known poultry products, who could have played a mediator role in the case.
The Nuaria Group would have created the largest residential park in the city of Totana, where 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two wellness hotels were built.
The company acquired an area of 2.2 million square meters in Totana, which was reclassified. The project would have doubled the population of the currently 25 000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group includes companies such as Autesa Inomonuar, Vigo, Conycase, Conycase, specialised in direct marketing, the sale, promotion and installation of buildings in Coruna, Venezuela streets and the catalogue Ferdinánd Square.
Things that happen

If they agree, we'll put a little away the Month's Book and see if we can acquire some philosophical knowledge and wisdom.
I've already set up one.
People, life is a constant change.
Of course, everyone can figure something out.

Our Finnish reporter found this comment in one of the largest Finnish newspapers: (probably in the edge of the world's report on the level of culture), in Helsinki, saying what appeared at the same time on 18 November with the criticism of Blackburn's book.
"Philosophical teachings were brought before the public after the tragedy of the Jokela high school.
He quoted the writings of Platon and Nietzsche in the texts of the murderer, a student before the graduate.
Educational Councilman Pekka Elo, responsible for teaching philosophy, demanded on the Helsingin sanomamat’s website that teachers look critically at Platón’s teachings and added that Nietzsche’s knowledge is not necessarily important at the compulsory basic philosophy of high schools.”

One of his colleagues informs us that the Code of Crime includes a criminal offence about Internet downloads:
A. Downloading a song is a mistake and punishable from six months to one year.
However, if you steal a plate of less than 400 euros in a store, it is just an infringement (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal 1000 euros in a shop, theft is already a mistake, but the punishment still does not reach the level of punishment to be imposed in the case of online downloads (Article 234).
C. If you steal a car, but take it back in 40 hours, the punishment still does not reach the level of punishment for downloading the Internet (Article 244.1).
D. You can count on a smaller punishment if you get involved in a fight than coping CDs.
If you are involved in a mass fight, you can receive a three-month penalty for one year (Article 154 of the BTK), while the CD is copied six-monthly for two years.
(Article 270 TSI).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the BTK, sexual harassment at work is not as severe as downloading a DVD film.
F. The marketing of copyright-protected films without the consent of authors is more punishable than the sale of pornographic materials to minors (Article 186).
If my colleague's right, someone's really slipped out of hand.
For example, consider this box as an integral part of the project.
My doctor gave me an article on strange research in the following title: "The money causes brain activity, especially if the others have less of it."
Which means the feelings of the workers on the pay day depend on how much the others received.
The experiment was conducted at the University of Bonni, measuring magnetic resonances tomographs, and the results were published in the last time of Science.
The author of the study and the director of the Neurokognition Group in Germany, Bernd Weber, said: "The strongest activity was measured when the participant correctly responded, the partner mistaked."
Researchers found that if both of them were given the right answer and received the same amount of money, brain activity was moderate, but if one of them had doubled, activity was enhanced.
I have no idea why such a great science needed to be such a simple conclusion.
Chief Prosecutor of the Balkans
For eight years, Carla del Ponte has been mercilessly persecuted by the Prosecutor's Office of the Prosecutor of the Crime in Haga and the former Yugoslavia.
His mandate ends at the end of the year and Carla leaves with a bitter taste of mouth, as the responsible of the Srebrenica bleeding, in which 8000 Bosnian Muslims were slaughtered, i.e. General Ratko Mladic and the Serbian Bosnian leader Radován Karadzsics are still free.
Their names are listed on the list selected by Swedish director Marcel Schüpbach to his documentary: Carla's list (in 2006, Spain). Like the real crime, the film follows the work of the Swiss Attorney General from Belgrade to New York, trying to pressure the governments concerned to press around the refugees.
What kind of insurance is it for me?
Vehicle insurance, which represents safety for the car owners to bring significant damages and also depends on several factors such as age, gender, date of acquisition of the licence, family status, type of car to be provided and the nature of use.
Getting the car is only the first step.
In fact, choosing the right insurance is often more difficult than deciding what kind of car we want.
First of all, we need to be aware of what this is about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insurance undertaking.
This Agreement is a body in the form of an insurance contract, which states that the insurance company takes the compensation in the head of the fixed insurance fee in the event of the damage.
The insurance fee is practically the amount paid for insurance, which is determined by taking into account different factors, such as the age, gender, the date of the acquisition of the licence, the family condition, the type of car to be provided, its use and others.
Insurers shall determine the insurance premium on the basis of statistics, i.e. a higher amount of insurance which represents a higher risk of accidents.
That is why women over 25 years of age or less pay because statistics show that they represent a lower risk because they are more cautious.
Similarly, according to the findings, insurance companies concluded that married people also cause less accidents than lonely people.
For the type of use of the car, the frequency is the final.
The possibility of accidents increases more frequently than use.
In determining the insurance fee, insurance undertakings take into account a number of factors.
Therefore, the owner should be careful to look into the most appropriate form of insurance for its profile.
The following are the most important factors in the election, so that the price to be adapted and acceptable to the needs of the guaranteed is best developed.
At the time of the conclusion of the insurance contract, the under-25 people should have a number of disadvantages, such as the lack of driving experience and the update of the licence.
Although it is most ideal if we are guaranteed against all the dangers, there are also more economic solutions.
The more precautionary leaders can bind a full insurance with self-determined insurance, guaranteed against all dangers, and the price will also be affordable.
In such a type of contract, the insured person pays part of the damage.
"The amount of own contribution to be paid by the insured depends on the premium; the higher the fee, the lower the self-party" says the head of First Europe of the online insurance intermediary in Spain, Luis Noguera.
Another option is the increased liability insurance for third parties when the client provides for damage to others, but not the damage caused by his own car.
Besides, you will be secured against stealing, fire damage, and the loss of the car.
It's a good advice.
If you are not 25 years old, be careful and preferably avoid accidents because this affects the bonus and thus reduce the amounts to be paid in the future.
It is called bonus for the benefits granted by the insurance company in relation to the basic tariff.
And as far as the basic tariff is concerned, the punishment has been eliminated is called malus.
"The bonus and malfunction depends on the insurance company and its profits.
If the company's been a good year, you can afford to increase the bonus" explains Nogue.
Once the 25-year-old age has already been exceeded, it is easier for owners to provide adequate insurance as the risk of accidents is reduced due to the experience gained over the years.
Then we advise you to make full insurance with you.
"In general, young people are not able to apply their experience properly during an accident and even at the time of driving," claims the Spanish director of the European insurance company, adding that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of driving, when the leaders have already crossed the fears of the beginners.
If the insured is already married, but not yet having children, it is best to make full insurance, of course, if your financial opportunities allow it.
Insurance companies hold couples with children to the lowest risk customers, so the fee to be paid is lower in their case.
In this case, the best is the full insurance by means of (this could reach EUR 300), or if you have a higher bonus, the insurance can also be extended from the third year of the vehicle to the damage caused to others.
"They will drive more calmly, but they will have greater customer power and allow themselves to be higher in their own part", confirms Luis Nogue.
In the case of pensioners, the full insurance is offered with self-deposit (which is around 150 euros) or can also be extended to liability insurance in case of higher bonuses.
Vehicle insurance is very important, not only because it represents protection to the owner in the event of damages, but also because it is a major cost, so it is essential that we choose properly the customised form of insurance.
Celtic wants to get a point in Milan to get into the eighth grader.
Milan and Celtic measure their power on Tuesday at the San Siro stadium to get the missing point at the closing of the Championship of the Championships, and the Italians may be first, and the Scots can qualify themselves.
The Italians have a total of ten points, and they have already secured progress in the fifth round with an insolvency fight with Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but one more needs to be the six-point Shakhtar, who will fight the four-point Benfica.
Two games of the D group will be held one week before the end of the sixth round, as Milan has to play in Japan at the Club World Cup, where on 13th, he is trying to fight the progress of the 16th final.
This group D will end sooner than the rest, while Giuseppe Meazza stadium's most likely outcome will be inconclusive, the two teams will end up trying to win, since the Italians do not want to miss home and the Celtic will start from a better place in the eight-decision.
Gordon Strachan's team's defeat is enough to qualify himself if the Shakhtar won't, but it can't be sure, because if there's an equilibrium, the Ukrainians will get further, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won the next match (2-0).
The Italians will try to deteriorate the night of Scots, who want to go into the eight-decision of the reorganised Champions League, after they got out of the previous year with a goal from Kaka in the 0-0 post-continuation extension (1-0).
The winner of "Rossonerik" would be most welcomed by Shakhtar, because if the Celtic goes into the eighth decision and stays in the UEFA.
Since the Benfica, despite the fact that he is currently in the last place and is unable to remain in the European championship, he can still gain the third place with a victory that he could play in the UEFA.
20,000 people went to Vancouver to attend the first concert of Spice Girls tour.
Spice Girls in Vancouver (Kanada) started his tour, and they were performing in front of 20,000 viewers for the first time since they were dispersed in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) were reported a few minutes before the concert organised in Vancouveri GM Place.
Approximately 20,000 people exchanged tickets to be present at the concert, where they also presented a video film about the history of the community that had been created in the 1990s.
At the same time as the joint reconciliation and the tour, the EMI has placed a new album on the market in Spain, in which the major hits and two new songs include "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
The five Spice Girls members of the "Posh Spice" husband, British football player David Beckham's bracelet.
The athlete was also on the viewer of the GM Place, although Victoria banned him a few days earlier.
When the show was beaten up, Victoria Beckham said the British football star didn't see our performance dresses yet, so I'm nervous about what he's gonna think about the show.
'Sporty Spice', there was a reason that the joint was dispersed two years after leaving the band in 1998 'cause the members didn't understand each other. He also seemed nervous at the press conference, which was held two hours before the concert.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw people's feelings for Spice Girls changed.
I thought why not? Now I'm glad I decided so," said Chisholm about the band that was dissolved nine years earlier.
The singer added that in time, " things were settled and we love each other very much."
But many things have changed since Spice Girls last acted in 1998.
According to the CTV television information, the joint arrived at Vancouver on Virgin Airlines' special aircraft.
At the airport, a bunch of baby-sitters waited for them.
They have a total of seven children.
After the Vancouveri concert, the team will perform in California (USA) and then in San José (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7)
They'll be performing in Madrid on 23 December.
Another fear of the Russian-Ukraine gas debate
The gas price deal has been renewed between Ukraine and Russia, which may also affect Russian fuel to be transported to Western Europe.
Most of the Russian gas exported to the European Union (EU) is transferred through Ukraine, and the disputes between the two nations are always being taken into consideration.
Kiev stated that if Moscow raises the price of gas to be paid by the Ukrainians, they will also suffer from higher costs of transit.
As a result of a previous debate between the two countries last year, the supply to EU countries decreased.
The recent debate between Kiev and Moscow is the Ukrainian Government and the Russian state-owned natural gas monopoly, the Gazprom's agreement attempt to pay the price of gas to Russia in 2008.
Gazprom stated that for gas produced from the neighbouring Turkmenistan, it should carry out a 50% increase compared to the price agreement with Ukraine for 2008.
According to analysts, this could mean an increase in the price of 40% of the shipment from Gazprom for Ukraine.
"It is important that we argue in accordance with one of the most important gas suppliers' transit state during the negotiations," said Anatolij Kinah Ukrainian Minister of Economic Affairs to the Reuters news agency.
"The changes in gas prices should certainly be linked to our debate on the cost of transit (and Western Europe) in Ukraine."
As a result of the recent significant gas price exchange between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom closed the gas trap to Ukraine in January 2006.
This resulted in a dominant decline in exports to Western Europe, which also greatly pushed prices.
A quarter of the EU's gas supply is produced by Russian gas.
Russia has the largest natural gas reserves in the world, but most of them are still undiscovered.
As a result, Gazprom will complement its own gas supply from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet countries in Central Asia.
NHS "need to check foreign workers"
The Skót NHS Committees should improve the monitoring of criminal records of workers outside Europe - an supervisory body has stated.
The proposal consisted of Robert Black's main figurer after a foreign citizenship doctor in Scotland was linked to the attack on the Glasgow airport in June.
It also expressed concern that NHS Scotland does not have accurate data on the number of overseas employees.
At the same time, the report, through the sample of five health authorities, pointed out key controls that have been properly carried out.
Following the attack on the Glasgow airport, the main counter has checked the list of staff recruited outside the European Economic Area.
The 28-year-old doctor of the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, Bilal Abdullah, was arrested at the airport after a jeep led to the main terminal of the building.
Abdullah was one of the three doctors who were interviewed by the Old Bailey court in October by accusing automobile bombing attempts in the United Kingdom.
The Committees of the NHS shall, in the case of their employees from overseas countries, check the existence of the skills and experience of the workers concerned before starting employment and the provision of authorisations for employment in the United Kingdom.
Although the SWCs apply Disclosure Scotland to verify the criminal records, the Agency is not entitled to obtain such information from outside the territory of Great Britain.
The accountant's report has, inter alia, proposed that committees introduce the Code of Criminal Register Office guide, which facilitates the monitoring process with the various overseas countries for the employer.
"Although we have found evidence of such checks among the records of staff, they are not regularly carried out", says the report.
According to Black, the Scottish NHS fulfils its own pre-employment review procedure at a high level, adding: "Our report highlights the areas to be developed to provide up-to-date information on the number of NHS overseas staff."
Dr. Peter Terry, President of BMA Scotland, says that it's "specially unacceptable" to identify potential NHS staff with pre-employment checks that could be used to perform terrorist acts in the future.
"The report states that the pre-employment checks currently applied are working well in the NHS Scotland and that the value of the proposals is still not transparent."
According to the Skotla’s health authorities, the majority of their overseas employees account for 1161 people.
However, the main counter pointed out that the figures are likely to be higher, which is partly explained by the fact that the identification of unfinished workers is a problem for committees.
The investigation also showed that the control procedures introduced in the Ayrshire and Arran region, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and the NHS authorities in Lothian are highly coordinated.
These procedures covered the verification of passports, employment permits and certificates of qualification.
The Scottish Government is currently examining the directive and guidance on pre-employment checks on employees from the NHS overseas countries.
Nicola Sturgeon’s health secretary said: "I am delighted that this task was carried out after the attack on the Glasgow airport.
He added that, in cooperation with the Health Committees, the Scottish Government will take into account the proposals contained in the report and will ensure that the up-to-date guidelines on pre-employment checks on the entire staff fund, including those from overseas, reflect the best practical application.

In Saudi Arabia, 208 people were arrested for terrorist conspiracy
Saudi Arabia published yesterday that 208 militia involving terrorist cells was arrested, designed to implement an attack on an oil facility and several attacks on churches and security forces.
According to the state television of the world's largest oil exporter, one of the cells wanted to smuggle missiles.
The supporters of Al-Qaida have launched a battle against monarchy, which has acted as an ally of the United States since the Iraqi invasion in 2003.
According to the television report, an eight-person cell led by a resident of foreign nationality is planned to launch an attack on an oil facility in the Eastern province.
Following an attack attempt organised by Al-Qaida in 2006 against the largest oil-processing device in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia has started to develop a rapid-responsive force of 35 000 people in order to protect the facilities.
According to the report quoted by the Minister for Interior, 18 of the arrested are included in a cell leading to an unlawfully crossing of the country's border, "a person specialized in the blasts".
The report also reported that warriors were trying to smuggle eight bullets into the kingdom.
22 of these arrested were designed to commit attacks against church leaders and security forces.
The government called for a more rigorous action by the church leaders to control the Saudis who join Al-Qaida fighters in Iraq, who fight against the federal forces and the skimmed Muslim government with American support.
The Al-Qaida fighters consider a significant part of the Saudi Arabia church leaders to be involved by the authorities in the support of the royal family policy of the government.
The fighters of the organization - inspiring the attack on foreign-residents, government buildings and energy installations of Al-Qaida's birth manager, Osama bin Laden, the West Friendly Saudi Government.
"The security forces have made enormous efforts in the last five months," said a Minister of Home Affairs spokesman to the public television.
During the arrests in Medina, a 16-person media cell was caught, with the aim of spreading "taxial thinking". Taxi thinking is the ideology of the sunite Muslim radicals, which supports violence against unfaithful and unfaithful Muslims.
Among the arrested were also 32 persons accused of financial support for militants.
The Venus climate can provide an overview of the earth’s future
According to the scientists yesterday, Venus once provided pleasant living conditions.
The data of a European circulating spaceship indicate that this planet is much more considered to be the earth’s delicate twin brother than we thought before.
Venus is the nearest planetary word on Earth.
In view of the size of the two planets, they are almost the same and their circular tracks are similar, although Venus is a little closer to the sun.
The scientists today know that many billions of years ago, Venus had a very similar living conditions and could have been given to the living conditions.
However, due to the emerging high carbon dioxide-glass effect, the atmospheric erosion caused by sun radiation and the lower speed of the planet in turn, Venus has entered a different path of development.
Today, water, surface temperature is hot enough to dilute lead, and hurricane winds and lightning storms are destroyed.
The findings of the Venus Express Space Zone of the European Space Agency, based on the study of the planet for one year, paint an incredible picture of how similar catastrophic climate changes can develop on Earth.
Fred Taylor, professor of the Physics Department at the University of Oxford, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "Putting out why the climate of Venus differs so much from the world, even though the two planets have similar structures.
"Our new data enabled us to develop a scenario of the development of Venus before billions of years, when he had a living conditions similar to Earth.
The police booked uranium.
A kilo of radioactive material - uranium enriched according to reports - was booked yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
According to a police speaker, three people were arrested and the material was also examined.
The speaker did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but stated that the material could have been sold for a million dollars (480 000 pounds).
Open Gates
Mitt Romney thinks it's unworthy for a presidential election candidate to answer questions from a snowman.
However, the Republican candidates of the Presidential election agreed to take part in a debate on YouTube, where the ordinary voters put their questions on video and forwarded them to the candidates.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday night 28 November proved as ridiculous as the snowman who asked democrats about global warming in the debate on the other party on YouTube.
However, questions and answers this time reflected the situation of the Republican Party coming to the next year's election.
For the time being, it is not known that CNN leaders co-financed the dispute were selected on the basis of which the YouTube clips submitted to the candidates were selected.
The longest issue in the first half of the debate was the issue of immigration.
This is one of the Republicans' veins.
CNN called on some unsure voters that, if something goes wrong with them, please choose a number: the intermediary experienced an outstanding agreement when the candidates spoke hardly about the question of borders.
The most vivid and longest debate was held between Rudy Giuliani at national level and Romney, who had a major role in the final elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to change the image of him that he handled the issue of illegal immigration too easily during the Mayor of New York.
He accused Romney of hiring illegal immigrants from the former Governor of massachusetts to build his house.
The vocabulary between them became particularly intense when the questioners were interested in the support of "amnesty" (which would provide illegal immigrants with a permanent status and the possibility of citizenship).
Some of the candidates with less votes, such as those from California and Tom Tancredo, have been thoroughly involved in the subject.
And although none of them are considered to be potential for the marking, their stay on the competition field may be explained by the fact that the bells of immigration began to be held before and louder than others.
At least on the issue of immigration, there is broad agreement between the candidates: the common aim is to strengthen borders and tough action against illegal immigrants.
This topic - as well as fear of Chinese poisonous games and other worrying factors from the outside world - will help the Republicans to forget or minimize divide between Libertarians and Christian conservatives.
However, when topics of different kinds were raised, the debate was very unpleasant.
Giuliani had to face the question of why he supported arms control earlier.
John McCain and Romney argued about the fact that the simulated watershed is considered torture.
Another questioner was wondering if the candidates believe all the words of the Bible.
In this matter, Giuliani finally struggled at the point of view that even though he viewed the Bible as his favorite book, the story of Jonah and the whale might not be literally interpreted.
Another question was whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee, who has won the first place of the Iowa election, was responding to the expectations that the death penalty was painful, but it is necessary.
When they asked whether Jesus would receive sufficient support, laughing at the fact that Jesus was wiser than going to the elections.
The competition continues to open unusually.
Huckabee's intensive revelation in iowa coincides with the libertarian Ron Paul's money collector action and his enthusiasm in Wednesday's debate.
The sudden occurrence of the two candidates can be explained by the fact that two wings of the party have not yet been able to launch a common candidate from one of the more familiar and traditional aspirans.
In 1980 and 2000 there was a candidate who united the party, who timely and convincingly strangled the winning message of America's greatness, and who found the joint voice with both wings of the party.
But now the party has been divided, and the consequences are so far incomprehensible.
Pains of the Labour Party
Another break before Gordon Brown; the way out is unchanged
Compared to the British political scandals, this doesn't seem too clever.
No one sold his honor, no politicians were exposed to their hotel bills in Paris, no one committed a scandal outside of marriage.
However, the discovery that a rich businessman under the names of others for more than four years contributed to the Labour Party of Great Britain with an amount of £650 000 (1.3 million) above that amount, and that this party did not report, one of the things that the surrounded Gordon Brown would have done well without.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister escaped the election, and when it said that public opinion research did not affect the outcome of the decision, the British intellectual ability was questioned unreasonably, people still hoped that Brown would ensure a strong and effective governance.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, remarked with increasingly spiritous remarks, was converted from feared Brown Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The failure to save a bank called Northern Rock put the regulatory weaknesses and the deficiencies of judgment into a crossfigure.
The patient proposals to change the tax law have encouraged business interests groups to join the government.
The loss of tax authorities of 25 million people's personal data has revealed an incredibly high level of administrative inconvenience.
In the House of Lords, three peaceful generals protested against reducing the budget of the army, claiming that the position of the Minister of Defense is part-time occupation.
And now here are David Abrahams' mysterious donations; Peter Watt, the chief secretary of the Works Party (formerly the administrative leader), has already resigned.
These accidents don't mean Brown can't turn back on the way out.
At the same time, governments can reach the point after which governance is impossible.
People don't like politicians and they don't trust them, but when a new group is powered, they usually suspend their infidelity.
However, as it becomes clear that the Prime Minister is unlikely to be able to take things forward and perhaps not stay in the post for a long time, the suspended infidelity is over: the civil servants' arm is beginning to leak, the office ministers will be in directing, and the press will look after bad news; and the government will start to focus on defence and will not be able to focus.
In a certain way, Brown is in a particularly difficult situation, since, unlike other political leaders, he does not count as "fresh blood".
As much as you wish to deny your relationship with Tony Blair, he had his right hand.
The problems around Northern Rock and the tax authorities records, for example, are linked to decisions made during the time of Brown's Minister for Finance.
And although the long-term investigation of the relationship between the Blair-type mismatch, such as the "financial nobility" case and the political party-financed relationship, did not directly take part, voters may have the right to assume the opposite.
Although Brown's situation is unpleasant, it's not as embarrassing as it looks.
The spoils committed are not as scary as those indicated by the cakes.
As with Mr. Bean, no one died, no one was taken directly.
The compensation can be the creation of the directions that have always been promised by Stalin, who lives in Brown, even as much pain as it is: reliable, firm and slightly hard-handed governance.
Good, for example, serves the cool snow around political donation.
Abrahams, who is shrimply concealed, who compares his donations to charity, said that he did not want to reveal his charity to the public.
Perhaps it is, but it was not his responsibility to make a decision.
The law prohibiting the anonimity of major political supporters can be clearly and clearly justified: the public has the right to know who knocks on the gates of the country's leaders.
Watt, who, according to his own statement, knew of Abrahams' action, was not aware of its illegal nature, will certainly be inspired by the interviews; as did Jon Medleson, the Foundation Manager of the Works Party, who was informed in October of the troubled donations.
However, to Brown, for the time being, there are no threads: there is no indication that he knew about these rolls, not even that the payment of the huge amounts was made after the office of Brown in June.
Until now, the Prime Minister has completed half of his duties.
However, the violation by his party was soon condemned, but the firmness was diminished by the fact that he was touched with a familiar device; for the sake of the case, he commissioned a committee with the leadership of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this story, the lesson to learn is not too complicated.
In the event of a breach, the police shall be responsible.
In addition, Brown needs to take care of other things, such as the appointment of the chairman of the independent committee on administrative rules which have not been chaired for six months or the effective reform of political party funding.
This would require the hardfishing Party to cooperate with the Turks and to break up with special financial relations with the associations - that would be a hard wall for the coupled Brown.
But you should face some of the facts about the party.
According to the surveys, the conservatives currently have a major advantage; Brown has had two years to take the voters back behind him; the only way to mobilise the victory is impeccable integrity and strong competencies.
Card sharks
Is the second mortgage market crisis threatened by America's credit card market?
If blood comes into the water, it's natural that sharks appear nearby.
Now that the American housing market is weakening, predators focus on the country's credit card market.
The analysts of Goldman Sachs believe that if the mortgage crisis infects other forms of public credit, the loss of the credit card market could reach $99 billion.
The signs of tension are clearly visible.
An increase in the deduction rate of both incumbent credit rates and the non-discriminatory rate of late payments over 30 days.
HSBC reported a loss of $1.4 billion last month in the US Consumption Financing Sector, partly due to the financial weakness of card holders.
At the same time, the panic is still early.
The ratio of descriptions and late payments remains low.
The rate of late payment calculated by Moody's credit rating agency for the third quarter is 3.89% below the historical average by a percentage point.
The reduction of the rates is partly explained by technical factors.
The amendment of the American rules on individual insolvency in 2005 resulted in a sudden reduction in the number of non-payments declarants, while at the same time causing a large loss on the market of credit cards; the increase in the number of banknotes (and this descriptive rate) is expected, irrespective of whether the total conditions for borrowing are deteriorating or not.
The rate of payment, which shows the proportion of monthly credit redemption of consumers, is also firm on the market.
In addition, trust in securities covered by credit cards is rather strong despite paralysis in other areas of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney, the TowerGroup research company, estimates that the 2007 emission volume will be 25% higher than last year.
The signs of the impact of the mortgage crisis on the credit card market are clear: consumers increase debt on credit cards to borrow housing loans.
However, card issuers mainly monitor cash flows and not the asset value, so the fall in housing prices does not necessarily lead to a change in creditworthiness of creditors.
The emergence of the situation may be advantageous for creditors.
If the property is less than the mortgage loan, the incentive for consumers to redeem credit; as a result, the repayment of debts on credit cards will be progressive in the priority order.
By changing interest rates or credit limits, card issuers can adapt faster and more flexiblely to changing conditions than mortgage creditors.
Theoretically, this should reduce the risk of sudden re-flows of assets.
"We are not likely to wake up one day to fully reassess the loans" says Gary Perlin, the financial leader of Capital One.
If a surgeon crisis of subprime is less likely in the credit card market, the risk of gradual recession is much more.
If the decline in housing market prices and the decline in lending leads America to a recession, the industry faces a serious future without any doubt.
It's worth watching those predators.
British bankers confessed to being guilty of Enron's case
On Wednesday, the three British bankers who were brought before the court to investigate their role in the fraud of the former financial director of Enron, Andrew Faston.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew initially declared themselves innocent in the charge of a weekly fraud, allegedly co-operating with Fastow in a secret fraud in 2000 with which they wanted to be rich at the cost of their employer.
Their trial began in January.
But at a court hearing, before Ewing Werlein Jr., the U.S. district judge acknowledged his contemporary deception.
The three former employees of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group, Greenwich NatWest, have become known during the two-year release process in Great Britain.
Closing the investigation of the case initiated following the collapse of Enron in 2001 in the United States is still waiting for you.
The first prosecution against them warned Fastow in 2002 that he was one of the targets of the government investigation initiated to discover Enron's bankruptcy.
The three brokers crossed the NatWest Triple, accused them of traveling to Houston in 2000 to prepare the fraud together with Michael Kopper, who was Fastow and Fastow's right hand at that time.
Fastow, responsible for planning a number of frauds that confiscated Enron, was also under the control of the subsidiary of Enron, in which Greenwich NatWest invested.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had no knowledge of any of its subsidiaries’ shares, but the three British men well knew that the interest was very large.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the bank's share of $1 million in the subsidiary.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 to get a share in this company.
According to the accusation, Fastow misinformed Enron by buying from Greenwich NatWest a subsidiary of $20 million.
But actually, $20 million was hit by British bankers, Fastow and others.
The prosecution holds the bankers 7,3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others got $1,3 million.
In January 2004 Fastow confessed his birendic guilt as a result of his role in the collapse of Enron.
The three of the British were arrested three months later.
Fastow currently has six years of punishment in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Copper spends three years and a month's punishment in a prison in Texasarkana.
The three English men were able to travel to the United States in the head of a bail of $1 million, where they stay during the trial.
Enron, the seventh largest American company, reported a bankruptcy in December 2001 after the accounting tricks used for years could not cover millions of debt accumulated and reported as profitable, but actually lossy companies.
As a result of the collapse, thousands of jobs have disappeared, market value is more than 60 billion dollars and pension funds have decreased by over $2 billion.
Kenneth Lay, the founder of Enron, and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling, were sentenced last year for their confiscation in the company's bankruptcy.
Skilling is currently in prison for more than 24 years.
Conspiracy, fraud, and other accusations against Lay's death of the man last year have ceased.
No Poverty in Moscow
$54 million starts with a Gulfstream G550 plane equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine, which does the road between Moscow and Los Angeles without interruption, with a tank.
But this amount is only for some Russian rich people as coins.
"18 passengers fit in" said Dan Firer, his representative of Gulfstream.
"No one orders so many seats because the machines are bought for private families or corporate leaders."
Mr. Firer was expecting visitors at the 4-day, exclusive, Milliomos Vására, organized in the huge exhibition halls around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxurious items are rented on the exhibition, hopes that the Russian new farmers are interested in all the fridges that are covered with diamonds up to 50 cents.
Mr. Firer carefully watched the bright orange Porsche on the stand next to him.
"He's a good car, but he doesn't even trace our products," he said.
"After the United States, private aeroplanes have the largest market in Russia."
Looks like the Russian capital swim in the money like Dallas did at the time of the oil price explosion.
"We went through a similar process in the 1890s when some American millionaires went to Europe, and these Americans were considered materialists here." said Marshall Goldman, the senior scholarship of the Davis Centre for Studies at Harvard University of Russia and Europe.
Like the '70s of Saudi Arabia and the Japanese gambling players in the 1990s, the Russians have now become the most spectacular poets in the world.
The most exclusive luxury mackerels demand their share of the golden goat.
At another conference organised by the luxury industry at the Moscow site, the President of Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, LVMH, shared their opinions on how to sell high-value products on similar markets to Russia.
(The conference was organised by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times)
According to Forbes' list of richest people, 53 billion people live in Russia, who have a total of $282 billion.
In addition, the number of Russian millionaires in the second class has reached 103,000, who can have a total of $670 billion, established a study by the economists of the Economic and Financial Research Centre, which analyses personal welfare development in the former Soviet Union.
( According to World Bank data, the number of people below the minimum of life in Russia was 15.8 per cent in 2005.)
"There are hundreds of millions of people living in Moscow, and that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, represented by David Morris' jewelry store in London.
Nicole took part in the fair for the first time with the Russian distributor of the brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are unjustly cared for, and men are a real treasure mine."
Two residential market agents, 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatova and 26-year-old Svetlana Turovtsova, both themselves and their clients were considered millionaires.
"I watched the cars and I'm trying to decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said the young Yumatova, who's incredibly rushed in his unique design dress, as if he's already used to this setup.
The purchase was mainly arranged for new farmers, for the brand-oriented Russian customers who are willing to visit a garnetous, cifra decorated site after hours on the market, where they can find Cadillac Escaleds, platinum pockets, Short Pick ice cream, regular billiard tables, double apartments and Gund plüss bears.
For average people, the entry ticket costs EUR 30 ($44.57).
"The Russians like to know which brands are the most expensive and best", said Mr. Gijrath, who is patriotically occupied on the Dutch porcelain manufacturer's stand, Royal Delft's stand, with a wall-size, hand-decorated blue-coloured Rembrandt imitation.
"The Russians, of course, are more interested in outstanding things."
Indeed, the salesmen here said that the rich Russians, on the basis of the long-term (Russian Sticks, this means 10 to 15 years) have already been decorated from the outsourcing logos to brands in a limited number of brands that would not enter a trade fair.
Yet, thousands of people, including millionaires, millionaires and millionaires, have spent their space every day until they've been smuggled.
And some of them bought it.
On the first day of the show, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, director of the King Koil beds company, sold two, $70,000 each, made of silk, casmir and cotton with golden straw.
Also, on the night of the first day, Mikhail Lyubiumov, A1 Moto's sales staff on the supply of high-quality cars with modern alarms, reported that his company sold the bright orange Porsche for a Russian millionaire for $170,000.
Andrei Karapetian, a luxurious automotive manufacturer providing a solution for specific needs, President of L.A. Connection sold three fridges to Rolls-Royce Phantom on Sunday afternoons. The barrels are compared to connected chain brackets and cost 55 thousand dollars each.
Reporters also showed a wheel for the owner of the Russian casino, which he said was involved with Swarovski crystals to produce a roulette wheel.
A set price of four pieces: $22,000.
"The Russian milliomer who wants wheels made from struct skin and a picture of the face of his wife from a cyrkonium risk will not necessarily use these objects." - said Karapetian.
"He's gonna keep them in the garage in the 30-40 cars."
Despite the fact that many of its Russian customers are rich, Karapetian believes that the term "Russian millionaire" does not present a great deal of advantage, given the rapid increase in property prices there.
"Whoever bought property in Moscow four or five years ago is most likely a millionaire today, if not in money, but at least on paper."
"There's more than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least have made the appearance of wealth before the stand of the Russian property management company at Alliance Continental.
The company built four English-style phone wires that were accumulated with millions of counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, marketing manager of the company, his team printed 500 thousand false banknotes on the Milliomos Buy.
Many of the visitors stopped playing with the money, and many of them made photos of themselves on a mobile phone like they're hanging in the wallet or just putting a few millions on their pockets.
"See, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaires" said Karryev.
Surgical art defects are suspected behind a death in New Jersey.
It was the day before Thanksgiving that Ronald Livingston looked in the flat glass window of a restaurant called a little more Healthy and saw a rescue car stopping Cape Cod two doors down West Scott Avenue.
A police car arrived shortly later.
Then another one.
"Then I saw the doctor's car stop," said Mr. Livingston, one of the inspectors working in the restaurant on Wednesday.
"I knew that someone was dead."
The authorities found out that the dead woman was 41 years old, Olga Arroyo, who used to work as the head assistant of the Newark Police Director.
Currently, the investigation is taking place to determine whether the death was caused by an intervention by a cosmetic surgeon unidentified under West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have so far failed to find out what caused Arroya's death, but they are hoping that the result of the toxicology tests will light this mysterious death, which has suffered great pain from the high ranked workers of the Newark police.
Arroyo, whose voice was known in the department, worked as an assistant since September 2006 with Garry F. McCarthy, the police director.
"Loyal, busy and reliable" he said about McCarthy Arroyo in a Wednesday interview on the phone.
"He was my housekeeper.
He was my protector."
McCarthy told me that Mrs Arroyo was the former police officer in Newark, currently working in the Szesipari Products Control Committee, and two, 14, and a 11-year-old boys and a stepmother left behind.
Eileen Walsh, the prosecutor of Union County, Theodore J. Romankow, said that the detectives were working on finding out whether Mrs Arroyo was the victim of a surgeon without permission.
"The probability is low" said Walsh.
"The test is still underway."
From the authorities' reports, they arrived at the house at 3:00 p.m. in November
On 21th and Mrs Arroyo were found on the couch.
He's already been declared dead at the scene.
More than a week has passed, and for the time being, the police have been very little betrayed of the investigation and the owner of the house, Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't tell me if Castro was heard by the detectives.
Participants in the study are looking into whether part of the house was functional as a medical doctor.
On Wednesday, no one opened a door in Castro's home, where there was a shredded rosebo in the narrow garden, and a song was barking from behind the house.
By the door leading to the basement, in the car entrance, there was a blue container of "Etil Vanilin", which is used to replace vanilla in food and perfume.
From campus to two mountain bikes hanging on the side.
McCarthy recalled when she first arrived in Newark after 25 years at the Newark police, Mrs Arroyo was an invaluable help to help him manage the unusual and unpleasant political culture of the new city.
"He always said, "He's gonna be better off with it!" he remembered.
"He's been here all the time when I arrived in the morning, and he was always in there when I left tonight.
It was embarrassing."
The expectation of Fed's interest reduction leads to the shock of the world's stock markets
The stock prices on both Atlantic coasts jumped yesterday after the reassuring statements by the President of the United States Central Bank increased their hopes that the Fed will try to facilitate investment opportunities with additional interest reductions.
The stock markets have disappeared both in London and New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, who has declared it the right hand of the Fed President Ben Bernanke, must respond to the constantly observable anxiety on the financial markets in a "smart and pragmatic manner".
In addition to the clear objective of Kohn that the signs of the recurring credit crisis were to mitigate the markets, Kohn stated that the present anxiety "reversed the progress achieved in the market at the end of September and October".
He said that if increased confusion continues to exist, it could increase the possibility of further constraints on credit contingencys in households and companies.
The statements were interpreted by investors by the fact that Fed is ready to inject fresh capital into the American markets or even further interest reductions.
The statements were also reassuring to Wall Street, which has recently been reported by many bad news about the American economy, such as the negative record of the number of American housing sales.
In addition, Bear Stearns' investment bank has confirmed the financial disabilities of the investment bank to offset losses in the second-market mortgage sector by 650 employees and 4 per cent of their global labour force as part of the cost reduction.
A total of 20 jobs in London are affected by the abovementioned measure.
In New York, Dow Jones's average industrial index increased by 331 points, 255 percent and closed at 13.289,40 points, while the wider S&P 500 index increased by 2.65 percent.
The London FTSE 100 index increased by 165.5 points, 2.7 per cent, and closed at 6.306.4 and thus increased the value of the British blue-chip companies by more than 39 quid.
The German Dax increased by 2.6 per cent, while the French CAC40 increased by 2.3 per cent.
Credit market agitation was renewed after a high-demand auction organised by the European Central Bank for papers with no three-month maturity since April 2001 at a price of 4.7 per cent.
After the interbank interest rate, Libor reached the highest value seen since September after 12 November, 6,59 per cent, the Bank of England was under greater pressure to follow the Fed and the ECB and to allow additional capital to the money market in London.
In England, the decision is followed between Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
He gave me two dilemma, one of them is more complicated than the other.
Who should the English team have the sixth field in Kandy, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And in an indirect context of the first test against Sri Lanka, it is not less important who will make the decision?
The last question is, on the one hand, because David Graveney, the president of the selectionrs, who temporarily performs this specific task, will help the leader of coach Peter Moores and Captain Michael Vaughan in the decision, and, on the other, because the English Executive Director, Hugh Morris's desk drawer, starts fulfilling the national or at least one of the requests for a selection post.
Of the two players, it draws the shorter, which does not get the sixth bat place, but as known, life, and mostly sport often unjust.
It's never easy to tell you what makes it the top of a person's profession, while others can't even get past a lower level.
It is not only a cricket that it is difficult to choose - many times subjectively.
Did the time come for Bopara to move forward?
Is it fair to Shah if that happens?
The same question can be raised in other areas of life, such as John Edwards and Tubby Banerjee, two smart, well-skilled young leaders who know the business, while only one of them has a place.
Who can tell you which level is a cricket player without throwing into deep water in a more serious race?
Of course, the data have a major impact on the decision, but the options are equally important.
In a team, the player must catch the captain's look at the cricket gate at the right moment, and a batting player must get a chance to become a big player once.
It's a lot more complicated to catch the audience's eyes.
For example, more than James Anderson played better in the last season, he still counts as a sure team member in the first test, despite the fact that Stephen Harmison's own statement is in good shape and that he's doing very well.
Anderson fought with 32-grade gate raids and 33 runs to participate in the tour.
Chris Tremlett only hit 29, but both of them have had a successful moment at the highest level, and they hope they will be like this in the future.
If Shah or Bopara are going to play at Asgiriya Stadium, then they will decide on the basis of the opinions.
This decision may or may break anyone's career, but it may also have no special effect on the future.
Four years ago, Sri Lakán Gareth Batty played every test and did well with five gates and 40 useful runs, yet Paul Collingwood was the one who was the one who was highlighted and determined a cricket, who may still be underestimated even today, despite having received a double hundred points against Australians.
It is likely that, listening to their conservative instincts of Graveney, Vaughan and Moores in Asgiriya Stanion, they will take their voks over Bopara's young life power and dynamics with greater experience.
They're both arguing.
Shah's talking about the bright and successful debutation of the 88-year-old Bopara six-year-old, who was also in excellent twists with 32-year-olds.
However, the fact that the Middlesex player Shah in May, in the Lorda test, runs only ten in two quarters against West India, and that Vaughan, who fought for his immediate resistance to his re-employment in the next game, seems to have reduced the persistence that was clearly seen in Bombay.
Against him, Essex's universal talent is a lifestyle and an insurmountable player.
There's nothing to upset the cricket court, but his behaviour outside the field was well characterized when the team's autosponsor, Volkswagen's four-wheeler at an exhibition.
However, the first thing he did after was to take care of Vodafone's phone (naturally sponsored) and call his distant teammate Alastair Cook to ask him, "Do you see this?"
Bopara is a better player with classics. He creates a handful of drum angles for his enclosed medium steps, and his beats are self-conscious and good.
Choosing the right person is one thing, and another is the right moment.
Maybe this is the real art of the selection.
I'd personally give Bopara the chance now, which doesn't mean that I don't think Shah would be prominent if, as suggested by the tea leaves in Ceilon, he would be the one who plays this weekend.
Buses delivering refugees home to work and fight with Al-Qaida
Since yesterday, the first buses from Syria to Baghdad with those Iraqi refugees who have lost their money or have lost their visas, or, in fact, those who hope to retire in the city.
There are also people who came back to fight with the soldiers who took them out of their house.
The bus station in Mansour was already full of refugees returning from Syria and Jordan before a 800-person bus from Damascus arrived in the government convoy with dozens of buses.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Bagdad," said Dr. Sabah al-Qubaisi sunny.
"Today I returned because I saw what happened in Bagdad on TV and on the newspapers and that the city is now safe.
"The Mahdi Army has stopped killing people," he said, referring to Moqtada al-Sadr militia, who is currently shutting down his skiite army.
The 38-year-old skiite teacher, Qassim al Atwani, who lived mostly in Amariyah, returned home with two children because he failed to renew the Syrian visa and because the regime there prevented Iraqi from working.
Amarija's neighbors called him and called to return, saying with the help of the teams supported by the Americans, they managed to squeeze Al-Qaida out of their stash in the western part of the capital.
One of the first arrivals from Jordan was a sunny and skiith tribe leader who escaped from a granade attack from his home in Sleikh, Sleikh, North Dakota, after he began to encourage his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaida.
He came back to fight.
"Two days ago, my friends called and told me that they created an Al-Qaida militia in Sleikh, and they need to support me and my sons.
That's why I came back today," said the 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many have spoken about the fact that the military civilian forces in the capital have been seducing them home since the American teams joined.
However, more people were forced to return from Damascus because of visa and financial problems.
The 51-year-old, three-child Salaam al-Samarrai voiced a wide range of views among refugees that Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki asked the Syrian Government to reject the application for a visa for refugees to force them to come home.
They believe that more than two and a half million escaped from the death crimes in the country.
"Everything was fine until Al-Maliki has not made a visit to Syria and has no pressure on the government to avoid giving more visas to Iraq to move home," said the sunnite retired.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house after I escaped."
One of the reasons for the relief of violence is that the sunnits were removed from the ski area, while the skies also left the Nunnite lactated areas.
Many fear that the sudden appearance of the refugees will revive the moods, which may lead to new wars.
Kis Saar - Nívó training
The smallest federal region plays a leading role in vocational training, and its higher education has an international orientation.
Only in an area of training, the island rural people struggle with the same deficiencies as the rest of the country.
"I've explained 50 times a day to a non-Saar country that we are not French," this is an independent slot who announces this on his posters on the 50th birthday of the smallest federal province.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play an important role in the education system in the Saar region, which, based on the surveys of the German Economic Institute for Cologne (IW), can praise the fifth place.
In this way, higher education institutions are working closely with neighbouring countries, even because of traditions.
The University of Nearbrücken was founded by the French in 1948.
Students here can complete their studies with a double degree, even a third degree, until today.
Accordingly, there are 15.6% of your foreign students.
However, the high schools and universities of the Saar Region also exerted above average attractions for wanting to study in the region - many of them have no higher education.
"In the Saar region they take advantage of vocational training opportunities," explains Axel Plünnecke, an expert in the German Economic Institute of Education.
More than five of young people get a right to further education at a traineeship school, with more than seven percent higher than the federal average in the Saar region.
The combined options for professional and higher education have also been well developed.
Infrastructure for dual studies is the second place of population within Germany.
Despite practical training and growing interest, however, the number of graduate engineers decreased by a third in recent years.
The Ministry of Education in the Regions therefore committed higher education institutions to a marketing campaign, which focuses on engineering sciences.
"We have initiated a number of reforms in general schools after the first Pisa study", an speaker of the Ministry of Education.
Therefore, the government carried out comparative tests across the country.
To start learning earlier, the last childhood year is free of charge. It is a model that the rest of the federal provinces have started to copy.
To ensure that students' performance is sustainably improved, only future comparative studies will answer.
On the basis of the Pisa survey in 2003, the proportion of pupils affected by the risk ranged from 29 to 20 per cent.
However, the overall performance of the Saar region has not improved to a degree similar to that of the rest of the federal province.
The bajons count better.
The greatest vengeance of the island regions is not taken into account in the Pisa test - otherwise, the foreign language knowledge could be harvested in this area,
because the language of the neighbouring countries is a compulsory subject in high schools - even if the region is not French.
Chávez's changing the hours.
In Venezuela in the near future, the clocks are different from the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez reverses the timetables in the Latin American country half an hour.
Meanwhile, Chávez in Spain became a ridiculous subject.
As Venezuela's official paper said, according to a new law, the watches will be turned back for four and a half hours compared to the greenwichi time.
In this way, the South American state will be a part of a time zone which is not used in any other country in the world.
The United States Anti-Chávez, among other things, justified its decision to force all hour-based time zones into the world.
Furthermore, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) the interruption of relations with the neighbouring Colombia due to a hostage.
The nationalist politician on the left stated that until the conservative Alvaro Uribe remains the President of Colombia, neither the Head of State nor the Colombian Government will be in contact.
"I can't do this because of my own dignity," said Chávez, who calls for a constitutional reform to be put to an opinion within a referendum of the citizens of the oil country on Sunday.
Reform would significantly build its power in the country.
The reason for this debate was Uribe's decision to revoke his mandate from Chávez to negotiate the release of hostages with marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe decided to "arcul cough" Venezuela, gave a voice to his criticism of Chávez on Sunday.
Everyone in Spain is talking about Chávez.
In the country, a new cell phone bell sound came up: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't shut your mouth), - that's what sounds like the sentence more than half a million people spent on the Internet.
The sentence came from King Charles of Spain, John, who was so upset by the constant incisions of the populist politicians in Balolda at the latest Latin America Summit in Spain that he had cut into his word.
In 2007, wage reduction threatens the Germans
A forecast is that this year, despite the strong conjuncture, the German workers are threatened to lose real wages.
Professionals supported their pessimistic forecasts with many reasons.
According to the calculations of the Hans-Bröckler Foundation, employees can actually pay less in 2007 than in the previous year.
"The reason for this modest wage development, the increase in general turnover taxes, and the rapid increase in food and energy prices," said Gustav Horn, member of the Macro-economy and Conjuncture Research Institute.
In terms of unemployment insurance, more burdens can also be imposed on workers.
Minister of Finance, Peer Steinbrück, stated in his statement to the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" newspaper that, at the beginning of the new year, a correct and reasonable reduction of unemployment insurance to 3,3 per cent in the current situation.
In any case, the German Federal Labour Agency should not be put in such a difficult position to apply to the Alliance for credit or support, quoted the German Social Democrat Party, the SPD politician.
On Tuesday it became known that the price explosion of food and mineral oil products resulted in the highest inflation for 13 years.
In the annual comparison, prices increased by 3 per cent.
Venus is the devil twin brother of Earth
Despite the harsh atmosphere of Venus, it's more like Earth than they've assumed to be: In the atmosphere of the European "Venus Express" spacezone lightnings, and in the corners of the corners, there are wind clouds that occur in winters on Earth.
Approximately three decades ago, scientists assume that the Venuson lightens.
The European "Venus Express" spacezone has provided evidence - electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere: The Vénuson lightnings are spread across the wheels of 56 kilometres from cloud to cloud, reports Christpher Russel, a colleague of the University of Los angels of California.
According to the famous "study theory", earthly life was caused by lightnings: According to the theory, the zivatars have triggered reactions in the ocean that led to the development of amino acids, the builders of life.
Not like Venus: "If there ever existed life there, it could be in very early days," explains Sean Solomon from the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Currently, living organisms can hardly exist on the surface of Venus: The atmosphere on the wheels is hundreds more dense than on Earth, and temperature values sometimes reach 500 degrees.
"Venus may be the helly twin brother of Earth, but his twin brother," he nailed Russell.
The main issue of the Esa mission is why Venus, in its mass and size, is moving so similar to Earth on a different development path.
The "Venus Express" started November 2005 was a milestone in the Venus Research, because none of the probes have been on their way since the beginning of the nineties to find this planet.
According to researchers, the latest research results presented in several articles of "Nature" are not merely proof of the uniqueness of the Venus Solar System.
"They also point to the likelihood of the neighbouring planet to Earth greater than we first assumed," said Esa.
Researchers, alongside the already known northern archipelago rotation band, discovered a much faster motion cloud on the southern corner.
The phenomenon reminds of the air flows of the earth's winter hemisphere, states the research group led by Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica Institute.
The second internal planet of the solar system is almost the same as the Earth’s mass and almost the size of the Earth with a diameter of 12.100 kilometres.
The heavenly body called the Estonian Star will be avoided in just 225 days.
However, it turns much slower around its own tent: an older day takes 243 earthly days.
Although the 460 Celsius-focus surface temperature of Venus 92 bar is hardly reminded of Earth, scientists begin from the fact that both planets were in a completely similar situation.
Both of them gathered water, which remained on earth as an ocean, while the Venus went to the universe.
And while carbon dioxide on Earth has been bound in carbohydrates, Venus is a major part of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Mr Köhler, President of the German Republic, demands the conclusion of the debate between the parties that exploded around the office of Chancellor Dalai Lama.
He indirectly criticised the SPD for attacking the Chancellor after the September reception.
The German President, Horst Köhler, is concerned about the authority of Germany, and has called for the Grand Coalition to conclude the debate that was expedient about the reception of Dalai Lama.
"We should not show ourselves as a shared nation in this matter towards the outside world," said Köhler to the Handelsblatt page.
At the same time, Mr Köhler understood that Mr Merkel accepted the Dalai Lama in September.
"I think human rights are universally applicable even if I respect the differences between cultures," Köhler.
Everyone is aware of the need for Germany to look at the external political balance, stressed the President of the Republic; however, Merkel defended against the accusation that the Chancellor would pursue a new China policy.
"The Federal Chancellor did not break up with the traditional "China".
China is aware of this," he nailed Köhler.
Mr Frank-Walter Steinmeier's Minister for Foreign Affairs (SPD) gave an indirect nomination over Dalai Lama's reception and therefore became the target of attacks in the Union's lines.
Steinmeier complained, inter alia, about the EU's "lobby policy" in the field of foreign policy.
Following the reception of Dalai Lama in the Chancellaria, there were severe disturbances in the German-China relationship.
Thus, the Chinese leadership has not only returned the invitation of the German Minister for Finance of Peer Steinbrück (SPD) but also frozen the so-called ‘Strategic Party’ between the SPIEGEL's information.
Wen Jiabao, Chinese Head of State, now called for the acknowledgement of the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel that the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China rejects that if European politicians accept the religious leader of Tibetans in their official quality, wen Jiabao confirmed the Chinese position.
The actions and words of Dalai Lama pointed out that he was trying to break away Tibet and other Tibet areas now.
Schäuble protects from disruptions similar to the French
Street conflicts with the police, shootings, lighting cars: Wolfgang Schäuble protects from disruptions similar to the French.
It is necessary to do everything in order to ensure that social discomfort in Germany does not distort street violence, demands the federal Minister of Home Affairs.
Barricads fired, daters fired with beer rifles on the police: after the serious disruption of young people in France, Wolfgang Schäuble Federal Minister of Interior (CDU) in Germany has come from similar developments.
"We need to say that social explosives do not accumulate at our place and do not fall into violence.
We have to take it seriously," he said to the "Neue Presse" newspaper in Hannover.
Not all young people are adapting to the rapid changes in social reality.
Association, Provinces and communities are currently working intensively in solving problems, said Schäuble.
This is not just about the integration of immigrants.
"from the integration summit to the Islamic Conference, the first success has been shown."
But it's too early to solve the emergency.
At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that there are no urban and social problems in the German precincts, such as France.
In the northern capitals of Paris last night, young people fought serious street fights with the police.
There were cars and public buildings in Toulouse.
In view of this, the federal government, Head of the Turkish Communities of the German Government, required a greater degree of activity in the field of integration.
With regard to the disruptions in France, Kolat warned me about the "risks of reproduction".
Although the situation in Germany is not as delicate as in France,
However, action is necessary.
Kolat pointed out that among young people under 25 years of age from immigrant families, unemployment is "higher than the average".
Before all, more education should be provided.
Kolat emphasised: "We need to provide a peer-relevant for young people."
However, the Head of the Turkish Community added that "in-family social supervision" is more present in Germany than in France.
In addition, many young people from the immigrant family do not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat warns us, "Despite this, we have to be in a hole."
For young people, "the sooner they have the opportunity to have work and to receive education".
Meanwhile, in the precinct of Paris, Villier-le-Bel was restful during the night.
Hundreds of police officers were ready to launch, and a helicopter with a headlight has been pampering the area.
The competent authorities have reported three arrests and some flammable trash and cars.
Since reporting, a 1000-person security unit on wheels will ensure peace.
The police are ready to intervene until Michelle Alliot-Marie has announced his visit to the suburbs.
During the Tuesday night, 80 police officers were injured by the disturbances in the Villiers-le-best.
The next night, the disturbances spread to Toulouse.
The attacks occurred in connection with a traffic accident in which two young people lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the first findings of the Public Prosecutor's office, the police are not responsible for the death of young people.
Cloudman in Angela's Empire
The action of the Chancellor's reality is evidence that the coalition is going to end - and there is no expectation of it.
In fact, in which country does the Federal Chancellor live?
It is necessary to determine after the squirrel and content of the general debate in Bundestag: not here - not in the country whose governance would be his business.
He rejected the accusation with a very high sentence that Angela Merkel would focus too much on foreign policy.
It was provincial, answered, and in such a way it only gave you the expression that you would not want to understand what those critics were talking about.
At the Federal Assembly, it made it clear to everyone that the crookings were a match.
In the meantime, there was no particular interest or empathy for the problems of the country.
Instead, the cloudy Angela appeared: a politician who has escaped from reality, and there is only his own uncertainty.
The example of climate protection is: Heligendammi has unrestly praised itself for the Heiligendammi Decisions, but he hears how to achieve the climatisation targets in the country.
Nonetheless, as far as your compliment is concerned, such modesty would not have been allowed by the CDU presidency two years before.
Now he's getting into that frustration that prosperity has a positive effect on people.
This harms his good news as a pragmatic person who can solve problems instead of vocabulary flowers.
In the cloudy Angela's empire, however, internal policy problems are just a sidelines.
Child poverty and the problems of low-income people?
It's just a few secrecy.
It is a lot to say in this regard that there is a density of language failure when it comes to family supplements.
Mark has to go on three times to bring together a semi-manufactured sentence.
If it's concrete, it's in a foreign area.
Assault Division
The Republican president's candidates during his discussion at Youtube, the two favourites between Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, had to be changed hard, and they must also be held from an outside candidate.
The tension of the candidates has already reached the surface of the first subject.
Mitt Romney says to the opponent, Rudy Giuliani, that he's made New York a "complimentary immigrants".
Who, on his own, says with serious facts: "I would say that his own house served as a refugee for illegal immigrants", cut back Giuliani and vouch for the former governor of Massachusetts that he has been employing immigrants with no documents as a private person.
The candidates are going to a seizure: Since the Republican camp continues to have unanimously supported favours, the eight presidential presidency will use the debate on the CNN before all to undermine the credit of the opponent.
The videos sent by Internet users through Youtube have a set of 30-seconds of their own videos are hardly more than short summarys.
"We put Hitler into power by this type of isolationism," rubbed John McCain under his opponent Ron Paul's nose, who demands immediate exit from Iraq as the only participants of the circle.
Romney's head is also thoroughly washed on the veteran who went to Vietnam, when he stands to convict the so-called "Waterboarding", the interrogation method during which the drainage is simulated.
The fact that the important topics of the campaign are located beyond discussions on Iraq and torture, is shown by the reaction of the audience in Florida to St. Petersburg.
There is a loud applause in the room when conservative values are praised and when future tax increases are rejected.
Meanwhile, the two candidates are becoming more and more weak.
"I was mistaken", relentlessly reproached Romney and apologized to the supporters and television audiences for putting the vox in 1994, along with the abortion of pregnancy.
Giuliani, however, is inclined when he asks for the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf first rules as a civilian
One day after the resignation of the army, Musharraf, who exercised power in Pakistan, was retired.
This ends eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
The President of Pakistan, Pervez Musharraf, took place on Thursday, a further five-year term of office.
The Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live from the capital, the Islamabad presidency palace.
Musharraf swore to the constitution and to act for his people.
On Wednesday, he gave his military leader's office to his confidential Ashfaq Kiyani and thus allowed the international pressure from the United States.
The former general, eight years after the break-in of power in the form of a military coup, is now governing for the first time as the Head of Civil State.
Musharraf, acting as the chief commander of the armed forces, has complied with a fundamental demand for the West and the opposition.
Further important demand is the elimination of the exceptional condition, which Musharraf announced on 3 November.
According to Prosecutor Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will no longer eliminate the exceptional condition with which the West meets a further demand.
The Supreme Court of the country, in which Musharraf was planted sympathizing attorneys at the beginning of November following the publication of the exceptional situation, has rejected all the objections of the disputed re-election of the Head of State of 6 October last week.
Meanwhile, five soldiers lost their lives due to an assault against a military convoy in northern Vaziristan, and four more damaged.
According to the information reported by the Army's spokesman, the bomb was exploded on the road near the Afghanistan border.
The fathers of Crautrock will return
The German super team in the '70s music again: Harmony's three gang members redeployed his instrument until the power of a Berlin concert.
At the time of the reunion, from their light age, the time of "Live 1974" shows a cut tape.
They were much more known at that time in the foreign country.
The reported sensation has killed the body in the person of three agreed gentlemen surrounded by dinner tables.
His own instrument, his own cable and above all his own buttons.
Dieter Moebius has been in the middle of his 63 years in snow-white shirt.
Michael Rother, who has been young since his 57 years left, offers an escort in the possession of a laptop and guitar.
From the public to the right, Hans-Joachim Roedelius is 73-year-old and concentrates on the console.
Each of them produces some kind of noise, once and for all rhythms.
And sometimes this is about randomly a traditional music.
However, all of this seems not particularly disturbing the gentlemen themselves.
It was an excitement to the people of the crautrock music direction that Harmony had a musical band again.
What we can already say here: As a result of a proper follow-up, the name passed through the collective pop memorial, but in no case did he leave any remaining traces that we would miss this band painfully after 32 years.
But why can't the Germans celebrate the legends of their seventy years?
Especially that what we call a misleading crautrock, in England and America, they always appreciated more than in their own country.
When the music industry was awarded the Echo award for the living members of the cologne Can group in 2003, the German pop figures in the room sat with an incomprehensible face.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers laudated even the La Düsseldorf and Neu! thanks to the bands, the admiration became unlimited.
And at the concerts, Michael Rother sat on the stage as an old buddy with Red Hot Chili Peppers.
The same coin is two sides of domestic rejection and foreign acceptance.
Harmonia has already overloaded the memory because the trio existed for only two years, and during that period it has a far-reaching less effect than others were subsequently assigned to him.
Moebius and Roedelius used to play music with Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name of Cluster.
They started playing at the basement under the Schaubühne Theatre in Berlin.
Then in Düsseldorf, economic considerations for a record company financed by the church.
Rother helped the Kraftwerk band for a short time, and in parallel, perhaps the most radical German band, Neu!, acquired a reputation as a guitarist.
In 1973, however, Rother followed the Cluster's musicians into their exile in the Forst of Weserbergland.
There, in Alter Weserhof, lived in a 16th - century Roman city as a communal.
Less ideologically, than in Communication I, where Roedelius was still in trouble as a babysitter.
Their lives are more of an idyllic art.
It's supposed to be from the garbage, the flag of Harmonia Ottenstein's songwriter, and that's how they found their name as art.
Harmony has fixed some of these things.
The first album is called "Musik von Harmonia" and the next album is "De Luxe".
Despite his loose and modest music, the band had a financial need.
The arrow collection alone did not provide for them to find themselves.
The CD appeared at "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griessem, in front of an audience with a record of just 50 people, so someone remembers.
Harmony forced and occasional practice were then Rother's idea.
For Roedelius and Moebius, this is an immoral demand.
The band announced its distribution in 1975.
Rother ended up at the thousands and kept himself on albums like "Flammende Herzen."
Cluster was revived in the '80s, which has been more successful than Harmony has ever been.
Griesem's live album is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His Greenland-sounding record company aims to care for the crautrock as a special German contribution to live music.
In this context, Neu! has been dug up the same way as Roedelius.
Harmony is being resurrected at the House of Berlin Cultures.
Public money, within the framework of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope, the author of our British autumn and the "Krautrock Sampler" is also present.
There's also the idea manager of Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
This is about the impact of crautrock on the following popzene age.
In this respect, Harmony will fill the empty space reserved for the super team.
Brian Eno's determination with the most unusual voices floats in the room: "The only true music is his future."
There are pictures that represent the producer with Harmony in a peasant's room.
The production of further black and white photographs of sophisticated cable equipment serves to build legends.
In the hall, the three veterans are reconstituted with improvisation.
This just means that microphones are recorded for orgone and drum equipment with the intention of being deceived from the instruments by means of their own instruments that produce sound effects.
Today, electric music looks like electric music.
Three, a tech deepened in the field.
That's not even the house class's gonna change anything.
During Barbara Morgenstern's leadership, they cough and pussy and they sing "Aaaaaah!" in a beautiful part.
The crautrock has always been a very English concept.
It was never about rock.
The roots were earned less in blues than in musical art colleges (Can), in technical knowledge (Kraftwerk), or in the predecession of artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
If someone here yells at '68', they don't go on the wrong road, and Harmonia doesn't even leave you alone for that.
Even the most understandable thing is thought thoroughly on the stage.
Where does the music begin, and where does it end?
This may nervely impregnate you, or offer you the moments of exceptional happiness.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough
Through Hunting and Mörderischer Frieden, two movies are repeatedly dealing with war in Balkans.
However, none of them are convincing.
The basic thought or too much for action and shooting, or too emotional.
Even you, Richard Gere, can't help me with this.
First of all, the good news is: Although the two war criminals, Karadzsics and Mladics are still hiding in the hills of the Balkans, they found him again in the dark back of the Bosnian war, Richard Gere.
Recently, we lost sight of the most beautiful men in the eighteens of the years, since the emotional films for women played a number of good boys-nothing roles and the many press conferences in the Buddhism topic even took our minds to look at it.
And look at this, suddenly Richard Gere is the most pressing argument in addition to the fact that maybe we're looking at the "Wasking" film.
It provides a wonderful, ridiculous formation: basically Simon Hunt warrior, who was created by him, could have become Gere in that case if the fate and the movies were not so merciful to him: A man who has left his most beautiful years behind him long ago, but he still preserved a significant part of his romous monuments.
However, the German "Mörderischer Frieden" production, which started to show "Warning" this week, continues only the infinite series of films about the war in the Balkans, despite this adu.
The film "Mörderischer Frieden" does not have much to say: The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who are saving a Serbian woman from Kosovo's snipers, and one of them suddenly loves it.
Although it is welcome that this time the Serbians are not depicted as the only cause of all bad things, the film bearing the secretity of television films is too quickly lost in the shooting and in the event-fashioned scenes.
Cobra's carrying a "11" character instead of a motorway with a war.
On the other hand, it is exemplary in the case of Hunting, why no really good movie of the Balkan war has not yet been made.
The story of the three U.S. war criminals who listen to the name "Róka", with other directors and other directors, both in Richard Shepard's Persian Union, may have become a new "Apocalypse now" in another age.
The stories show a surprising similarity: In both cases, small groups will cut him to the forest to carry out what the army is unable to do - and in both cases the trip to madness.
One of the reasons for the fall of the Hunt is that Simon Hunt just won't let him be an obsessed cynic who listens to his heart, as he presents him at the beginning.
No, and as a result of the script, he spent a romantic relationship with a woman of Muslim witches who were murdered later.
The "Wasking" will end in the last five minutes of the film, when the reporters will get to what Nato, the CIA and the world were unable to do in five years: they will capture the warrior, then they will hand him over to the mohamed witches for fair revenge.
This is so bad that man would most like to turn to the Hague International Tribunal for the crime against the cinema logic.
The purpose of the film is deeply human.
He intends to put Karadzsics and Mladics on the loose, suspecting the Americans and the French (in this case they are exceptionally unified) that they do not continue the persecution intensively because of secret political agreements.
But good and evil sometimes look so much like each other, that a famous Brecht-vers comes to mind.
This poet writes the following about the Asian demon depicting the desk on his desk: "I look at the desk of the desk, which tells me how tired it is to be."
For films like Hunting, they have the same size as human-headed masks that show how tiresome it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the genre of movies about the war in Balkans.
It's been reported in the paper recently that all the Hollywood films about Iraq were a rude fall.
We can add: There hasn't been any good movies about South Africa yet.
It's almost always true: if a star is in the world's crisesgocas or mine fields, it's like "The paths of freedom" with Patricia Arquette, "No Borders" with Angelina Jolie or "The Bloody Diamond" Leonardo Di Caprio.
It is possible that these conflicts are still too close to time.
For decades, Hollywood was able to film a good movie about the holocaust with the "Schindler's list" film.
Probably a few films are still in place - because the arts of the Vietnam war, which are already classical, such as "The Horse Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett", were not celebrated in their time as unanimously masterpiece.
But it can be imagined that these days, when all mass murders arrive in real time, immediately through two screens of our home, we simply know too much about the conflicts of the world.
And that robs the scripts of the realm that we need to tell good stories.
I mean, "Lenn or not to be" or "Ditator" were finally so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin didn't even know how terrible my Nazi regime really is.
Maybe you shouldn't try to do good if you want to make a good movie.
Maybe we need to put the novel in Lawrence Norfolk's sarcastically distant artistic vision.
When historic novel "The Lemprière lexikons" and his parallels between the war in Balkans were asked, he said, "This is all that certain things never change.
Big cities will always be awfully dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way, and in Yugoslavia there will always be war."
Von Beusto is being severely criticised for resigning the Olympics
The decision-making of the mayor was a strong criticism of the tender submitted to the Summer Olympic Games in Hamburg in political and economic life.
A lot of people want to keep fighting for organizing water games.
Von Beust, however, is strongly alerted to realities during the probation.
On Wednesday, the Director General of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, considered the retirement to be "as favourable to the economic environment".
No other project has recently released such powerful motivation forces in the city than the Olympic idea.
"With this goal, we could not keep a level playing field for sports policy."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to develop a long-term initiative "which starts from modified time coordinates".
Mayor Ole von Beust maintained his earlier statements that the ambitions of Hamburg's Olympic Games were not real until at least 2028.
"Not Hamburg decides on the Olympics, but the German Olympic Sports Association," said von Beust to WELT ONLINE.
He was waiting for the Sports Association to decide on the Munich tender for the 2018 Winter Olympic Games.
"The advantage of this means that we will not have real opportunities within the period of 2028 which we have so far thought."
However, we don't give up the dream for good, he said von Beus.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) regretted the statements of von Beust.
This makes it an impression that Hamburg for the next 25 years does not intend to apply for Olympic Games.
"It's too early to wire a chance to bury our plans now," said Günter Ploß, President of HSB on Wednesday.
In addition, the resignation from the application is contrary to the statement made by the Senate President at the general meeting of the General University of Germany.
It is the case that Von Beust Hamburg’s 2015 Univerziadera tender was characterised as not a supplement to the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The College Sports Association only launched Hamburg as a city participating in the tender last week.
The civilian group of the SPD urged the Senate that he left valuable time in terms of the building of his dwellings in Hamburg.
"The development of the Kleiner Grasbrook has been postponed for years by the Senate because he voted with the Olympics and avoided the building of the apartment", said two SPD representatives Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD continued to break the chain alongside the integrated plan for the Olympics and subsequent housing exploitation for Kleiner Grasbrook, the CDU unilaterally emphasised the "incremental factor".
The tender for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games was very enthusiastic in Hamburg.
However, Hamburg fell in Lipcsé.
These aren't Warhol's crates.
The one who connects the concepts of Sweden and the village is Ikea, and he doesn't mean Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently, the walls produced in Sweden put a dark shadow on the list of Warhol works.
The majority of the ninety-four "Stockholm type" Brillo Box are counterfeit.
After a few months ago, after the Swedish "Expressen" paper, Andy Warhol doubted the original of Brillo Box 1968, now the internal investigation of the Modern Museet in Stockholm came to an inconsistent outcome: A large part of the six "Brillo Box" provided by the former museum manager Pontus Hultén in 1995 and probably a hundred more "Stockholm type" Brillo Box.
The long and complicated chain of artistic and curatorial mutations.
In 1964 Warhol created the first "Brillo Boxa" - the "Brillo" soap powder box, based on red-blue-white shapes.
In an exhibition in Moderna Museet of 1968 - with Warhol consent - the works produced hundreds of Brillo boxes: these (for cost savings) were not from Warhol, but transported directly from the Brillo map factory.
It wasn't artwork, it was their templates, simple exhibition pieces.
However, in 1968 Warhol granted authorisation to manufacture some of the Brillo villages in Sweden, which were not produced in Moderna Museet.
The witnesses of the age are now talking about fifteen boxes that were then certified as Original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Box under the term "Stockholm type" entered into the history of art and auction.
Some of them were auctioned for over $100,000.
The problem, however, is that Pontus Hultén, the legendary museum manager, was falsely claiming that in 1968 hundreds of your walls were manufactured and produced in Sweden, and then left Warhol.
In fact, Hultén's 105 boxes were produced only in 1990 in Malmo for a Saint-Pétervár exhibition.
At that time, however, Warhol was dead three years ago.
Lars Byström, the main monumentist of Moderna Museet, in addition to six boxes owned by the museum, examined three boxes of Swedish private property, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968.
On the contrary, the structure of the copies from 1990 reveals that the paint has been put up directly to the spinning sheet without foundation, and it is not about oil, it is about acrylic acid.
"These boxes were not authenticated by the artist, so they should be deleted from the official list of Andy Warhol Brillo Boxes," says Lars Nittve, Director of Moderna Museet, "If only the New York 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' decides otherwise, the six boxes of Moderna Museet in its collection will be classified as a copy/exhibition material."
The Authentication Board, of course, announced in June that he was examining the serious accusations of soap powder boxes.
However, they have been concealed in unquestionable silence since then.
Manilai Rebel Soldiers Resign
They gave up the rebel in the Philippines, the soldiers who bariqued themselves at a hotel in Manila and demanded the defeat of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
You can't take responsibility for the bloodshed, you've reported to reporters at the hotel, their leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and election fraud.
Before that, government-friendly soldiers with tears had attacked the hotel.
The two dozens of soldiers have stayed in the building for hours.
Half of the team was held before court on Thursday due to a failed attempt in 2003, including Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly solve rounds with 30 sympathies.
The military police responsible for the man's guard have obviously joined him and joined the meltdown.
They entered the Peninsula-Hotel and then demanded the failure of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government cool units have closed down the neighbourhood of the hotel.
The president invited the security office to an extraordinary meeting.
Norberto Gonzales' security consultant condemned the military procedure.
"They have enough for the people," said Trillanes.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, formerly commander of the Scout Rangers elite, declared that other military units wanted to join the run in a short time.
On Friday, government critics called for a strong protest against the president.
His government has been shaded by corruption charges for months.
Manila’s financial district was already the main stage of the attempt to revolve against Arroyo, organised by 200 members of the Army’s wheels in 2003.
The uprising failed only 24 hours ago when the army came to join.
Since 1986 at least seven coupon attempts have been carried out in the Philippines against the democratically elected governments.
The United Internet will be a major player in Versatel
United Internet provided more than 20% of its share in the Versatel telecommunication company.
As reported by the company on Wednesday evening, the average price per share is 14.46 Euros.
This represents 20,05 % of the capital.
You've already had some wings from the takeover before that.
The possibility of raising the share acquired in Versatel remains open.
By this step, they want to promote the consolidation of the German DSL market, as reported by United Internet.
Before this, there were assumptions on Wednesday about a possible link after Berenberg Bank increased its share of the Düsseldorf network service provider by further 5 per cent to 15.1 per cent.
The financial institution maintains its share only as a third party, announces it on the money market.
On the previous day, United Internet owned a narrow 10 percent of Drillisch's mobile phone company.
Within the framework of the capital increase, Drillisch has issued 17,4 million new shares worth EUR 106,4 million.
The United Internet purchased 5.15 million shares for €31.4 million.
In addition, companies have initiated dialogue on cooperation on the market dumping of DSL and mobile phone products.
"We're breaking up our partner relationship," said the United-Internet spokesman.
The two companies jointly established the MSP Joint Undertaking to take over the competitor Freenet.
The two companies at the beginning enjoy a good 10% share in Freenet and do not live with the right to take over the additional 18.49% of Freenet, reported on Thursday the United Internet.
However, the two companies leave all options open, especially in increasing their shares in Freenet AG, the news.
The negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on the strategic partnership were concluded in the middle of November.
For months around Freenet, a poker game that can only be reviewed with a case-by-case event is part of the consolidation of the German telecoms market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet was a 2,9 million contract mobile phone client and a customer with 1,27 million DSL and fixed access.
The United Internet and the holding company Drillisch have so far had 6,01 per cent shares in Freenet.
Now we have an agreement that Drillisch brings four percent of the additional wheel.
An agreement on the right to purchase 18,49 % of the Vatas investment company was concluded in August.
