Camille Auer wanted to fix his sex, diagnosed as mentally ill, and now he's making art on the subject, "Man should have the right to his own body."
The roof of the Project Room Gallery at the Academy of Arts hangs tens of patients' reports.
Every one of them says Camille Avier's name.
The papers explain the multiannual story of how external people have written up their interpretation of Auer and its identity.
Decided for him who he is.
"I wanted to tell a person about my treatment history so that the process of violence would be visible," says Auer.
With the process, he refers to the reproduction process.
It is often a years of study that includes meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process starts by sending the diagnosis of "sugar identity disorder" carried out in Tampere and Helsinki.
In the case of Auer, the process started four years ago.
Even before this, he had used the oestrogen he ordered on the Internet and was, by the way, very long in his own repair process.
He experienced being a woman, but according to Finnish law, a person must go through the repair process so that the sex can also be corrected legally.
The translator, i.e. the transsek law on establishing the sex of the mouth (563/2002), requires transsexual people to be forced into sterilisation in order to obtain the right sex, for example, to the demographic register centre and passport.
At present, every gender remedial requires psychiatric diagnosis and evidence of reproductive inability.
People have the right to decide their own body.
"This situation is intolerable and infringes human rights," says Auer.
The reform of the translator has been discussed in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has made eight observations in law and the European Court of Human Rights has a preliminary decision obliging the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to respect the right of self-determination.
The previous Government of Finland prepared the amendment of the law under the leadership of Susanne Huovisen, Minister of Social Affairs and Health.
There were election and the Base Finns rose to the government.
Now the change of law is stuck again.
This is about internal policy disputes that are not even related to this law.
"Hallitus does not want to put it on the table because there are disagreements within the government to amend the law," says Frank Johansson, director of the Finnish branch of Amnesty.
Two major installations control the front of the exhibition space.
One of these consists of packs and instructions for use of Aeri medicines.
In the patient report, any visitor can read, for example, the interpretation of the transpol psychologist of the University of Tampere hospital in Auer.
The psychologist met Camille Auer twice and wrote on the basis of this report that should define the treatment of the law of Auer and the access to assistance.
The consciousness of the researchable reality appears to be exposed to deterioration.
The study’s self-consciousness appears to be at a border level fragmented and the instability of personality-related features are highlighted.
Auer didn't recognize himself from these descriptions.
"It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed as mentally ill," says Auer.
The even greater shock was when Auer was not given gender correction therapy.
According to the care staff, his resources were not sufficient to start the process.
He was forbidden to have his own identity.
At that time, 11 February 2015 Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked the waiting hall on TV.
Later, this television produced a works of art called Monument for the Excluded, where Auer reflected his experience of power and its use.
"It's crazy that anyone who is born as a woman can magnify his chest, but to remove the breasts needs a diagnosis," Auer says.
Your body is not yours if you experience nothing but the number of your sex defined in the birth.
Unfortunately, Auer's experience is not the only quality.
The gender correction process is tougher for many mental reasons than for purely medical operations.
Those who are through it meet dozens of people who have to justify their own existence and right to their own sexual experience.
"It's crazy that people who are in need of support and help are denied treatment, insisting that their resources are not enough," says Auer.
Many people who have applied for the process have psychological symptoms: depression, anxiety, possible temptation experiences.
In this respect, the care staff may decide that treatment cannot be initiated.
"Avoiding treatment and assistance can cause a person to be in a worse situation than it was before the process was started," says Auer.
Auer’s own exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts about suicide.
In the exhibition edition, Auer writes: "I have had self-destructive thoughts throughout my adult life, and that is what people are usually hard to melt."
Depression has been treated with medicines and when Auer started using hormones, feeling easier.
He had finally been able to say the feelings that had already existed in childhood and teenage age.
The reason why the wide jaw did not feel suitable for its own body and why the chest muscles had to be round instead of a flat chest.
The most important thing for Auer has been that there are people near him who see him.
Getting to sight is the basic goal.
"She has to reason so much by talking, dressing, using voice and moving," he says.
Today, Auer is already experiencing his coming to be seen, he exists as a woman.
However, at the beginning of the process, the random comments of close relatives could hurt a lot.
The most important thing is to do is to hurt someone who's intimidated.
"They should know and they know who I am, but they won't agree or be able to intimidate it," he continues.
But not all transhumans need physical changes.
They do not suffer from body dysphoria, i.e. body conflict, where body or parts of it can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and the long-term research process, no formal confirmation can be obtained for their own sex.
"There are no medical grounds for these studies," says Auer.
And it's true.
In Denmark, for example, Parliament adopted a new procedure for the recognition of legal sex in June 2014.
The new legislation is based on self-determination in relation to legal sex.
A full-aged applicant shall make a written application for a new identity, stating that he will experience being a different sex.
After six months of discretion, the applicant shall confirm his application in writing and the Ministry shall grant the applicant a new identity identification.
This self-determination is also required in Finland, and this requirement is also subject to the exhibition of Auer.
It has not been an artist's therapist experience, but an exhibition is a political and artistic collection.
I want to believe that art still has a weight and that it can bring about political changes at a time when politicians have forgotten human rights.

The Civil Rights Organization gave travel warning to Missouri
The National NAACP Organisation for Afro-American Civil Rights has provided a travel warning for Missour, due to the discriminatory practices of the State and the racist attacks that took place there.
"The NaACP Missouri travel report will enter into force on 28 August 2007 and calls on African American tourists, visitors and locals to pay particular attention and to exercise extreme caution when travelling in a state which has recently experienced numerous cases of questionable races", the report of the organization states.
The recently in force in Missour, the law will make it difficult for the export of discrimination cases to justice, and the enforcement of state law is disproportionately directed at minorities, according to the NAACP, which led to the provision of travel warning.
"Inhuman civil rights are being violated.
They will be stopped on the basis of skin color and be assaulted or killed," said Missouri Rod Chapel, President of the NAACP, to Kansas City Star.
"We haven't heard one of many cases in one short time."
The travel report on Missouri is the first warning of the United States State.
The organization mentioned, for example, racist comments against Afro-American students at Missour University and from Tennessee, the death of a 28-year-old black Tory Sanders.
Sanders died in a questionable situation this year, and he was driving through the state when his car ran out of fuel, and Missouri's police arrested him, even though he was not accused of a crime.
The travel report also referred to Missouri's Justice Minister's report that the police would stop the black driver by 75% more likely than the white driver.
"The purpose of the travel report is to urge people to be careful and to warn their families, friends and colleagues about what may happen in Missouri," says Chapel.
"People must prepare, for example, by taking money to pay guarantees or by telling relatives that they are going to travel through the state."
According to the FBI, in 2015, 100 anger crimes were recorded in Missouri, the sixteen most of the U.S. states.
Travel warning is also the answer to Missouri's new law, which makes it difficult for companies to challenge discrimination in housing and employment relations.
The ACLU recently gave travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after the adoption of immigration laws which oblige the police to arrest people of immigration violations, which is an additional profile based on race.
In general, travel warnings are published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and concern other states, but in recent times NGOs have published them as a response to certain laws and developments in the United States.
Yle: Lintilä asked Finnair to report the Executive Director's supplementary pension
Mika Lintilä (kesk.), Minister of Commerce on State ownership, has requested Finnair to report the supplementary pension premium received by Pekka Vauramo, CEO of the airline, Yle tells us.
According to the Minister, it is in conflict with the State's statement of will.
The supplementary pension received by Vauramo was raised this week when Helsinki’s Sanomat news about the remuneration of the managers of the stock exchange companies.
The Finnish Photo Paper news about Vauramo’s supplementary pension in February.
Finnair stated that he would give up the supplementary pensions in 2013.
The State has clarified that no additional pensions are used to reward.
The state owns more than half of Finnair.
According to the company, the decision is in line with the principle of ownership management in the last year.
The forces were hardening the speeches immediately.
A while ago, it seemed that relations between the United States and Russia were on their way from cold to warm.
During the G20 meeting of the industrialised countries in Hamburg, the US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared to be doing great.
Since then, the atmosphere has cooled considerably.
The new economic sanctions signed by the United States Congress last week and signed by Trump on Wednesday were rigorously responded in Russia.
The most disastrous answer has so far been heard from Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev, according to which Trump's undersigned imprisonment means "full-scale trade war".
Although the Russian reactions would only be out of the tops and overlyings of political rhetoric, the blackmail between the United States and Russia is the fact that after the short month after the choice of Trump.
In the United States, the transit of the Sanctions Act on Russia, Iran and North Korea was not simple.
Of course, the Congress adopted the law with considerable consensus, but the adoption of the law to the President was much more difficult, according to what has been said.
Trump criticises the law that he has recently signed as "deficient".
President Trump must have been responsible for the clumsyness of Russia in particular, although the adoption of a law restricting his own powers must also have been disgusted.
As well known, investigations are being carried out in the United States on the possible involvement of Russia in the presidential elections and on the Russian links of the Trump campaign.
The extortion between the United States and Russia is a fact after the short honeymoon.
When the White House staff has switched to a thin and various scandalous turns have been revealed almost to update, it seems increasingly clear that foreign policy in the United States is not being done under the leadership of the President, but despite the president.
There is no hope for such a situation.
If the relationship with Russia is a turbulent in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the excitement of the security situation in the Union's nuclear area in the Baltic Sea also exacerbates relations.
The EU has seen the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and has called for the implementation of the Minsk Treaty.
Although the Union has remained at least on the main side of its policy, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
For a Member State that makes a lot of trade with Russia, economic sanctions have been real trouble.
The impact of the recent US sanctions is still unclear.
In the EU, it is feared that sanctions will make the operation of many European companies more difficult.
In Finland, for example, the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly the Fennovoima nuclear power plant project may have an impact.
Acidity in Europe has caused the absence of sanctions, for example, a liquid natural gas in lng, which is important to the US economy.
Commercial sanctions are the way in which world policy can demonstrate misconduct.
However, economic sanctions must be very discretionary and precise.
Otherwise, it's easy to harm more than use.
Isn't anything holy anymore?
The White House of Trump now has a Statue of Freedom
The absence of statues is surely a sign of exchange of power.
The Americans know it as well as others: the Iraqis, together with American soldiers, were drowned in the field of Firdos in 2003 in Saddam Hussein's statue.
Stephen Miller, one of the main ideas of Trump's administration, knew well what was going on in a vivid debate with the CNN channel Jim Acostan. The Freedom statue was attacked by Miller in a vocabulary on the president's proposal to significantly reduce legal immigration.
Miller didn't really criticize the statue himself.
If he had done that, he would have been attacked by huge flocks of cruise organizers and imaginative characters of the Statue of Freedom.
His attack had the significance of the statue, especially the fact that in 1903 Emma Lazarus’s poem — 17 years after the statue was completed.
So Miller sank Acosta: "I don't want to go further into history, but the statue of freedom is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.
The poem was later added, and it is not part of the original statue of freedom."
Miller wasn't wrong on his own, but it's not just about history, as he said himself.
The only words in Lazarus are essential, the only of their quality, where the state calls not only immigrants but also the "poor poorest": "Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teeming shore."
The poem is now more up-to-date than ever.
Miller did not practice the literary criticism, but he made it clear that the poorest poor are not welcome to the United States of Trump.
The importance of the Freedom statue is part of a wider political and cultural debate on the importance of the United States.
After his death, friends of Lazarus campaigned for the poetry to be attached to his statue, and they knew very well that the act was strongly political.
The purpose of the statue was to manifest the links between the French and American Republic with a classical symbol, a female incorporation of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in his poem, the female beast is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: the mother of exiled.
The link of the poem to the picture was a brilliant feminist coup and a disastrous attack on the American Nationality Act.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long wanted to turn it back to the original.
In 2010, Rush Limbaugh, an instructor, which can now be regarded as some kind of prophesying mark of Trump, claimed that the Statue of Freedom does not appear to be invited to anyone, but is the early advancer of new conservatives, which leads the United States to the darkness to cover the world: "Lady Liberty comes out.
He's taking the freedom of waking from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch doesn't show the way to the United States."
Hardly, Limbaugh was partially right.
The significance of the statue of freedom depends entirely on the point of view.
Lazarus saw it as poor and exhausted but hopeful immigrants from the ship's deck after a long journey and trials.
He saw it from the point of view of people looking for a better life.
His Son of Freedom comforts by giving hope and welcome.
And that's what Miller and Trump don't want.
Their torch does not show the way, but sparks the flames of hatred, their only source of power.
MM competitions in general sports 2017: Neil Black praises Scotland members of the UK country team
Eilidh Doyle remembers the time when only two Scots got to the British country team.
The head of the British General Sports Association, Neil Black, says that 16 members of the country team participating in the World Championships are "significant confirmation".
On Friday, the MM competitions in general sports in London have been selected for a record number of Scottish athletes.
According to Black, in Scotland, there is something special that needs to be learned by British general sports.
"This is welcome, and we will continue to examine it for so long that we can understand what this is about," says Black.
"I was conversing with the representatives of the Scotland Sports Institute, and they thought it was involved in the operation of the Institute.
The Scotland General Sports Union believes that it relates to the activities of the Union,
and the British Association of General Sports believes that it is behind their activities.
And the usual streetman thinks he's got something to do with it.
But it's something absolutely awesome, and why is it?"
In London, many Scots are competing with medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competes with Sir Mo Farah in a race of 5,000 metres. Eilidh Doyle was elected captain of the country team.
"Eilidh is uncommonly modest.
His captain's speech was incredibly amazing," says Black.
"The warriors took advantage of their achievements and were strongly motivated, regardless of where they would live and practice.
The words of Eilidh were genuine emotion and passion for sports."
Eilidh Doyle is a silver-track champion of the National Society in the fence run of 400 metres, and these are his fifth World Championship, and he thinks it's "incredible" that there are 16 Scots in the country team.
The previous record was seven from 1983 and 2015.
The middle traveler Laura Muir has run over the year five British and two European records.
He's competing in London at 1 500 metres and 5 000 metres.
Chris O'Hare runs 500 meters in London. He is also worth watching: a man has an excellent season behind him, including winnings in UK MMs and Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers his first World Championship, when the only scotch of the country team was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the country team says he's "very proud" of the fact that there are so many scots involved, some of whom really compete with the final spots and medals.
"Access is a great honour, but more specific, because the members of the country team voted for the captain," says Doyle.
"I am, of course, very proud of all the Scots who entered the country team.
It shows how far we've gotten.
They're involved as worthy athletes who compete for awarders.
My Captain's speech?
I thought it was all right.
I focused on how lucky we were when we had a home race.
It is important to enjoy the support of the home public and the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get another chance to compete there, and I know that the atmosphere will be incredibly amazing."
Prevention of critics in Facebook: Do not apply to public posts if you are unable to endure criticism
Our country's father knew what was a bad publicity.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers soon began to criticize him from all possible domestic policies to his political principles.
I'm sure the criticism was annoying.
But he didn't silence his critics.
"If the freedom of speech is removed, we may be led by dumb and quiet as sheep slaughtered," Washington said in 1783.
That's how we get to Maryland's governor, Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff have deleted at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and blocked them.
The U.S. Civil Rights Association challenged Hogan's court earlier this week.
His staff considered the challenge to be unfounded, and his attitude was also negligible online.
"What difference does it make? It's just Facebook," a lot of comments.
But it matters.
In particular, in the case of Hogan.
Hogan is the astonishingly popular Republican governor of the state of democracy.
He has received second best estimates of his activities among the 50 governors.
Hogan's not a sensitive reaction to a hot rock.
He's been struggling with the state and firmly holding on to the principles.
He has also used Facebook as a key communication channel to his electorates and published a picture of his bald head in chemotherapy.
Therefore, preventing users coming to the Governor's Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous. The Governor's page is a public and official forum, which his staff maintains with tax resources.
Mr. Hogan's reporter, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's action in his interview to Washington Post, and he said it was just about the moderation of comments.
However, stamping commentants as trolls, squirrels or haters is too easy for us.
Washington Post interviewed users blocked by Hogan on Facebook.
They proved to be ordinary people who wanted to discuss with their chosen leaders, not trolls, but teachers, entrepreneurs, and pastors.
They told me that their comments were respectful, kind and appropriate.
In his comment, the reverend quoted the Bible; he wanted to appeal to the Catholic faith of Hogan.
Mr Lakshmi Sarma Ramani Maryland’s Bowie was not hostile but raised a question of anger crimes.
"I said complimentally that I am disappointed that Hogan had not taken a position on anger crimes and other recent news," he wrote in the comments of Washington Post's news.
"I cannot accept the fact that when more people comment on the same thing, they are regarded as a sort of organized group and are ignored as a large group of citizens concerned."
The governor's staff called the comments "a central attack" and someone else could call them "in order to promote matters that are important."
In the Facebook era, communication is easy to manage by preventing a critic or removing a critical comment.
In the past, staff should have been sent to collect and burn newspapers that had published critical headlines, or to arrest and silence demonstrators.
In fact, however, it is the same matter, now only digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official charged with the chaining of Facebook and other social media channels.
The Twitter users blocked by President Trump have challenged him to court.
The first important decision was taken last week in Virginia.
According to Alexandria’s Supreme Court Judge James C. Cacheris, the Loudoun County Government violated the first increase of the U.S. Constitution in preventing the electorate on Facebook.
And the U.S. Civil Rights Association went to discuss the use of Twitter and Facebook with the Republican Governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevin.
This shouldn't be hard.
During Washington, cheap postal payments had similar effect as today on the Internet.
The number of newspapers fourfolded from 1776 to 1800, and anonymous writers mocked Washington.
There were trolls that night.
The names of Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius were written in the newspapers in which they hailed Washington's decisions.
The President's office was flooded with petitions that criticised the Jay Agreement, i.e. the United States-Georgia Cooperation, Trade and Maritime Agreement, which reflects the documents collected by the Papers of George Washington network project.
But he didn't slow down his critics.
Free speech, freedom of opinion and freedom of conversation are the basic stones of our nation.
The real leadership means accepting this fact.
The summer food of birds should be stopped immediately
The samples have come from about a half a dozen locations, and also online reports from a couple, three.
Most of them have become South and Warsaw Finland, but then individual from Haapaved and Seinäjoki, specialist researcher Marja Isomursu Evira tells us.
The green peppers have died of a tricomonosis parasite.
It is caused by a scientific animal called Trichomonas gallinae.
It has previously been known to hit the cereals, and especially the bucket.
However, in the 21st century, the disease was also detected in pedestrian birds.
In 2009, it was quite a blur.
At that time, the tricomonosis caused a major collapse in the green pepper stock in Finland, after which the strains of the species have been revival.
There have been sick green peppers now, but not yet in a large scale, the museum master Juha Honkala of the University of Helsinki (Luomus) tells us.
It is feared that the previous epidemic of green beeps will be recurrenced unless there is anything to do.
What we need to do now is a very simple thing that everyone can do: stop the birds' summer food immediately.
More on the subject later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from home field service at the Renaissance Club
The former European First Player Ronan Rafferty hopes that he will benefit from the home field service for the next three days when the 25th Scottish Senior Open tournament is held in the Renaissance Club Eastern Lothian.
Rafferty, the Northern Irelandian, led a tournament in the neighborhood of Archerfield Links, before the last round, but eventually lost to Paul Eales. Rafferty is pleased to be a new place and is an ambassador of the tournament on behalf of the founder of the club and CEO Jerry Sarvad.
"I followed the construction of the Renaissance Club, and with this event it's going to be full of glory," says Rafferty.
"The players will see the field in their best, and it's in great shape.
Jerry's been doing a great job with this place.
He's an enthusiastic ambassador in the game, and he's proud of his accomplishments here.
"The tournament is a fantastic show for this field."
The English Eales defends the championship for the first time, although he has won both the European tour and the European tour for the 32 years.
"This feels like a very special opportunity," says the player in Southport.
"I couldn't defend Extremadura Open's victory because the tournament is not part of this year's tour.
It's great to get back here.
It's a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories come back to mind: the tournament victory was a great thing for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a great time we'll always remember."
Gary Orr will return to real action with his own soil, and he went in to the tour after 50 years earlier this year.
This is his first performance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open tournament.
"Playing in the homeland is always more relevant than usual," says Orr, who lives in Helensburgh.
"You want to succeed, but you also feel extra pressure.
I've been enjoying playing again and playing pretty hard.
I'm happy with my game so far."
The Triple will be able to join the field with the former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and seniors' major tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
There are six scots: Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance and Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
There is free access to the tournament. The car parking costs five pounds if the car only has a driver, and 10 pounds if there are at least two people in the car.
All revenues are donated to the Prostate Cancer UK Cancer Organisation.
In the bed, possible internal air problems were solved by the barracks.
At the bedside, no internal air problems have been found at least for the time being at the barracks building of the Pori Brigadier, the Brigadier was reported on Thursday.
Inland air investigations will continue.
The surveys began when a man who stopped his guard for health reasons thought that his health had weakened because of the bad indoor air.
According to Colonel Mika Holma, the Chief of Staff of the Pori Brigadier General, no problems have been identified in the health situation of other garagemen.
It turns out that this was a case of individuality and that there was no health problems with other service providers in that unit.
Each declaration is being taken seriously and we wanted to settle this issue thoroughly.
At present, it is not known that we have any internal air problem, Holma says.
The Brigadier's release states that, as a result of the July arrival, the barracks had to be moved into the barracks, which could result in a momentary increase in dust.
The air may therefore seem intact, Holma says.
Poverty and death in the Goldland of Indonesia
Bardina Degei doesn't use the gentleness of his cooking plant.
He's only rarely using a shrimp.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital of the region of Pania, located in the unrested Papua province of Indonesia. When he prepares dinner, he usually puts a batat – locally "nota" – directly in the fire.
In half an hour, the batt burned on the carpet will be eaten greedyly with bare, unwashed hands.
There are no furniture in Dege's home, and he sits on a mud painting, where he usually carries his daily chassis, like in a cloudy water that was applied for from a nearby swamp.
The office of the bathroom will be delivered by a bucket in the roofless room.
Degei is the youngest of the four wives of his husbands, and he has not been assigned to treat fields.
Multi-wisdom is common here.
Later work can be dangerous: most of the village's men are unemployed, and many drink a lot, and the soldiers must also be taken into account.
"No one dares to walk in the village after five nights," Degei says.
This is a rare stretch of the ark in the Papua highlands, the former Dutch colony, which was attached to Indonesia in 1969. A controversial referendum preceded by the controversial referendum, where 1 026 of the village was forced to vote publicly before the occupational forces.
The local autonomy movement opposed the Netherlands quickly turned its anger to the Jakarta Government, which holds the area strictly under control and prevents foreign suppliers and human rights observers from access to it.
In 2003, the province was officially distributed to Papua and West Papua. The eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
The enarotal is a remote and a collar. The trip there begins at a flight of about a half an hour from the town of Jayapura to Nabire, and continues on a five-hour drive by the rental car.
There's no public transport here.
In the city of about 19,000 inhabitants, there are wooden houses surrounded by bamboo plants whose wavelengths have been stacked into bells.
Only a few Indonesians have been here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries came to Papua, the tribes of Mee Pago worshipped the God of Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes.
"We didn't have such clothes," Degei says. He means colorful, hand-woven with his boiling head, dark skirt and bright-colored blouse.
"Before we had only magazines covered in our bodies."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia. 28% of its inhabitants live below the poverty limit and children's mortality and literacy are the highest in Asia.
But it's also the golden country of Indonesia.
Paniai is about 153 000 inhabitants of New Jersey. Only about a hundred kilometres away from Pania is Grasberg, the world's largest and most profitable gold mine, owned by Freeport McMoran, whose home is in Phoenix, the United States.
In 2015, the mine produced the Freeport worth 3.1 billion dollars of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has an estimated 78 billion dollars of wood reserves.
However, these riches to the Papuans bring misery, as they mean the suppressive presence of the strong army in Indonesia.
In 2005, New York Times revealed that Freeport paid almost $20 million to local military personnel and military local units in 1998-2004.
This source of income threatens the demands of greater self-determination of beans, and they are slowed down without mercy.
According to human rights activists, after 1969 the Indonesian army has killed over 500 000 papuans and raped, tortured and imprisoned thousands.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, mass deaths at the top of the Papua tribes in the 1970s were proportional to genocide.
Last year, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3 900 people in the area in peaceful demonstrations.
In the Brisbane Archbishop report We Will Lose Everything from 2016, there are reports of the cruelties of the previous year, such as executions without trial, torture, rape and electrical attacks are particularly popular means – and unrepentant attacks towards peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to calculate the number of victims because there are cases per week," says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
Ruuvia has been extorted when Papua’s natural resources attract immigrants from other parts of Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of Provinss, 83% are Christians, but the demographic structure is changing when the islands of Japan, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawes in Indonesia are moving Muslims to the region in the hope of a better livelihood.
The Japanese warung food cakes sell fried chicken and gado-gado-violence in the peanut sauce.
It's hard for locals to compete.
"The exchangers have started selling chickens and vegetables on the market cheaper than locals", says 24-year-old Abeth You, from Pania and moved to the capital of the province after work.
"Local women lost their clients."
In Indonesian President Joko Widodo, named Jokowi, promised to address the injustices and human rights violations of Papua in his 2014 electoral campaign.
Papua consists of 29 regions, and this former carpenter won a vote in 27 regions, including in Pania, on his way to the Jakarta presidential Castle.
But just a little has changed in Papua, and the locals feel disappointed.
"Our hearts were broken because we voted in 2014 to Jokowi and we expected that he would fulfill our wishes and restore justice," says You.
There was some kind of wave base in the Pania only two months after Jokow's logical officials.
Eleven children were singing Christmas songs near the fire at Enarotal on 7 December 2014, when two Indian soldiers appeared in the dark on motorcycles.
Scared children told the soldiers they should use headlights.
One of the soldiers didn't like the remark, and according to the local pastor, Yavedt Tebai, the man returned with four soldiers.
According to the reports of victims and witnesses, drunken soldiers captured children and assaulted them with rifles.
That's how one of the soldiers shot at the kids.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, fell into a coma as a result of assault.
A few hours later, the building of the National Election Board located near the site was set on fire, and the following day began to happen.
About a thousand papuans — young men, women, and children — met at the football field in front of the local police station and military headquarters to demand justice.
They had hunting springs for their holidays, and they began to present the traditional wait dance of the Papuan Mee Pago tribe, which dances in a circle and tracks the bird song.
Some demonstrators began to stone police and military buildings.
When the atmosphere got hot, the soldiers received an order in the internal radio system: "If the crowds are fighting more than three times, shoot them dead." The information is based on the official document in the TIME magazine that has not been published to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the resident director of Kego Koto, felt the situation out of hand and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
"When I turned around, I was shot in the left wrist," he told the TIME magazine with a shiny color of his wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but the bullet came from the soldiers' lines.
"A lots of shots were shot in the Venice."
Alfius Youwi was shot three times, and his cousin saw the shootings.
"I ran to him and made sure it was really him," told Yohanes TIME sadly. Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
"I saw him dead, I kissed him."
The police inspector Yotje Mende told the journalists that the police were just "protecting" police station because it was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said Pudjo Sulistiyo, Papua police informant in 2015.
That's when it's about life and death.
According to the Human Rights Watch organization, five young demonstrators were killed and many were injured.
The data on the deaths came to Jakara the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi held an emotional speech in Jayapura in which he expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and promised that the violence in Papua would be addressed.
"I want the case to be investigated immediately so that this will never happen again."
In October 2016, Minister for Security, Wiranto said that he would launch reports of human rights violations outside the legal system.
But he started to revoke his speech right away.
"Some of the violations happened a long time ago,
In the 1990s and early 2000s.
The most important thing is that we have decided to investigate infringements, but there are certain processes to do so," he said.
During the interview in Jakarta on 5 June 2017, Wiranto had already changed her mind. She said that she was not going to start the investigations at Papua.
"Everything will be settled in court," he told me.
The UN blames Wiranto for "crime against humanity". Crimes relate to more than a thousand people's death in the bloody independence vote in 1999 in East Timor. Wiranto said to TIME that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been investigated, including cases in Pania.
The families of the victims of Peninians view the claims with dark infidel.
"I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things have not progressed in any way," Yohanes says.
"I'm already tired of this."
He tells us he's still alive in fear, even though it's been years.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me, and I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother, Yacobus, confirms that the panic people are afraid to discuss the event.
He tells me the soldiers had assaulted him when he had helped bury four of the victims.
"The soldiers are looking for me after the funeral of the victims," he says.
Shooting isn't over.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot villagers in the Neighbourhood of Pania in Deiya.
One died and 17 was injured in the conflict between the villagers and the construction company, which began when the leader refused to take the man who lost his consciousness to the hospital, and among the injured ones there were children.
The man who needed medical treatment was the 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had been in possession of water while fishing in the nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
In front of the company’s office, the angry villagers showed their minds at the construction site.
According to the police, the villagers stoned cops who responded with warning shots.
According to local authorities, however, the mobile police unit of the Indonesian militia police opened fire towards the crowd, where one villager was killed.
"We're terrified, we're afraid of revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw those injured.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
Deiyai Parliament has called for gunshots to be fired by police officers and the withdrawal of a moving police unit from the area.
Paniai has always been the problem of the Indonesian Government.
The lack of real development feeds negligence in the tribes of Mee, Multi, Dani and Damal, living in the middle of Papua.
Many have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM), the rebel army, claiming to defend the rights of the Papua by random attacks and the kidnapping of the Indonesian army.
Some of the OPM leaders are Paniais, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded by arresting and imprisoning thousands of people in Pania in the name of "securing national sovereignty".
Some of the arrested people never come back.
Among the Papuans, Paniai is known as "holy, forgotten place".
Poverty feeds discomfort.
There's only a little rice to be sold in the Enarotal, and it's too expensive for the locals,
Like bread.
People themselves grow their food: predominantly batates and some fruits and leaves.
Cultivation is women's work, and one woman's responsibility may be four or five bats' fields.
Most of the harvest is for the family, and the rest is sold on the market.
Ten bats only cost 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
In time, the differences in local and migrant earnings have increased and the number of migrants has increased since new routes were opened to the airport of Nabre.
There are few jobs, and they usually go to local better educated and wealthier immigrants.
Only a few beans have sufficient capital and know-how to operate their own business competitively.
"Youths do not want to stay in the village because there is no work or money here," says John Gobai, President of the Pania tribe council.
In the world, steep Papua will be a little attention.
In addition, the restrictions on international advertising remain strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua, although they had been given a rare description permit.
According to Phelim Kinen, the Asian Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi has not kept his electoral promises; he has not increased transparency or promoted development by removing restrictions on news.
"Indonesia's restless eastern provinces of Papua and Western Pope have new risks: refusing visas and getting on the black list," Kine said in his opinion.
The absence of the freedom of operation of the press means that the Government of Indonesia will only be pressured by neighbours near Papua.
In March, six Pacific States — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands — called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "local and widespread infringements" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting attack.
These countries have traditionally also supported the Papua release movement.
Arrmanatha Nasir, the informant of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, challenged the accusations and told journalists in Jakarta that "Indones are still a democracy with freedom of the press, so the coverage of evidence of human rights violations would be difficult".
The locals want foreign governments to be involved.
When the Dutch official delegation, led by Embassy Kees Van Bar, visited Jayapura on 4.5.2017, the locals broke the silence and expressed their desire for freedom, reports an anonymous source involved in the meeting.
In Indonesia there are presidential elections in 2019, but the beans say that they are probably no longer voting for Jokowi.
"Jokowi means good, but there are people around him who have become involved in the fire attack at Pania," says the Chairman of the tribal council, Gobai.
He wants Jokow to know the situation of the panic: they live under the greedy and unpredictable army in the lack of poverty, in practice without health services and training opportunities.
According to Goba, the panians, like the rest of the beasts, consider the voices given to Jokow as "debted", which must be paid back.
"They don't want money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and frightening, the victims of the Palestinian shooting once again pointed out the resistance symbolically: they buried one of the victims at the police station and the military office in the opposite country.
They know that they may never have justice, but at least they will not let the responsible forget their crimes.
"My family member was killed," says Yacobus in the press.
"What else can we do?"
Dereck Chisora calls for the cancellation of Robert Helenius retreat: "Even though his own fans don't want to see it"
Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisora of a heavy series of boxers were intended to fight on 27 May in Hartwall Island.
However, the match was withdrawn for commercial reasons.
In the recent interview with the IFL TV, Chisora has a reason to flop the replay on Helenius' shoulders.
My game in Finland flopped, but it wasn't my fault.
I don't live in Finland, I don't want to sell tickets there.
It was my Finnish opponent.
Even his fans don't want to see him fight because he's miserable, Chisora's taunting.
Helenius and Chisora first met in the full Hartwall island in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial point sentence.
The ticket sales to the retreat went smoothly, and Nisse Sauerland's proprietor told the evening-Sanom in May that the fight was transferred to autumn.
There's never been anything new about the fight.
However, resignation is no longer annoying Chisora.
In any case, the fight would have probably had to be withdrawn after Chisora was ill.
On Thursday, three days before the time of the fight, I woke up into tough pain.
My daughter was exploding.
The hospital said I had to be cut, Chisora tells me.
Britt says he's in about 45% right now.
He's not interested in the retreat with Helenius, he's targeted by Dillian Whyte.
Chisora suffered a loss to Whyte in December.
It came to repeat the power of the Torch cloudmaker in Dubai
The flames captured the world’s highest-reading residential building in Dubai on Friday. Hundreds of people were forced to escape from a high 79-story building.
This was already another fire within two years of the building called Torch, a torch.
The building was empty and no one is known to have been injured.
"We were sleeping and awakening the fire alarm and the screams of people.
We ran down the stairs from the 50th floor, which took ten minutes," the resident named George told Reuters.
According to the rescue authorities of Dubai, the extinguishing forces were fired at 4 a.m. local time and remained cooling the building.
The government announced that he would arrange accommodation for those who left his home.
The case may ask again questions about the safety of materials used in the outer surfaces of high buildings throughout the world.
After the fire of 2015, the Board of Directors of the Torch building carried out a study indicating that the most damage was suffered by discs used for the screening and insulation of the faeces.
In Britain, the police believe that London’s Grenfell Tower insulating and screening plates could contribute to the rapid progress of flames in a fire that killed 80 people in June.
Stealed from the Joensula parking lot during the night of the mopo
A Joensula parking lot was stolen from mopo on Tuesdays between 21:00 and 5:00 a.m. on Wednesday.
Mopo disappeared from the Nivaria address of Tikkamäentie 2.
Mopo was on the mark of the Sky Team Monkey.
At the colour it's red, and the registration number is 27-REV.
The mopo was found later on Thursday.
The police will request observations on the mopo or its escort by e-mail to this e-mail address is protected from spambots.
You need JavaScript support to see it. Or phone call for police emergency number 0295 415 320.
Modified 3.8.2017 at 12.40: Police informed that the mopo has been found.
In the United States, more than 20% of air travellers take prohibited objects into the machine, reveals a survey
The survey carried out by air passengers reveals that more than 20 % of passengers in the United States had taken unawarely or unaware of unaware of the airborne objects through the U.S. Transport Safety Agency (TSA) inspection points. At least 6 % of passengers had knifes or other steel objects which they knew were not prohibited.
Less than one percent told me he only got to know afterwards that they had been misleading weapons, ammunition or explosives.
The survey responded to more than a thousand passengers and carried out by the Stratos Jet Charters ordering airline, and the results also reveal that young passengers are more likely to violate the rules.
19,7 per cent of passengers aware of the TSA’s rules were members of the Y-generation and less than 15 per cent belonged to the X-generation.
The most common rules were broken by taking food and liquids to the plane.
More than 3 per cent admitted that he was aware of the aeroplane of steel-produced items, and that 2.2 per cent of women and 3.7 per cent of men reported that he was consciously taking prohibited drugs to the aeroplane.
The survey involved passengers from all over the United States. The company that carried out the survey wanted to find out how many of them had accidentally taken the smuggling goods bypassing the security check and how many had done so consciously.
It is not surprising that most passengers are also most likely to pass the security inspection — consciously or without knowing.
However, as the company in question states, the guidelines of the TSA are quite complex and confusional.
Passengers often do not know what fluids can be taken into a plane and how much.
So it's not surprising that most of the TSA's confiscations are liquids.
For some time, there was also a thought that you shouldn't take books to the plane.
They're allowed to take the liquids for flights in the country, but not for international flights.
Scott Pruitt, Director of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, rounded up his decision to delay the decisions taken during the Obama period to reduce emissions
The day after 15 states had challenged Scott Pruitt, the Director of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the Pruitt revoked his previous decision to delay the implementation of decisions to reduce the emissions of smoke.
According to Pruitt, the change shows that the Agency, which he has led, takes better account of the needs of the decision-makers responsible for the environment of the States.
Pruitt did not mention in a word an action against his previous decision in the Federal Court of Petitions.
The state should start to comply with the 2015 level for the ground ozone as of 1.10.
Pruitt announced in June that he would transfer the implementation of decisions to a year so that his agency would have more time to learn about the plan because the Agency would not "intervene in local decision-making or detrimental to economic growth".
Pruitt was the public prosecutor of Oklahoma before President Donald Trump appointed him as head of the EPA.
After coming to Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to prevent or delay the implementation of the decisions against the chemical industry and industry using fossil fuels.
The sudden change of Wednesday's mind is the most recent retreat for the Pruitti's plan to mitigate the provisions.
Last month, the Federal Tribunal in Washington adopted a decision that the Director of the EPA exceeded its powers in attempting to delay the implementation of the Obama Government's decision on oil and gas companies, which obligated companies to monitor and reduce the leakage of metan.
In its opinion on Wednesday night, Pruitt argued that, in relation to the otson provisions of his full translation, it would only strengthen the cooperation of the EPA with the States in a complex process aimed at meeting the new requirements in accordance with the timetable.
"In the past governments, the EPA often failed to comply with the deadlines and then expected the activist groups and others to challenge it to the right to reach agreement on schedules," said Pruitt, who challenged the Environment Agency more than ten times in his previous action.
"We do not believe in the regulation through the trial, and we take the deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the regulation on our activities and its powers to us."
However, the opinion of the EPA noted that Pruitt could continue to exercise "delegate powers to delay the implementation of decisions and other legal powers" in order to ensure that the provisions are "reasonable and based on the best available information".
The Republicans drive a wider change in the Ozone rules in the Congress.
The aim of the legislative initiative adopted last month is to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions for at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted in the Senate.
This week, the General Prosecutor Eric Schneiderman of the State of New York, who led the association of the states that was challenged by the EPA, told that the group was planning to continue pressure.
"The change of the EPA's mind as a result of our complaints is a significant victory for those 6.7 million New York and more than 115 million Americans who are exposed to the direct effects of the smoke rod in their communities," said Schneiderman.
In addition to New York, the action included California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and District of Columbia.
Earth surface ozone occurs when emissions from cars, power plants, oil refiners and chemical plants react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
A smoke node such as this can cause severe difficulty in breathing for sensitive groups, including thousands of premature deaths per year.
Public health promoters and environmentalists welcomed the surprising change in direction of Pruitti.
"It's worrying how much pressure was required to make a guy with our breathing air used a healthy sense," says Lori Ann Burd of the Centre of Biological Diversity.
"We have to fight against Trump's administration, because its ideological aim is to act on conditions for contaminants and other groups who have their own interests."
Supercar manufacturer coming from the street terrain... "becoming in Ferrar style"
It also intends to invest in hybrid sports cars while trying to hold on to its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it will happen in Ferrar's style, the CEO Sergio Marchionne said plans at the press conference on Wednesday.
The details of the new strategy will be revealed next year when the Italian supercar manufacturer presents its new five-year plan, Automotive News news.
All cases of East Savo tumour vaccines of the same type of virus
The coastal mosquito infection is the same type of virus as the previous cases of East Savo, reports the THL.
On Thursday, the Virology Laboratory for Health and Prosperity Institute has ensured that the fifth ash infection in East Savo is the same virus strain with previous infections.
THL has ensured that on Friday, 28 July, a coastal person has been assured of the same type of virus as the previous cases of East Savo.
On the basis of this information, all infections in Eastern Savo are linked to the first ash vaccine detected in the region in June.
News is good, because that means we haven't come up with any other types of anticoagulant virus.
However, it is possible that there may be new infections from the fifth disease until mid-August and that the epidemic is not yet over, says Mirkaleena Erkkilä, a doctor responsible for basic health care diseases.
New infestations of tuberculosis or their suspicions have not been found since the fifth confirmed case.
However, it is still important that everyone take care of the update of their own vaccine protection, Erkkilä reminds us.
Further information on: Three new ash vaccines were secured in Pirkanmaa - "Infections or epidemics are very unlikely"
Finland prepares to make a promise of slide
I don't even think about the sponge soup.
On the basis of the grounds that the process produces booze alongside metanol, which is toxic.
It is legal next year, but the legitimacy of the bouquet's bouquet is not even considered.
The screams will be prepared by fertilizers, again by distillation.
The regulation of distillation is based on the grounds that the process, along with wine, produces methanol, which is toxic.
Political will has not been seen in order to regulate the cooking of the dough as a man’s right, the Government Advisory Office of Ismo Importing the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health commented.
When the Ministry prepared the reform of the alcohol law, the distillation of the straw was not considered to be legalised.
It was also not brought to the political table.
There was no debate on the release of distillation, says MEP Outi Mäkelä (Kok.).
He is in the negotiating group of government delegations who took a position on the reform of the Alcohol Act.
Promise the distillation at home will not continue to be granted even on the application.
Commercial manufacturing will also remain subject to authorisation.
Importation tells us that home production of alcoholic beverages will be subject to a simple rule: alcohol can be manufactured at home by visits.
This means that, in addition to beer, cider and wine at home, you can legally scream.
The government has wanted to simplify the provisions.
The new law removes the requirements of flavourings and flavourings and enables the cooking, Mäkelä refines.
The preparation must still be so that the raw materials or the flavouring and flavouring materials derived from their fermentation are clearly detectable in drinking.
Under the new law, drinks can be prepared as much as you want, and you can give yourself your own alcohol as a gift.
You can't still put it on the sale.
Escape is no longer a public health problem in Finland, The Tuominen believes.
A much greater change occurred in 2004 when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were released.
75% of the alcohol used in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The Alcohol Law is now under the control of the Ministry of Justice.
Alcohol law comes to the Parliament as soon as the September starts.
The plenary session is 5.9.
The law will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It's like the Parliament has already taken a position, and Mäkelä is happy.
Oscar Pistorius was sent to the hospital by armed guards.
Oscar Pistorius, who suffered from breast pains, was sent to the South African hospital because of a heart attack.
Pistorius is already out of the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is in prison in Atteridgeville.
According to the British Mirror magazine, Pistorius was taken from prison to the hospital this morning by armed guards.
Pistorius suffered from chest pain, but he got out of the hospital this afternoon.
The informant at the prison confirmed that Pistorius was taken to the hospital for research.
On the other hand, the informant of the Pistorius family told me that the ex-human athlete is fine.
Last summer, the Supreme Court sentenced the six-fold gold medalist of Paralympicians to prison for six years for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkampi.
Pistorius shot Steenkampi in February 2013.
Littered phone conversations reveal that Trump has pushed Mexico to build a border wall
The littering of phone talks between President Donald Trump and Mexico and Australian leaders has leaked on Washington Post.
Trump called on Mexico President Enrique Peña Nieto at the 27 January 2017 phone discussion to stop public speeches that he would not pay the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States called Nieto for the fact that this had smashed the wall project publicly. "You can't say that to the press," Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential campaign by pledging to build a wall on the southern border of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
Washington Post also published a littering from Trump's first call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, and during the call, there was a tense exchange of speech.
Trump said to Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take refugees on their way to Australia would be "lous", "lous" and "lous". Trump said that the agreement negotiated during Obama would make him look like "idiotic" because he had proposed a ban on the residence of refugees to the United States.
Trump stopped calling by saying to Turnbull that "this was the most unpleasant call all day."
Assassination of Georgia: The activists relaunched racist lynch in the hope of justice
The Ford Mercury-marked car passes the crowd in the small town of Monroe in Georgia and continues its journey towards the small Moore's Ford bridge.
There are four black passengers in the car and a white driver, four armed men blocking the road before the car reaches the bridge.
The leader of the crowd, a middle-aged man dressed in a wireless suit, takes a deep breath of his cigar and bounces through the windscreen.
Passengers are scared.
"Roger, n--u!" the man's shining.
"Get out of the car!"
The screams break silence when a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this shocking event is only a relay that was presented on 22.7.2017.
However, the wrestlings of the shatter are real when the hanging hook is hanged in the neck of "Roger".
Since 2005, the Human Rights Organisations have returned to the Moore's Ford Bridge to resettlement events in 1946. At that time Ku Klux Klan shortened two black-fashioned couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one's been charged with murders.
"It is confusing that no one has been arrested in these years – even though murderers live among us and many must know who they are," says Tyrone Brooks, who helps in the rehabilitation arrangements.
"It is the shame of history, but above all it is a burden that weighs our soul."
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and former Georgian congressman.
To him, the reconstruction is a reluctant call for action, and it also reminds the people of Monroe that injustice has never been corrected.
"We want the culprits to be brought to trial, and we want things to be finally completed, and we want to recover from grief and make reconciliation, but above all we want justice," says Brooks.
"We can't recover and reconciliate before we get justice."
Dead detective covers the body of the dead victim in Georgia's massacre in July 27,46.
According to NBC's news files, more than 50 men were suspected of a lynch in Monroe and the surrounding counties.
But no one was accused of murder.
Although the guilty have been free for decades, activists believe that the causes of the lynch have been known all the time by the locals: politics and sex.
In 1946, the decision of the Supreme Court to vote for the first time in the presidential elections of the state of Georgia, the Supreme Court adopted its decision in April, and the elections were held in the summer.
According to the FBI, there was an incident in the days of the elections, where Roger Malcom, a black lease farmer, stabbed Barnett Hester in a fight with Malcom's wife, apparently Dorothy.
According to Brooks, the city heard Hester had an affair with Dorothy and that Dorothy was expecting this child.
According to the FBI, a powerful white landlord, Loy Harrison, on 25 July46, paid Malcom's $600 guarantees against which he was released from prison.
On the way home, with Malcom and Dorothy, their cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The crowd stopped their car before Moore's Ford Bridge.
"There has been evidence that Harrison ordered and arranged for murders," says the FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local authorities; the authorities were involved in murders and destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks is making it more central.
"It was a right to vote," he says.
"They were murdered because they wanted to tell the black men that the same thing would happen to them if they were going to vote."
Cassandra Greene has been in charge of the reconstruction of the massacre in Georgia for almost a decade.
The proposal is extremely realistic and imprisonable, a description of the shocking racism that many would like to believe that the US has already disappeared today.
It's hard to watch the show, but it's even harder not to see what Greene says it's meant to be.
"We don't want to talk about lynch because we have to meet our own dark sides," says the director.
"But I can't create a relationship with you if you don't hear me or you don't want to hear what I've been through."
This year’s performance began in June. On the first day, about 30 actors — a dozen of black men and twenty whites — met to listen to Greene’s routine summary of the presentation.
Wade Marbaugh is the assistant manager of Greene.
He has presented the local leader of Ku Klux Klan in the reconstruction for years, but the role is always as difficult and disgusting.
"I feel dirty because I'm not myself," Marbaugh tells me.
"It is important, however, that this side of history will be kept out so that it will never happen again."
On the other side of the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona are trained by Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester.
The show starts with a scene where Malcom screams and pushs Hester, and he's mad about having a relationship with Dorothy.
"Don't you hear me?
Rascona, Hester.
Then let's hit it.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) will squeeze in laughter.
Greene laughs the hardest.
"What?" Rascona asks.
He's confused.
"Did I accidentally hit too hard?" he asks.
"Not", Greene's weakening.
"I just don't think the white people used the word n--u."
"Yes," another black actor confirms.
"It's slang, you need to use a longer version."
The subject of the performance is unpleasant, but the room is powered by a guy's spirit.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just because of the show, and they want to respect the memory of those who have been killed.
The scene begins at the beginning.
Now, Rascona's words stand up.
No one's laughing.
The reconstruction will end quickly and violently.
Scream, shots... and silence.
A woman dressed in black funeral stands next to the bodies and sings Billie Holiday's Strange Fruit.
His voice breaks every second word.
A few ten yards away, fifty viewers wipe sweats and tears from their eyes.
Almost half of the audience is black and half white.
There's a couple who's come to see a show from Ithaca in New York, but most of them are local.
They have visited Brooks' guide to the graves of the victims in the pressuresome moisture of Georgia.
Murders have become true of the story.
After the song show, Greene will invite the crowd to check the bodies.
Children are stalking to watch artificial blood and unmoved bodies and whispering to each other.
"They're not really dead," the little boy mutts like to remind himself of himself.
In a few minutes, Greene thanks the audience.
The actresses who played the coincidents take off their robes and wipe tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man who presented the local Ku Klux Klan.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors and then pours out into tears after a tough show.
"It's all right," a woman who was involved in the presentation comforts me.
"We know you're not him.
You did this for a good reason."
Later, the audience and the actors will meet for a common dinner.
A white couple arrived from Altanta discusses the presentation with a black-hole couple that he has just met.
Denise Duplins too is hard to find words when he describes the feelings raised by the performance.
"It's hard to listen to terrible words and look at terrible things that say and do people who look the same as you – just because they look the same as you," he says.
"I've got the show to notice that the lynics are still happening," he added. "They're just called arrests."
On the other side of the room, Brooks recalls the development of civil rights to listeners sitting on the same table.
He's already told me he started planning the next year's show.
"The new resistance is a powerful experience because it describes the horrors we've experienced, but it is also a teaching experience," says Brooks.
"The message is that this can happen again if we don't learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are condemned to repeat it."
Ripping growth in stores sparks: To this extent, removing "overall parts" really saves
Is it allowed to remove the flower cabbage leaves already in the store before weighing?
What about taking away the big hat from the pineapple? Doesn't it weigh how much?
The answer is strongly shared with the opinions: one of them is a sign of the drainage that has been drained, while others do not want to pay for the parts that are not used and yet go home to the trash.
Well, they're gonna know what's going on in the stores.
For example, there are boxes of paper in the K-Citymarket of the Helsinki Ruoholahde, because many of them, for example, are ripping off the parts of the flower cabbage.
From the box, the leaves will be traded in biowaste.
According to the news published by the economic statements, sniffing in vegetables is astonishing traders.
But how much is the removal of additional parts of vegetables before weighing really saving money?
How important is the means of drowning really?
We women tested how the price would change when they took off the leaves or strains of pineapple, latva, potatoes, broccoli and flower cakes.
Flower cabbage: €2.10 for flower cabbage was EUR1.80 when all the leaves were shelled.
Ananas: the price of the total pineapple paid by EUR 2.30 fell to EUR 1.95 when its stock was withdrawn.
Latva Artisokka: €2.60 price became €2.40 when the short-term stock was cut off.
Two delicious skirts cost me a total of 75 cents.
Without the stocks, the price was 60 cents.
Broccoli: Medium-sized broccoli cost 1 euro and no stock of 80 cents.
Final result: If leaves and strains go off, saves a few decades of cents at the top of one vegetables.
As a percentage, the price of vegetables fell by up to 20%.
So the total cost of these purchases would have been EUR 1.20!
Neymar was bought out of Barcelona - the box star concluded a five-year agreement with the PSG
The Brazilian Legislator Neymar has concluded a five-year agreement with the French football club PSG, reports AFP.
Previously on Thursday night, Neymar’s representatives had paid the EUR 222 million out buying-in price to the FC Barcelona in the Spanish League.
The maximum transfer amount of EUR 222 million is football history.
In the past, the record was in Manchester United, which last summer paid EUR 105 million for the French Paul Pogba.
The Spanish League brake the transfer earlier on Thursday, when it rejected the first payment company of Neymar representatives.
The company buying under the rules of the League cannot pay the buying-in price directly to the seller, but the player himself has to buy out his contract, which happens by recycling money through the league.
In practice, the PSG has paid the sum to Neymar and its representatives who delivered the money through the league to Barcelona.
They think Neymar's coming to Paris on Friday.
He may be introduced to a new home audience at the opening of the PSG period against Amiens on Saturday.
Uefa examines the details
Barcelona also informed of the payment of information to Uefa, the European Football Union, in order to determine any disciplinary measures arising from the case.
Among other things, Javier Tebas, President of the Spanish League, has suspected the PSG's infringinging the rules of the Uefa's economic fair game.
Uefa may be punished as a result of a loss of more than EUR 30 million over three years.
According to Uefa, Neymar's transfer does not automatically break its economics.
The transfer of Neymar to PSG affects the monitoring economy for several years, but the effect cannot be assessed in advance.
For example, PSG may sell a number of players with significant sums, Uefa was informed.
The PSG owns a state-owned Qatar Sports Investment.
Former tennis professional, Chairman of the Society, Nasser al-Khelaifi.

I was just asking if he's alive. Austin's sister, Autumn, says.
Austin spent two weeks at the hospital.
In addition to the flares, he had muscle damage and cerebral haemorrhage.
The experience was hard for the whole family.
You can't wait for that.
It's traumatic for everyone, Autumn tells you.

Pearson reduces 3,000 jobs and revives business by cutting dividend
The British Training Group Pearson announced on Friday that he would reduce 3,000 jobs and cut the dividend by 72% in response to the new restructuring programme to the pressures on his business.
According to John Fallon, job reductions are made mainly at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019.
Pearson announced that he would re-cost with £300 million in May as part of his third savings programme aimed at revitalising the deteriorated business as a result of rapid digitalisation.
Last month, Pearson decided to sell its share of Penguin Random House to his partner, Bertelsmann, and the company announced to keep his prospect of the current year, with its turnover increased by 1% in the first half of the year and was GBP 2.05 billion.
Assault in Kabul: NATO's soldier died in a suicide attack.
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan in Kabul, and according to the authorities, he was killed by a NATO soldier and several others were wounded.
According to the NATO statement, five soldiers and interpreter were injured in the attack.
According to unconfirmed local data, three civilians also died in the attack in Kabulin Qarabagh region.
The explosion is the last violent attack in Afghanistan this month, and on Tuesday, 30 people were killed in a mosque explosion in Herat.
On Monday, two people died at a suicide bomber attack in the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO's statement, a Thursday night explosion occurred when the joint patrol patrol of NATO and Afghan Army was attacked by an attack by a "person carrying a self-propelled explosive device".
The opinion stated that everyone injured was stable and treated at the US Military Hospital at Bagram airport.
According to correspondents, the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of the ISIS terrorist organization in Qarabagh are important concerns for NATO troops near Bagram.
According to the United Nations, at the first half of 2017, at least 1662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan, of which 20% in the capital.
At the end of July, the car bomb killed at least 30 people in Kabul in the area of suicide, mainly in Siiamuslims.
The Taliban announced that he was behind the attack.
On the last day of May in the centre of Kabul, more than 150 people died in a bombing attack, which was the most disastrous attack of the militant group in the country after the United States' commanded forces deployed from the Taliban in 2001.
Violence underlines the unstable situation in Afghanistan when President Donald Trump is considering whether the United States will send more troops to the country to help the local army and the police.
According to correspondents, suicide attacks in Kabul over the last few weeks have also significantly weakened the trust of people in the government, its policies, and in particular President Ashraf Ghan.
The EPA will make its decision to postpone the implementation of the smoke summit provisions
The United States Agency for the Environmental Protection of the EPA has taken its decision to delay the implementation of the decisions to reduce the emissions of smoke during the Obama administrative period after 15 states had challenged the Agency’s court.
The EPA announced its decision on the implementation of the so-called ozone definitions in 2015 late Wednesday, according to the Agency, a sign of its commitment to cooperation with the States.
"We believe in dialogue and we want to respond to the needs of the states," said Scott Pruitt in the opinion of the Agency.
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of the Agency to postpone the implementation of ozone determinations for one year to October 2018.
On Tuesday, the Agency challenged 15 states mainly controlled by democrats, including District of Columbia, according to which the postponement of implementation was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration has sought ways to mitigate the environmental rules of Barack Obama. Trump says that the measures are part of a broader programme for economic growth.
The measures of Trump have been opposed by democrats and environmentalists who are concerned about the health effects of the increase in emissions.
According to the website of the EPA, air breathing containing ozone "may weaken lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" such as as as asthma.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, the person who belonged to fathers' leadership had also sent parts of the bomb to Sydney.
The suspects suggest that the bomb was to be taken to the plane on 15 July, but the company was interrupted before the security check was carried out.
The police won't tell us more about why the company stopped.
Another plan for suspected terrorists was to build a toxic non-coloured gas extractive device and to take the device to a public place, such as the public transport device.
Australian Federal Assistant Commissioner Michael Phelan says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans that have ever been made in Australia.
Due to suspected terrorist plans, four men were captured in police racials on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interviews are also continuing.
Fluid Managing Director: Renewable fuels managed well
The oil processor Neste's result before taxes fell, but it hit the forecasts in the second quarter.
According to Managing Director Matti Lievose, the company produced a good result in oil products, the sales volumes of renewable products increased to the record level and the development of the marketing & Services segment was in the right direction.
Last year, Blenders Tax Credit tax relief improved the comparable operating profit.
According to Lievos, the operating profit for renewable products remained at a good level this year thanks to higher sales volumes and more favourable markets, even though the tax relief ended.
The implementation of our strategy is going well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects and we will complete the strategic investments we have already notified in 2017, Lievonen said in the press release.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lotšenko are discussing a possible match at their first meeting.
Vasyl Lomatšenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be at a collision course for the most interesting boxing match for the near future of less than 66.7 kilograms, met each other on Thursday.
The men were in their own rooms in the ESPN Sports Channel premises in Los Angeles until WBC's undefeated light series master Mikey Garcia walked through the hallway to greet the master of the WBO's superior feather series.
On Saturday, Garcia won the showtime with the unanimous decision of the former four-weight world champion, Adrien Broner, and then Garcia and Lomatšenko have been among the five best in the list of different-weighted boxers.
Garcia handed his right hand and said, "How's it going, Master?
Good luck with the fight!"
Lomatšenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on the ESPN channel at 7th Saturday.
When the two poseered for photographers, the manager of Lotšenko, Egis Klimas, pointed out that the fight between men would be "superfixed to the scoops".
"I'm a former feathersman," Garcia reminded me.
"I pulled a series above [63.5 kg] for Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm a small size of 63,5 kg.
I want to go back to the light series.
He has to get into the light series [61.2 kg] and then we can fight.
That's what our fans want.
Let's fill their wishes."
Lotšenko agreed.
"The boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked whether the fight should be arranged on payment channels, as part of his strategy for Lotšenko, according to which Lotšenko debytoes later this year and fights next summer against Garcia (37-0, 30 stroke wins). Garcia would also be interested to meet the winner of the fight between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell. Linares and Campbell will be in the spring series in Forum on 23 September.
"The fight could be on the pay channel because the fans have asked for it," Garcia said and later announced he was ready to fight on a channel that offers the best prize package.
"We are the most interesting names.
No one else gets that much attention.
I'll be fine as soon as we get to the deal.
Garcia said he appreciated Lotšenko as "unbelievable fighter" and maybe he was going to see the Saturday fight.
Lotšenko interrupted Garcia's screaming and said that this three-weight master from Riverside looked like "true slow." Sorry, Mike... but you needed that knockout.
Garcia said she was focusing on displaying the force and then boxing.
The men said they felt that the fight between them was being desired to be more and more effective.
"This is the fight we're waiting for.
None of the other fights attract equal attention and interest.
I'm definitely involved in this case," said Garcia.
Lotšenko said she was waiting for her to fight the best. "Mikey's a legend.
It's gonna be a great fight."
Mean salary EUR 5 300, education what happens - the situation of investment counselling was "funny and free"
The quality of investment counselling has spoken a lot lately.
Last time the Sanomat of Helsinki told Ritva, 68 to whom the investment counselor of the banker shop spoke full bunny when selling investment products.
The rules on the sale of investment advisers and various investment products will be tightened at the beginning of next year.
These increases are based on a new Financial Markets Directive, which will be applied from the beginning of next year.
Currently, the assessment of the skills of investment counselors and employees selling investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.
There are no knowledge requirements specified in the law.
The financial sector itself recommends that those working in the investment service carry out its own APV1 or APV2 qualification.
The financial sector has authorityd the organisation of qualifications for APV investment studies for a company called Oy, whose degree work group is seated by experts from the Financial Supervision (Fiva), universities and industry.
The degrees are 12-15 points of study and their exams are produced by Aalto EE, Aalto University Executive Education Ltd.
Its website says that, in general, both exams are "very large in terms of requirements".
Competence material includes 10-15 books and numerous other guides and works.
Markku Savikko, CEO of APV investment studies, tells us that the percentage of exams is roughly estimated at about 70.
Of the staff of the largest banks, mostly, all those providing investment services have carried out either APV1 or APV2 because it is mandatory to carry out them according to their own rules.
Then there are smaller bankruptcies without mention of names whose staff appear to have been mapled to complete qualifications, says Saviko.
He says that there are "other" cases of bankruptcy.
According to Saviko, 13 000 to 14 000 people have completed the APV1 degree since 2000 and a more demanding APV2 degree for investment counselors has been recommended by approximately 3 000 people.
Some banking operations consider the qualification to be an advantage.
In several other sectors there are considerably stricter skills requirements.
According to Savikko, the Financial Sector Recommendation requires APV qualifications to be completed, since it is the case that investment-related expertise is ensured.
According to the Statistics Finland, financial and investment advisors make a number of thousands of euros per month, including commissions, incorporating income premiums.
The average monthly period of regular working hours is approximately EUR 5 300.
On average, men working in the field make more than EUR 5 900 per month and women, respectively, more than EUR 4 500.
On average, the tenth earner earns about 8 100 euros.
The dozens of the most earning men deserve more than EUR 9 000 per month or more, a tenth of the most earning women earns EUR 6 400 or more.
Investment advice under the Investment Service Act can only be provided by an authorised company.
Self-regulation has so far been trusted at the level of workers and duties.
According to Fiva, the audit carried out by it received individual cases where the skills and qualifications of the investment counsellor were not sufficient on the basis of the advisor’s activities.
In principle, as a retailer of investment products can also act even if skills and qualifications are at a low level.
In this respect, the situation has been wild and free.
In several other sectors there are considerably more stringent skills requirements, says Savikko.
According to Saviko, from the beginning of next year, this will result in tightening up with the new Financial Markets Directive (MiFID II).
This requires that each company shall be responsible for the adequate skill of the personnel providing investment services.
Financial supervision should, in turn, be empowered to determine what to know.
The Fiva Market Supervisor, Marko Hovi, says that one of the clear changes to the current legislation is the requirements of the knowledge and experience of investors and retailers of investment products.
According to the Court, the new requirements concern both the staff of investment firms and related agents who sell products on behalf of a company.
The Court tells us that, according to the Government of the Ministry of Finance, Fiva may be empowered to determine knowledge and experience.
From what they are exactly, they will be decided with these visions during the coming autumn.
The company must also continue to ensure the necessary training and, if necessary, monitoring and further training.
This is all to be documented, and the company has a duty to demonstrate that this is also the case.
The Court explains that, in practice, the company must, for example, map the work of the staff at individual level.
This will certainly result in different levels of demand depending on whether it is investment advice or on the sale of products.
According to the court, it is also a requirement to work with a more experienced person in the time period if the knowledge or experience is not sufficient.
So if the company hires a new employee who does not fully meet the specified criteria, the employee must work with a person fulfilling the criteria for a certain period.
According to the court, the change leads to tightening and concreteing the rules.
The legislation on the sale of investment products will be tightened at the beginning of 2018.

Imatra’s stubborn beach schoolers do not be tempted by rain or sun’s roast - Iines Kaiknen’s polski with the help of the bathing village
Iines Kaikkonen went on a good pace, Taina Itkonen followed.
Imatra beach suburbs go around Liette and Lempuka this and next week.
Although it rains and then shines, the young swimmers are not a mess, says Taina Itkonen, the guide of swimming schools.
In swimming schools this week, 13 children are acquainted with swimming skills, next week by a dozen.
The number of children in the next week was influenced by the fact that school and escar, it was estimated by Itkonen.
In cooperation, Imatra Coast School organises the exercise of a joint project and the city of Imatra.
On Thursday, Liette's swimming pool had a nice atmosphere.
The sun shined and the young swim schoolers trained to stay on the surface with swimsuits, even without one.
Smaller sisters also enjoyed water.
Iines of Kaiko, 5, first thought to go deeper into the water.
However, Taina Itkonen encouraged him to pollute toward the beach.
It's going great!
Iines Kaikkonen told me that he used to swim a lot this summer.
She's good at her swimsuit.
Like Iines Kaikkonen, with a swimsuit village, she was swiming hard to practice, Vili Huhtanen, 5.

Millions of Lukkonen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread the towels to the dock, snapped fruits and shined the day.
In the water, teaching continued, but the dock wasn't busy.

An unknown soldier sells toilet brushes, "This is such a combining story."
You see all kinds of things like that.
The Sini product, which manufactured cleaning products, lanseered the unknown military product series a few days ago.
I mean, dish brushes and washing sets, and "wc brush on the edge brush."
An unknown soldier refers to the film and the marketing of a movie that he receives in the first night in this autumn.
However, there is something special in the combination, and the products have been cut off in social media: When will they come to know-to-health?
I need to call the company and ask what this is all about.
What does Aino Määät say?
We're a partner in the movie.
We're supporting this movie, like a lot of other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and cult film, Määtta says.
According to him, the products are specialized in movements, and the film is thus visible.
Isn't this a little funny, often when you think that products and related stories have something in common?
Yes, there is such a combining story that we are a Finnish operator and these are Finnish products, Määtta says.
According to him, the company supports the same basic Finnish values that are supported by those who have seen an old unknown soldier.
And cleaning up isn't a stranger to military culture, Määtta says.
Other partners in the military film include, for example, Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
So far, Hartwall's vichyes have been introduced on the market, which are found in the name of Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela.
Unidentified products have already been posted by a blogger in the Finnish Picture Magazine, Kalle Kinnunen
There are already coffee and watches available.
Kinnunen points out that there's still time for the first night of the movie, so there's still time to go on.
The unknown partners have not yet revealed their war products, such as Valio, Processor, Neste and German retail chain Lidl, Kinnunen.
New results of age tests for Swedish asylum seekers were published
The results of the tests carried out by the new assessment method reveal that the test has been determined to be more than 80% of those over 18 years of age. However, not everyone considers the tests to be reliable.
The Swedish National Judicial Medicines Agency launched a test earlier this year.
Tests can be evaluated more closely than the age of the asylum seeker. A new test was introduced after the assessment of the Swedish Immigration Agency that it had failed to determine the actual age of applicants who claimed that he was a minor.
To date, the Immigration Agency has conducted 6 880 tests, and the Agency has now published the results of 2 481 tests.The tests were carried out between March and July in 2017.
The 80% of the tests, i.e. the 2002 asylum seeker, was determined to be more than 18 years old, and in 25 cases, the Judicial Medicine Agency determined that the test was "possibly 18 years old or older".
In 432 cases, the result was that the asylum seeker is "possibly under 18 years old".
The tests were only carried out in cases where there was reason to suspect the age indicated by the applicant.
Johan Göransson’s Legal Medicines Agency tells us that the results are consistent with the results of previous months.
"The figures are quite uniform. Big differences in statistics in the previous months are not detectable," he told The Local.
Although a large proportion of applicants were determined to be more than 18 years old, it does not necessarily mean that applicants lied to their age.
In May, the Agency published 581 results of the test and announced that in 442 there were "referencing that it was 18 years old or older".
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the same results, it was found that in 243 cases the applicant had openly informed him that he would meet for 18 years this year.
The medical age assessment method used in the tests takes X-rays of wisdom teeth and magnetic screenings of knee pencils, and then dentists and radiologists analyse the images, and the method is also critical.
One of the suspects is endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinian Institute, whose work involves an assessment of human biological maturity.
"I have had reason to think about it, and I think that the method used is not the right way.
Determination of a biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we are certainly unable to determine the age, we should not pretend that we can do it," he said to the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, it can be said that the risk of determining the child as an adult is small.
The risk is the highest in a situation where the test will soon meet 18 years, and then the risk will be around 10%."
Ilonen collapsed 30 places in Scotland
Five more than a pair of results in the third round, Mikko Ilose spent 30 pieces with a score slider downwards in a golf European tour competition in Scotland.
At the end of the round, Ilonen left for Saturday at the 11th place, but it was found at 41.
There was a double-bog accumulation with Ilosse in a heavy bowl of three bogs.
The other people had a hard time, too.
Ian Poulter, an English man, rose up to share the top position in one of the few rounds, even though he said that there was plenty of work in the umbrella lengths.
Keli was cruel, but I hanged with him, and finally the day was good, Poulter tuum.
He shares the top place with his countrymen Callum Shinkwin and an Australian Andrew Dodt.
Western Virginia Governor is changing the party
On Thursday night, the democratic governor in West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced that Trump's campaign event would change the party.
"Democratics simply rejected me," Justice said.
"Today, after many prayers and thorough reflection, I will tell the West Virginia that I can no longer help you as governor of the Democrats."
The audience broke out of the rampant popularity.
Tomorrow, as a member of the Republican Party registered, Justice added.
As a coach, I would tell you that it's time for a new game.
Trump earlier promised that a significant announcement would be made at the Western Virginia campaign event.
Trump won 42 points in West Virginia because Justice did not support the candidate of the Democrats Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected governor in 2016. According to Forbes, he is the only billionaire in his state.
He inherits a mining company from his father and owns carbon mines in five states.
His property is worth about $1.59 billion.
On Thursday night, the National Committee of the Republics (RNC) published an opinion that "Current Justice's party exchange is a new attack on the democratic party, which would rather build obstacles than better America."
"The Democrats have only 15 governors and less states than ever before. In this situation, the Declaration of Justice is the last refusal of the party that has no leadership and cannot find a positive message that connects people", said Ronna McDaniel, a representative of the RNC, in his opinion to the CBS news.
Lightning sowing damage - Thursday coming up even in the summer's very thundering day
In the end of the week, we also get more thunders in South Finland.
Over the past week, it has been thirsty, especially in the central and northern parts of the country, as well as in the region of Warsaw-Suomi.
On Wednesday to Thursday, lightning attacks triggered several fires.
According to the meteorologist, Thursday may become a very thundering day for this summer.
The skulls have finally found Finland.
During the last week, it has been flashing especially in the central and northern parts of the country, as well as in the region of Warsaw Finland.
At the table, the lightning hit the electric center of the line house, causing a small fire.
The Rescue Department received an announcement of the fire about 15 minutes before midnight on Wednesday.
The electric center was located in the sauna mode at the end of the line house.
The rescue plant purged the roof and the walls to find the fire batteries and blew the fire off.
A total of 11 apartments were left without electricity, but persons were avoided.
On the other hand, the lightning set the outer building on fires before midnight on Harjulant.
When the rescue plant arrived, the building was already at a full stage of fire, and the rescue department could only prevent the spread of the fire.
An outer building of about 50 square feet burned down.
By the way of the coop, the lightning hit the homehouse.
The people of the house were outside the building and witnessed a stamping flash.
The Rescue Department was there to check the case, but this time, the lightning didn't get the fire, only a few meltings flipped.
In traffic, thunder caused problems on the train track between the Seinäjoki and Vaasa when the lightning strike damaged the traffic control system.
The data on the error was received between 8 and 9 Thursday morning, after which the trains were replaced by buses.
The problem could not be resolved until just before five afternoons.
Since then, rail transport has been able to continue normally with the bulk rail section of the thunder.
Lightning has sown destruction across Finland.
However, lightning has been very small this summer.
These thunderstorms of this summer have been totally infinite! reviewed by the Air Science Institute's modern-friendly meteorologist Jari Tuovinen.
The midweek and Thursday thunderstorms have been mostly moderate in their strength, but thanks to the small lightning storage of the summer, too, it feels even strong for many.
This might feel like a real hard man, but that's what it's been like compared to this summer's thighs, Tuovinen says.
On Wednesday, landscapes blew up 1700 times, and on Thursday even the hardest summer thunder day: around 16 o’clock there were 1 790 landscapes in the plaque.
If the lightning continues to the beginning of the night, then you can reach more than two thousand lightning, the Tuovinen predicts.
The previous record weak womb year was experienced in 2015, when the lightning volume of the year was about 30,000 copies.
By Wednesday, this year's lightning count had risen to 18,386 lightning.
That is why it is still important that this year does not break the two-year guaranteed "review".
However, a squirrel can wait for it to continue.
According to the Court, the air mass above Finland will also remain warm and wet during the end of the week, which is a suitable birth environment for thunders.
The main weight of the Ukkos is to move from the norther parts of the country to the south by Saturday and Sunday, where some 2,000 lightning days can be obtained.
There's a more united rainbow in the middle of the country.
In such a way, according to Tuovis, it only thunders with fewer people.
Coe praises Russia's "open-minded" apology for the doping scandal
The World Sports Commander, Sebastian Coe, praised the apology that Russia submitted on Thursday, because of the Dopingskandaal, but Coe added that it was not yet time to stop the ban on Russia.
Dmitri Shljahtin, Russian General Sports Director, said at the IAAF Congress on Thursday, that the ban received by Russia is appropriate and that he intends to fight decisively against doping.
He said he was sorry for "all the athletes that were taken from the races of gold or silver medal."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of the extension of the ban. Russia was excluded from general sports competitions in November 2015 after the World Antidoping Office WADA report provided evidence of the state's support for doping in Russia.
"I think that his response today was very straightforward; it was a very open-minded presentation," Coe, President of the IAAF, told the journalists.
"The whole Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Association of General Sports admitted that the country had been through difficult times and announced that they would do everything they could to reorganise its activities."
Coe also said that he was "satisfactory" to accept the conditions for terminating the ban.
"I think that we had a very constructive day and progress has been made, but the Congress supports the working group's recommendation that this is not the time to stop the Russian ban," said Coe.
"In the coming months, we must do everything we can to normalise the situation.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes separate from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes compete with the status of a neutral athlete in London at the MM competitions on Friday. They have met the strict criteria of the IAAF.
Rune Andersen, Director of the IAAF Working Group, said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet many requirements before its position can be restored.
"The test is still insufficient, and the trainers who have been banned are still free to operate," he told the journalists to the IAAF Council on Friday after his presentation in London.
Production company disappointed the weak success of the Tom of Finland film
The Tom of Finland did not succeed as the authors wished, says Yle.
If honestly they say, I am disappointed, acknowledges that the film was produced by Helsinki Film in an interview by Annika Sucksdorff Yle.
I was afraid the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it seems it is.
The film received its first night in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached a fair 100 000 viewers, which is about five million euros, compared to the budget of the film.
There's no lottery win, but now it's important that investors get theirs back.
If the movie had been more successful in the country, they would have already gotten their money.
Now, we have to wait for small streams of foreign distribution, Sucksdorff says.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukoske.
How the soccer financial rules affect Neymar's transfer to Paris
The provisions restricting the use of European soccer euros do not prevent Neymar from Spain to Barcelona to France Paris Saint-Germain, which is the most expensive player transfer in football.
Its possible sanctions for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) will be decided by a European football-regulating UEFA, which can prevent team participation in a respected Master League.
In 2011, UEFA introduced fair game economic rules, according to which PSG must be able to demonstrate that Neymar's transfer has been financed without major losses.
EUR 222 million was paid to Barcelona for the conclusion of the Brazilian agreement, and Neymar’s annual salary in the new company is moving in tens of millions.
The transfer of Neymar to France has a wide range of economic aspects.
The PSG has no difficulty paying the amount of Neymar's transfer and attaching it to its Stargate, as it follows the funding of the wealth of the ruler of the Qatar oil.
They are allowed to use large amounts to buy players, but they need to be balanced with real sources of income in order to avoid loss of football-related business.
The economic rules of the fair game were drawn up as Chairman of the UEFA in 2007 on the initiative of the French Michel Platin.
As a former footballer, Platini believed that the pursuit of success with debt was a fraud and led to serious problems if banks or owners supported it.
In 2011, the focus of the fair game's economic rules moved from the debts of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses.
The change meant that the first business model used by Roman Abramovich in Chelsea in 2003 was significantly difficult. Abramovich bought a promising team, used huge sums for players' procurement and created a global brand.
The current three-year period of evaluation of fair game economic rules lasts until 2018, during which the members may make a loss of up to EUR 30 million.
Although Platin had to leave the President of the UEFA’s duties scandalously in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, also, wishes to control the use of the clubs in a modest manner.
"The rules of fair game are still in place, and we will apply them in the future," Andrea Traverso, which was responsible for the economic rules of fair game in UEFA, told the Associated Press News Office last week.
Although the PSG paid Neymar out of his contract with one-off compensation, it may aggregate the amount in accounting for the entire duration of his new contract.
Neymar has concluded a five-year agreement, so the transfer amount can be recorded at EUR 44.4 million per year for the next five years.
On the basis of the economic rules of the fair game, the first sanctions were allocated in 2014. The main sanctions were imposed on the PSG and the Manchester City financed by Abu Dhab.
PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million, which was later reduced to EUR 20 million, and the follow-up was also ordered to limit its group of Mestaries to 21 players for the period 2014-2015 instead of 25 players.
The UEFA observes events that may attempt to circumvent its economic rules by increasing its income through companies associated with the owners of the company.
For example, if the Qatari company supports the PSG, but the value of the aid is considered to be higher than the normal level of the market, the UEFA does not calculate the aid as a real result.
This was the case when UEFA decided in 2014, that the support of the Qatar Tourism Authority for PSG had been exaggerated.
It has also been shown that some of Neymar's merits in the PSG could be financed by payments available from the Qatar 2022 MM Competition Arrangement Commission.
However, the PSG and the Arrangement Commission have denied that Neymar would be expected to make a MM competition ambassador.
Due to the previous sanctions of the PSG, the UEFA will also monitor more firms by circumventing the rules.
On Thursday, the sources from the situation reported that UEFA had not negotiated with the PSG on Neymar's transfer.
The sources provided an interview to the Associated Press News Office on the condition that their identity is not revealed because they do not have the power to discuss the situation of the PSG.
According to the latest published accounts, the net sales of PSG for the period 2015-2016 amounted to EUR 542,4 million and operating profits exceeding EUR 10 million.
The accounts of the last period have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to attract new sponsors and increase the sales of follow-up products and gaming shirts.
The follow-up estimates that its turnover will increase by at least 30 % in the context of the Neymar Agreement.
The Spanish league, clearly irritated from leaving the world's best players, tried to make Neymar's move difficult, allegedly breaching the economic rules of the fair game.
"This is a clear economic doping case for both the company and the state," Javier Tebas, President of the Spanish League, said to the Spanish AS newspaper, referring to the qatari ownership of the PSG.
Arsenal's manager, Arsenene Wenger, also, has reservations about the fact that the state finances the activities of the football club. Arsenal's owned an American sports bay.
"The meeting is the result of ownership that has changed the football environment in the last 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"Everything is possible after the state owns a football team.
It will be very difficult to comply with the economic rules of a fair game. There are so many interests that relate to the popular player representing the state."
It is now urgent: Finnish MM athletes coach in Helsinki
Long-term jumper Arttu Pajulahde and a threesomer Kristiina Mäkelä coach Suren Ghazaryan is stuck in Helsinki, even though he should train general sports at MM contests in London.
Kristiina Mäkelä may have to compete without the counsel of his coach.
The Pajulaht will compete tomorrow at the long-standing slope and Mäkelä on Saturday at the trillion.
However, the dual coach, Armenian Ghazaryan, has not received a visa to Great Britain.
Ghazaryan has tried to deal with this in the British embassy without any results.
The coach has a call from the MM organisers as a document, but it has not been able to obtain a visa either.
I wonder if this is the first symptoms of Brexit, or what, coaching director Jorma Kemppainen said.
He has always successfully handled visa matters in the past, but now there are some problems.
He's doing everything he can to get there.
Ghazaryan has worked for SUL for years.
It doesn't matter that much.
As long as someone looks at the stadium's steps, Arttu Pajulahti said that his coach could be removed.
MM medal for Finland from London requires a miracle
The MM competitions for general sports will start in London today on Friday and will last at the end of the fair week on Sunday 13 August.
General sports, terrain skiing and hockey are the species that Finnish bench sports like to be passionate from year to year, whether successful or not.
The success in the hearts of the bench athletes is measured in medals.
Of course, there are other meters.
Less attention will be paid to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from value races to one where the experience of getting the athlete’s performance to the level that the MM medal of adults is genuinely possible.
Now there are no such young athletes in the small MM team in Finland, although they are neither.
A MM medal for Finland requires a miracle.
Fortunately, the interest and surprise of sport are the fact that miracles can happen.
It draws the bench athletes to the television screen and glue to follow the races, even though the London medals are solved due to the difference of time only in the evening.
For the previous MM races of general sports 2015 Finland received one bronze medal.
It was brought by Tero Longmäki, the shoe thrower.
The dares are still waiting for a long-standing medal, even though others tell the results of his and other throwers in recent times and the stay of Long-standing at the value races of last summer.
Whatever happened in these races, Longmäki will remain in history as a great Finnish sports hero.
For other Finnish athletes in the races, access to the final competition or making their own records is sufficiently good.
Hope and belief in the realistic medal hunt of Finland’s general sports in the coming years will provide good success in the international value races of young people this summer.
The processing of young talents and the financial support of their work is more important than maintaining a small group of elites of representative athletes.
The success will not come in a moment, but requires years of sweating work from athletes and patience from both trained and bench sportsmen.
Finns also appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
Hopefully, London’s races will remain in history as the races of Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, not because of the fear or miserable attacks of terrorism.

Viking Linen's new fast-track ship blew into the harbour in Helsinki
Viking's new fast-training FSTR is badly late for the schedule.
The Pika ship was supposed to leave Helsinki to Tallinn at 18:00.
In eight countries, loading was underway.
The ship came to Helsinki late.
At least a half-hour I've been waiting for you to get on board.
Now the car line moves a little, the Estonian John Rebane, who was waiting for access to the ship at the Helsinki harbour at 7:30 p.m.
Rebane thought the new ship had become a technical error.
Rebane told me that the shipping company had brought water bottles waiting for the ship.
Viking's head of communication, Christa Grönlund, tells IS that there was a technical error.
It was repaired at the Helsinki harbour.
The ship leaves Helsinki for a few hours late.
Grönlund says that the ship will also be late for a couple of hours from the return trip to Tallinn.
The ship was to return from Tallinn to Helsinki at 20.15 a.m.
42 metres of special transport disrupts traffic in the 6th Thursday night
42 metres long special transport from the alien to the Mustolan port during Thursday night.
The shipment leaving 9 should be there by 11:00 a.m.
Police are running traffic on 6th, and traffic may be stopped periodically.
The transport from the dam is moving along the 13th road to the Mustolan harbour.
Nostalgia of the small circle: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
At the same time, the story swings both the great days of the 80s and the '90s grunge (this time David Wain and Michael Showalter made a wonderful The State scandal for MTV) and its own time – in 2001, before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and other stars moved to bigger cases in their career.
As a cultural product, it is both a parodia and a description of the continuous memory to which we are stuck during the Facebook period.
As a commercial product, it feels like it's already been alive.
The First Day of Camp was surprisingly well done, not just because of its absurd humor (including the background story of the vegetables that speaks with the voice of H. Jon Benjamin).
At the heart of Vits, middle-aged actresses act like creepy teenagers approaching full-life age, and its emphasising makes a joke part of the inability of reaching the past.
Ten Years Later, where adults play adults, is less emotional, and its parody is more fragmented: it parodizes, for example, the 90-century stalker films, such as the horror movie The Hand of which swings.
In one section, one of the characters digs out Apple Powerbook, inline rollers and "other stuff from 1991".
Many stories are the same as before.
Goodhearted Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer, but still hasn't gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And in one madman, Ronald Reagan (so old Michael Showalter) is involved as a criminal partner of George H. W. Bush (who plays Michael Ian Black).
As always in these series, the best is the sidelines.
It's particularly fun to see the ancient Paul Rudd, who has underneath the beard-up of Matt Dillon's "soul patch" movie Singles. Rudd's acting Andy, the camp king, starts to be an old man.
The moments of accidental madness may bring this series into flight as a kind of recurring Seven Up! series until it gets its obvious decision: Wet Hot American Summer – Twenty Years Later. In its last scene, the team of friends will go to the Wet Hot American Summer first night.
The Amazon Comrade Detective series again appeals to another kind of nostalgic: the spirit of the cold war of the Americans, the Atomic Blonde, and even the GLOW series, where the east is facing the west.
The comedy series have been created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, and it has been directed by Rhys Thomas. It is made into a Romanian police drama in the 1980s, where the Bucharest cop couple fights for truth, atheism and marksism-lenism.
In the main parts of the hard-faced Gregor and idealistic Iosefina, Florin Piersic Jr and Corneliu Ulici are seen. Their turns have dubaned in English Channing Tatum (the main producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea.
But that's a lot more than that.
There are some good visual jokes in the series (polices spend time watching chess on television the same way as Americans watch football).
There are a number of famous audio actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny, who get a fun game to play.
However, comrade detective is too caught in imitation of the socialist drama — a killer hidden behind the Reagan mask, for example, and that is why the series is often starting to feel like a creepy propaganda.
Six long episodes are too long, and a series of humors are not fast enough and not too fast.
As tightened, the series might act better as agitprop satellite, even if Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. embassy and the lobby are always two fat men taunting hamburgers.
The message to the communist audience is that Western culture can make all consumption and fast food.
The imaginative Romanian creators of a series were not wrong: our greed is a spoil of our own history and their history.
Toni Tauru, Kouvolan, rises up in Macao on Saturday against the former UFC fighter
Toni Tauru wants to keep the fight up.
Toni Tauru gets a hard bone in Macao, because the Brazilian Leandro Issa fought in the UFC last year.
The Brazilian also has the black belt of the jujutsu and the world championship of the species.
For once, I'm going to fight myself against my parents.
It's a funny thing. Tauru, 32, tells me.
The Kouvolan was supposed to get into the ring in Indonesia last Saturday.
The match was withdrawn because of logistical problems, but three struggles were received on a quick schedule to Macao, China's autonomous region.
Tauru has never encountered such a thing before.
This was the first time my fight was canceled.
It annoyed me for getting ready and training took a lot of time.
However, the fighter is pleased to have a new time for the struggle.
Weekly waiting is not much about preparation.
The transfer doesn't seem to work out, because it won't get better in a week.
You can get worse if you're practicing too much.
In a few previous struggles, Tauru has encountered opponents whose strengths are in the formation.
This time, the situation is different.
Issaa's couvolan describes it as a typical Brazilian.
He's a pretty aggressive fighter.
I bet he'll come on the first round hard and try to get him to the carpet.
He's won the jujutsu World Championship, so he can wrestle.
The previous match of the Kouvola didn't go as planned.
The Philippinesan Kevin Belingon hit Tauru badly in the eye, and the victory remained for the Philippines.
I've never fought so well, especially in the face: he didn't get any hits.
When I went down, he hit my eyebrow.
It was really bad for a long time.
New Motivation
Some of the free fighters fight once a year, some get in the circle more often.
For example, the future opponent Issa fought last time in September.
Tauru had three matches last year.
Now there's a second struggle in the year to come.
Sometimes it's gotten pregnant.
In recent years, I've been practicing and having been in good shape all the time.
But I've only fought for fighting.
When the 32-year-old heard about the coming encounter, he decided to change the landscape for a moment.
I was in Espoo training and I got the pleasure back.
We got really good workouts when there was a friend from Sweden, too.
Practice was a great help, for on Saturday, a cowboy has to be prepared for physical struggle.
I've been able to train the same-sized opponents and practice the vertical match.
I'm sure standing up is the 32-year-old's main tactics.
We have to beat him rationally.
If there's a chance, I'll go to the property myself.
Sub-exports must not be given for free because they consume the most.
Macao's been tempting Tauru in China before.
I hear it's China Las Vegas.
I think there's a big, great evening ahead.
Central Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25 %
The Central Bank of England is expected to report that it keeps interest rates unchanged when economic growth has been inefficient and that consolidation of inflation has stopped speculations from interest rates.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth continues to slowly, and the Bank shifted interest rates because of increased pressure on the level of family income.
The decision-makers of the Central Bank's Monetary Policy Commission decided to hold the interest rates by 6 to 2%, with a lower rate of interest in this month, as economic growth has been inefficient.
In its quarterly inflation review, the bank decreased its growth forecast to 1.7% in 2017 and its forecast to 1.6% in 2018, and also warned that the household income level would be subject to increased pressure as inflation is expected to continue to rise by 3% in autumn.
However, according to the Bank, increases in the next few years are needed to control the inflation accelerated by Brexit, and the Bank announced that the loan costs may need to be increased more than expected on the financial market.
In addition, the members of the Commission decided to withdraw part of the massive economic package, which was launched one year ago in the post-certifications of the Brexit referendum.
The Bank will end the Term Funding Scheme programme in February 2018, although it is now expected to offer favourable funding to banks more than GBP 15 million, i.e. a total of GBP 115 million.
The Bank's interest rate decision states: "The forecast by the Commission responsible for monetary policy is that the slow development of GDP will continue in the coming years when the real income of households decreases consumption."
With regard to interest rates, the Bank reiterated the need for "a certain degree of tightening of monetary policy" market expectations to reduce inflation "a little more widely".
The market is currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that possible increases were "stagenic" and "limited".
In May, the bank predicted an increase of 1.9% for this year and an increase of 1.7% for the next year.
Now it kept its growth forecast for 2018 at 1.8%.
The pound was deteriorated against the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
Compared to the dollar, the pound declined by 0.5 per cent and was $1,31 per cent; compared to the euro, it declined by 0.4 per cent and was 1.11 per cent.
The decision to keep the interest rates unchanged after the expected weaker growth figures reduced the increased expectations of interest rates. GDP grew by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter and 0.2 per cent in the first quarter.
The bank is expected to continue to increase by 0.3% in the third quarter, but to increase slightly at the end of the year.
Its latest inflation review gave little hope to households suffering from accelerated inflation and low wage increases, and according to the Bank, the situation will deteriorate even before it becomes better.
The Bank added that monetary policy cannot prevent the fall in income in the coming years, but it expects wage developments to “significantly” at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The House will also be strengthened by a strong increase in demand for British products as a result of a weak GBP, abolishing part of the decline in private consumption.
The decision was taken one year after the interest rate was reduced to 0.25%, after the result of the EU national vote, which was shocked to lower the GBP.
The Bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision is likely to be seen in prices and in the economy only after four years.
Before the latest decision of the Central Bank, the increases had been reduced to demand more and more loudly when inflation was extorting the pressure on households. Three decision-makers requested a 0.5% increase in July.
Inflation remained at 2.6 per cent last month from 2.9 per cent in June, but according to the bank it was expected and inflation would rise again in the coming months.
According to the Bank, the two-percent exceedance of the target was due to the weak GBP 'all'.
"In view of the recent decrease in swap interest rates, competition in the mortgage market would seem to become more exacerbated when creditors hotly seek customers and want to end the year strongly," says Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
"The markets look particularly good for those whose current loan agreement is ending, and the latest agreements are more popular, their interest rates are low, and there are also costless options."
NHS amounts to 10,000 controversial HIV medicines
Since September, patients can be prescribed a "reverse" anti-HIV medicine. The Supreme Court concluded a dispute concerning the financing of the medicine in the English public health system (NHS).
NHS reported that pre-exposure inhibition therapy (PrEP) was prescribed to approximately 10,000 people during the first three-year trial.
NHS agreed to finance the experiment after the last year's judgment of the Supreme Court was held by the NHS, even though it argued that the local authorities should finance it.
Simon Stevens, the head of the NHS of England, called the decision to be "significant new intervention" on Thursday, and the National AIDS Organisation described it as "relevant for a moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield begin to receive registrations for other clinics in October.
Pre-exposure inhibition therapy (PrEP) should be taken with a HIV medicine that reduces the risk of infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV infections in risk groups.
Before administering, the medicinal product means that the body has enough medicinal products to prevent HIV infection during the intercourse.
You can take this medicine every day or two hours before sex.
The target treatment group consists of gay men, bisexual men and transsexuals, as well as those with a HIV-positive partner who do not receive effective treatment.
Clinics select the conditions for testing meet the applicants for men, women and transgenics and for those whose HIV-positive partner is not known to receive antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and who have announced general medical treatment can also apply for an experiment in their local sexual health clinic.
The programme will cost GBP 10 million and NHS signed a contract on medicinal products this week after the international invitation to tender.
The purpose of the experiment is to assess the potential of PrEP by collecting a wide range of clinical evidence of its targeting, taking and carrying out treatment.
"This important new intervention should be complemented and enhanced by the already existing diversified and increasingly effective means of preventing HIV," says Stevens.
"This is another significant achievement in the struggle of over 30 years in solving the greatest health challenge of mankind."
"This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV," says Deborah Gold, director of the National AIDS Organisation.
"If PrEP is properly targeted for those who need it and who are members of the risk groups, it may have a reverse effect on their HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, the risk group will receive through the experiment funded by the NHS, a medicine that they can decide to use independently without need to negotiate with the partner, an effective effect that will improve the lives of a very large number of people.
This was a welcome news."
"The most important thing now is to ensure that the experiment is launched quickly throughout the country and no one belongs to the risk group is excluded," says Ian Green, director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation.
"We have acquired the PrEP used in the experiment, and we will soon be able to protect 100,000 people from HIV infection."
"The start of the preEP experiment is a welcome event that has been overwhelming for several months due to the government's slowdown," says Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Health of the shadow government.
"We have evidence that the medicine may have a reverse effect on our work we are doing to prevent HIV and stop spreading this disease.
The experiment will help us to better understand the real benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the experiment be launched as soon as possible in the whole country, so that we can protect those exposed to HIV and move further closer to the situation where the spread of HIV in society has been able to stop."
Quality of living: Intermediate floor and smart decoration solutions have made a small home spacious of Earl's Court's apartment
The former banker Joanne Leigh, inspired to renovate property, moved from Knightsbridge to a smaller apartment in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of the queen Anna's style house, and the success of the remont tells me that Joanne has not yet packed and moved.
"This is where I used to live with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger apartment," Joanne says.
"I'm looking for something similar in my price class.
I went to this apartment show, and I noticed that the rooms were as high as in my flat.
"I got adored right away, and I made a offer on the same day."
After that, about 90 squares of apartment has experienced a complete change in shape.
It was a twin where the bedroom was only able to get out of the kitchen, and Joanne wanted more storage space and the intermediate floor so that the room height could be used.
"I wanted space, large windows and a lot of light.
They were my demands," he says.
He hired the work from the Duck & Shed Design Office in Erfan Azad, Notting Hill. Erfan was assigned to use the space of the rooms of almost four metres and to create an apartment not only for renovation and sale but for home.
The room height was not quite enough for two double spaces, so the challenge was to build an intermediate layer where it could fit to stand.
The solution required creative thinking from Erfan.
"The steel structures are quite complicated.
The spaces had to be arranged in duplicate so that they didn't need to crawl.
Structures had to be adapted so that the height is just appropriate both on top and below."
Erfan was able to place over two full - height rooms with fascinating details.
On the intermediate floor, the copper crossing window of Retrouvius opens up to a stylish residence space.
Reflected furniture, silver efficiency and Serge Mouillen vintage lights create a unique style.
The use of mirrors results in the theatricality, the sensation and light of the state.
The mirrors on each end of the short corridor make the corridor seem far further.
The mirror in the intermediate space of the kitchen is like a window that opens a view to another room.
Indoor mirror furniture have a storage room for Joanne’s meals and glasses.
It's more elegant that the kitchen can be hidden when it's not used.
Kitchens equipped with a skilled door are not a new solution,
But in Joanne's kitchen, it is unique that the door is lifted up in the same way as the garage door.
"It required a little design," Erfan tells me about a steel-reinforced slice-pin MDF door.
"It is balanced, i.e. it slips up very easily."
As a result of sound use and planning of storage facilities, Joanne received 16 extra squares, another bedroom and a better ground solution.
"In selling the place, the area solves – or the value of the property," Erfan says.
"In the event of retirement, the real estate broker walks in the apartment and lowers the price based on the area."
In Joanne's apartment, the area was added using high-quality materials that bring luxury to the farm.
"The person is touching the materials of the apartment, and the emotional connection to the apartment is generated partly by them," says Erfan.
"No one's climbing into the power lines on the walls.
They're important too, but not in the same way."
Joanne’s apartment is an example of good design and additional habitats making the basic dwelling exceptionally fine.
It can also happen that you don't want to move out of the apartment anymore.
Pregnant Princess Sofia radiated in his summer locus
Princess Sofia's residence hit the button.
Princess Sofia represented Sweden for the last time in Båstad.
For the dinner of the Sustainable Tomorrow event, the princess had chosen a quiet, light blue dress.
Sofia represented at the opportunity as a smiler.
The Swedish Princess Sofia has visited Båstad in Sweden this week.
On Wednesday, Sofia represented a beautiful blue-blooded dress in the A Sustainable Tomorrow seminar, which was most recently dressed as a pregnant princess.
Sofia arrived at the event in a dark blue suit.
This is the last representation event in which Sofia represents before she is born.
His calculated time is in September.
Sofia had chosen a beautiful pastel blue dress for dinner, which landed wonderfully.
The style was corroborated by large earrings and a stylish little bag.
The Pastell blue dressed finely for the princess.
Sofia has been on a representation trip to Båstad in Sweden this week.
Sofia supplemented her dwelling with a little bag.
Sofia just radiated in her delicious summer lodges.
Sofia even became enthusiastic to talk to photographers.
Now I'm just holding my stomach, Sofia said laughing and referring to his rest of pain.
He grows us with a sweet chili.
During the summer 1996, the Lahde market appeared at a home where Thai food was sold.
The Lahtians didn't dare taste, they walked by.
In the home, Panya sold food to Suamsri-Penttilä, among the familiars of Panja.
He had little knowledge of Finnish, and the Finnishs were not yet aware of thai at that time.
Because people were afraid to go to dinner, Panja offered free tastes.
This is how he taught the Gulfs to eat thai food, spring roll at a time.
Try the taste, he said.
I got hooked out of the valley.
I went more and more often, eventually every day.
During the summer 1997, Panja opened its Thai grocery fish in Lahde’s store hall.
There were two small tables, and I think there were less than 20.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food but also to sit next to a stranger.
When you're hungry and you're restricted, you can't leave an empty chair between yourself and a guest.
In a little while, we knew better, and we became friends.
Eventually, I sat at the plate with a dictionary studying Thai.
Two years went to the grocery hall, but then the restaurant had to change, because they said the spice stoves themselves would smell too much in the hall.
A new place was released from the office.
There's room.
Now we jugglers can sit in our own tables again, only in the rushed times we will be shy to ask guests if there is room next door.
Panja knows his client.
They'll tell him where they've been and who they've seen.
He knows what food each one eats.
He's seen how customers' life stages vary and the food club changes.
He remembers the name of the man I went to eat my first spring roll.
She remembers me thin and fat, and remembers how I was when I was young.
It's nice to go to lunch a little later than others, sit next to the kitchen door, and change your belongings with Panja, who is based on the dishes.
Food isn't the most important thing we get from him.
He has taught tolerance and internationality with a sweet chili sauce.
He has opened our tastes in addition to our thoughts and hearts.
Today, many speak to him the thai - thanks to the increased popularity of tourism.
I admire Panya.
Even though he's been having a hard time, he's always being friendly.
He's busy.
He's going to the restaurant work and he's going to the fungi and the blueberry.
Last week, the restaurant was celebrating the fulfillment of two decades.
We clients got strawberry cake for dessert.
Without alarm or attention, this great day took place at work.
The discovery of the underground base revealed 173 terrorists who were willing to attack in Europe
From the start of the year, security authorities received a list of important elements for the anti-terrorism work.
The list contains information from more than 170 Isis fighters who are ready to attack Europe.
According to the German Die Welt magazine, the total number of persons is 173 and the document also includes photos of each person, not only their personal data.
More than 130 of the people mentioned in the list are Iraqi, but six Europeans are also involved.
They're from Belgium, Holland, France and Germany.
The rest is Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tazdhikistani and Saudi Arabia.
Evening-Sanoma told me about the list and a couple of weeks back.
Now the location of the list and the information contained there has been revised.
According to the newspaper, the Iraqi Army Special Forces found a list of terrorists' personal data and photographs in studying the underground base of the terrorist organization in Mosul.
The U.S. Intelligence Authorities evaluated the authenticity of the papers and sent them forward to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all European security authorities in May.
In the background, there was fear that something big and serious would be planned in the western countries, by terrorists, when Isis was defeated in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, in addition to the names and images of all persons, the date of their birth, the invented subsidiaries and the information of the person's homeland.
The list has also identified the specialities of terrorists.
For example, in Sami J. of the 27-year-old German on the list, the battle name Abu Assid al-Almani, i.e. German.
He was reported to have left Germany in 2012, traveling first to Egypt, then to Libya and later through Turkey to join the Isis lines.
It's been written next to him as a special suicide bomber.
There's no more detail about the man's fate.
A total of around 6,000 fighters have left Europe on the Isis lines, who have no certainty of their destiny.
The man swept under the surface in the Tokoinranna of Helsinki
Based on the interviews from the Rescue Department, the man wanted to show him that he could swim.
Even the bucket can save a drowning life.
A person underwater was rescued in the Tokoinra of Helsinki on Thursday.
According to Ville Estlander, the firemaster of the Helsinki Civil Protection Department, the situation was over quickly.
The person was found underwater for about 15 minutes after notification.
The divers found him under the surface, Estlander tells us.
The Rescue Department received an announcement after half four in the afternoon.
The person was delivered to first-hand care.
Estlander says he was about 50 years old.
Based on the interviews, the man wanted to show him how to swim.
The situation in Tokoinra is over.
Estlander thanks for the cooperation of the authorities with the Border Guard and the police.
It was a mission led by the Border Guard.
The locals also instructed divingers excellently.
The situation was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water together with the Border Guard and the police.
Two passenger cars ran into nine people in Eura, three seriously injured.
There were nine people in the cars, and the rest of them had less damage, says the day-old firemaster.
There are both men and women among the injuries.
The accident occurred in the three-way crossing at four o'clock in the day.
The accident occurred when the other car turned in front of the other car behind the warning three, the day-old firemaster tells us.
According to the Rescue Department, the crossing area has a limit of 80 km/h.
Brothers fight over $500 million for real estate
Two brothers argue about Victoria's largest property empire worth more than $500 million, which is linked to their Italian family 40 years ago.
The former Chairman of Carlton's football club and the real estate developer Colin De Lutis lives only three houses away from his younger brother Paul.
Paul has wanted to leave the family company since 2014, but there is a bitter dispute about the difference.
The brothers and their mother Anna, together, own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars.
That's where the family set up the Westco Jeans store, which expanded into 160 movements.
The trading chain was sold at $85 million in 1999.
The money was used for real estate, and the family now owns offices, building development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento and apartments in Gold Coasti and Mt Buller, as well as shopping centres in suburban areas.
According to the agreement with the past father, Colin owns about two thirds and Paul owns about a third of the company's wealth. Paul describes his father as "family bearing power and central character".
According to the legal documents, the share of the property means that Colin owns properties of about $316 million and about $ 176 million.
Paul is not satisfied with the distribution of real estate and money.
"I think that Colin left the best properties for himself in his proposal," Paul wrote in his first oath certificate to the court in 2015.
The case was dealt with last Friday for the first time in the Supreme Court after several reconciliation companies.
The brothers are now also debating who is in control of the existing business. Paul claims that Colin has excluded him from business.
Colin said that it's not true, but he's accusing Paul of some of the bad business of real estate.
Colin, together with his first conscientious testimony, writes that he would like to find a solution.
"According to our Italian traditions, the family is most important to me," says Colin in his opinion.
There are hundreds of pages of complaints, e-mails and reports, which are being examined by consultants such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and his late husband Luigi were Italian migrants who founded milk bars and delicious shops at the end of the 1950s. At the beginning of the 1970s they bought a store from Brunswick.
They were used as a guarantee when they bought the family from Collingwood a property on which Colin set up the first jean store of the family.
Colin tells us that he set up a trade "in the last years of the class when Paul was still a child (approximately 10 years old)".
Anna De Lutis tells us that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to transfer the property to their sons in harmony.
"Luigi often said that he did not want the brothers to end up in court," Anna writes in his statement.
Two other sons of the family, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the De Lutis Group's business. Colin says Mark got $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left the company.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark are a "category of the economic conditions of their departure".
Colin has kept a low profile, even though he is the former member of the Australian football league government and the best friend of the television star Eddie McGuire, according to the lifetime of this year 2015.
Fairfax Media contacted Coli and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Colin only answered: in his text message, he said that there is no right way to comment because it is being dealt with in court.
"It's very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and to draw our family's name into a fight for justice," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to accept the requirements of his brother.
"Our father would not have wanted us to argue in this way", Colin continued and said that he would still hope that it would be resolved.
Friday, hope seemed to have passed out.
"Our business will be settled in the court in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new head of staff intends to limit the use of the President's media.
The others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will finally succeed.
First.
According to the Poltico magazine, the new Head of Staff of the White House intends to limit the media use of President Trump and the monitoring of the news so that the boss is not so often in trouble.
Reporter Josh Dawsey reports:
"When the new Head of Staff of the White House, John F. Kelly, met with the management staff on his first working day, he took up the key problem he intends to resolve: he intends to limit the access of President Donald Trump's information.
Kelly told the workers of the White House that all the information – both printed and heard at the information conferences – must be transported through him because the President makes better decisions when he gets good information."
Kelly's words make sense, but others have tried to limit the media use of Trump and failed.
President Trumpi has a relationship with television for decades – and as President he is still watching a lot of television.
"If President-in-Office Trump was nervous about unfair news, he was encouraged to show that the media of sympathy dealt with things more equally," Sam Nunberg, who worked as a consultant in Trump's campaign, told the Politico magazine in February.
Politicon journalist Tara Palmeri then wrote that "the use of Trump Twitter by six former campaign workers is essential that his personal media flow belongs to a level playing field".
Okay.
But it's ridiculous to say that the use of Trump Twitter would never have been controlled.
Perhaps these campaign workers know something that we others don't know — perhaps Trump twitches would have been even more brutal without their efforts.
We will probably never find out what kind of messages Trump missed.
If even a few times his staff have been able to prevent her from causing problems, their work has not been worthwhile.
However, no one has consistently been able to prevent the womb caused by Trump.
The problem is partly due to the fact that there are competing groups in the White House who are trying to drive their business by providing Trump with information that supports their vision, and that information can be reliable – or not.
In May, Politico wrote that the advisors were deliberately giving the President questionable information.
Reporter Shane Goldmacher told me about a case:
"Trump's current and former employees say that he can become tremendously angry with the magazines in which he is criticised – especially if they tell about harmful data leaks, and then he must know where the information comes from.
This happened at the end of February when someone gave the President a copy of the news of the web proposer Charles C. Johnson’s GotNews.com site, accused Katie Walshi of several White House information leaks.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter for harassment, and he had previously disseminated false charges and later withdrawn them, and he also did not provide concrete evidence.
However, Trump had started the case after reading to ask the staff about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that the staff manager Reince Priebus and the staff secretary of the White House Rob Porter were trying to introduce a system of management of documents going to Trump.
And what was the result?
Kelly's trying the same thing three months later.
He may prove to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still self-impulsive himself and his assistants continue to drive their own business.
These unchanged facts make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Neymar concluded a five-year agreement with the PSG
The Brazilian Legislator Neymar has concluded a five-year agreement with the French football club PSG, reports AFP.
Previously on Thursday night, Neymar’s representatives had paid the EUR 222 million out buying-in price to the FC Barcelona in the Spanish League.
The Neymar agreement with Barcelona was therefore dissolved, and he was free to move to the Paris Society of PSG.
The maximum transfer amount of EUR 222 million is football history.
In the past, the record was in Manchester United, which last summer paid EUR 105 million for the French Paul Pogba.
The PSG owns a state-owned Qatar Sports Investment.
Former tennis professional, Chairman of the Society, Nasser al-Khelaifi.
They think Neymar's coming to Paris on Friday.
The success writer Raija Oranen reversed the fear of alcoholism and flight hypnosis: "I'm fine in my life"
Of the TV series, Rose's time and pure white sheets were just celebrated by the well-known success writer Raija Oranen.
Hypnosis helped Raija Ora.
Five grandchildren like grandmothers, taking along with writing, that Raija and her husband Jyrki gave up the Spanish sun and home Fuengirola after 18 winters.
First they sold their house, but now in the spring, the rental apartment also left.
To light and sun, away from the old circles Raijan once took depression and alcoholism from which he has survived.
Even the outer nature is 20 pounds lighter.
The weight went down when the serotonine drugs were stopped, they were anti-smoking drugs.
I used to get help with alcoholism from hypnosis, which also worked for the fear of flying, and I won it.
I've been out of alcohol for 15 years now.
Alcohol takes a human, a radiant writer says openly.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen have been on the same journey for over 45 years.
I'm better than ever.
Jyrki Oranen, who also worked in the tourism sector, has traveled together for over 40 years.
I proposed, and it was getting married in two weeks, Raija laughs.
The queen of such a drama has always been, ending his life with that, Jyrki laughs at his wife.
Oranen made a measurable writer's career only remembers 44 parts of the pure white sheets of the TV series that touched and moved the lama time in Finland.
I finally decided to be the business of the Raikkaa family company in the clothing industry, when I read the 50th anniversary interview of Liisa Seppala on the plane.
I was the daughter of a sewing machine myself, my mother also had a clothing store, and sometimes I acted as a manneken, Oranen remembers.
He thought the series was a pattern and the story changed the attitude of Finns to entrepreneurship.
Anita Saven's investigation and the argument revealed it, Oranen says.
Raija Oranen lives as a writer for active time, has many manuscripts under work - ideas for hundreds.
The Circles returned over the raft to the alley of millionaires.
The most wealthy owners of West Midlands are once again hairless with superficial circulars who succeeded in crossing the municipality's harbour and returning to the next field of the houses.
The Circles park 20 of their trailers near the street called the alley of millionaires in Solihull.
They were drove away from the area in May, but they managed to cross the city's roadway, and they brought with them children, horses, and the army of trucks.
The Circles succeeded in crossing the barrier that had been left unprotected for the path.
Solihull's municipality has been accused of "complete inability to solve the problem".
An anonymous resident tells us that the circulars came from Bentley Heath on Monday night, where they had thrown by stones.
"That must be hardened to act, because it seems to be completely incapable of solving the problem.
The Circles were here in May, and then they left, but they returned again.
They came more tonight, and probably even more today."
The resident told me that Birmingham's municipality had solved the problem by banning access to the parks.
"Asun Streetsbrook Road, and it's frustrating to pay municipal tax when the municipality can't do anything about it."
According to another unnamed resident, it is ridiculous that the Cypriots returned so soon after they were driven away.
"They have been more than before, and they have even landed the horse in the parcel."
According to the informant of the municipality of Solihull, the municipality is aware of illegal camping near Streetsbrook Road. "We are taking the necessary legal measures with the Solihull police to eliminate the campers as soon as possible.
In view of the collection of evidence, it is essential that as many locals as possible report to the police about disturbing or criminal activities.
It helps to create an overall picture of the situation for legal proceedings."
Angered people surrounded Portugal’s devastating machine
In Portugal, men full of people on the beach have been interviewed today in court.
As a result of the forced bill, two people died last night.
The two men flying the plane can be charged with invasion.
At the lowest time, 16 years of imprisonment can be obtained in Portugal.
Last night, because of a technical error, the male-flyed plane had to make a forced landing on the beach of Sao Joao da Caparica near Lisbon.
There were hundreds of people on the beach during the event, some of whom ran the landing plane into the water.
The plane hit the 56-year-old man and the eight-year-old girl who died immediately.
The plane first hit the man who was on the back of the plane.
As soon as the plane got up, and when it landed again, it hit the head of the child, told the page of Filipe Janeira Jornal de Noticias on the beach.
The little girl who died was on the beach with his parents.
The parents of the girl weren't hurt.
Those on the beach surrounded the small machine immediately after the crash were angry.
The daughter’s father and other people went to the plane and began to beat it up, told the case in Celia Rocha Correio da Manha.
He called the pilot a criminal. He was desperate.
It's a miracle that no more people are dead.
The two men on the plane weren't injured in a forced landing.
A tragic Finnishist who lost his leg won again the MM gold: "I wouldn't be the world champion"
Matti Suur-Hamari party early Wednesday morning Finnish time MM-kulta banked slalom in Canada's Big White competition.
The Great Hamari used to win the cross MM gold in the races.
All of them, three MMs have already been accumulated.
Wow, that's amazing MM contests!
Two treatments of gold, a pretty good heartbeat pulled, the telephone targeted Big Hamari rejoiced.
The 30-year-old calculator thanked his coach and very successful preparation in Finland.
According to the Great Hamar, the number of pests in the species is growing all the time.
The whole paralum boarding has grown and evolved so much lately.
Differences decrease and many new calculators are involved.
He's always wondering if a black horse's coming back.
Every race seems to have a different winner.
Great Hamari lost his second leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
He had been eager to fall with his friends since he was young, and the accident did not take his desire to get to the slope.
It comes to mind at times what my life would be like without that accident.
But my attitude has always been for nothing to do with it.
With those cards you play, which is distributed, the Great Hamari stresses.
It would be cruel to squeeze a serious accident and lose a limb to be a lucky shot, and the Great Hamari won't do it.
But he turned a terrible problem to the benefit of it.
Yes, I would say that the situation turned out to be a win.
I wouldn't be a three-fold world champion without an accident.
Before the accident, the biggest boarding activity of the 23-year-old Big Hamar was already slipping.
The Duuni headed towards the peak only after the accident.
I trained with my friends when I was young, and we always killed X-Games.
But they were distant dreams that faded some time.
After the accident, I found myself somehow at the X-Games start.
I couldn't have imagined it in advance.
I was 23 years old, and I was wondering if this would be a very long life if I stayed here to bitter and mourn.
I decided to pull the suits on the back of my neck and start working.
I'd say I've done pretty well.
The calculator was very pleased with the choice of Leo-Pekka Star as a year's athlete.
The four-fold Olympic Winner received his prize in the sports gala held in January.
According to the Great Hamar, Star's victory is an important signal for the paraurgy.
It was a big deal, and the victory was definitely earned.
I'm sure this will also open eyes to the parasport world.
When is it time to launch a double world champion Matti Big-Hamar sports campaign for the year?
Then we'll see it in time.
I'm trying to do my best to succeed.
Even the Great Hamari has not conquered all the tops of the desire.
Next year, there's a big goal.
A year later, the Paralympics will be visited in South Korea.
We're gonna go get some medals!
The majority of young refugees in Syria will not believe that they will return to their country permanently unless the war ends and Isis leaves the country
The study of A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees investigated the opinions and attitudes of the youth refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
The Syrian refugees are baking bread in the refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of young Syrians believe that they will not return to their homeland permanently.
According to them, the end of Syrian war and the leaving of Issis from the country are the most important things that should be done to allow them to return to their homeland.
The Trump regime does not see a change in the Syrian conflict.
The communications chain of Burson-Marsteller explained the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in the international study.
In nine years, Burson-Marsteller has studied the opinions and attitudes of the Arab gorillas.
This year, the study of the Voice for Young Syrian Refugees examined the opinions and attitudes of the youth refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February-March 2017, a total of 400 young Syrians aged 18-24, half of whom are women and half men, responded to the study.
Half the interviews were made in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of the young Syrian refugees do not believe they will return to their homeland permanently in the future.
42 per cent of the respondents can think of returning to their homeland and four per cent could not say.
According to the study, the decision on the return of young people is most affected by the war in Syria and the presence of Isis in the country.
Nearly half (47%) consider the end of the war to be the most effective factor for permanent return, while the quarter considers the most important thing is leaving Isis.
Only less than a tenth increases the main factors affecting the decision to improve the economic situation or leave Bashar al-Assad in Syria.
Military actions do not solve conflict alone
The Syrian youths were asked what is the most important factor for the conflict to be resolved.
The majority believe that the end of war is more essential than the resignation of President Bashar al-Assad.
The fair quarter considers the President of Al-Assad to be an obstacle to the peace agreement.
Nearly half of the experience is that both political and military solutions are needed to put an end to the current Syrian conflict.
To solve the conflict by means of mere military action, only a fair quarter believes.
The majority of young Syrian refugees see Isis' power deteriorating over the last year, while the fifth experience of its power is strengthened.
According to the respondents, the most important battle against Islamic, and generally against terrorism, is that the media will convey to people information that Islamic has nothing to do with Islamic.
Almost as many put military measures as well as training reform as a priority.
The decade of fairness feels that the most important thing would be to create better hired jobs for young people.
When asking about the impact of Trump's regime on the Syrian conflict, 66% of respondents believe that the conflict will not change during Trump's regime.
Almost every fourth believes that the Syrian conflict will exacerbate during Trump.
The opinions are divided into two ways as to whether the participation of Russia and Iran has improved or worsened the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half of his time coding to keep the Internet in order to keep up with the database he has developed, for example, Wikipedia and Google.
Espoo company MariaDB develops an open source database of "the fastest growing" database.
The main product founded by the coding entrepreneur Michael "Monty" Widenius does not pay any money to users, and it can be developed via the Internet by any qualified programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are Finnish database users, but they are not necessarily paying customers.
With the help of databases, huge data masses will remain in order and quickly available.
If you use Linkedin, Twitter or Booking.com for example, they will use MariaDB or MySQL database.
"All information that is not in the image format comes from the database, and the images are also linked to it," explains Widenius.
MariaDB's technology manager Widenius spends around half of his time coding.
The man who makes a beautiful hand-to-move work contributes to ensuring that the Internet works smoothly.
Widenius developed the world's most popular open source database with MySQL and Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, the technology company Sun bought MySQL for a billion dollars, and a year later, Oracle dumped Sun for 7.4 billion.
When the Oracle store took place, most of MySQL's developers announced that they were leaving.
"They did not want to work for Oracle, who did not give a certain promise of the future of MySQL," Widenius recalls.
He had already set up at this stage a company that started developing MariaDB.
He didn't want his life's work to die.
I hired Sun for twenty best developers, and I made sure that the code's continuity was secured by the same guys that created it.
Because MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch.
All I had to do was change the name.
A Foundation was established to monitor the freedom of development of the MariaDB code.
"In MySQL, these confirmations were not made," Widenius troubles me.
Although many have heard about Widenius and MySQL's billion stores, Finns rarely know anything about MariaDB.
"For the last few years, our growth rate has been around 50% per year," says Kenneth Paqvalén, the economic director of MariaDB.
MariaDB focuses on growth is not yet profitable, and Paqvalén is low-profile of the company's figures.
To that extent, she reveals that during the current financial year MariaDB estimates that she will receive orders of EUR 20 million.
Since the database is free, the company has developed services around which business customers are willing to pay.
MariaDB also helps to exchange databases, which may be more than a year's career if the client has used a closed database.
A change from MySQL to MariaDB will be successful in a moment because they are versions of each other.
Among other things, the largest DBS bank in Telefónica and South-East Asia is the customers paid by MariaDB.
The most popular cloud services such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Alibaban Cloud, offer their customers MariaDB.
At the same time, MariaDB will automatically spread to new users in distribution packages for Linux operating systems where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Even though we're a small company, we have contacts with the biggest gamblers.
"Our clients are among the world's largest teleoperators, gambling companies, banks and even some kind of central bank", Paqvalé.
The giants such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP still exist in their closed databases.
Even to Oracle, MySQL is a modest side business compared to the company's traditional closed database.
Although according to the research company Gartner, the largest database companies have lost their market share in recent years, in turnover, players such as MariaDB are still insignificant, although fast-growing sints.
A $50 billion database market, open source databases up to a billion.
However, the weight of the open source code cannot be measured only in cash because most users do not pay for any of these software.
The research company Gartner predicts that in 2018 companies are already developing more than 70% of their internal applications on open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would have been switched to open or at least started.
Large companies will not receive new customers because most of them will choose an open source code next.
This has led to the fact that the licence fees for commercial databases have jumped into the clouds.
Companies want to make as much money as they used to do with a smaller number of customers," Widenius thinks.
Since the exchange of the closed database is troubled, most of the customers have debilitated price increases in a modest manner.
"There are a lot of customers to whom transfer is really difficult because their old applications and others are closed in a closed database," Widenius says.
He still thinks that the number of customers is coming to full.
When licence fees rise every year, the customer moves sooner or later to the open source database.
The price is 10-20 per cent from the previous one, and the service is better because the customer can easily switch to another database if he wants to.
Moreover, many companies are facing major changes in systems when they transfer their activities to cloud services.
At the same time, many exchange database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received EUR 25 million of loans from the European Investment Bank from the EIB.
It was the largest growth fund ever granted by the EIB to the Nordic countries.
The company has around 115 employees worldwide and is now meant to hire more.
One of the reasons why the EIB was financed was the impact of MariaDB on public procurement.
The company has customers in the public sector, for example in Britain and Germany.
The public sector in Europe will pay billions of euros per year for databases.
"Most countries want to move to the solutions of the open source code and thus use tax funds more efficiently," says Paqvalén.
Widenius is anxious about how money is spent in Finland, for example, in closed health systems, when open systems are cheaper and the subscriber is not at the mercy of one software company.
Some say the open source code is ideology, but I think it's a better way to make the code.
The community will help and do something that is not invented or capable of doing.
55-year-old Widenius is part of the other Finnish developer Linus Torvalds, along with the most famous open source promoters.
Widenius helps other companies to develop working business models on an open source code.
I am still having 4-5 speeches annually across the world on this subject.
Italy hardens its approach to civil society rescue ships
Italy has warned NGOs which save their ships refugees in the Mediterranean that they must not continue their activities unless they commit themselves to comply with the new rules on their activities.
"If NGOs are not committed to the new Code of Conduct, it is difficult to see how they could continue their activities," said Minister Marco Minniti, in the event of an interview at the Turin La Stampa magazine.
Minnit’s warning came from the day after the Italian authorities were confiscated by the German Jugend Rettet aid organization, which was suspected to cooperate with human smugglers, which promoted illegal immigration.
For a year only, the Assistance Organisation refused to comment on the detailed accusations of the Prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosion.
"We are very sorry that we are not able to act in the search and rescue area", the organization announced in its opinion in the social media.
"We can only evaluate the charges after we have gathered all the information we need and we can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the Iuventa ship of Jugend Rettet since October.
The crew is suspected to have taken on board boat-to-vehicle refugees directly from human smugglers who reintroduced the boats.
One such case is allegedly only a few kilometres away from the Libyan coast, which is shown in the document of the prosecutor whose content has been published by the Italian media.
The people are suspected to have threatened the Italian Coast Guard, which supervises the rescue measures in the region, and the motive is to be the enthusiasm of helping.
According to the Code of Conduct, ships such as Iuventa should be involved in the Italian police, which supervises operations.
Only three of the nine NGOs participating in search and rescue measures have so far agreed to follow the direction of action: Save the Children and the Maltese MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
which announced on Thursday that it considered new rules unnecessarily but acceptable because they did not cause "significant changes or obstacles" to the rescue of the organization.
The Nobel Prize of Doctors without Borders is among those who refuse to comply with the Code of Conduct.
On the other hand, Mr Minniti pointed out that the number of migrants arrived in Italy has dramatically declined over the last few weeks, as demonstrated by the efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and cooperation with local city leaders.
"In the last days, light has started to appear at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He revealed that this month there are plans to continue discussions with the Libyan city leaders on economic development projects and with Chad, Niger and Mal on measures to reduce the number of refugees moving towards Europe.
The prosecutor was suspected to have killed his unfaithful spouse at Enontekio, found a suspect in the property case to the prosecutor.
A suspected crime occurred in the Enontekio's Kuttas last December.
According to the police, a Czech 36-year-old man was suspected to have killed his 26-year-old Scottish open spouse.
Previously, both of them were seasonal workers.
The police have also told me that the suspect would have fled to the ground with two dogs since his actions.
The man was found cold in the ground, and he did not resist when he was captured.
We're gonna have to file the case in just a week.
The case may be settled in Lapland’s court law in the course of August.
Harry Potter and All-Fucky Robert Hardy, known from my friend's show, is dead.
Brit actress Robert Hardy is dead at the age of 91.
The actor's death reported this family on Thursday.
Hardy, born in 1925, started his actor's career at the theatre at the age of 24.
During his long career, he also acted on movies and television.
Hardy is especially reminded of the role of the magical minister Cornelius Toffee in Harry Potter films and of his veterinarian role in a series of all-haired friends based on James Herriot's book.
The BBC's popular series was described through seven.
Michelle Carter was sentenced to imprisonment for text messages about suicide.
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years of imprisonment for text messages and calls in which she was considered to be inspired by her boyfriend to commit Conrad Roy's suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, executes 15 months of his sentence in prison and five years in probation.
Carter was sentenced to murder in June and his boyfriend, Conrad Roy, committed suicide on 13.7.2014.
"My family is broken," said Conrad's father at the Thursday sitting.
"My son was my best friend."
Carter applied for an appeal and he was allowed to wait for an application to be handled in freedom.
He was threatened by a 20-year sentence, but according to his lawyers, both Carter and Roy were suffering from mental health problems.
Carter, who dressed in red pants and cream-colored shirt, listened to his judgment hands crossed a crying look on the ground.
"He did what killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor said to the court.
"He decided Conrad's life to heal his own.
He hasn't taken responsibility," the prosecutor continued.
"He has not shown repentance."
Carter's attorney said the case was due to "controversial circumstances that Carter deeply regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz believed that Carter's "age or maturity, and even mental health problems had a significant impact on his doing".
The prosecutor read a statement from Conrad's mother, Lynn Roy, where my mother told me that "it won't take a day not to mourn the death of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and the way I get through this, and I'm trying to comfort his sister in this pain that we will always bear."
Brother Conrad, Camdy's Roy, told the court that he'd be "conscious" of the idea that he would never see his brother's wedding or be an aunt for his children.
"It's painful to lose a person who's been in my life every day since I was born, and that pain never lasts," Camdyn said.
The case seems to be a precedent because there is no law in the state of Massachusetts that imposing suicide would be a crime.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found in the car to be dead in 2014.
The case attracted national attention when it turned out that Carter had been inspiring his boyfriend to commit suicide in his text messages.
"I don't know, there are many ways," wrote Carter in many messages that he had sent to Roy during the two weeks prior to his death, and Roy was on vacation with his family at that time.
Just a little before Roy's suicide, Carter wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad," and "You just have to start the generator, and you're free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter was looking for attention at Roy's death, and the judge ordered Carter not to be able to benefit from the case by giving interviews.
The case has shared the opinions of experts.
One of the defendants is Amanda Knox, 30 who was convicted of the murder of his British roommate in Italy in 2007. Two years later he was released.
Los Angeles Times published an opinion by Knox, which says, "Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison."
Secretary-General for NATO: The worst in Russia then in the cold war
The military union between NATO and Russia has clearly deteriorated, commented by the Secretary-General of NATO Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its position in the Ukrainian conflict.
I believe that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the cold war, Stoltenberg said in the CNN interview.
After the end of the cold war, we hoped that we could try to work closely with Russia.
However, in particular after the illegal accession of Crimea in 2014 and due to the persistent instability caused by Russia in the eastern Ukraine region, NATO's relationship with Russia has worsened considerably.
However, according to Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed to doing so that tensions do not exacerbate.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can have a political dialogue with Russia to avoid the acceleration of the situation and the new cold war.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, US President Donald Trump was able to find that between the United States and Russia had run even to a dangerously bad level.
Trump urged me to thank the poor congress of the countries that adopted the new sanctions against Russia last week.
Audit changes to 850 000 diesel engines due to the rear attack of car manufacturers
The day before Aud's announcement, BMW offered to update more than 350 000 car software.
The BMW Director said that the company believes that " there are even more rational options than driving restrictions". He referred to European cities, including the BMW home town of Munich, who are considering limiting or banning the use of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that he would make changes to more than three million Mercedes engines to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies were talking about a return call.
European car manufacturers have strongly marketed the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to achieve the CO2 targets.
Hydrogen oxide emissions from diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
The installation costs of emissions neutralising equipment are increasing, which makes it difficult to price cars competitively.
German car manufacturers are being closely monitored, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of helping and ignoring major car companies.
Companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's errors. Volkswagen installed in cars fraud devices that reduced emissions to compliance with the requirements of the tests.
Several leaders in Volkswagen have been charged in the United States, but the conduct of leaders is being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former director of Aud's engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so he can be handed over to the United States for a possible trial.
In the past this year, Audi was involved in a criminal investigation on Volkswagen, and the authorities suspected that the Audi had installed a system that could circumvent European emission requirements, based on a similar investigation in the United States.
The investigation of Aud can significantly weaken the position of Volkswagen: the manufacturer of luxurious cars is disproportionately large in the profits of Volkswagen.
Venezuela's vote started a fair investigation, big demonstrations on promise
According to the company, the number of voters declared by the Venezuela authorities is at least one million higher than the number of actual voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion from a company that has no role in the electoral performance, said Tibisay Lucena, President of the National Election Board, to journalists.
Maduro assures us that the crisis will end
In Venezuela, a controversial vote was held on Sunday, with a representation to change the Constitution of the country.
The opposition has strongly criticised the vote and organised protests against its amendment.
The opposition against Maduro has postponed its own demonstrations so that they would be in progress at the time of appointment.
According to El Pais, the national security forces of the country began to take over the national parliament building on Wednesday nights.
The teams are intended to ensure the security of the appointment event.
Climate change threatens Provence's laventel
Laventel has become a symbol of the South French Provence region, but now it is threatened by climate change.
Laventel had declined due to drought and disease-producing insects, and researchers and farmers are trying to find a solution to the problem.
"Laventel is directly endangered in Provence's territory because it has suffered the impact of climate change in recent years, which has led to a clear reduction in the rainfalls of spring, especially autumn," says Eric Chaisse, a specialist in the CRIEPPAM, which specializes in agriculture in Provence.
"This shortens the life of the laventel.
In addition, drought has brought many small bouquets that disseminate microbacteria."
The bets are tough.
Lavender oil attracts tourists, and it is also a very desired ingredients of perfume waters and cosmetics.
"In addition to small stars and large flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are weakly developed or weakened, or are missing completely," says Chaisse.
"In other words, there are fewer parts of ethical oil."
The solution will be sought by stepping up wetting, slowing down soil humidity and injecting with plant protection savies and water mixtures, and further developing more sustainable varieties of drought.
The journalist's murder reveals a growing threat in Mexico.
The delivery of the Riodoce newspaper once a week usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss the latest cases related to organised crime, corrupt authorities and the endless drug war in Sinaloa.
However, today we are discussing safety because of the recent tragedy.
Journalists have been invited to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists discuss which is safer: leave children home or take them in the delivery of a grenade attack in 2009.
Security experts have written three words: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask journalists for names for each group, and no evidence is needed, observations and emotions are sufficient.
The names of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists suspected to be on the payroll lists of governments or drug cartels, criminals making the chaos of Mexico life-threatening news.
According to the Defence Committee, at least 25 journalists have been murdered since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012, 589 journalists have been subject to attacks and threats in the defence of the Federal State. In the current year, at least seven journalists have been murdered in seven states.
The latest victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, founder of Riodoce, supplier and source of inspiration.
"The mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
He is deeply needed, even though he is present everywhere. The outdoor light of the Riodoce building covers a huge picture of Valdez's middle finger. The picture says "right." Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez are wearing T-shirts that decorate Valdez's smiling face. Valdez's eyeglasses and a panama hat formed as a trademark.
The meeting will be held less than two months after the death of Valdez, and journalists will discuss their common trauma, their nightmares, their insomnia and paranoid fears.
In 2010, the federal prosecutor’s office was established, in particular for the handling of the cases of suppliers, but according to the Defence Committee of journalists, only two accusations have so far been raised.
It is rare that journalists are murdered by courts, as well as thousands of murders related to drug trafficking and organised crime annually, only few will be brought before justice.
Riodoce’s journalists intend to continue writing about Sinalo’s violence, even though they are crushed and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, the security meeting is only a little useful because the killers are unknown and there is no hope of justice.
"This meeting is, frankly, a waste of time," he says.
"We can't trust anyone as long as we don't know the cause of the event."
Valdez had disappeared from Riodoce’s delivery in Culiacan in the state’s capital in the morning of 15 May 2017.
He had only driven a few blocks in the red Toyota when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and shot twelve shots.
The shooter drove away with Valdez's car and crashed it some way away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She was left to mourn her wife and two adult children.
The rumors are moving fast, and they're talking freely in Culiacan.
However, Valdez's death is very slow.
Sinalo has been the most bloody battlefield in Mexico since Guzman was arrested last year and expelled to the United States in January.
On the Sinaloan streets, one or several people are shot to death daily, and the cemetery has decorative two-layer graveyards of drug barons, which are larger than many houses.
In the coast, there is a "relax" in the state where only one cartel controls ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, Riodoce founder and leader, 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez feels guilty that he was unable to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes led to the murder of Valdez.
In February, Riodoce published a Damaso Lopez interview, leading a competing group that warns Guzman's sons.
Guzman's boys could be mad at this case: the customers suspected of being members of the gang bought every number of the magazine as soon as the newspaper came to the sales points.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after the second release of the same case became an attack.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is regarded as a turning point in violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear for him.
He had made a long career in Noroest, when he decided in 2003 to establish five colleagues with Riodoce. The magazine’s shares were sold at the time of $50.
In Sinaloa, "It was impossible to do journalism without dealing with the drug problem," Bojorquez says.
In time, the magazine began to feel about the brave and honest things, and its sales and advertising revenues increased.
The journalists appreciated the opportunity to publish a high-class research journalism without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinating with the papers that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after he was established, Riodoce won the Prize Maria Moors Cabot for his news in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez received the International Press Freedom Prize of journalists for the courage to follow the Mexican drug trafficking story.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to be able to continue my life," he said when he received the prize of the Defence Committee of journalists.
Drug trafficking is a "lifestyle" in Sinaloa, Valdez said Rompeviento TV interview last October.
"The engineer must accept the task that falls upon him – or act stupid.
I don't want anyone to ask me where I was when I was bathing death – why didn't I tell you what was going on?"
Riodoce's staff need Valdez — a jokeer who cried like a port worker, and they need a friend who always had a hug and advice, and they need a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routines.
He used a pancake hat.
He went to the El Guayabo Bar against the delivery and sat on the same table all the time.
Now they're asking if the routines came into his destiny.
The death of a colleague has also led them to reflect on how they can best do their job and stay alive.
"The criminals don't like it if we deal with their women and children in our cases and their clean business, their secret drug trafficking runways.
They were left out of cases," Bojorquez says.
Even in the best case, it meant strong self-defense and self-defense,
Trusting your own instincts.
If you feel that everything's not right, you have to stay away.
The problem is, according to Riodoce's journalist Andres Villarreal, that "the impression can be deceived, and that's what happened in Javier's case".
The old rules no longer apply to Sinalo, nor do they apply to Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were not allowed to be brought to the room where the safety training of Riodoce was held. A few days earlier, it had been discovered that only the spies sold to governments had been followed by activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two police officers had gone to the tree shadow for protection from 40 degrees.
The state government had ordered them to guard Riodoce's offices, located in a four-round building in the middle-class area of Culiacan.
Some of the journalists were half-stop playing, whether these two two policemen were part of the 50 percent that the state governor did not think to be trusted.
It had been months since journalists had visited the mountainous landscape controlled by drug gangs.
To the number of this week, the Riodoce delivery was designed for three main things.
Julio Cesar Chavez's brother was killed in Sinaloa.
The newspaper was also going to reveal that the government’s money was focused on the city of the governor’s home.
In addition, one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, just a block away from the prosecutor's office, had been kidnapped by a group of people.
There was no official information about who was abducted and how, so we had to move carefully: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was in favour of both drug dealers and public authorities.
The supplier found out in public documents that the restaurant was registered in the names of the politicians of the institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has been controlled by the PRI in Mexico policy at all levels for almost a century.
Recently, the governors involved have been accused of corruption in cases of high publicity.
Villarreal asked the journalist to write about earlier cases in the same place, one of the sons of "El Chapo" Guzman managed to escape and avoid the army's ride.
A few months earlier, readers would have known they would have received reliable information on Valdez’s column about the abduction.
"We would have already known what had happened before," says 46-year-old Villarreal, who has received a grace for his body structure, the nickname "El Flaco", Ohukainen.
"Now all the connections to our sources are broken."
The office of Valdez has been converted into a warehouse that preserves signs and stamps against the persecution of journalists. The employees of the paper have received a new, unexpected task: they have become activists driving press freedom.
The reporter Miriam Ramirez took with him a few signs after he left the following morning to represent the local prosecutor's office for a demonstration, which was the cause of the new journalist's murder.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the West Michoacan State three days after the murder of Valdez.
After the disappearance, a burnt body was found based on the DNA tests by the authorities, Adame.
Journalists have begun to protest more loudly throughout the country, and in favour of the footways and buildings there are "SOS Press" texts.
Today, the leader of Bojorquez is in Washington, where he tries to get international support for the Valdez case investigation.
On the day following Valdez's murder, Ramirez met the governor of Sinaloa and accused the authorities of spying and killing journalists because they told the truth.
He has since asked him to be transferred from the government cases because he is concerned that his anger cannot be objective.
Valdez had repeatedly pointed out that organised crime, authorising authorities and an uninterrupted society surrounded by journalists in Mexico.
In his final book, Narco-Jurnalism Valdez writes that drug gangs are killing journalists, but they are also killed by the order of politicians and security forces in agreement with organised crime.
According to the Articulo 19 control team, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were the result of police and public authorities.
"In Mexico, people are slowed down by killing people," Ramirez says.
Murders have a depressing effect.
No one forgets the death of a blogger, Maria Elizabeth Macias, in the North Tamaulipas border State six years ago.
At his body there was a message signed by the Zetas cartel: "I'm here for my writings."
There was a computer keyboard and headphones next to her head cut off.
Some of the magazines have decided to end their activities, such as the El Norte magazine in the North Chihuahua border State after the painting murder of Miroslava Breach.
Some continue their activities, such as Nuevo Laredon El Manana, even though its leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010 Diario de Ciudad Juarez published a message to drug maples: "What do you want from us?"
Some of the journalists have escaped from their state or the whole country.
It's a difficult decision.
It is difficult to find a job in the exile, and you must be careful all the time.
Sometimes criminals are looking for a journalist, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in the apartment in Mexico City in 2015 three months after he escaped from Veracruz.
For those who continue their work, every day is filled with dangerous decisions.
Ibarra, who used to be a poet, admits that writing about drug trafficking scares.
"I became a journalist because Mexico's on his way to hell," he says.
Some time ago, Riodoce’s journalists sat on Friday midnight with a footway beer when the new number was completed.
In a shooting between competing gangs and security forces at the Mazatlan coastal site, 19 people were killed.
The war accelerated, as was promised in the cartel's messages that were found in the area.
The journalists put the news on Riodoce’s website on a pedestrian on their smartphones.
The front page had to be reset the next day.
The sirens flooded near us — another shooting attack.
Bojorquez took a look at the shipment of guarded cops:
If they were scared, they covered it very well.
Riodoce’s delivery continued the tradition of the murdered founder of the magazine under this massive image, where the man shows the middle finger to all Sinalo.
Bojorquez says that you can't even consider stopping the business. "How can I stop the paper when our trainer asked me to go to the street to do the case the day Javier was murdered?"
The Hannu Mannisen Olympic project started with a huge back-up, a "High place"
In April 39, Hannu Mannisen’s party remained short, for the professional pilot began to prepare for the Olympic period.
However, the exercise period began with a disaster when Manninen was influencing.
It started a long period of illness, which took almost five weeks.
May practically went to full illness.
At first, there was flu and finally a child’s disease such as an ear inflammation that I had to eat an antibiotic cell.
I was able to make only 10% of the scheduled exercises.
I don't remember the last time I've been so sick.
It was a tough place when I didn't get used to internships, and Manninen's gonna tell me about the evening-Sanom.
Test result collapsed
The World Champion of 2007 received a training permit only during the second week of June, which was seen in the KIHU roll-out test of the racing and excellence research centre on 12 June.
In the test, the athlete skis on a roller carpet with a speed growing every three minutes.
After every three minutes, the carpet stops for about 10 seconds, and the tester takes a milk acid sample from the athlete's finger on the needle.
Last autumn on the carpet for 32 minutes, but now I only stayed for 28 minutes.
It came against the wall, Manninen tells me.
In a better direction
After the initial rights, Manninen tells me he's staying healthy.
I've done a variety of peaceful aerobic exercises that I've been trying to normalize the body's metabolism.
Now there's a really good five-week episode.
It was also a half-week holiday for flight work.
I had time to go to the cabin with my family.
During the last period, Manninen only participated in four world cup competitions before the Lahde MM dogs.
The best result was seen in the opening contest immediately when Manninen rose on the top skiing to the 18th.
Guideline drawn
Manninen and Head Coach of the Land Team Petter Kukkonen have made an internship and competition plan until next February.
Now we're looking for a different sort of rhythm compared to practice in the last season.
After the first races, Ruka would have the weekend of the three worldcups.
In December, it was meant to be at least one of the world cup weekends, perhaps in Ramsau.
At the end of January, the plans would still be involved in Seefeld.
Hopefully after that, we can find the name on the Olympic Team's list, Manninen says.
The Pyeongchang Olympics would be the sixth Winter Olympics for Mannis.
Now the most important thing is to remain healthy, in Salt Lake City, in 2002, the golden team contest celebrated a nummel underline.
Dinosaurus was protected from his enemies by masking
At first, it looks like a scary statue.
The researchers have now revealed the first findings of the creature of the monkey size found by the Canadian mining worker, which had been so well preserved that the experts call it the Mona Lisai of the dinosaurs.
It had been so well preserved that researchers could even define that its Finnish skin was red brown and had been "problemous past".
According to current Biology, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur and the best representatives of its world species.
The recently found fossil is a nodosaurus, which lived in the mid-term of the Union period between 110 and 12 million years ago.
Researchers consider this astonishingly well-preserved fossil as a truly significant discovery.
According to the National Geographic magazine, the armored vegetarian is the best preserved fossil in its species ever.
It was found in the Suncor Millenium mine in North Alberta, Canada on 21 March 2011, and the founder was the mine man named Shawn Funk.
He hit something that seemed not to be a natural part of the surrounding rock and decided to examine his discovery more closely.
The fossil found in the rock was sent to Tyrrelli's royal paleontological museum.
For six years, the beast was dug out of a 100 - kilos log.
The results of the hard work are now visible.
"If you squeeze your eyes, you can almost believe it was sleeping," says researcher Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher at the royal museum of Tyrrelli.
"It remains in the history of science of the dinosaurs Mona Lisana, one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs.
The study of the skin revealed that dinosaurs eating meat were likely to be a major threat to this vegetarian, even though it had a armor and resembled a walking tank.
Its red-white armor masks its predators, and it was also protected by darker and lighter colouring, which still occurs in many animals.
According to experts, it was better to mix with its environment and avoid enemies, greater dinosaurs.
The 110 million - year - old nodosaur rose into the titles in May, and now it is an exhibition in the royal paleontological museum of Tyrrelli.
Scientists have given it the name of Borealope, a brandmitchelli museum engineer according to Mark Mitchell, who belonged to a team that took over 7,000 hours to dig up a dinosaur.
The Nodosaurus has remained so amazingly well that Mitchell and the international team of researchers have been able to determine the patterns and shapes of the body's bowls and armor.
They found that it was still protected by the animal world by a general color, where the body is darker and lighter than it is.
However, the observation was a surprise because Borealope is considerably larger than the present animals with similar colouring.
It can be concluded that the dinosaurs that eat meat have preyed to the extent that evolution is favorable as a means of survival instead of hiding the battle.
Of the present animals, such as peuros, zebras and armadillos, they are much smaller and therefore easier to catch, which indicates that nodosaur too was seriously threatened.
"The prey of a large, strongly armed dinosaur tells us how dangerous the dinosaurs of the Union season were," Brown says.
The chemical analysis of Nodosaur's soil organic compounds reveals that its skin was red brown.
Scientists continue to study the nodosaur in order to draw conclusions on its life, including the content of the intestine to find out what it ate with its last meal.
Scientists believe that it fell in the river when it died and drifted onto the sea where it drowned into the bottom of the sea.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as today in Florida, and the rivers and the seas are likely to extend much further than today.
“This nodosaur is really important because its soft leather has been preserved and has also been maintained in a three-dimensional manner in its original form,” says Brown.
"That's why it looks almost the same as in the early Union season.
It doesn't require much imagination: if you squeeze a little eyes, you can almost believe it was sleeping."
The season was the age of the teropods, the vast two-length dinosaurs eating meat.
Although their king, Tyrannosaurus rex, or millions of years earlier, Borealopelta, its great predecessors may have preyed this armored dinosaur.
The predecessors of Tyrannosaurus rex included, for example, Acrocanthosaurus, an approximately 11.5 metre long six-ton monster.
The latest findings of Nodosaur scientists have been published in the Current Biology magazine. They believe that Borealope washed into the sea after his death and mothed into mud.
It was found in the Suncor Millenium mine in North Alberta, Canada on 21 March 2011, and the founder was the mine man named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the world's best preserved armored dinosaur with leather and pants from the leather to the hip.
The Nodosaurs were five metres long on average and weighed up to 1 300 kilograms.
Its stages rose up two yards of wires.
Researchers believe that this armored vegetarian went through the current West Canada until the flooded river moved it to the open sea.
Its armor has preserved small details in the sea grave.
Its fossilized remains have remained so well that its skin is still left in the laces of the panzer along its skull.
Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic magazine that such preservation is "one rare as a lottery victory.
The more you look at it, the more amazing it feels.
There is still fossilated leather on the plates of its skull wall.
Its right front leg is on its side, five toes up.
"I can also count the base bows of that foot."
How did one activist learn to answer the question: Whose streets belong?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked on 9.8.2014.
He had arrived in New York a day earlier from St. Louis and sat on his airbnb apartment on his bed, twisting on Facebook with his phone.
Then he noticed a message from his high school friend:
"The cop just killed a 18-year-old, and his body is still on the street."
When he was confused, he noticed that no one else had posted the same information on his feed. That's why he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
His timeline had numerous re-twists from the user @TheePharoah.
A user name belongs to a rapper living in St. Louis who tweeted in real time about Michael Brown's death, and the white police had shot an unarmed 18-year-old black brown in Ferguson in the state of Missour.
The user had also posted a picture of Brown’s lifeless body on the street where it was left for four hours.
"This is incredible," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
He put his phone off, and when he returned to Twitter later on the same night, they told me that people were gathering on Canfield Drive.
Users posted photos of police capsules and screaming people, and of the man who claimed Brown himself to be a father, who was wearing the sign, said, "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
Ferrell followed a real-time video of the police standing in front of the demonstrators with a dog who was barking.
He says he also saw a video where another policeman put his rifle and screamed, "I'm gonna kill all of you... animals."
"This isn't normal," Ferrell remembers.
"It wasn't the kind of murder we've been used to and could be called typical.
That's when I felt cold colors.
I was angry and I was crying."
He booked a return trip home for the next day.
Ferrell went to pick up his six-year-old daughter's father and decided to go to Ferguson the next morning.
About what happened to Ferrelli and Ferguson in the next three years, a documentary film "Whose Streets" was made.
The film is a story of survival and demonstration, love and loss, and strength and persistence from the point of view of the local people who went to the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove towards Ferguson and his daughter who was dressed in a collar that was compatible with it, they re-examined what it was like to live in black and what conditions. They had spoken about it countlessly before that morning.
"Do you remember when I told you how blacks have had to fight for the things they believe in?" Ferrell remembers what he said to his daughter.
"We're going to Ferguson because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and it's not right."
"I couldn't take my daughter with me," Ferrell told me later.
"This day's events are... the summit of past events.
My daughter has the right to know and grow into it.
He must have the capacity to activism and organization, but he must also know the different layers and conditions of the experience of living as black and black. And he must know what we have to do to free ourselves.
Fortunately, even though I have been able to protect her from brutal racism, she is still the same as other black girls.
I feel like I'd hurt her if I were to protect her from reality."
Their first stop in Ferguson was the South Florissant Road across the police station, which became an activist camp site, waiting for information on the case and finally found out that there would be no charges against the police.
That's where Ferrell and his daughter went to help a local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunches in their bags and distributed them to demonstrators.
Ferrell started to gradually react to activism in a new way.
"My activism changed completely after 9 August," he says. When he studied at Missour University in St. Louis, Ferrell was the chairman of the Nurse Students' Association of minorities, he focused on the right of food and health differences in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
"Something it just happened."
Some weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, the assistant director of the documentary.
Folayan said that he and the photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar “will simply tell me what was happening.
He said, "Do you really want to tell me what's going on, or do you want a story you can use?"
The background of the doubt was the countless times when people in the local community had appeared, usually white people who wanted only to benefit from their difficulties and stamina.
"We had heard that those who were born and raised in Ferguson had no common voice," Folayan recently told us, "We wanted to do things differently."
Folayan had already contacted Deputy Counselor Damon Davis, known for his activism with the prisoners of death.
Davis' involvement led Ferrelli to join the project together with six other locals, followed the events of the shooting of Brown in the years following.
"This is not a documentary where someone speaks to us or speaks for us, but we speak," says Davis.
"I was the most important thing about how local people are being presented in the movie because I'm being presented in the same way."
According to Folayan, it was not intended to focus on Ferrelli's experiences because it was wanted to show that the folk movement "is not a charismatic leader but a community". However, Ferrell proved to be more transparent.
Therefore, the document sees surprising private aspects of Ferrelli's life, such as falling in love and getting married.
"I felt pretty naked," Ferrell laughs telling me what it felt like to see the movie for the first time.
"But I realized that this work and the human image of the blacks requires certain vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrelli's story repeatedly and brings back to midnight the role of black queer women in the wider Black Lives Matter.
The movement was born in social media (#BlackLivesMatter) after the police had shot a black teenager named Trayvon Martin in 2012. Two of the three founders of the movement are identical to the queer identity.
"The leadership of the Muslim queer women has maintained the entire movement," Ferrell says. "It's because we have to fight constantly on many fronts.
The black queer women have had to endure everything."
Folayan agrees: "The movement is indeed maintained by black women with many queer women."
However, he stresses that Ferrelli was not selected in the document because of its "self-reasonable" identity.
"He got the energy moving," Folayan says.
"But there is no coincidence that she was in the front line. Black queer women live at a lot of things at the surgery site, and they have a lot in the game.
His energy passes from a white fabric."
Ferguson has been left by the news description teams a long time ago, but the Community and the police are still tense.
Ferrelli has two and a half years left of parole, and he was sentenced to block the motorway at the demonstration.
His description of the social climate in their home corners is short and core: "Insecurity."
Yet he still trusts in the strike clause which he learned outside Ferguson's streets three years ago:
"Our authority is to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We have to love and support each other.
We can only lose our chains."
A suitable similarity: an artist creates images of Chelsea Manning's DNA.
The Fridman Gallery in New York has been hung in the middle of the exhibition space with faces – white, black and brown faces, with a view to identifying similarity.
These 30 works are the images made by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg based on the DNA samples taken from Chelsea Manning's cheek and hair.
Manning sent samples of Fort Leavenworth's prison where he executed 35 years of sentence. Manning was sentenced to leak secretly classified diplomatic telegrams on the WikiLeaks site.
Dewey-Hagborgin A Becoming Resemblance was opened on 2.8.2017.
It has two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, IT and art. Manning is a transnatal and career-driven contemporary contemporary contemporary, whose prison sentence by Barack Obama reduced his term of office to the third day.
Dewey-Hagborg analysed Manning's DNA algorithmically and created 30 formats based on his genetic data. They are sharp, although a little theoretical statement on the reconciliation of DNA data, multidisciplinary and interpretation-based causal consequences and identity.
Chelsea Manning, born in the name of Bradley Edward, has openly stated that he has been identified as women since the break-in of the country. In 2013 he was found guilty of 20 crimes, including violations of the spy law, computer fraud and theft.
There was only one picture of the prison sentenced Manning: a granule, black-white selfie, where the troubled-like Manning sits in the car at the driver's location. He has a platinum wig on his head, which became his mark.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg had a major popularity in the Stranger Visions project, which he carried out in 2012.
That's where he created photographs based on criminal records, and he got DNA data, for example, about cigarettes and bitumens, and created pictures of what those people might have looked like.
Then the artist received an e-mail from the Paper Magazine magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Mannig and needed a picture of their cases," Dewey-Hagborg told me about the new exhibition at the press conference.
He couldn't visit Manning, and he couldn't be photographed in prison, so he contacted Chelsea and asked if he'd be interested in making a DNA image of Manning.
Suddenly, the artist and his captive music became associates of correspondence, writing to each other for a couple of years.
They even made a series of Suppressed Images together, which was pictured by Shoili Kanungo. It described the future where the President would have alleviated Chelsea's judgment and he would be able to watch the exhibition.
In fact, Obama shortened Manning's judgment only a few days after the publication of the comic book. It was a lucky coincidence after seven hard years in the National Military Prison.
It is also impressive that the exhibition will be opened right now, when Donald Trump takes his own war against the information leaks and transsexual soldiers and still invent new ways in Twitter to strengthen the powerful harassments that he was actually supposed to alleviate.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that "everything has its purpose."
On the wall of Galleria, there is an artist's statement and under it the great sign of Manning, with the heart of the last name i. In his statement, the artist demands the end of the "automatic distribution on which sex, race, sexuality and culture are based".
On the opposite wall, Manning's DNA episode is the long line of C, G and A letters on the lead pen.
With this combination of 200 letters — or a nucleotide, such as the scientific definition used by the artist — Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we are, at least our biology.
"I hope my exhibition will help people to understand that we are equal from our genes and that genetic data are very personal and open to interpretations", says Dewey-Hagborg. The exhibition also shows his Spurious Memories video from 2007.
"DNA tells countless stories, and there's 30 of them here."
The final work of the exhibition is in its own room: page of the comic book of Manning and Dewey-Hagborg.
That's where Manning's character gets out of jail like King Kong, with a megaphone in his hand.
"If they make you quiet, they've won," the picture says.
"Don't ever shut up."
"The art is from the letter I got from Manning," says the artist from Philadelphia.
"It's so impressive that I'm still getting cold colors."
Unlike the comic book described, Manning has not yet seen the exhibition. When Manning comes in, he greeted his own gene data based on the face as a group of demonstrators in the middle of the exhibition space.
It is deliberate, as is all else in this exhibition: for example, Manning's DNA cycle is written with a lead pen on a height similar to its length (157,5 cm).
"The faces were on the wall earlier, but I wanted to bring the crowd to them," says Dewey-Hagborg.
"I wanted to describe the mass movement created by Chelsea, which was also behind his release."
Professor of Northwestern University and Oxford University employee are being searched for murder suspects.
The police report that they have launched national searches to find a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at the University of Oxford, suspected of stabbing a man to death in a chicagoly luxury apartment.
The records of the Cook County Court show that on Monday, arrest warrants were issued for the murder of Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56 suspected of the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to the documents, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed several times.
According to the local newsletter published by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on 27.7.2017.
The police alarmed the Grand Plaza apartment building found a victim with multiple wounds of wounds in his bodies.
According to the authorities, Cornell-Duranleau was found dead at the scene and the stabs are being investigated as murder, actively looking for two suspects.
Lathem has worked as a assistant professor in microbiology and immunology at Nortwestern University since 2007.
In the opinion sent by e-mail, Vice-President Alan K. Cubbage, responsible for social relations of the University, said that Lathem is now free of administrative power and is prohibited from access to the campuses of the Northwestern University.
"This is a crime that the authorities are investigating, and the Northwestern University is helping the investigation," Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as a parent as a financial assistant at the University of Oxford.
The opinion sent by e-mail to the University and the Somerville College states that "we have been in contact with the police in Britain and we are ready to assist the authorities investigating the case in the United States in all possible ways."
In addition, the opinion stated that Mr Warren's colleagues are shocked and hoped that he would surrender.
Anthony Guglielmi, CEO of the Chicago Police Department, said that he called on the suspects to give them seriously to the authorities.
"Police has an idea of where they are, and we keep clarifying our searches," said Guglielmi.
According to Guglielm, local, regional and national authorities are helping search for suspects.
He told the police that he received a call from the master of the Grand Plaza building, who had received a vague indication that something had happened in the apartment of 1008.
The police described the view at the scene as terrible.
According to Guglielm, it is unclear whether the victim was murdered the same day or earlier.
He told me the security cameras revealed that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had an affair," says Guglielmi.
The Grand Plaza Management Group published the following communication to the residents: "The police would currently examine the course of events and the background of the victim, as well as possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence."
The man threatened to blow up the Islamic bookstore and kill Muslims in London.
"I'm not an anti-muslim, I'm a Catholic," sentenced to the police.
Moffatt must perform 100 hours of unpaid social service.
A 39-year-old man was sentenced to explode an Islamic bookstore in London and kill all Muslims.
According to the Independent magazine, David Moffatt was sentenced, among other things, for gross harassment.
According to the police, they were alerted by the bookstore staff on 23 May.
According to the staff, he was like, "Fucking to blow up the bookstore and kill the Muslims."
The suspect left the store after the threats.
Moffatt was caught when he called the police for a threat.
The threat was not related to the events of the bookstore.
The authorities noticed that Moffatt had dressed in the same way as the suspect in the bookstore, the police informant said.
I'm not an anti-muslim. I'm a Catholic. Moffatt told the cops in interrogation.
As a punishment, a man must carry out 100 hours of unpaid social service and pay GBP 620, i.e. the legal costs of EUR 690 and GBP 85, i.e. compensation for victims of EUR 95.
Scotland Yard's informant says a number of anger crimes are ignored.
"We will complete the activities under the WADA road map in the near future" – Vice-President of Russia Vitaly Mutko
Vice-President of Russia Vitaly Mutko has said that Russia will soon complete the activities under the World Antidoping Office’s WADA road map to restore the powers of the Russian Antidoping Commission RUSA.
"A part of the road map measures have already been taken, and RUSA was entitled to design and test in cooperation with the UKAD of the UKAD of the UKAD.
The WADA road map has been updated in this respect," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Vice-President commented on the second part of the WADA road map, which sets out the conditions for the return of RUSADA's powers. The second part of the road map was recently published on the website of the organization.
According to Mutkko, it does not contain anything worrying for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, and everything is implemented.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and to WADA in the near future," Mutko added.
However, one of the points of the road map requires the Russian antidoping authorities to publicly approve the results of the investigation by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren. McLaren examines the State's alleged share in the Russian sport doping.
To that, Mutko said: "The investigation is ongoing because our antidoping system has acknowledged the failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no state programmes, and we cannot admit something that didn't exist."
The words of Mutko were echoes of the opinion of Mr Vitaly Smirnov, President of the Russian independent Public Antidoping Commission.
Earlier on the same day, Smirnov, who spoke to the Russian RSport sports media, acknowledged that there have been problems in the antidopings in Russia. "We have said several times that the report has had disputed statements and regulations.
We are not going to accept the report unconditionally, but he added.
WADA ordered RUSADA to stop doping control in Russia in November 2015 when the scope of the doping scandal had been revealed.
However, in June last year it was authorised to design and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
WADA's leader Olivier Niggli visited the headquarters of RUSADA in Moscow in July. After the visit he stated that the organization was in a "right way" towards the return of powers.
The British organization skeptical to Finns on loving innovation: "no evidence of the health benefits of maternity packs"
The British organization suspects the benefits of Finnish-style maternity packings.
Among other things, BBC and Guardian tells us that Lullaby Trust, a fighter against the dead, is prohibiting the use of their own brochures in maternity packs distributed in Britain.
Distribution of maternity packs to all pregnant women will begin this month in Scotland.
In England, packaging is also distributed in some areas.
According to Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that a maternity pack would reduce the risk of concealing death.
Death is an unexplainable death of the baby.
Lullaby Trust is an expert on the British health authorities at the child’s safe sleep.
We will no longer allow our official brochures to be packed into them because it would allow us to understand that we recommend this product, the organization informed.
In Finland there is one of the lowest child mortality figures in the world, only two dead thousands of births.
According to Lullaby Trust, the good reading of Finland is the result of many different reasons, such as a small number of teenage sicknesses.
The fact that they give each family a box may be one factor.
However, that cannot be said surely, Lullaby Trust's CEO Francine Bates said.
We are concerned that maternity packs are marketed as products that reduce child mortality and hidden deaths.
Maternity pack is a Finnish invention, and it is given to all mothers in Finland for free for 80 years.
The package contains various equipment, such as children's clothes.
This year there are 53 products in the pack.
The package itself is a box in which the child can be put to bed.
According to the Scottish Government, the boxes it distributes meet all security standards.
Lullaby Trust, on the other hand, says that there are no security standards for the boxes as a place to sleep.
According to Lullaby Trust, the packaging can be the best option for a place to sleep if there is no cradle or surface bed available.
The organisation recommends using the package only for daytime sleep and stop using it at the time the child is able to turn.
The organization also recommends keeping pets away from the packaging and to ensure that it does not get wet or wet.
The fox frog fled from the Japanese zoo again
The Japanese zoo staff is looking for a quarantised turtle.
The giant turtle has been surprised at the speed of the staff and has already escaped to repeat in two weeks.
The Turtle escaped from the Shibukawa Zoo in Okama west Japan on Tuesday morning.
The security cameras revealed that the frog left the zoo through the main entrance.
It will not die immediately because it eats grass around the zoo, but we are very worried about Yoshimi Yamane, who works in the zoo.
A 35-year-old villain is female, 55-pounded and about metres long.
Yamane describes the fugitive as quiet and gentle.
During the opening hours, the villain can walk freely in the area of the garden.
The zoo hasn't seen any signs of a turtle.
The previous runaway of the Konna happened the other week.
Yamane found a fugitive walking along the road 150 metres from the zoo.
I noticed it on my way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help, Yamane told me.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These startups help your company to avoid Uber errors
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of workers in their start-up business, but the surveys did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless or even misleading.
Although he assured that the surveys were anonymous, some of the workers were suspicious of them.
"The issues were simply not consistent or objective," said Errett. As his hair management company, Madison Reed focuses on online trade, with 75 employees.
This is what this is about to take advantage of outside help.
More and more new types of start-ups in personnel management have emerged on the market, helping other companies to figure out how their employees can.
They develop and license software that can measure the commitment of workers; they can ask questions and target them to certain teams and groups of populations, and provide unnamed reporting services to their employees, and in some cases direct links across the top management of the government.
"Own health can be followed by applications such as Strava and Fitbit, but where will Fitbit be staying?" asks the founder and CEO Jim Barnett of the Glint Star in Redwood City. Glint provides companies with analytical software to measure the commitment of employees.
Errett has been using Glint's software for three years, telling him he has gained a deeper view of his employees' thoughts and feelings.
The programme can make quick questionnaires and votes for certain teams, and it can also draw up a map of which you can see at one point, in which departments workers are more unsatisfactory and which leaders have received the weakest estimates.
Companies have understood that they need to monitor the job culture so that they do not become the next Uber.
For start-ups like Glint, such negligence is an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation and conformity are a global sector that can be valued by the Let's Talk Payments website to more than $ 118.7 billion by 2020.
Convercent in Denver, the Convercent in Colorado, is an startup that helps companies to detect and prevent unnecessary use. Interesting the company grew earlier this year when Uber's reputation suffered a crash.
Convercent has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It also made an agreement with Uber recently.
Like Glint, Convercent gives companies the opportunity to make customised surveys, to collect answers confidentially in real time and to map problem areas.
In addition, workers can anonymously inform the use of unauthorised behaviour by SMS.
And if a leader is to be suspected of inconvenience, the complaints go directly to the company's government.
"The general opinion has excluded the authorities," says Convercent's founder and CEO Patrick Quinlan.
He recalls that if the company treats his employees poorly or acts uneatically, the consequences may become expensive even if the authorities do not interfere with it, and consumers can start to bococulate the company and may also lose workers and be challenged.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain has more than 25 000 employees at 500 offices, and the company has used Convercent over a year because it wants to ensure that workers are aware of the policies and procedures and that they can easily contact the headquarters.
Previously, the practice was that if the employee wanted to report the problem, he had to first find out the phone number or e-mail address that could make a notification to the headquarters. Then he had to make a formal complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
“It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience,” says Ruby Tuesday’s Director of Law, James Vitrano. According to him, complaints made by employees were difficult to follow.
In the past, problems remained hidden from leaders in another city or state, and now problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can be detected and dealt with faster.
"I have a more comprehensive and comprehensive idea of the reality of the employee," says Vitrano, leading to Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
At the same time, we protect our shareholders from judicial proceedings relating to employment relationships.
According to Quinlan, companies began to take more serious views on ethics, values and employee commitment after the audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed as a result of unethical activity in the Enron scandal.
Only with social media, companies understood that they could no longer prevent their dirty washing from being publicly cleared.
"The hope was used as a strategy before technology came into control of ethics," says Quinlan.
Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service that is regularly charged.
Both Glint and Convercent are supported by capital investors.
Convercent collected $10 million from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital in February and has collected capital of $47 million.
Glint received EUR 10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and has collected a total of USD 60 million.
Investments are not a surprise in view of the links between companies, business culture and venture capital.
According to several studies, workers are expecting more from their jobs.
Good wages on a competing market such as Piilaaxo, and interesting projects are only the beginning.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they give their time to a genuinely useful company.
"Employers are more committed to the success of the company if they enjoy the company and feel that they are listened and that their work is rewarding," says Nina McQueen, director of the employee's reward and well-being company.
Investors will receive income when companies succeed, and companies will succeed when employees commit themselves.
Third-party analytical tools promise to strengthen the commitment of workers, so it is no wonder that they are interested in investors.
According to the experts of the workplace culture, information on the commitment of workers is important;
but it is useless if it does not lead to measures.
If the company asks for feedback from his employees, it can be considered as a sign of change.
And if the change does not come fast enough or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce the commitment of workers.
"If four thousand proposals are requested, it must be ready to conduct four thousand discussions," says Russel Raath, President of the Business Management Advisory Company, Russell Raath, who has seen the companies rely too much on simply the collection of information.
"If the company fails to take action, the workers start wondering if they're heard.
and whether their opinions matter anything.
If the company doesn't care about them, why should they care about the company?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed is currently conducting staff surveys every month and is able to deal with the problem on the same day as it is reported in Glint.
When Errett had collected feedback from those who were frustrated by slow decision-making and communication quality, he was able to make changes to teams and organise communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday better understands its employees and hopes that deeper understanding will help to improve the sustainability of staff in the long term in an industry known for the high variability of workers.
"If the company does not commit itself to creating a culture of transparency, it will lose workers," says Vitrano.
"If it loses employees, it also loses customers.
And without customers, there are no companies."
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of smuggling his naked neighbour, reports the news office TT.
A woman in Gothenburg had come home from the shower when she had noticed a cell phone hanging at the end of the rope outside her window.
According to the woman, the cell phone camera took a picture of the apartment.
A woman who was scared of the case had run into another room to dress.
When a woman arrived to check the situation, the cell phone was pulled up first, but soon after it was recalculated in the window.
A 20-year-old man who was suspected of concealing the image has admitted that he has taken a picture of a woman.
But he claimed that he only pictured the face of a woman.
The video on the cell phone was removed, and the police had failed to restore it as evidence.
In interrogations, the man has admitted that he did, but he has refused to commit a crime.
The man who was filming it was right to say that he loves his neighbor as "was insane."
According to TT, a man will be charged with the case.
Teachers demand more autumn during negotiations
The wage development cannot be lower than the export industry, for example, but the difference should be reduced, said Olli Luukkainen, President of the OAJ on Thursday.
The temporary operation of public holiday money highlights the difference, he points out.
We do not have the opportunity to conclude agreements that would in any way not have been involved in the review.
In the municipal sector, contracts will only be concluded after the private sector's papers have been signed and the percentage increases have been established.
A large number of people predict that, for example, OAJ’s working conditions have been agreed in January.
The percentage targets Luukkainen has not yet revealed.
Juko is also the president of the public-skilled negotiating organisation.
Luxurious: Holiday money surgeon increases earnings disparities
According to the OAJ, statistics and forecasts show that the purchasing power of public sector employees is deteriorating while the private sector’s purchasing power is increasing.
According to a large number of people, the periodic holiday payment operation further increases the pay gaps.
In Finland, it is necessary to define how many students per teacher can be
Furthermore, the OAJ notes that the equivalence of basic education must be ensured, as the best and poorer differences are growing all the time.
Under the organisation, learning results will weaken and the differences between students and regions will continue to grow.
The day of the Bruins players extended when the NCAA reduced daily exercises in two to one
It's almost 11:00 a.m., and a bunch of American football players in UCLA have left to talk to the campus on the other side of the new training fields.
Some of them have stripped off their shirt, and their backs shine from the sweat after the first day of the training camp.
Time for many of them, this couple of minutes of conversation is a noon break.
After three hours of training, the players at the university's summer courses will return to the apartment to read the final exams, and the next morning they will meet at half seven at Wasserman's football center.
"The next three days will be tough for these friends," says Bruins Coach Jim Mora a little before Monday's change to Tuesday.
The overstudy camping organization reduced the number of daily internships in two together. The change was designed to reduce the number of players, but it has extended their days – at least until Friday, when the final tests are held.
That is why the first three exercises of UCLA began at 15 o'clock in the evening.
The limitation of training times a day means that there are more training days than before. This year the camp began almost a week earlier than last year, and this is the first time in the Westwood Coach period through Mora six, when exercises are held at the same time as summer courses.
Practices are to be held 18 times before the 20th of August, when the actual preparation for the opening of the season: UCLA meets the Texas A&M University in September.
Mora says that he supported NCAA's change in the rules, even though it made it even more stringent than the players' schedules.
"We really load them a lot for three or four days, and it's very challenging," says Mora.
"But the players are ready to work, they're great friends.
I think the situation will make it easier when we get to Saturday, and then we'll have more time.
The UCLA closes the exercises from outside after the camp. It is not easy to take into account the direct view of the training fields to the next parking area and the Luskin Center, a flat hotel that has already been bombed on footballs flying over the protection network behind the paint.
The Bruins players are supposed to move to the hotel next weekend, but Mora admits that problems may arise during the period when the rooms are available to outsiders.
"We have security," Mora says.
"As a matter of concern, people can book a room and film exercises from there on the video. It is not an overwhelming concern.
The video from the exercises is pretty much paid.
But we have guards there and the parking lot.
We'll do our best.
I'm not gonna bother my head too much.
We have a plan."
Freedom to Rwanda
In Rwanda, Central Africa, the presidential elections are held on Friday, and the winner is already held clear.
Paul Kagame is formally seeking for his third period, but in practice he has had an impact on the leadership of the country since 1994.
That was when the rebel group of RPF ended the genocide organised by extremists.
Kagame was commander of the RPF.
Kagame has been criticised, among other things, for the crushing of opposition and for limiting the freedom of the word.
He has also been accused of, for example, distortions of poverty statistics.
For the third period, Kagame will be able to pursue, because the two constitutions of the Presidentship have been changed.
However, in Rwanda Kagame is also a genuinely held leader.
During his time, social reforms have been made in Rwanda and international investments have been carried out.
In addition, Kagame has played a major role in reunification of the country shared by genocide.
Ruanda's success has led many African people to ask whether liberal multiparty democracy is the right model for African countries.
However, Kagame too has promised his people more freedom after the earth has been raised on his feet.
Now could be a good time to start.
Facebook fights false news by stepping up the checks on facts
Facebook intends to send possible false news to independent inspectors and to present the results under the original article. The world's largest social network reported on Thursday.
The company published on its website an opinion that it begins to use updated engineering in identifying false news. Any false news will be sent to the facts inspectors and the results may be published under the original article.
Facebook has been criticised for the fact that it is the biggest distributors of false news, and many believe that false news influenced the outcome of the United States presidential elections in 2016.
The issue has risen to a political debate in Europe where French electorates were bombed with false news before the May presidential elections and Germany preparing for the September elections supports the plan to fine social media networks if they do not quickly remove hostile content.
On Thursday, Facebook announced in a separate opinion published in Germany that the facts are being tested in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"The people want to see what stories do not pass the independent inspector's sculpture. They also want more background information to be able to decide more enlightened what they read and distribute", the Facebook news feed product manager Sara Su wrote in the company's blog.
He added that Facebook will continue to test the related articles and also make other changes to his news feed to reduce false news.
Created a comic book: Story of a castle
The small castle of Scotney in the Kent county is now known as Squeeze's music video and Margaret Thatcher's hideout from the 1970s and the 1980s.
But it has 700 years of stormy history, and now this charming place in the Bewl River Valley is a subject to a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes, an old mop-hair writer.
"It's great to be able to study the text written by a dead person over 300 years ago," says Rhodes very much.
"I know a personal connection when I hold the letter in my hand."
The book of Rhodes, A Castle in England, reports the stories of the families living in Scotney from mid-time to the Edvardian time. Each story has been imagined by a different artist, a promising British comician: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book based on the archives of Rhodes. In 2014, Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories appeared from him, whose enthusiasms were the documents of the British National Library.
"I moved into tears when I noticed a letter of thumbs, and a double agent who worked for divisions in the 17th century had written on the letter," says Rhodes.
"It was his fingerprint!
And the letters smell like smoke, because at that time the lighting was used.
Three centuries later, the reader feels that he's on his own.
I love archives!"
The author who was conspiring in old documents was allowed to live in the castle for almost four months with the support of the National Trust Foundation and the National Council of Arts of England, which seemed too good to be true.
He spent days exploring the victorian "new" castle, archives, treasures and rares, such as the walls hanged hyena heads and the bottles in the valley for centuries.
He circulated the ruins and farms of the old castle and discussed it with forestkeepers, gardeners, and sometimes the artists who were imagining the book.
I'd like to meet him, "He took whiskey, and he started writing."
Scotney's closer history is quite unknown, since the castle was transferred to the National Trust Foundation only after the death of the last heir Elizabeth Hussey in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the Foundation’s staff was just about to begin the archive visit. Rhodes describes that the archives had been held for hundreds of years by the same method: by taking all the extra stuff to the attic.
There were journals in the archives, letters from the time of the British Empire and maps about who owned anything. "You could imagine that the country disputes are boring," says Rhodes. "In this place, however, families fought even for one hardship.
I thought we'd let it be."
Some of the stories of the book are moving from the castle to the history of England, such as The Labourer. It relates to a man who soon after the castle was completed in 1381.
"The Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex mentions that there was a riot in the castle in 1380," says Rhodes.
"The English housewife rebel began in the same area, and it reminded me that the rebellion can begin with riot.
Maybe these events are connected?"
The other stories of the book are closely related to the history of the castle, such as The Priest, the story of the priest, hidden by Darrell’s family for seven years during the Kingdom of Religion.
The Smuggler again tells smuggler Arthur Darrell's story in the 17th century. He was said to frame his own funeral with stones filled with a coffin (they were discovered years later when his grave was opened).
Darrellit is the favorite family of Rhodes in Scotney.
The men of Darrell's family solved their debt problem by marrying wealthy old women, and I see them as handsome friends who knew how to squeeze heritage."
Now Rhodes is looking for new writing experience.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book of Life Hill, a parlor in the early 1900s, with only an eutrophic property left.
Scotney's castle has a special place in her heart.
"It was sad to leave there," he says.
"I didn't want to go back to this damn ark yet."
You're going to the worst in Russia then a cold war
The military union between NATO and Russia has clearly deteriorated, commented by the Secretary-General of NATO Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its position in the Ukrainian conflict.
I believe that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the cold war, Stoltenberg said in the CNN interview.
After the end of the cold war, we hoped that we could try to work closely with Russia.
However, in particular after the illegal accession of Crimea in 2014 and due to the persistent instability caused by Russia in the eastern Ukraine region, NATO's relationship with Russia has worsened considerably.
However, according to Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed to doing so that tensions do not exacerbate.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can have a political dialogue with Russia to avoid the acceleration of the situation and the new cold war.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, US President Donald Trump was able to find that between the United States and Russia had run even to a dangerously bad level.
Trump urged me to thank the poor congress of the countries that adopted the new sanctions against Russia last week.
Vladimir Klitshko stops the replay against Anthony Joshua will not happen.
Professional boxing for a long-term heavy series world champion Vladimir Klitshko will end his career.
Ukraine Klitshko, 41, announced its decision on Thursday morning.
Atlanta’s Olympics in 1996, Klitshko, who hit gold, fought as a professional 69 times, winning from the games 64.
He held different MM notes in 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitshko lost two final matches of his career.
Tyson Fury hit him with points in November 2015.
In April this year, Klitshko met Anthony Joshua at the Wembley Stadium and lost after the brutal fight at the 11th round.
Joshua and Klitshko were expected to meet at a retreat in Las Vegas in November.
However, Klitshko did not find any motivation for the fight.
I was deliberately using a few weeks to make a decision so that I could get enough distance to the Wembley match, Klitshko told me in his briefing.
As an amateur and professional boxer, I got everything I wanted to do, and now I want to start my second career after sport.
I could never have imagined that I had such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I'm very grateful for that.
See Klitshko's argument on the video that she decided.
Klitshko’s manager, Bernd Bönte, stated in the Notice that the decision to terminate was difficult for Klitshko.
But he has always stressed that he wants to stop if he doesn't have enough motivation anymore.
That is why this is definitely the right decision, Bönte said.
Klitshko has dated with the American actor, Hayden Panettiere since 2009.
The couple has one child, a daughter of Kaya born in 2014.
Klitshko's great brother Vitali is also the former heavyweight world champion.
In 2008-12, the brothers managed the MMs of different alliances at the same time.
Finland's weather breaker is inclined to the circumstances: "Vie from the fiil"
Minna Nikkanen has suffered conditions during the summer's external railing season.
Minna Nikas has had problems with circumstances.
The wind and the cold have taken the woman out of the fridge.
Even in London's MM contests, there are unstable conditions.
Minna Nikkanen speaks weather.
The conditions have been this summer a slope jumper against Minna Nika.
I don't want to blame the track, but it was incomprehensible that I couldn't even get the little spears to move properly, Nican said after the Innsbruck race.
I've been competing and practicing here know how many times and I've never experienced the same divergent wind in this place, Nikkanen told Paavo Nurmin Games.
During this period, the standardisation of the jump has been very difficult, even when there have been so unstable winds in exercises, Nikkanen said in Kaleva’s races.
Even on Thursday, the weather spoke in London.
It's been kind of challenging to get the technology together... whether it's a cold bucket or something.
It's been cold, it's windy, and it's taken away from the fridge.
It doesn't make sense to use energy in a bad situation.
Thanks to the 455, he got to the MM.
There's been 445 out there.
The circumstances are not the same for everyone in London.
We need to be calm and wait for better winds.
The aim is to cross 460 on Friday.
Why don't you go out and train abroad?
It's not necessary.
Last summer I was in Italy and Germany from the early season.
I got the jump together and the tech standardized.
I guess I should have done the same thing now.
Normally, we've got the hall to practice, and now the hall's closed.
What would it be like to race?
25 degrees warm.
It's a little wind, as long as it's standard.
The experienced ex-official stashed politicians in the top: "We don't have any dividends now or for many years."
Despite the positive climate of the economy, Juha Sipilä's Government must keep ice hats and beware of the increase in the state budget by debt, warning the budgets prepared by Erkki Virtanen in the Ministry of Finance for decades.
He said there's no allocation.
Yle interviewed Virta in 2015 at the 1st meeting of Wednesday.
The construction of next year's budget is about to begin.
Recently, the proposals of politicians on the increase of guarantee pensions, the reduction of car tax and the support of electric bicycles are regarded as electoral speeches.
They mainly tell us that the elections are going to be close, because when 10% of the state budget is financed with additional debt, we have no allocation now and not for many years.
I even think it's treason to talk about dividends when debt is taken, Virtanen said to Yle.
Virtanen stressed that all the debts were owed to children.
Virtas has a long experience in preparing the state budgets: he started in 1978 as Secretary of Finance, and then worked as Deputy Head of Budget Section and Head of Budget.
Last time he retired, he was the head of the Ministry of Employment and Economic Affairs.
Virtanen pointed out in Yle's interview that the forecast economic growth of 3% is likely to be temporary.
All predictors estimate that this is a pile, from which we are going to go down to the subjugation next year, and Finland is expected to grow by 1 percent for tens of years.
Washington amends the rules on permanent residence permits
According to the media, President Donald Trump announced that a permanent residence permit, namely Green Card, will be amended by a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, to tighten the requirements of temporary work permits and to limit family visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans, and the President supports them.
The draft law is to be discussed in two Chambers of Congress.
"This law reduces poverty, raises wages and saves billions of dollars of money for taxpayers by changing the way in which permanent residence permits are granted to citizens of other countries.
It also reduces chain immigration and replaces the current programme.
The new search process benefits applicants who know English and are able to support themselves and have our economic skills," Trump said the media.
The wife of the Danish queen does not want to be buried with the queen in the same place
Prince Henrik doesn't want to be buried with Queen Margareta.
In the picture of Prince Henrik and Queen Margaree as described in April.
The Danish queen Margareeta, 77, and this married prince Henrik, 83, will not be buried next to the court of Denmark.
Traditionally, couples of rulers in Denmark have been buried in the same place.
The King's Room today has announced that Prince Henrik does not want to be buried in the Roskilde Court of Justice, the Court notes when he announces on Thursday.
According to the BT magazine, this is why the prince is unhappy in his role in the king's family.
There is no secret that the prince has been unhappy in his role and title in the Danish monarchy, Lene Belleby commented on the Court's communications.
For the prince, the decision not to bury him next to the queen is a natural result of not being treated as equal to his spouse.
According to the court, the queen has long been aware of the desire for his spouse's funeral and understands the decision.
The horror on the road: The car was coming on the motorway.
Tommm had an open mate and two little kids on his ride.
They were not injured in an accident, but they will not receive funds from insurance if the other party is not targeted.
The Turma happened at the Keimola gate in Vantaa.
Archive photo of the construction land of Kehä III.
Vantaa Tommi says his family survived on Tuesday at a miracle store in a car accident.
Tommi, his co-rapporteur, Riina and two little children of the parish, drove on the road at Keimola gate in the direction of Vantaa Hämeenlinna.
About the connection of the third round to the Hämeenlinnan, it was a speeding band along the white car that was driving to the side of the family car, Tommi says.
Without an ambulance, the car would have come on top of Tom.
I brake and twisted the car at the same time, and it left the hands, Tommi tells me.
The family's car ran into a high-speed squad.
The parents and the two little children on the back seat were not injured.
One of the children is a little under 3 years old, the other is less than a year old.
I guess it was a pretty good luck when nothing happened to us.
No one bypassed had even driven towards us, even though the place was busy.
The accident was about 17.20 p.m.
Tom says no one stopped with them, and the family called the Emergency Center.
They got out of the car with their own strength.
The staff of the ambulance and the rescue department came in and the family was checked.
The car went to redemption.
Tommi tells her that she and her outfall have a small income, and they received aid from the family to buy a car a few years ago.
Without the information of another car, the family doesn't get money from insurance according to Tom.
That's why the family hopes for witnesses to see the car that led the family to a highway.
We need a car every day.
It's hard to take the kids to the garden and go to work without it, Tommi says.
Tommi saw the car was white, old-fashioned.
It was probably from the end of the 1990s or the beginning of the 21st century.
He thought the start of the car registration number was SIG.
If we don't get the blame, I don't know how we're doing economically, we're going to have to count every cent today.
Tommi hopes you've seen what happened or what you know about it is connected to the police.
It is confirmed from the Ida-Uusian Police Department and the Central Newland Rescue Department that they have had an accident site on Tuesday nights.
Headline and case repaired at 21.15 p.m.: Unlike the case originally told, the other car didn't come by Tom, but it was driving from the acceleration band to the side of the family car.
Lotta Jäppisen's directed presentation deals with human relations with humor by means of humor - Self-exposer will be seen in What? Theatre on Friday and Saturday
Lotta Jäppinen from Kouvola brings his first-family guidance to the Theatre What?
Self - Explorer is a music theater about past relationships and inadequacy.
The director Lotta Jäppisen says it's still a good idea.
The topic is discussed by humour.
I don't think you're going to miss your feelings, he says.
According to the Member, the circular summer theatre has been carried out with a long-distance budget and a large, young heart.
The name of the presentation challenges the question of what a person reveals himself when he comes to a new person.
Do you think he's pulling a role or approaching another jacket open?
An inconsistent presentation mixes the fact and the fiction
The stiff has both led and dramatized the performance.
He's also responsible for the lights.
The draft is composed of texts of the Working Group and does not have a plot.
The director believes that even though the presentation absorbs the thoughts of young people, it talks about people of all ages.
Jäppinen stresses that Self - Explorer does not express his own or his working group’s human relationships.
Factory and fiction are mixed up.
I'm sure my own value world will care about the show.
I do not think that human relations would be bad, but I do not think that human relations, especially a relationship, would be a prerequisite for happiness.
Many learn from their divorced parents
Jappinen believes that Self - Explorer draws a timely picture of young adults living in Finland a hundred years old.
According to him, many have learned much about human relations from their parents, many of whom have separated.
At least you have to listen to yourself.
You don't have to stay in a bad relationship.
In the presentation, Minea Lång, Niklas Rautaen and Otto Rokka.
The working group also includes a costume Ella Snellman.
The music reconciliation is Jäppisen and Rokan.
Love in the theater was inflamed in Kouvola
Lotta Jäppinen from Kouvola, 26, studys as a director at the University of Turku University of Applied Sciences.
There's two years behind, and there's another crook.
Member's enthusiasm to the theater has begun during the Kouvolan years.
The music class grower has been an assistant at the Kouvola Theatre and has been exhibitions, among other things, at the University of Helsinki and last Linnateater in Turku.
The guidance has become more and more interested.
The self-declarant received his first night last week at the Narr scene in Helsinki.
A presentation lasting about 45 minutes was also seen in the future at least in the study city of Jäppinen in Turku.
Self-discoverer Kouvolan What? Theatre 4.8 at 19:00 and 5.8 p.m. at 14:00 and 19.
The Finnish Olympic Winner recovered for a year from the terrible motocrosson accident, the kaularanka broke.
Few athletes in Finland have similar unstoppable natural power to Janne Lahtela.
Ace of cucumber counts circulated the world for hundreds of days a year for decades and hunted for his dream of the Olympic gold.
The dream was implemented in 2002, but the movement of Lahtela continued.
He was not only a tired trainer, but also a new species experimenter.
There are probably not many types of exercises on earth that the chemical ingredients would not have tried at least once.
It's been excited to practice.
There's always something new, Lahtela tells me.
Finally, one hobby was to stop Lahtela completely.
In 2014 Lahtela was in a motocross accident.
As a result, his necklace and both hands broke.
I wasn't working anywhere.
I licked wounds at my house for a year, Lahtela says.
It was bad luck on the desk.
He also admits that his age could have been part of the devastation.
You know, driving a bike might sound crazy.
But I didn't get the limits on it.
It's just so hard as a species that a 40 - year - old doesn't think too much to do!
After the accident, the Lahtela was in a special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
There was a long rush behind the Japanese freestyle team as head coach.
Lahtela started in the pestilence immediately after the end of his career in 2006.
For the first time after I was 15, I had to be there.
I didn't really do much, Lahtela tells me.
Even during the training period, Lahtela often challenged his protector in the slope and physics tests.
Surprisingly, stopping was a good experience.
I was so physically and mentally tired that my thoughts didn't make sense.
Not even with the species.
It was good to be there.
I really enjoyed it because I was once really able to be.
The forced break enthusiastized Lahtela as Finland’s chief coach.
Without stopping, he's afraid he'd burnt out.
It's easier in the body to find places that have gone all over the place than intact!
Without the accident, I wouldn't have realized that I needed so much rest.
Lahtela started the Finnish freestyle country team as coach about a year ago.
At the same time, he found a safer hobby to replace the Speeds.
I switched the motocross to frisbeegolph!
I mean, it just left the shovel right now.
For the worst part, I was throwing seven hours a day.
Although Lahtela has always been a super-innocent trainer, he does not require his trainers to be the same as he.
I'm not gonna make everybody dressed the same way.
In our variety culture, there is room to be one of our own and the way to be the best of the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and mentality has always been in line with it, Lahtela says.
The sex robots are coming and we need to be worried.
It is here: a report on technological development in the sex robot sector – just when it started to feel that 2017 cannot become more odd.
Yes.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next 5 to 10 years.
"We must start to take a serious view of the generalisation of sex robots," says the founding member of the Foundation and the professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Noel Sharky Sheffield.
Customers can choose the type of colour of the robot's eyes, the shape of the nipples and the type of fingernails.
"The sex robots are being squeezed, but they are already sold quite a lot, and we will see them even more," Sharky said in the publicity of the report.
Sexins have developed from blown dolls to robots with warm-sensitive silicon skin and artificial intelligence, which resemble human use.
The user can also adapt the robot to its own preferences from the colour of the eyes to the shape of the nipples and the type and colour of the fingernails.
The more worrying thing is that robots have a personality that makes Stepford's women look like progressive freedom fighters.
Sexy guys have developed into robots with silicon skin.
For example, the nature of the RealBotix robot can be adapted to the user’s preferences, even shy.
The Roxxxy Gold robots of True Companion have a preprogrammed personality: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is adventure-oriented and so on.
"Roxxxy Gold's personality is as perfect as possible adapted to the user's personality," advertised on the company's website.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has different moods:
It could be tired, talking to you or "with that wind."
There are many worrying features in the generalisation of sex robots, which replace genuine relationships, but even more dangerous is the subjugation of women and direct rape fantasy when the user approaches, for example, a shy and resistive robot.
True Companion compares Roxxxy robot with the vibrator on its website:
"Women has a vibrator, why shouldn't men have a sex robot?"
But sex robots are not just a fetish or a new kind of sex toy.
Their expansion and development relates to some of our darker and deeper cultures: the recession of gender equality towards sexual intercourse, where subordinatement is one of the other's options.
Of course, most men do not acquire a sex robot, and their popularity remains a margin, although the FRR report reported their growing popularity.
However, the marginal phenomena tell a lot about the life of time.
And many begin to be weird or offensive until the market permits it.
There is no coincidence that sex robots have begun to spread at the same time as women's rights are threatened across the world and the White House is sitting in the president who has praised women who are being distressed.
In the TV series The Handmaid's Tale (Orjattaresi) is not the most worrying language of its powerful image, such as pictures of the body hanged and out of the mined eyes.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now there seems to be a surprisingly short journey.
Sex robots are being attempted to make as much as is technically possible for real women (in proportions of porn stars).
Robots developers want their skin to feel real and moves to imitate human movements as well as possible.
However, their "personalities" are far from reality.
The robot can't leave the relationship or the situation.
They do not have their own will or history — nothing implicating independence or breaking the fantasy of complete surrender.
They're pleasant servants.
Slavery.
Police suspected: two terrorist acts were planned in Australia, head of the group's head of Isis.
The superintendent of Isis led a group of Australian men suspected to take the bomb to the plane of the Etihad Airways.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, the person who belonged to fathers' leadership had also sent parts of the bomb to Sydney.
The suspects suggest that the bomb was to be taken to the plane on 15 July, but the company was interrupted before the security check was carried out.
The police won't tell us more about why the company stopped.
Another plan for suspected terrorists was to build a toxic non-coloured gas extractive device and to take the device to a public place, such as the public transport device.
Australian Federal Assistant Commissioner Michael Phelan says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans that have ever been made in Australia.
Due to suspected terrorist plans, four men were captured in police racials on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interviews are also continuing.
The good sides of the Trump?
Make Mitt Romney look healthy in the root of the mind.
In the Trump period, it has been repeated to the age of boring that the strong staggering of voters has also broken up families at a daily level.
On Christmas and Thanksgiving, American newspapers’ advisory pieces guided how to deal with the relatives who voted for Trumpia.
They want us all to clear up our information bubbles.
The less attention has been paid to the ability of Trump to connect families.
I'll tell you about this because my cousin visited me this week in New York, and he's a left-looking poet living in Chicago, who has long been the opposite of the Republicans of our family.
He reminded me that the common enemy could have a powerful combining effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, all of my cousins, including the Republican brother who has been controversial with politics for decades, are suddenly on the same side and suddenly on the same side.
At the dinner table, it is a good thing, but, more widely, there are significant risks.
Trump has given a new flow to the left, but the distortive effect of his presidency can actually lead us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization", we're talking about the scary possibility that one day we can't bear to terrorize his tricks.
In the long term, there is even more terrifying possibility that Trump normalizes the Republicans of the right extremist, which suddenly seem quite reasonable compared to Trump.
I remember as a fragile version of Mitt Romney's controlled madness: dogs on the roof of a car, 14% income tax (and at least we have seen his tax returns).
When Trump's season is over, the next candidate of the Republicans must only be clear, and it seems to be a significant improvement immediately.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our children to the Carusel of Central Park, which is the biggest carusel in the New York Park Department and the best thing you can get in New York for three dollars without caffeine.
The horses of Karuselli are vast, the characters in the middle — the horrored clowns and the animals behind the horror — are evil - minded, and the background of the shining music is strangely fascinating.
Many of the characteristics of New York are disappointed over time: the prospects of high buildings are getting bored, the city's siluet become too familiar and the city's reality does not match dreams.
And yet, after 35 years, it has not been over the fact that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage but a large transport circle in North London. Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is a Swiss-skinned pub, but it is not counted.
On the other hand, the caruselli of the Central Park is still a strange tangible experience — even to the extent that two, one and one, and two fourty women enjoy it vastly.
I would've given the carusel a full score if someone had asked me to evaluate, but I'm glad no one asked me a question.
Instead, I was asked this week to evaluate my "payment experience" on a scale of one to five stars before I put my credit cards on the reading device.
It's the same thing in the cafe at my neighborhood, but there's also an opportunity for me to combine the 15% service money when I pick up the coffee from the dish.
This slows down the daily interaction and pressures the customer server to put its personality in the game in a situation where it is not necessary.
The salesman at the yard smiled when I gave my credit card five stars to the working experience.
Shefki Kuqi was fired from Interi, "No trust in the leadership."
FC Inter has today released a team of representatives of Shefki Kuq from the Coach's duties.
Fabrizio Piccareta has previously acted as a coach.
The other training team will continue in its current tasks.
Italian Piccareta has previously been an assistant coach in English, including Sunderland.
In January, a 51-year-old Piccareta joined the Inter training group has completed the UEFA Pro licence last year.
Mr Stefan Håkans, Chairman of the Interior of the FC.
Exchange of coach is never an easy or pleasant task.
However, Shefki Kuq had no confidence in the management of the company, when there was no other option, Håkans commented on the company's report.
The Piccareta Agreement shall apply until the end of the period.
He is already responsible for tomorrow's home fight against the HIFK.
According to the records of the evening-sanomas, the team has fallen across the Thursdays.
Kuqi told the players on Thursday morning that I was following Piccare and John Allen have moved away.
Kuqi and Piccareta strongly joined Inter in a fight against PS chemicals last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius published a youth picture in the '80s, would you recognize a serious violin student?
The violinist Linda Lampenius published a youth picture in Instagram.
A number of puzzles have been added to the picture, which makes it possible to conclude that the musician is a 16-year-old student in the Sibelius Academy.
Lampenius himself wonders a serious young woman on the camera.
A long time ago, seriously, he's sending me a message.
If you don't see the picture, you can look at it from here.
Lampenius has previously published pictures of his past and also spoke of painful topics.
A year ago, he published a picture pair of himself in Instagram.
In the second picture, he will be seen 20 years ago, in the second he will pose now, as the mother of two children.
In his picture text, Lampenius reflects his own growth as a person and refers to eating problems that she suffered when she was younger.
Twenty years ago, and today...
I still look a lot the same as that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I've learned to like myself and what I look like, Lampenius wrote.
After the text he had added in English a hashtagi life, eating disorder, insecure, self-confidence, self-esteem, love yourself, 1996, 2016, ageing, girl, woman, ageing is cool.
Lampenius has spoken openly about the eating celebrations of the past years.
He was already 14 years old at the hospital because of anorexia and orthodox.
A little later, he also got sick of his bulim, which was finally discovered only in 2006.
The healing started a little bit.
In addition to therapy and comparison, Lampenius helped a new love.
Oscar Pistorius was delivered from prison to the hospital for chest pain.
This is the second time Pistorius was taken from prison to the hospital.
Last year, he received hospital care for the cuts in his wrists, which he found by the prison authorities when he fell in the cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after the defendants complained of the original murder sentence.
He killed Steenkampi in early Valentine's Day in 2013 by shooting several shots through the toilet door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nightmare intruder hiding in the toilet.
The prosecutors have told me that they intend to complain again because they consider the six-year sentence of Pistorius too mild.
The prosecutor of the Kingdom intends to appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the complaint may be dealt with even this year.
If the appeal is accepted, the judgment of Pistorius may be extended for 15 years.
The death penalty is not in use in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two unlawfully camped Bulgarians were arrested in Greece, announced by the State’s Foreign Ministry on the BTV Channel.
The police arrested a bunch of unauthorized campers in Sithonia on the morning of August 1, two Bulgarians among the campers.
They were still released on the same day, but the case continues.
According to TV, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs later announced that Bulgarians were released.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules on free camping areas and already provide considerable fines for all who are camping in non-target areas.
The checks shall be continued until the end of the period.
The Ministry announced that the right to fine may be imposed.
Net share drowns - falls already -7.7%
The oil-processing Nesteen share has fallen by 7.7 per cent about 11:00 a.m.
Its result before taxes fell, but it exceeded the forecast of Inquiry Financial.
The stock exchange has taken place today on a slightly packed side, both in Finland and elsewhere in Europe.
Shortly after the opening of the stock exchanges, a large European index of Stoxx 600 had declined by 0.2 per cent.
The Helsinki Stock Exchange General Index OMXH had fallen by 0.3 per cent after half an hour of trade to 9509.48 points and OMXH25 had fallen by 0.3 per cent.
The total exchange of the stock exchange was EUR 41 million, of which nine million were the results published in the morning.
Red meat, milk products and chocolates may alleviate irritated bowel syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like the nightmares of the digestive system.
However, the recent study argues the opposite: a rich diet containing meat protein and milk products may facilitate an irritated bowel syndrome.
An inflamed bowel syndrome is an incurable disease that suffers about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300 000 people in Britain. It causes abdominal cramps, swelling, repeated or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
However, researchers at Washington University found that the required amino acid triptophane contained in the protein helps the body to develop immune cells that strengthen the gut susceptibility.
According to the research leader Marco Colonna, the immune cells guarded the gut and ensured that the harmful microbials in food do not enter the body.
The cells that cause inflammation are balanced by cells that strengthen tolerance and protect the body without harming sensitive tissues.
If the balance falls too close to the inflammation, the result may be an irritated bowel syndrome.
The tests showed that immunocells that boost tolerability are present in mice with a specific bacteria in the intestine.
This bacterium needs trüptophan so that immune cells start to appear.
"We noticed the connection between the development of the Lactobacillus reuter bacterium and the development of the cell that promotes susceptibility. Lactobacillus reuter is part of the normal intestinal microbial," says Professor Colonna.
The more trüptophane was in the mouse diet, the more they had such immune cells.
If the same works in humans, the combination of Lactobacillus reuter bacteria and a diet containing high triptophan can strengthen the gut tolerability and reduce the sensitivity of the inflammation.
When investigating immunocells that enhanced tolerability, Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan found that, although one group of mice had such cells, they were not present in the same mice that were kept separate from another group.
He suspected that the difference was related to the intestinal microbials of the mice, i.e. the normal gastrointestinal bacteria, mushrooms and viruses in the Community.
When the intestinal DNA was studied, six bacteria were observed in mice with immune cells but not in other mice.
When the Lactobacillus reuter bacteria were given to mice with no intestinal microbial and no immune cells, they began to develop immune cells.
Researchers wanted to find out how bacteria influenced the immune system. They raised Lactobacillus reuter bacteria in liquid and moved small volumes of fluids — without bacteria — to immature cells isolated from mice.
Immunocells developed into tolerance-intensive cells.
When the active ingredients were cleaned from the liquid it proved to be a by-product of trüptophane metabolism known as indol-3-milk acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of trüptophane in the food of mice, the number of susceptibility-producing cells increased by approximately 50 per cent.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, man has the same tolerance cells as the mouse, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuter bacteria in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not yet known whether Triptophan’s by-products from the Lactobacillus reuter bacteria can develop cells in humans in the same way as in mice. However, thyptophan-related genetic errors have been observed in patients with an ingestive bowel syndrome.
"We must want to promote the development of such cells because they control the inflammation of the intestinal surfaces of the intestinals," says Cervantes-Barragan.
"The high levels of tryptophane combined with the Lactobacillus reuter bacteria may contribute to their generalisation."
Mr Mourinho believes that Manchester United received a "neron" agreement with Nemanja Matic.
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United received a "neron" agreement with Nemanja Matic. The middle field player debytoed the Manchester United rows against Sampdor on Wednesday nights.
Matic, who moved from Chelsea at 40 million pounds, started at 2-1 wins in Dublin, United's last match before the UEFA Super Cup tournament against Real Madrid on Tuesday, impressed as a defending mid-field player against stars like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, Matic was not yet in the best condition because he was not involved in the Asian tour of blue shirts before the beginning of the season. He was only able to do 45 minutes on the field – Mourinho said it would have to change before the beginning of the valioliiga season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence and thinking makes him a genius – he has a natural football thinking ability," says Mourinho.
"We'll help him be ready rather than later."
In addition to Matic, the newcomers Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku were starting the game at Aviva Stadium when Mourinho began to cut off his opening meeting for the beginning of the season.
Independent revealed this week that Mourinho would like to have three new players, even though the company has already done a "brilliant work" by getting three of his four priority players.
"Three out of four – thanks must be given to the company," he added.
"I'm more pleased if I get all four, but they did a great job."
Flyball women tempted Germany for two rounds.
The Finnish Women's Flying Ball Earth Team lost its fourth match for Germany directly 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
The German routine level of playing is high.
Their game was equal in each sector, Finland's chief coach Tapio Kangasniemi reported in the release.
In the first two rounds, Finland kept his opponent at a bundle, but in the third round Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany leads the block.
When we played patiently and in certain places aggressively enough, Kangasniemi said it was possible to go with us.
The most effective in Finland was 14 points collected by Piia Korhonen.
Three fights from four lost Finland will meet Slovenia on Sunday.
Reuters: The grand jury has already sent challenges regarding the Trump Jr meeting with Russia
In the United States, a large jury has sent challenges regarding the meeting of Donald Trump Jr and the Russian advocate Natalia Veselnitskaya.
The great jury convened by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has already sent out challenges in connection with the meeting of Donald Trump Jr and the Russian advocate of Kremlin and Natalia Veselnitskaya.
The news office, Reuters, also confirms the information from Wall Street Journal on the summoning of the great jury on Thursday.
According to Reuters, the large jury has sent challenges in connection with the meeting of Veselnitskaya, known from Trump Jr and Kreml links, which was held in the middle of the US presidential elections in June 2016.
There were also Donald Trump Sr’s campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and his son-in-law, current counselor, Jared Kushner of the White House.
According to Reuters' sources, the fact that Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has called together a large jury in Washington means a consolidation of Russia's investigation.
The sources add that Mueller wanted a large jury to assist in the investigation, which aims to determine Russia's involvement in the United States presidential elections and whether Trump's campaign or his close cooperation with Russia.
The great jury expands Mueller's rights to collect evidence, sends challenges and forces people to declare.
The large jury is a group of ordinary citizens who work behind closed doors.
The grand jury weighs the evidence found by the prosecutor in the investigation and decides whether the charges should be filed.
The British inventor squeezed himself to get home and to his car with a hand rolling
The British inventor is the first to microchip himself throughout the country so that he can open his home outside the door, get into his office and start his car with a swinging hand.
The microchip is between the thumb and the front finger of Steven Northam, a 33-year-old. Now he provides services to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with Northam BioTeq technology.
Northam cooperates with the anaesthetic anaesthesia doctor at the Royal Hampshire Hospital in Winchester, Hants, in order to meet medical requirements for the installation of a microchip.
The microchip uses the same technique as the cats and dogs’ microchips, and the installation takes only 30 seconds.
Northam also attempts to make houses and car locks compatible with the microchip. One lock processing costs 300 quid.
Northam is married, and he has one child, and he has put a microchip technology in his home and BMW Z4 car, which starts when he drops his hand on the steering wheel.
The White House exhibition paid thousands of dollars to taxpayers
The last decision of the White House is to fly the marine helicopter to the southern lawn of the White House for an American production event came to pay taxpayers $24,000.
The Green White Helicopter Sikorsky VH-3D is called Marine One, when the President is on board. It was a drawback at the event held at the White House on 17.7.2017, where American construction programs were presented.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and a group of White House officials were familiar with products from all 50 states.
In addition to the helicopter manufactured in Connecticut, there was a sailing boat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a trumpet from Mississippi.
The Military Office of the White House had asked the helicopter at the location of the helicopter only about 36 hours before its landing on the southern grassroot event. This is reflected in the documents of the HMX-1 helicopter fleet of the Navy.
"I just wanted to make sure that you were aware of this, because it was an exceptional event that gets a lot of visibility," the commander of HMX-1 wrote an e-mail message to his supervisor, who is an assistant commander of the Navy Flight.
The message told me that the helicopter would arrive at the southern lawn at 7 a.m. on 17 July and that the event would begin at 3 a.m. only after the helicopter was emptyed in the evening between six and nine.
The message also pointed out that, if the helicopter leaves the White House would be delayed, another crew would be required to do so due to the limitations of service times.
The original crew was in the helicopter during the event, and the unit's security staff was at the helicopter when it was on the ground.
The documents received by the TIME magazine are not clear whether another crew was needed in the end.
The U.S. Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using state property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 inquired, an event infringes the law.
"One of our questions was whether the Hatch Act was violated, and we were told not to be violated," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you can take part," responded the Deputy Commander.
Made in America was the official event of the White House, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political tones.
At that time, the President spoke on behalf of the health reform in the Senate's proceedings and of the delicate state regulation.
The use of the Marine One Helicopter and Air Force One aircraft for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
The Presidents must use them on their trips,
but the use of them only for photographs is unusual.
The activities of Trump were highlighted in February when Air Force One rolled on the background of the president's campaign event in Melbourne in the state of Florida. Trump has strongly criticised the use of the predecessor's presidential aeroplane on Twitter.
"The White House is very pleased with the Made in America event, which introduced products from all 50 states of American materials from American workers", said Lindsay Walters, the White House press secretary.
The HMX-1 unit crew regularly perform training flights in Washington area and train the southern field to bring the President to the White House with accuracy of centimetres.
When Trump was at the G-20 Summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 made 58 countings for the White House.
According to one official, flights to the Made in America were included in the monthly training quota of the crew.
The unit's helicopters were also flying on that day for 11 hours in non-president support tasks.
According to the White House, the event did not entail any other costs for taxpayers.
Sikorsky's reporter told me that the company was not involved in organizing a helicopter presentation in the southern field of the White House.
HMX-1 has no records of flights related to the president's duties, and an accurate assessment of the costs of the event is difficult.
The level of compensation for VH-3D helicopter in 2017 is EUR 24 380 per flight hour.
According to HMX-1 units, flights from Quantico base to the White House from Virginia to the White House lasted an hour.
According to the White House, the helicopter's operating costs are clearly lower.
"The calculation of the cost of taxpayers according to the level of compensation is misleading," Walters says.
"The required level of compensation includes staff, maintenance and many other so-called uprooted costs, which are taken into account in annual appropriations."
According to a report by the RAND research company in 2015, compensation levels do not include personnel costs, but take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
During the event, Sean Spicer, former press secretary of the White House, defended the use of the helicopter in the event.
"The idea is to introduce American production," Spicer said.
"I know that the state of Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud that they are involved in ensuring national security and that they will probably employ hundreds or thousands of people.
And I think, like most Americans, we're proud of the helicopter and other defence supplies, for which many Americans have worked hard.
It is absolutely appropriate to mention it."
It's not sure if Trump went to the helicopter during the event, but at least he sat down the fire truck driver.
In the White House, Trump was joking to the press about his own Sikorsky squad.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said. "I have three."

The State Prosecutor of Venezuela demands the right to prevent the appointment of a new country representative
The State Prosecutor of Venezuela has applied for a court decision to prevent the appointment of a new country representative.
The President of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro, has announced that the delegation elected in the last Sunday's vote is to be appointed on Friday.
In the controversial vote, the country was elected a representative body, which could, among other things, change the constitution of the country.
According to prime prosecutor Luisa Ortega, the prevention decision has been requested because of election doubts.
Ortega has also begun a election study.
He appointed two judges for his mission after the British company that organised the representation vote told that the results were manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters declared by the Venezuela authorities was about a million higher than the number of actual voters.
Only all the allies of Maduro were subject to representation, and the selected 555 member’s representative office includes Maduro’s son and wife.
In addition to the amendment of the Constitution, the delegation may disrupt the Congress led by the opposition and amend the laws.
Described as a dictator
Maduro's actions have been widely condemned.
The opposition considers the amendment of the Constitution as a means of strengthening its position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro and called it a dictator.
In turn, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have stated that they do not recognise the new delegation.
Maduro claims that the new representation is a solution to the country's political and economic crisis.
The troubles in Venezuela have continued for months.
Many people have been wounded in them, and more than 100 people are dead.
Venezuela fell into the economic crisis by the price of oil.
Now a lot of people can't afford food or medicine.
The opposition is also expected to reflect on Friday, when a new representative is to begin.
The Russian man delivered by Finland was sentenced to prison for 4 years in the United States
On Thursday, the court in Minneapolis in the United States condemned Maksim Senah, a 41 - year - old, about four years of imprisonment from the involvement of the global computer fraud.
Senah was arrested in August 2015 following the demand made by the United States.
According to Fontanka, the Russian magazine Senah had been on vacation in Finland.
She was arrested by Finnish border authorities when she was returning home.
Finland handed it over to the US judicial authorities in February 2016, despite the opposition of the Russians, reports AFP.
In March this year, he was found guilty of a computer fraud that had benefited millions of dollars.
Senah had 46 months of imprisonment.
According to the US Ministry of Justice, Senah will be expelled from the country after the imprisonment.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs blamed Finland hardly after the arrest and said that the man should not be handed over to the United States.
In the opinion, Finland and the United States were accused of being arrested in Finland without Russia's knowledge in advance.
According to the prosecutor, Senah had used a computer virus called Ebury that grabbed dozens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus used to fish for usernames and passwords.
After that, fraudulents continued to use the information by further directing the Internet’s traffic through clippings and spreading garbage mail.
According to the Head of Crime Department, Kenneth Blanco, the case shows that the United States is also able to pursue other cyber criminals.
We have the ability and the desire to identify, find and bring them to justice, Blanco told me in the press.
Modified at 20.58 p.m.: Corrected littering the name of the convicted person.

Two men fought in the parking lot at the shopping center in Espoo
Two men had a fight in Espoo in the shopping center in the park hall of Iso Omena on Wednesday morning.
According to the parties, the dispute started when the other party accidentally drove into a prohibited direction.
There was an oral dispute between drivers.
The driver who was driving in a prohibited direction would shake the driver of another car, which would lead to the driving of this car running into the hitter's car.

Timo Soin's question mark titled: "Then there was a flood."
Timo Soini, Minister of Foreign Affairs, published a blog writing on Thursday, labelled with a question mark.
The article is short, only two sentences.
During my time, the party grew from zero to thirty-seven representatives as a government party.

Soin's text contains references to France in the 17th century.
The madame de Pompadour of King Ludvig XV or his lover is known to have used the water flood comparison.
Depending on the interpretation, the books of history have left the records "the Flood after us" or "the Flood after me".
According to the United Nations, democracy in Afghanistan depends on the political role of women
The elections are representative only if they can vote for all members of society, including women, said the Head of the UN Afghanistan delegation on Wednesday.
The temporary Head of the UN Assistance Mission Nicholas Haysom stated that there are hundreds of women in the election of the province councils, three women seeking to become Vice-President and more than 30% of recently registered electorates are women.

The flood of certain tourists threatens to culture in the region
The authorities consider limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
Local rage focuses in particular on the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
The Italian Minister for Culture calls it "eat and flee" tourism: it is only a few hours away and it is going to run through attractions in large troops.
The Venice has been suppressed by quick day trips to the city’s tourists.
On the streets of the gates, it is difficult to move, and the fine squares are so full of visitors that the Venice people are no longer able to fit in.
They have been forced to move further away from the historic center, while homes have been replaced by hotels.
The New York Times and the Guardian write about the problems of tourism in Venice.
The authorities consider restrictions on the number of tourists.
They call the present phenomenon a low-quality tourism.
When a large cruise ship arrives, the time will be given for two or three hours.
You follow the flag guide of Piazzale Romalta to the Bridge of Rialto and the market of Saint Markus, and turn back, describes Italy's Minister of Culture Dario Franceschini's dominant and problematic tourism.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in architecture, but also in the operation of the place, shops and workshops.
We need to keep this part of the city's identity.
The market of St. Mark is also one of the most popular attractions of the Venice Historical Centre.
The church of St. Mark is located on the side of Tori.
The local anger is also mainly directed at cruise ships.
At the historic center in Venice, there are only 50,000 locals.
In 1951, there were about 175 000 inhabitants.
In July, an estimated 2,000 Venetians showed their minds against mass tourism.
According to them, tourism has weakened their quality of life, destroys the environment and drives people away.
About 2,000 people leave every year.
If this goes on, in a few years, there will be no more than tourists in Venice.
It would be a social, anthropological and historic disaster, says Carlo Belframe in the event of a demonstration.
The equation is difficult for ships to bring to Venice the earnings they need very badly and create the need for numerous jobs in different sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, a solution has been made to crossers moving beyond the historical centre.
Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, thinks that the situation would certainly change if Veneto's administrative area, where Venezia is located, could have more power to decide on its own matters if it were not fully autonomy.
Every year, about 20-30 million tourists visit Venice.
Are you driving towards Kuopio?
Incredible congestion of kilometres on the motorway
On the road north on the road between Kuopio and Silijärvi, there have been congestion of miles from work on Thursday afternoon at the time of return traffic.
In the area, road coating works are carried out, which slows traffic, says Savon Saymat.
In the case of sciences, 50 km of an hour speed limit is set instead of normal 120 km of an hour speed.
However, even in the 50-mile restricted area, transport had evolved in places on Thursday afternoons, in practice.
On Thursday afternoon, road work progressed on the side of the Silk Lake at the statue of Revelation, namely the golden horror.
I'm going to get along well without that kind of attention
A 23-year-old runner has been forced to notice the curses of the publicity.
Amalie Iuel has published magnificent pictures of himself, including in the Grand Canyon landscape.
Amalie Iuel, a Danish-northian, has become a popular athlete in its current country in Norway, not least because he broke the record of 26 years old in March in the 400 metre run by circumventing the track cycle at 51.81.
A month later, he healed 400 metres of fence at the time of the Norwegian record 55.38.
Shortly after his record, Iuel, who used cleverly social media, found that his fame and publicity had its shadow.
Men all over the world began to send Iuel pictures of their sexual organs in the hope that the young runner was interested in them.
Iuelin had to close his Snapchat account outside.
I got a lot of "breaky images" from unknown people, so I had to turn my account into private, Iuel told the VG.
Iuel didn't want the VG's interview to identify exactly what kind of pictures he had.
I'm sure you can guess, Iuel was laughing.
It's nice to get back after the run, but I'm going to get along well without such a different kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother's a Danish, his father's a Danish Norwegian.
Iuel's family moved to Norway when she was two years old.
When Amalie was a 12-year-old family, Dad first moved to Namibia, then to Pakistan.
After that, Dubai, Thailand and the United States were in turn.
Iuel spent four years as a university athlete in Los Angeles, where he returned to Norway.
In June 2015 he changed Danish citizenship to Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel trains three coachs, Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
In Norway, we are much more open to discuss than we are in the United States.
In the United States, coachs don't ask any questions, they only give orders.
In Norway, the coach has much more time to be personally involved with the athlete, Iuel told VG.
Amalie Iuel keeps Norwegian records at 400 metres and 400 metres in the fence run.
And the more footwise took the snowboarder Janne Korve to the entire career on the scale now joining the MM races: "Well, it's not gonna hurt anything."
It's been a good time to count when you haven't done anything!
Janne Korpi, 31, read by the most successful snowboarders in Finland, has been able to enjoy his beloved species again this season.
Last summer, the success of the career was at stake.
The weight injury of the table had forced Korve to the surgery table in January, and the foot did not want any improvement.
The hand had taken a hit in the raspberry.
In the summer, I didn't know what I was doing, whether the boarding or not would continue.
Sponsoridiles were broken and many things were open, Korpi says.
But that's what they say, things usually work out.
The leg was healed, the sponsor continued the contract for two years, and the blood started pulling again.
The decision to continue was then easy.
I knew it at the latest when I first went to snow.
I was like hell, but this is so funny, it's gonna be pulled through a couple more.
But after a long down break, it's been a big deal.
There's only a few of the Kiss in the Corp.
It's okay.
Competitions have never been the most important aspect of the charging of the Korve.
I've never counted for one race.
I think it's frustrating to target four years in one race, and then you're in fever for that week.
I can't think that, Corpi says.
Today, the Corp is competing with the Spanish MM races in Sierra Nevada.
Even though the individual races do not keep him in the slot, he always lights in a hard companionship.
According to the Cortex, the value of the races organised by the International Skiing Association has increased over the last few years, although some of the boarders chose to hold Norway X-Games at the same time.
Yes, these are important races. The visibility is big.
Although I think that appreciation always depends on what conditions and the level of races are.
The Corp is the oldest athlete in the 12-year-old team in Sierra Nevada.
The team's holes, the 17-year-olds Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkisenniemi, are 14 years younger.
It's nice to watch younger guys go.
I remember when I was at the time that everything was new and so sickly excited about everything.
It'll bring you a new power, Corpi thinks.
I'm still in the chest, but otherwise I don't, that's how many friends have to flow!
Janne Korpi has also built a different kind of sports career.
Pekka Korve's son, director, has been touched with the adventure: the boarder has his own nutrient horses to whom he performs training programs.
When I'm on a trip all the time, there's no time for it to be in the mess.
But I look at at at least the diet results every day and usually some kind of leaves, Korpi tells me.
Nutrition and therapeutic training are according to Korve, a potential career plan when the boarding career is completed.
I'm not planning that far, but it's at least a probable alternative.
I'm gonna get it a little bit like I'm studying it here, along with the snowboarding.
I'm trying to keep the time nerve and evolve, maybe in the summer to drive some kind of departure.
If it's my future profession, it's not hard to start when it's already inside the species.
Nutrition is also included in the organizing Elitloppet campus with Jaajo Birdland.
The twins have rented a cruise ship heading to the Stockholm Elitloppet catering contest at the end of May.
The Corps and the Birdland decided to revive the old tradition.
The cruise has become a great deal, and people have been excited.
We're already at the point that there's no bankruptcy.
There's still a few months left, hoping to fill the ship, Korpi says it's excited.
The Attendo Care Care project for Kite has surprised everything
Attendo Esteri is the name of a new, 41-regional care home for Kite.
In the next summer, the building of 1,700 terrain biometers will be completed on the other side of the healthways of the neighborhood of the Health Centre.
With the crystal of general wondering, the subject of which the new treatment unit is sufficient for customers, as many private homes in the Suu war are now afflicting customer shortages.
Regional Director of Health Services Anne Flink Attendo commented that Kite will in the future have more demand not only for options but also for enhanced service housing.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are alternatives, the freedom of choice works better, Flink says.
Last year, Attendo purchased private homes from Kite from Kanervikkola and Eerika.
The trade concerned business, but there is a well-known five-year lease for real estate.
Flink says Attendo doesn't have an acute need to transfer operations from these premises.
More on the subject later today.
GMB is concerned about the continuation of the operation of McVitie's Branch of Scotland
The trade union will request the leaders of the McVitie's cookie manufacturer to confirm the long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow factory.
According to the General Trade Union GMB Department of Scotland, the company has not reported its plans for the future of the Tollcross plant.
There are more than 500 employees in the factory producing Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products.
The Pladis company owned by McVitie's brand told me that he invested in the factory in recent years more than £5 million.
The company added that workers and representatives of the trade union should be "reported first" if changes are to be made.
In a letter to the Managing Director, GMB calls on the company to "concern that no funding has been provided for the modernisation of production lines".
Drew Duffy of the GMB trade union considers it extremely worrying that the factory manager cannot be able to learn about the needs of Tollcross’s business and future investment plans.
"The families have worked here from generation to generation, and the workforce has been strongly concentrated on the local community and the Glasgow capital area. The factory is a significant employee in the area of high unemployment and poor earnings.
From the point of view of employment, wages and earnings, as well as Brexit, increasing life costs and continually reducing production, Glasgow, Eastern needs the successful production of McVitie's."
According to Pladis, the CEO had received a letter of trade union only on the previous day and the company directly responds to the letter because it values the continued interaction with employees and trade union representatives.
"We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives in Tollcross two months ago, when we had an open debate on a number of issues.
We discussed with employees, among other things, that, like other highly competitive and uncertain markets, we are constantly assessing all of our business and business points in order to maintain our competitiveness."
According to the informant, in recent years the company has invested more than GBP 5 million in the Tollcross factory, in particular in its production lines and in order to improve its operations.
"We are aware of the long history of Tollcross as a production plant, and we are sure to be the first to tell workers and trade union representatives if we are going to make changes to the factory's activities."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar's transfer three years ago?
LaLiga may regret his interest in Marco Verrat.
Paris Saint-Germain does not give up on Neymar's request after the conclusion of the transfer contract of GBP 189 million.
The French Ligga 1 football team is ready to break the world record of transfers. The previous record was less than half smaller: it was born when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United with a transfer of GBP 89 million.
After the transfer, Neymar will become the most expensive football player in the world and also the world's most hired professional athlete, as PSG will offer him over £50,000 weekly salary after taxes.
Barcelona is known to be mad at the activities and practices of the PSG by which Neymar has left forces. The source near Barcelona shows that Neymar has taken very good care of the company since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did the President of the PSG warn the football world about this transfer three years ago?
In 2014, when Manchester City announced its interest in Blaise Matuid, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned the best players in the PSG.
"I'm not worried, because they know that if they want our players, we become their opponent and contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all the seuros.
But if they want our players, they'll have to face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have been guilty of this: it expressed its interest in the middle field player of the PSG Marco Verrat earlier this summer.
The PSG made it clear that it would not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances; it might well be that Barcelona will therefore lose its star player, Neymar.
The liquid braked the increase in the stock exchange - Exchange news - East Words
The other great printout of the day, Metsä Board, was in a more magnificent drop.
The broad European General Index Stoxx 600 had risen by 0.1 per cent when Helsinki closed.
The Helsinki Stock Exchange General Index OMXH rose by 0.1 per cent to 9542.08 points.
The OMXH25 of the most volatile companies went on to the same extent.

The company expects the world's oil stocks to remain at a high level despite Opec's production cuts.
Of the other most changing companies, the steel company Outokumpu rose by 1.6 per cent and the energy company Fortum by 1.3 per cent.
Forest company Stora Enson's R share fell by 0.2 per cent.
The income of Metsä Board before taxes and turnover grew last year.

The calls from Trump were invented by the White House informant: "I wouldn't say it was a lie."
The White House admits that two calls mentioned by President Donald Trump never happened, reports New York Times.
The calls that Trump smoked with both the President of Mexico and the Head of the Scout Organization have proven to be invented.
The White House informant Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that no calls were made.
But he said Trump didn't lie.
According to Sanders, many patrol leaders were personally talking to Trump, and Trump had spoken with the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto at the Hamburg G20 meeting.
I wouldn't say it was a lie, it's a pretty hard accusation.
Those talks happened. They weren't just on the phone. They were on the face, Sanders just explained.
The speech to the Scouts woke up the devil
On Monday, Trump told the Mexican President that he was called and praised by Trump was successful in extinguishing illegal migration.
According to Trump, Pena Nieto told me that few more will come across the southern border of Mexico, because they know that the journey will in any case be bored by the United States border.
On Wednesday, the Mexican Government published a communication that said that this call had not been made.
On Tuesday, Politico published the perfect version of Trumpi's interview with The Wall Street Journal.
That was where Trump echoed his speech at the large meeting of the National Scout Organization in West Virginia.
I got a call from the patrol manager, he said it was the finest speech they've ever spoken to.
They were very grateful, Trump told me.
On Wednesday, the Scout Organization informed me that it was not aware of any call from any of its leaders to Trump.
According to the newsletter, Michael Surbaugh's previous statement by the director of the organization, where he had asked Trump to apologize for the patrolmen, speaks himself.
Trump’s speech at the meeting of the Scout Organization was a great deal of odds, as it was exceptionally political in relation to the nature of the event.
He echoed the results of the last autumn presidential elections, among other things.
