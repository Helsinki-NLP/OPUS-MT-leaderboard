Four members of the Kemerovo Group were held in Estonia and Spain
According to the postman, the police in Spain held Slava Gulevich, the so-called Kemerovo group head of the Estonian underworld, known as Slava Kemerovski in the criminal world.
Gulevich, arrested in Spain, was arrested under the permission of the court.
Yesterday, the court also took three suspects arrested in Estonia.
According to doubts, there are members of the so-called "Kimerovo criminal community of 27-57 years of age, who primarily commit drug offences.
In Spain, in the province of Mijas, the alleged leader of the criminal community was held.
Three men were considered suspected in Estonia, one of them has been found to be the head of the criminal community and two are members of the criminal community.
The data collected indicate that the tasks and roles of the criminal community were clearly allocated.
The aim of the criminal community’s activities was to commit drug offences and thus to earn criminal profits," commented the head of the pre-criminatory proceedings, Prosecutor Vahur Verte.
"We do not preclude the increase in the circle of suspects in this criminal case," added the prosecutor.
This is the case with people who have been in the interest of law enforcement authorities, and some of them have been punished for drug offences.
Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been important throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become normal for us and this week's operation shows the success of cooperation," commented Prosecutor Verte.
Ago Leis, Head of Central Criminal Police Service, said that the pre-examination of detentions preceded almost a half a year.
"In the first half of the city, long-term work was realised and at the same time we held suspects of crimes in Estonia and Spain," he said.
In addition, the Central Criminal Police officials were assisted in detention in Spain.
For years, we have a good contact and understanding of each other with the Spanish police and the Civil Card Force.
These detentions are another message to criminals that we can get them from the other end of Europe," said Leis.
The information gathered so far clearly indicates that the suspected men may continue to commit new crimes while staying in freedom, and therefore the prosecution requested their arrest and the court also approved it.
A man arrested in Spain is waiting for his surrender to Estonia.
In the context of this criminal case, property, vehicles and cash are arrested to ensure confiscation.
The pre-judicial proceedings of the criminal case shall be carried out by the Central Criminal Police Office and led by the State Prosecutor.
The Tallinn City Court condemned Slava Gulevich for extortion in 2005 and sentenced him to five years of imprisonment.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevich was considered a second man after Nikolai Tarankov, the Toonase underworld leader in the criminal world of Estonia.
Gulevich from Kemerovos emerged in the underworld of Estonia at the beginning of the 1990s when he began to engage in extortion in Tallinn.
He allegedly charged taxpayers and prostitutes operating at different hotels and charged businessmen for monthly coverage.
International joint operations, confiscation of criminal income and effective judgments confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For example, the last sentences, the eight accused of the criminal community of the so-called Dikayev, from whom a criminal income was confiscated at EUR 80 000, or the sentence of nine persons in respect of the fact that Igor Aleynikov set up in 2006 a criminal community aimed at the illicit trade in secret cigarettes and committing crimes related to trafficking in human beings in the East-Viruland and South-Estonia.
The amount of confiscated criminal income is approximately EUR 71 500.
In these criminal matters, success has been made to ensure that police officers exchange information and prosecutors with foreign colleagues every day and, where appropriate, jointly take action in any EU country.
The Civil Rights Group warns for traveling to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people travelling to Missouri about discrimination policies and racial attacks in the state.
The group's statement states: "The NAACP travel note issued for the State of Missour, which applies until 28 August 2017, calls on all African American travellers, visitors and missourists to be particularly careful and careful in the course of movement throughout the state, taking into account the whole race's bizarre race-based events that have recently been carried out over and out here."
According to the NAACP, the group was encouraged to issue travel warnings, such a recent Missouri law, which makes it more difficult to win cases of discrimination, as well as the fact that the targets of state officials are ineffectively minorities.
"The civil rights of people are being violated.
They are pulled from the edge because of their skin color, beaten or killed," said the NAACP Missouri branch president Rod Chapel on the newspaper The Kansas City Star.
"We've never received such close complaints before."
This is the first warning that the organisation has issued for the US state.
The group referred to events such as racist insults in the direction of the black students at Missour University and the death of the 28-year-old Black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died half the beginning of this year in suspicious circumstances after he got out of the state while driving through the state, and Missouri's police arrested him without being accused of a crime.
In addition, the comment refers to the recent report by the General Prosecutor of Missouri, which shows that in the state black driver cars are being suspended by 75% more likely than those of the whites.
"The report is designed to make people aware and warn your families, friends, and colleagues about what may happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"Mans must be ready, whether it means taking the bail money or informing relatives that they are going through the state."
On the basis of the latest data on the FBI's hate crime information programme, 100 hate crimes were documented in Missouri in 2015, involving similar infringements in the state of the country across the 16th.
Travel alert is also the answer to the new law of Missouri, which makes it difficult to sue the company in court for housing or job search for discrimination.
The American Civil Liberties Union ACLU had previously issued travel notes for Texas and Arizona following the adoption of the Immigration Laws, which obligated the local capacity to arrest people for immigration violations, as ACLU stated that this increases racial profiling.
Usually, the Ministry of Travel provides warnings for other countries, but in recent times, stakeholders have started to use this measure as a counter-responsive reaction to certain domestic laws and trends in the USA.
Hepatitis: What could anyone know about the different forms of this severe disease?
Hepatitis or inflammation of the liver may be caused by five different - A, B, C, D and E hepatitis viruses.
All these viruses lead to acute inflammation of the liver tissue.
However, with a low cost of chronic hepatitis B and C, which may continue to develop into liver cirrhosis, i.e. liver bruising and liver cancer.
The epidemiological adviser of the Health Agency, Kuulo Kusar, says that signs of acute hepatitis are similar for all types of liver inflammation - fever, fatigue, appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, grey discharges, dark urine, muscle and joint pain, and yellowness of skin and mucous membranes.
The most recent signs of liver inflammation also originate in the popular name of yellow disease.
Children may experience hepatitis without signs of disease.
A variety of types of liver inflammation can only be determined based on laboratory data.
Acute hepatitis can be switched to chronic hepatitis for decades without signs of disease, which means that a person may not know anything about his dangerous liver disease.
Kuulo Kutsar brings out different forms of hepatitis and describes their course more closely.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from a sick person and infect us with contaminated food or drinking water, sex, infected person’s excretion to the hands and hands for food, surfaces, objects, mouth and drug consumption.
The members and guardians of the affected family and carers of the risk of hepatitis A infection, people with chronic liver disease, people having sex with the infected, men having sex with men, drug addicts, travellers visiting countries with high prevalence of hepatitis A.
Infection can be prevented by vaccination, in particular vaccination is recommended for people who are travelling to a large number of people and who are at risk of hepatitis A.
In addition, it is important to meet daily hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect hands before taking food to wash all fruit and vegetables.
Hepatitis B viruses are spreading in patients' blood contact, injecting drugs, tattooing, agglomerating, using blood contaminated human organs (hambags, rashing equipment), donor blood, having sex with a hepatitis patient, and from a hepatitis mother to a foetal/another birth.
The hepatitis B risk group includes injecting drug addicts, infected people's sex partners, men having sex with men, newborn mothers who have been infected, family members and caregivers who are exposed to blood and other body fluids, health, rescue workers and police officers and travellers visiting countries with high hepatitis B.
In order to prevent hepatitis B, it is recommended that people are vaccinated, in particular, in addition to chronic liver diseases, HIV infections, sexually transmitted diseases and people with diabetes.
Other preventive measures for hepatitis B are: avoidance of the use of foreign hygiene and manicure equipment, other sharps and syringe needles, tattoo and auguration, and use of condoms in the event of infectious sex or avoiding sexual risk.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the national immunisation plan and is free of charge for children in Estonia.
Hepatitis C viruses are spreading in contact with the human blood, injecting drugs, tattooing, agglomerating, using blood contaminated human organs, giving blood, having sex with a hepatitis patient, and from the mother to foetal/infected.
The risk group for hepatitis C includes injecting drug addicts, infected people's sex partners, men having sex with men, newborn mothers of infection, family members and caregivers who are exposed to blood and other body fluids, health workers, rescue workers and police officers, persons with HIV infection, and travellers visiting countries with high hepatitis C.
The preventive action of hepatitis C is: avoidance of the use of foreign hygiene and manicure equipment, other sharps and syringe needles, tattoo and auguration and use of condoms in the case of infectious sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D causes hepatitis D virus that is multiplied in the presence of hepatitis B virus.
An infection of hepatitis D occurs with hepatitis B or as a superinfection in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
D hepatitis viruses are spread in contact with blood and other body fluids, contaminated syringe needles, sexually and rarely infected mothers to foetus.
The risk group for hepatitis D is chronic hepatitis B virus carriers and people who do not have hepatitis B immunity.
Effective preventive action is vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects people against hepatitis D virus infection.
E hepatitis viruses are spread by fecal-oral route with drinking water and food, including in the eating of low-heated animal meat, fish and marine carrots, donor blood, jointly used syringes and from infected mother to foetus.
Passengers may be infected in countries with highly ill hepatitis E.
Prevention measures for E hepatitis are compliance with hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect hands after the toilet, before cooking and eating, after the patient has been treated.
Fruit and vegetables must be washed before consumption, avoided eating low-cooked animal meat, fish and seafood, drinking only safe drinking water and avoiding the consumption of drugs.
Although in the last round, the competitors tried to move the Olympic winner four times, 34 years of Farah’s end of the world found strength and won at 26.49.51.
Farah did not mean long, pulling after the finish along with her husband Tania and the children.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family so much.
It was wonderful to be on the track with them," said Farah to journalists.
Farah aims at the fifth title competition in London on the golden double of 5000 and 10 000 meters.
Everything will be possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor is diving in "Dam in Gold. Gustav Klimt Mesterry, Adele Bloch-Bauer's extraordinary story" from the birth story of one art works to much deeper the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century to the cultural life of Vienna.
But more in-depth history.
It would have taken a harder scary amount of information, or a narrower theme that would have been allowed to gain more influence on the extraordinary story of the title.
The story of Adele Bloch-Bauer, and a much larger and wider history book of respected Jewish families and German occupation, is now like two books: Gustav Klimt and his painting in "Daam in gold", and a more extensive history book of respected Jewish families and German occupation, with its consequences in Austria.
The first third of the book leads to the cultural life of Vienna in the middle of the blurbing, and who himself has arrived in the capital of Austria can at least imagine how more than a hundred years ago life was around the Circle or how all the heads of Central were turned when Klimt came in.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of Europe’s richest cities, and when you see a name known in the book, you feel like a gram of culture.
However, the fact that Sigmund Freud acted in a city where the untreated syphilis and was the highest level of suicide in Europe, as if it were not giving further progress.
Or, though, each pair-speaking pinch will add colours to the cultural life of the 20th century in Vienna.
A dream of traveling to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had grown explosively, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the century change, there was almost a Jewish resident in Vienna every ten years.
Adele’s parents were also new enthusiasms in Vienna, but by the time Adele’s two-year-old Czech sugar magnet Ferdinand Bloch and Klimt played for his famous paintings, his father’s bank had already become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg empire.
But Adele's whole glamour life, where he belonged, didn't pull.
If you look at "Dam in gold," it's hard to believe that at the end of life, this great lady was infected with socialism and dreamed of traveling to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order his husband's portrait to Klimtt, the last moment was the hottest painter in Vienna.
The Klimt order paid 4000 kroons at that time, a quarter of the good location of the house.
The fact that some of the portraits were suspected of a master's love story with a model, the sugar magnet did not deteriorate.
As far as Adele is concerned, the only sure fact is that the close relationship between the model and the artist developed during the work continued until the end of the lifetime.
Anne-Marie O'Connor... "Dam Gold.
Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Bauer's extraordinary story", Varrak 2016, translator Aldo Randmaa.
Shortly before the start of the work with Adele, Klimt had been to Ravenna in San Vita, and researchers believe that the glorious mosaics that just appeared there gave the artist the idea of making a golden portrait of Adele as a mosaic.
Klimt presented his "Dam in gold" in Vienna in 1908 and about at the same time (in 1907-1908) was born in another golden country "Free".
The artistic historians did not miss the similarity of the two women.
What about Hitler?
"I think that in memory of my friend Klimt, I owe him to make his handwork available to the public," wrote Adele Bloch-Bauer a few years after he left the artist (Klimt died in February 1918) to the director of the Belvedere Museum and wanted their family Klimt collection to go to the museum.
Six years before he died, another portrait of Adele had been prepared by Klimt.
In his will (Adele in February 1925) he also asked his husband to leave his two portraits and four Gustav Klimt landscapes to the Austrian Gallery.
His jewelry was inherited to his nephews, Mary and Luis.
A year after Klimt graduated from "Austria Mona Lisa", he had tried to get to the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts, 17-year-old Adolf Hitler, but he fell through the drawing.
Although, sometimes, Hitler’s later antisemitism is considered the reason that the Jewish professors did not accept him at the academy, none of his examiners were actually Jewish.
Anyway, the Austrian Galerii assignment mentioned in the Mary’s will had become considerably important by 1939 — finding delightful works for the Nazi parties from the rich Jewish collections of Vienna had become important.
Some of the work that Adele had at home was also suitable for Hitler’s personal art property, but not Klimt’s.
Sixty years after the Nazi art robbery, a ten-year trial began between the Austrian government and the Bloch-Bauer heirs.
Here, let it be noted that if the "Suudlus" is seen in Vienna in Belvedere Castle, Adele Bloch-Bauer's "Damian Gold" must be watched to travel to the New York Neue Gallery.
And before the Vienna ride, you can also read the book mentioned above.
Even if you did Klimt's work not to go see, because at least my emotions rolled around after the book closed more Nazi and Jewish theater than $ 135 million sold painting and model Adele Bloch-Bauer around.
So, not as portrait as a family destiny story - and a very touching story.
The Bauerian family tree, originally mentioned in the book, facilitated the orientation of events.
The 17-year-old swimmer was very close to the Estonian record in Canada
In the vision, Gold was very close to his 200 m backswimming personal record, swimming very close to 2.16.62.
Tippmark comes from a 17-year-old bike of a week ago when the Canadian junior championships took place at 2.16.58, Priit Aaviku Swimming Blog.
Gold got away at the last or tenth final.
In the final, he passed the distance by 2.15.76 and reached a great seventh place with a new powerful peak.
The Estonian record belonging to Alina Kendzior (2.15.13) left Gold a bit more than half a second.
Gold rose to third in all times of Estonia and his fresh personal topmark is the fifth result of all times in Estonia.
The young hope for the future is still about 100 metres, 200 metres and 400 metres in Canadian adult championship, and 200 metres and 400 metres in complexity.
Last week, the Canadian junior championship took place in Toronto, and Gold made a successful start there too.
He won 200 metres in freezing with silver medal in time 2.03.22.
This was so fast swim by the Estonian distant in 2008.
More quickly than Gold in Estonia, only Estonian recordmate Elina Partõka has swim this distance.
An Estonian who lives in Canada has won 100 m of the pronx medal with an excellent personal record and a new Estonian season peak at 56.66.
For example, a year older Kertu Ly Alnek has swim this distance by only one century faster.
In the opening of a communication swim, he reached a letter from 1.03.69 to the personal top margin.
On a long-term distance, he only reached the seventh place when he swim in the final 2.17.31.
Gold is currently running the Estonian seasonal agenda on four different distances.
President Trump goes on vacation, critics sharpening teeth
It's time for holidays, that means relaxation to the President of the United States, Donald Trump.
However, since Trump has so far been one of the most recent holidays of the President, critics are already sharpening the teeth.
According to US Today and CNN, the President's 17-day holiday is scheduled to be spent at a so-called golf club in Bedminster, which is located in New Jersey.
Although the president's vacation started yesterday, Trump's opponents have spoken about the holidays for a week.
They're throwing too much rest to Trump.
In other words, the president's custom is to spend weekends in his Florida, Virginia and New Jersey villas.
By the way, Trump has not been the most relaxed president in his 196 term days.
For example, George W. Bush reached that time on vacation for 67 days, Barack Obama but half less than Trump, only for 21 days.
But Trump tends to forget things quickly.
The counted days after being president, Trump said "60 minutes" that there would be no time for long vacations during his ambulance because very much needs to be done.
Also, three years ago, he expressed a disgrace for Barack Obama’s vacation.
The current president wrote in Twitter: "When Obama is on vacation, playing golf, playing at parties and jazz concerts, ISIS is cutting off the sun."
According to the White House officials, the 17-day golf club visit is not exactly a relaxation.
It is officially called leave at work, during which Trump has no time for reading or other entertainment activities.
In addition, there had to be another reason for leave at work.
In the west wing of the White House, the conditioning system is replaced, and therefore the entire staff had to leave.
Ovaalkabine and other presidential offices are also located in the western wing.
"I don't think that any of you would like to be in the west wing in August if there were 38 degrees and there were no conditioner," said Lindsay Walters, the White House speaker, who stressed that the President would continue to work during his vacation.
From where President Trump will spend 17 days, you'll know about the video.
Blocking criticals from Facebook do not apply to the state authority if you do not tolerate the criticism of voters
The father of our country knew so much about the negative media coverage.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers didn't take long to start smashing him for everything from internal policy to political principles.
Crisis, of course, upset him.
But he didn't make his critics quiet.
Because in 1783, Washington said that "the freedom of expression could be taken away from us, and in darkness and silences, we could be guided by sheep in the way of slaughter."
This brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan’s subjects have blocked and erased at least 450 posts who published their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And in the beginning of the week, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) brought him to trial.
The governor's officials made the case empty, and web-commercials commemorated the counter-reactions in the style "Who cares?".
"It's just Facebook," many said.
But it matters.
And that's very important if it's a guy like Hogan.
This is an amazingly popular Republican governor in the overwhelming democratic state.
His approval percentage is better placed among the 50 governors in the country.
Hogan's not an unthinkable stunning head.
He has led the state with a firm hand and remained firmly in line with his principles.
In addition, he has used Facebook as the main tool in communicating with his electorate, showing, for example, the first time after chemotherapy, a lazy head of his bald head.
Therefore, the Governor’s page, which is a public forum with official labelling, which is managed by the blocking of people who are paid by taxpayers’ dollars, is inadmissible and ultimately dangerous.
Hogan's press representative, Amelia Chasse, defended the conduct of the Governor's interview to the Washington Post, claiming that blocking the comments was nothing but moderation.
But it's too easy to paint a picture of online rolls, trash mailers or people full of anger.
The Post talked to a number of real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And that's what they're the real people who communicate with their chosen leaders. Teacher, company owner and pastor, not onlinerolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not inferior.
Pastor quoted the Bible in his post by pressureing on the Catholicity of Hogan.
A lawyer from Bowie, Maryland, Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, didn't provoke anger, but quite anger crimes.
"I politely commented that I am disappointed because he has not responded to anger crimes or other recent news," he wrote The Post news story in the commentary.
"I do not at the same time like the idea that if a lot of people comment on the same subject, some call it indifferently collective effort instead of admitting that this is a great deal of concern with citizens."
What the governor's officials called "directed spam attack" would probably call "public support".
Facebook-time allows you to easily match messages by simply blocking the critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than old times when workers had to be sent out to collect and burn the newspapers with critical guides, or arrest the protesters, and to make them quiet.
But that's exactly what's happening right now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first state official criticised for being bitten by Facebook and other social media channels.
President Trumpi has sued Twitter users who are blocked from the Twitter stream.
One of the first judgments of the meaning of the mark on this was taken last week in Virginia.
In Alexandria, the U.S. District Judge James C. Cacher decided that the chairman of the Loudoun Surveillance Council was infringinge the first amendment of the Constitution when he blocked the electorate on his Facebook page.
Kentuckys also visited ACLU for Facebook and Twitter use of Governor Matt Bevin (R).
It shouldn't be that hard.
During Washington, affordable postal costs had a similar effect on the Internet.
In the range of 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers and anonymous writers smashed his conduct.
Even then, Washington had to breast-feed anonymous trolls.
People wrote letters to newspapers under pseudonyms such as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius, making Washington’s decisions land.
According to historic documents collected in the framework of the web-based George Washington letter collection project, he was buried under the petitions of the office, which criticised his views on the friendship, trade and shipping agreements with Great Britain.
But he didn't make them quiet.
Freedom of expression, different opinions and discussions are the foundations of our country.
And proper management means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty expects the comfort of the home area at Renaissance Club
The former European first number Ronan Rafferty expects the comfort of the home territory in the next three days when the golf courses of the East Lothian Renaissance Club are held on the 25th Scottish Senior Open.
The North Irishman, who was in the neighborhood of Archerfield Links before the last round before Paul Eales came down, has been fond of the new site and has played the role of the club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvad instead of the tournament ambassador.
"I saw the construction of the Renaissance Club, and now we see the club shining with this event in full glory," said Rafferty.
"The fugitives see the track in their best form, it's in a glorious state.
Jerry has done a great job to build this place.
He's an enthusiastic supporter of the golf game and is proud of what has been achieved here.
It allows the path to be presented in a wonderful way."
An English Eales expects it to be able to protect the championship for the first time, although the man has won both European Tour and European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"It's going to be a very special feeling," said the player in Southport.
"I couldn't protect my Extremadura Open title because it was taken off from my winning calendar after a year.
It's magical to get back into this place.
It's a great place to play golf.
I remember the memories of last year, for me and my wife Sharon, the victory last year was special.
It was a very special time that we will always wear in our hearts."
Gary Orr will also return to the competition on the ground of the homeland, who joined the European tour of the seniors when he got 50.
This is his first event in Scotland following the participation of Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"The home to play is always a little more meaningful," said Helensburgh's man, Orr.
"You want to play well, but you're also feeling an extra tension.
I've been enjoying the play again and showing a pretty good golf game.
I'm happy with things going so far."
The former Masters tournament winner Ian Woosnam and the Champions of Senior Tournament Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty join the Trio.
The Orr and the former captain of Ryder's carcass Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots in the race, the rest of them are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free of charge and the car parking costs £5 per passenger and £10 for the car with two or more passengers.
All revenues go to the charity organization Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and Death in the Golden Land of Indonesia
If Bardina Degei cooks dinner, he won't use the lead.
He doesn't even use the pot.
In the main town of the Papua Regent of the Province of Indonesia, a wooden house in Enarotal, the homemade family member of the Papua province will place the batate called nota in local language directly to the fireplace.
In half an hour, the skin shall be taken from the charged mushroom and stirred with unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the mud floor, and he also does his daily homework, such as washing with cloudy water from the nearby sex.
The station's role is filled by a bucket in a roofless room.
Since he is the youngest of his husband’s four women, he is not appointed to care for any field.
Polygamy is common in this country.
However, late working may be dangerous for most of the village men are unemployed and many of them drink hard, and there are still soldiers here.
"No one dares after five nights visit," he says.
This is a rare view of life in the Papua Mountains. It is the former Dutch colony, which was joined under Indonesia in 1969 after the noemycic referendum, which forced only 1026 old men to vote in the eyes of the occupied forces.
The movement of the Dutch supreme power towards its anger quickly against the Jakarta government, which remains under strong control of the region by keeping away foreign journalists and human rights supervisors.
In 2003, the province was officially distributed to Papua and West Papua, so that the eastern part of the island remained to Papua New Guinea.
Enarotal is also a distant and abandoned place. To get here, a five-hour journey from the town of Jayapura to Nabiri for 90 minutes and then passes through the five-hour journey to puke with the rental car.
There is no common transport.
A city with about 19 000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and covered by wavelength iron roofs that have turned the different tone into yellow browns.
Very few individuals have made the journey here, not to mention journalists, nor have they been to foreigners almost at all.
Before the Christian missionaries arrived, the pope of Mee Pago worshiped God named Uga Tamee.
Other changes, too.
"We hadn't used to wear these clothes," says Degei, referring to his colorful hand-woven turban, dark blouse and bright skirt.
"Before we only wore herbal leaves on the body."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28% of people live below the limit of poverty and the statistics on infant mortality and literacy are one of the worst in Asia.
But it's also Indonesian golden land.
Only 100 km away from Pania, a mountain province of about 153 000 inhabitants of New Jersey, is the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, which belongs to Freeport McMoran in Phoenix.
In 2015, Freeport alone extracted gold and copper worth about EUR 3.1 billion from here.
In addition, Papua can be proud of consumer stocks, an estimated 78 billion US dollars.
However, these riches are the source of the Pope’s suffering, as they lead to a powerful presence of the Indonesian army.
The study of The New York Times in 2005 showed that Freeport paid local military and military personnel about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including USD 150 000 for one officer.
The efforts of the Papuats to ensure greater autonomy threaten this golden shark and are mercilessly circumvented.
According to human rights activists, over 500 000 pope have been killed since 1969 and thousands of others have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by Indonesian armies.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the mass killing of the genocide in the mountainous countries of the Papua tribes in the 1970s was a measure of genocide.
In the previous year alone, over 3900 peaceful protesters were arrested in the Indonesian police area.
The 2016 report of Birsbane's Archbishop contains evidence of the cruelties committed in the previous year, such as out-of-court executions, torture (a second report indicates that rape and electric shocks are particularly common) and the brutal depression of peaceful demonstrations.
"The number of victims is difficult to read together because such incidents occur every week," says the organization Human Rights Watch Indonesian investigator Andreas Harsono.
Screws are even more tightened because Papua's natural resources have caused the inflow of new residents from other parts of Indonesia.
83% of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians, but demographics are changing, because from the crowds of Indonesia, Japan, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawes are coming from Muslims to economic migrants.
Javani family meals sell guado-gado with crustaceans and mixed vegetables, served with peanut sauce.
Locals can't compete with them.
"The migrants started selling chicken and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than local pope," explains the 24-year-old Abeth You, born in Pania, who moved to Jayapura in the province for work.
"The petals of the pope of the mama-ma's [womans] will therefore lose their market share."
The Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known among the people as Jokowi, allowed in the 2014 electoral campaign to deal with these inequalities and human rights violations in Papua.
The former carpenter won on his way to Jakarta’s presidential palace from the 29 electoral circles in Papua, 27, including Paniai.
But the Papua has changed very little, and the locals feel disappointed.
"Our hearts have been broken because in 2014, we voted in favour of Jokow assuming that he will fulfill our hopes of restoring justice," says You.
In fact, only two months after Jokow’s office in October, Paniai went down.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children sang Christmas songs at the end of the fire in Enarotal when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on the motorcycle.
The kids who were stalking told them they should turn on the front lights.
According to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers insulted their voices and returned later with four soldiers.
According to victims and eyewitnesses, drunk soldiers were chasing children and beating them with their guns.
Then one of the soldiers shot in the children.
A child, a 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimot, was beaten so cruelly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby electoral committee building was set to light and the next day things were further escalated.
Approximately 1,000 young Papua men, women, and children gathered in a football field before the local police department and the military management centre to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting buses and presented the wait dance of the Papua Mee pago tribe, running around and replicating bird songs.
Some protesters started throwing rocks at the police and the military.
In the agitation of the plight, a command was sent to soldiers through internal radiation. "If the mass shows more than three times resistance, shoot them down," said the official document that has been seen by TIME, but which has not been issued to local media publications.
Kayame (56), the senior in the town of Kego Koto, in Yeremia (56), felt a threat and called for peace to be preserved by asking the crowd to go home.
No one had a desire to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in the left wrist," he said to the magazine TIME in his bright colors on the veranda of the wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but he says the bullet came from the troops gathered.
"There was a lot of money, a lot of gunshots," he adds.
The local man, Alfius Youw, got shot three times after his shooting, according to his cousin.
"I ran to her and studied her body to make sure she was with her," said TIME from the sync in Yohanes, who uses only one name, like many individuals.
"I saw him dead, I kissed him."
Chief Inspector of Papua Yotje Mende told the reporters that he'd be subordinate only to his department's security because it was attacked.
"We have to protect ourselves if we are threatened to be killed," said Papua Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, Commissioner of the Police Press Officer in 2015.
"This is a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and were many injured.
The news about the killings came to Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi Jayapuras had a passionate speech in which he felt compassion for the families of the victims and promised to deal with the abuses in Papua.
"I want this case straight away so that it will never happen again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, Minister of Security Wiranto said that it would establish an external mechanism for the resolution of crimes against human rights.
But almost immediately the apologies followed.
"Most crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to solving these crimes, but we must follow certain processes," he said.
On June 5, the magazine TIME in Jakarta, however, Wiranto returned his words, saying that he had no intention of creating a mechanism for dealing with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, "Everything will be settled according to the law."
Wiranto, accused of crimes against human rights involving more than 1000 deaths in East Timor during the 1999 bloody independent referendum, said that 11 crimes against human rights have already been resolved in Papua, including in Pania.
The families of the victims of Pania accepted such claims with a gloomy disgust.
"I have been interrogated four times in the last three years, but there has been no progress," said Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says he's still living scared years later.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me, I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother, Yacobus, confirmed the opinion that the people of Pania are afraid to ruin this incident.
He said he was beaten by the army after he had helped to bury four victims.
"The army came after me from burying the dead bodies," he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police fired villagers in the Neighbourhood of Pania in Deiya.
One person was killed and 17 were wounded, including children, when he became a war between the villagers and the manager of the construction company who refused to transport an unconscious man to the hospital.
This man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned fishing in the nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested at the building site in front of the company's office.
According to the police, the villagers were throwing cops with stones that the last responded with warning shots.
But according to the local authorities, the mobile brigade (Indonesian military police) started shooting at the people, killing one person.
"We were in great panic, we fear revenge," said TIME 29-year-old Domingu Badi, who lives near the hospital and saw the entry of the injured.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the prosecution of the police involved and the withdrawal of the police mobile brigade from the region.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of thoughtful development feeds the unsatisfactory honey, multi, dani, and damali tribes of Papua’s government in the middle mountain.
Many of them have joined the Free Papua Movement (VPL) army of rebels, which, according to their own, protects the rights of the pope by organising accidental attacks and kidnappings among Indonesian soldiers.
Some VPL leaders come from Pania, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response to this, the military's pretext of protecting the sovereignty of the state has been arrested in Pania over the last few years and imprisoned thousands of people.
Some of them never show up again.
Papua's people are known as a "tragic forgotten place".
Poverty feeds unsatisfactory.
A few rice sold in Enarotas is too expensive to buy for the locals.
The bread is equally unavoidable.
People themselves grow all their food primarily on bat, in addition to a little fruit and leaves.
Farming is women's work, each of whom can care for four or five batates.
They usually keep most of the crops to the family, and the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten bats only cost 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have deepened between the indigenous popees and the new migrants who have arrived a lot since the opening of new routes at Nabire airport.
These few jobs that exist are better educated and wealthier migrants.
Papua themselves often lacks capital or the necessary skills to conduct a competitive business.
"Young people are not interested in staying in the village because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, Chairman of the Board of the Paniai tribes.
Separation keeps the world's eyes away from Papua.
In addition to the external media, strict restrictions remain.
Towards the beginning of this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were sent out of Papua, because "they did not follow appropriate practices" although they had been given rare releases.
According to Vice-President Phelim Kine of the Asian Department of Human Rights Watch, Jokow's electoral promises have not been implemented to remove restrictions on reports to promote transparency and development.
"Indonesia, the new threats to the rejection of the visa and the inclusion of the black list are threatened by journalists trying to make reports from the easternmost unrested provinces of Papua and from the West Papua," he said in his statement.
The absence of a poring look in the press means that international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is largely limited to the neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific countries in Tonga, Nauru, Belau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands encouraged the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate "multiple wide-ranging crimes" in Papua, including the shooting of Pania.
These same countries have historic support for the VPL.
Arrmanatha Nasir, the Foreign Ministry of Indonesia's Press Officer, dismissed the allegations of the group, saying Jakartas to journalists: "Indonesia continues to have a democratic regime and freedom of the press, so that evidence of human rights cases would be difficult to bury."
Local people want more foreign governments to be observed.
When the Dutch official delegation visited Jayapura on 4 May in Kees, the country's human rights ambassador, the local people interrupted the meeting, but according to the source that wanted to remain anonymous, asking for their silence, "We want freedom."
In Indonesia, new presidential elections will take place in 2019, but the pope does not believe they will vote again for Jokow.
"Jokowi is a man with good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the shooting of Paniai," says Hobai, Chairman of the tribes council.
He wants to understand to Jokow that, in addition to the constant survival of the people of Pania under the threat of the predatory army, they are struggling because of the misery of the nigga education and health services.
According to Gobai, Paniai’s people, like other pope, consider their voice to be the debt that he has to pay.
"They don't need money, they want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and frightening, the families of the Paniai shooting victims were able to do the last symbolic counterattack they buried one of the victims in the land opposing the police department and the military base.
Knowing that justice may never be put on foot, at least they will not let the defendants forget their crimes.
"One of our family members were killed," says Yacobus with fallen head.
"What else can we do?"
He came to swallow the Dubai Torch cloud blower for the second time.
On Friday, a tower of one of the world's highest residential towers in Dubai, forced hundreds of people to escape from this 337 metres height and 79-store building.
It's another fire that's been ruining a superstructure in just two years, which happens to be called Torch or Horse Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries reported and no direct causes of fire were reported.
"We slept and woke up on firearms and screaming people.
We ran down the stairs, and we needed about 10 minutes to get down from 50th floor," said Reuters, a resident who called himself George.
According to the Dubai civilian defence officials, firefighters wiped out the fire at about 4:00 a.m. by local time (00.00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said they were working for the victims of shelter.
This incident may again raise questions about the safety of materials used on the outside surface of high buildings worldwide.
The investigation carried out after the fire of Torch’s Board in 2015 found that the most damage suffered was the decorative panels and isolation of the exterior surface.
The British police have said that they believe that the isolation of the London Grenfell Tower and the fascated panels could contribute to the rapid spread of the fire there in June, where about 80 people died.
See: These phones are probably going to be sales buildings in the autumn.
Spring and autumn are a sweet time for technical fans, as telephone manufacturers will publish their new top models.
In the spring you came to the sale of Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium, also in the autumn you can expect new hit phones for poets.
According to Tele2 Marketing and Sales Director Kristjan Seema, the thanksgiving is characterized by the innovative design of the flagship, the eyewitness scanner, the 4K resolution screen and the high-speed processor.
A great excitement in the technology world Samsung Galaxy S8, which has also reached the front of the Estonian smartphone sales table.
In autumn, smart people will be able to avoid more rapid loading, more durable battery, more high-quality camera and greater water and dust security.
He added that, on the basis of the celebrations, assumptions can already be made and predicted four top models that probably capture the sales channels of thanksgiving.
These four smartphone top models will reach the poets in the autumn of this year.
Long-term iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should reach poelettes already in the middle of September.
The rumors, what the new Apple model looks like and what you can do with it, spreads a lot.
If iPhone 7 did not bring significant differences alongside iPhone 6s, Apple's tenth birthday is expected to vary completely from the previous model.
There are four colors: black, white, pink gold and chromium.
One of the elements of the new design is probably a screen that covers the entire phone's front panel, lost the home button and the fingerprint reader is built on the screen.
Apple's designer JonyIve requires a new iPhone model to look like a smooth glass.
There's also been a story about the ceramic version of iPhone.
A faster A11 processor may be expected in addition to the eye-block scanner, wireless loading and even more high-quality camera.
I'm sure it's one year expecting smartphones.
The pre-treatment of the new Galaxy Note 8 starts on 23 August.
There's been a lot of celebrations that the new Galaxy Note 8 will look like.
It has been reported that even more business users are meant to be, and S Pen allows even greater functionalities.
There should be two cameras on the phone, one of which has a broadband and the other is a TV object with a narrower field.
Now, no one else knows what two rear cameras are capable of, but in any case it is Samsung's first test, which is definitely comparable to iPhone 8 for quality.
However, we look forward to 23 August.
Although Nokia has sold three smartphones in front of Nokia 6 this year, there is still no flagship - Nokia 8, which is already presented on August 16.
We wait for a screen and high-speed Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processors and more resistant battery from Nokia to the edge.
In the case of Nokia, there is also a talk about aluminium housing and a significant level of water and dust safety IP68.
Like Samsung, Nokia's new model has two back cameras that are produced by Zeiss.
If Sony's secure flagship has so far been XZ Premium, the manufacturer has confirmed that in the near future at least two smartphones are added with even more innovative functions.
We're waiting for a smartphone, which is a little more modest than XZ Premium, but at least with the same good camera or better.
Sony's new model has been speculated that its screen is at least six-inch.
As the reality is, we can see it very soon, because, traditionally, Sony has published his autumn flagship at the International Technology Fair IFA, which will take place this year until 1-6 September.
According to the transkriptes that leaked the phone calls, Trump pressured Mexico on payment for the border wall.
The Washington Post published the transkriptes between the President of the United States Donald Trump and the heads of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, Trump called the President of Mexico after Enrique Pena Nieto to stop publicly proclaiming that he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States blew with him the wall for public condemnation, saying, "You can't say that to the press."
Trump set up his presidential campaign to build the southern border wall of the United States and swore to make Mexico pay for this project.
Transkriptions were also published from his first speech with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, which reveals an intense debate.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take over the refugees heading to Australia would be "nasty", "nasty" and "rumal". He claimed that the agreement that was made during Obama's government would leave him to "juhmar" because he has offered a ban on resettlement to the United States of America.
Trump stopped calling by telling Turnbull that "working was the most unpleasant speech of the day."
The Court did not deliberate the complaint of the OÜ MRP City Lines in the case where the City of Tartu rejected their offer for bus transport from July 2019 to 2029.
This is the order which rejected the OÜ MRP City Lines offer at the bus contract in Tartu, since the offer did not meet the requirements, the director of the City State Department Anneli Apuhtin explained.
This is a public bus service in the city of Tartu for the period 01.07.2019-30.06.2029.
The MRP City Lines appealed to the Supreme Court the decision of the District Court of Tartu.
The Supreme Court did not take that action.
Although many in social media complain that the noise from the Weekend festival disrupts their night and the whole city is full of drunken parties, there is a lot of people who do not have any bad words about the festival on the beach.
I'm even positively surprised that the store was so polite!
I didn't see any blurredness or rudeness.
I even saw kindness," says Laine in the butt.
"It's good to have come, be and be known for joy from Pärnu, which is in winter as left in winter," he adds joyfully.
The slutty wave from the beach doesn't bother you.
When he still heard music on the beach when he was living in the middle of town, the music hasn't reached his home intent yet.
"But I hope to hear you," he says gladly.
Agnes, who also discussed the evening paper, says that the grand festival is more good for Pärnu, is a good contribution to local merchants.
He also rejoices that so many foreigners have come to visit the summer capital.
The lady's noise of the party doesn't bother.
Well, I'm not on the beach anymore, but I'm glad the beach's been alive.
And it's nice that the people move and it's been three times already," says the woman.
I think the first time was a little worse.
"Then maybe there were complaints," he thinks.
However, he says that the noise on the beach is common for the summer leaders.
"This Weekend is a very good promotion for our little town," says Harri, a decorated in the park.
No noise and noise have ever hit his rhythm.
What's up?
We should all keep together.
Think about how this international communication would be better.
A loud music man won't be crushed.
It doesn't bother, even though I live close to it.
"Good people can hold together, and there's no trouble," he speaks.
He said that guests coming to Pärnu are polite.
Of course, they've also exaggerated a little, but young people are young and God-- let them go, but be human and we can deal with it!" he says.
By that time, the coastal residents have traveled away to a place, whether with relatives or with acquaintances.
"But in general, the festival has a positive impact on people who like such noise," says Tiina, walking with children in Pärnus.
Even his family’s dreams are not disturbed by festival music, although last year it came even further than this year.
Last summer, the stage was different, then we heard more.
We live out of the city, that it actually goes to the far side of the Pärnu River quite well," he says.
Pearson cuts another 3000 jobs and reduces dividends to revive business
The British educational company Pearson said on Friday that he cuts 3000 more jobs and reduces his intermediate dividends by 72% by launching another restructuring programme to solve the risk of the business.
The job lost, which, according to CEO John Fallon, is highly likely to be concentrated at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019, will be added to 4000 posts lost during the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced in May the plan to cut costs by another GBP 300 million (394 million U.S.) in the framework of the third cost reduction programme to try to revive a business that has been hit by a rapid transition to digital learning.
The company that agreed to sell a holding in Penguin Random House last month to its partner company Bertelsmann said that their expectations in relation to the year have not changed since the 1 % increase in sales revenue was reported in the first half of the year of GBP 2.05 billion.

Convoy in Kabul: a NATO soldier died in a suicide attack
According to officials, a suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan, in Kabul, killing one of the NATO soldiers and wounding several of you.
In the NATO statement, five soldiers and interpreters were injured.
According to unauthorised local notifications, three civilians were also killed in an incident in the Qarabagh district of the city.
This bombing is the last of the acts of violence caught in Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday, more than 30 people died in Herati Mosque.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
The NATO statement said that a Thursday night explosion took place when a joint patrol with the Afghanistan army was attacked with "a human-borne explosive."
According to the application, everyone is injured in a stable state and is treated in a US Military Hospital at Bagram airport.
According to the authorities, the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (ISIS) is a serious source of concern for the forces of NATO Bagram in Qarabagh.
According to the United Nations, in the first half of 2017, at least 1662 civilians have been killed in Afghanistan, about 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, the car bomb killed at least 30 people in the Chite region in Kabul.
According to the Taliban, they were behind the attack.
On 31 May, the great bombing killed more than 150 people in the middle of the city - this has been the most fatal assault in the country since the United States-led forces dismissed Taliban in 2001.
This violence underlines the uncertain security situation in Afghanistan, while President Donald Trump of the United States is considering whether to increase the number of US military and police forces in the state.
According to the authorities, suicide attacks in Kabul over the last few weeks have also led to public confidence in the government, its policies and in particular President Ashraf Ghan.
The EPA annulled the decision to postpone the bond regulation after the action.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) annulled the decision to delay the adoption of an Obama-term regulation obliging the States to limit the emissions caused by the modalities, one day after the 15 States complained to the Court of Justice due to this visit.
The EPA announced the decision to continue with the "Ozone Level 2015" operations late on Wednesday, showing the Agency's commitment to cooperation with States.
"We believe that we must have a dialogue with and listen to partners from our states," said Scott Pruitt, EPA leader.
Pruitt had announced in June the intention of the EPA to reject the determinations of ozone content in which the different parts of the State are measured for the purpose of determining where it should be reduced by one year in order to comply with the stricter air quality standard in October 2018.
15 mainly of the democratic state, together with the Columbia District,, brought action on Tuesday, saying that this decision is illegal.
President Donald Trump's government has tried to withdraw a number of environmental regulations introduced by former President Barack Obama. Trump says that this is part of the broader economic growth plan.
But these efforts have caused counter-reactions among democrats and conservation groups who are concerned about the effects of increased pollutants on human health.
It says on the EPA website that inhalation of the air containing ozone could "decrease the ability of the lungs to work and increase the risk of getting sick of respiratory diseases" such as as as asthma.
The German pigs can have a party.
The German pigs and cattle may have a party as strong rain threatens to catches from the size of the European Union, Bloomberg writes.
This year may be the way that the seasons of the seasons before harvesting weeks may mean that the fruit intended for the bread industry is only suitable for feed for animals.
"The quality of the soil is far worse than the soil and worse than in 2015," said Bernhard Chilla, Analyst Agravis Raiffeisen.
This year, up to 40 percent of German wheat can go to feed for animal feed, which is double compared to normal, predicted by Agravis.
German farmers, as well as their European colleagues today, have faced all kinds of weather.
First winter was too dry.
Then came the cold spring that was replaced by the hot wave in June.
In July, Germany hit the rainfalls that have continued in August.
Many eyes have been turned to North Germany, where the rain prevents harvesting.
Until then, only five percent of wheat has been harvested.
In most areas, the harvest has not yet begun, announced by the local harvester in Ceravis.
"It's a pretty complicated day," said Ceravis' senior dealer Frank Deckert from Rendsburg.
Consistency in all or Finnish internal designs
Beautiful nature plays its part in the interiors of the Messianic homes, because through large windows, the excellent views of the fish in Saimaa are reached in many (life) rooms.
At all stages, our northern neighbours will look at their efforts to create both hard and perfect (energy-friendly) homes.

The night before today, the line was drawn down to the Weekend Festival Baltic, and Martin Garrix gave everything to remember as the last performer.
The people were really turning around during the Garrix performance, singing, smiling, dancing unbelievable.
When Garrix graduated, a joint mass was dispersed from the Pärnu beach to the city.

Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discussing possible contradiction
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be at the collision course to go to the most confronting boxing in the nearest future, in a weight category of 66.7 kg, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in the ESPN office in separate rooms in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council Champion, walked to the other end of the corridor to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization's champ.
After Garcia's unanimity, the winning of the former four-fold world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime, both fighters belong to the premier of the weight table.
Garcia handed his right hand and said, "How are you, champion?
I wish you good luck."
Lomachenko protects his belts against Miguel Marria on Saturday night at 9 p.m. ESPN.
When a couple posed for photographs, Lomachenko’s manager, Egis Klimas, stated that a possible conflict between the fighters would be "perfect measure".
"I'm ex-clothweight," Garcia recalled.
"I moved up to [63.5 kg] for Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm 63,5 kg small.
I want to move down to the lightweight.
And he must move upwards of lightweight [61.2 kg] and then we can fight.
The fans have wanted it.
Then let's offer them this."
Lomachenko agreed.
"The pox world needs this fight."
Klimas raised the question whether it should be a costly view. This is part of his strategy to allow Lomachenkol to debut at the end of this year in 61.2 kg class to make it possible for the next summer to meet Garcia (37.7-0, 30 days), who are also interested in combating Jorge Linares and Luke Campbelli's winners after their 23 September title raund Forum.
"Looking this fight could be rewarding because fans have wanted this contradiction," said Garcia, later saying that he is open to fighting on any channel that offers the best financial package.
"We're the main authors.
No other name can get that much attention.
Whenever they're ready... "
Garcia said she thought Lomachenko was a powerful fighter and she could go see her Saturday game.
But Lomachenko was modest when Garcia praised, saying that he thought the three divisions masters from Riverside had seen "very slow; sorry, Mikey... you wanted this dick."
Garcia said it was intended to show the strength of the impact and then to fight.
They both confirmed that they felt the tension of their forces.
"This is a fight that awaits realisation.
No other opponent gives that much attention and discomfort.
I'm more than ready to work for it," said Garcia.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the best fighters and Mikey's just that.
This is going to be a good fight."
What world angles are being moved to Estonia?
The land was extended and issued by the Police and Border Guard (PPA) recordally by more than 13 000 residence permits for third-country nationals who have mostly travelled to Estonia to work, study or to visit the family.
For example, if a fixed-term residence permit was decided to be issued to 6702 foreigners, the number of tuna bubbles was 4928.
The authorities can't tell how many immigrants will eventually remain in Estonia, but such an analysis will be drawn up in the Ministry of Interior.
When nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia ten years ago each year, the number begins to reach 2000 in recent years.
The number of residence permit applicants increased jumping during the Ukrainian crisis - in 2014, 1087 people received fixed-term residence permits, a year earlier 675.
According to the Statistics Office, the number of Ukrainian citizens in Estonia has grown most - soil arrived in Estonia by more than 850 Ukrainian citizens left.
"The Ukrainian community has been great in Estonia all the time, and because of the difficult circumstances in the country, it is natural that work and learning opportunities are being sought from a country where the community and many of the family are already in front of it", stated Kristin Rammus, the press deputy of the Ministry of Interior.
The number of Ukrainians authorised for fixed-term residence was higher than even the number of Russian citizens, although the most timely residence permits have been issued for the last fewer than 10 years.
If the Ukrainians come here predominantly to work, then the Russian citizens for the family.
"Beholding this historic Russian community, they are likely to also have the largest family ties with people living in Russia," said Minor of the Internal Defence Academy, Helina Maasing.
"If you look where Russian citizens who have been admitted to Estonia have moved to live, then after Harjumaa, the East-Virumaa," he added and pointed out that about 40 percent of them have married a citizen of the European Union.
The country received a fixed-term residence permit for 1696 Russian citizens, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians wishing to renew their residence permit decreased.
"The Hype is due to the fact that a new residence permit has been applied for permanently to enter Estonia instead of extending the residence permit," explained Rammus, the press representative of the Ministry of Interior, who said that the interest of Russian citizens in Estonia's residence permit has remained stable for years.
A new residence permit for permanent residence in Estonia can be applied for by foreigners who have lived here for at least three years since the previous year.
Its aim is to encourage adapted people to stay here.
However, a long-term resident’s residence permit requires, for example, five years.
As a result of the new residence permit, the extension of the old residence permit has probably also decreased.
For example, such a residence permit was granted to 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years.
Now the Ukrainians can change their work, and the Estonian country will no longer be able to see if the wage criterion is met.
This residence permit was vigilantly popular - applicants were still in the soil with grey passports (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and nigerians (36).
A total of 1968 people received a residence permit for residence in Estonia, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and as many Chinese people.
In the first half of this year, the total number of such applicants is already 1269.
In ten years, it is surprisingly becoming a country from Nigeria whose citizens are one of the most active applicants for Estonian residence permits.
When three residence permits were issued to nigerians in 2007, 200 in the soil.
They come from Nigeria to college here.
Estonian high schools are still popular, for example, among Georgians, Chinese and Turks.
The number of Indian, Bangladesh and Nigeria nationals has risen predominantly thanks to learning migration.
It also applies the rule that where the community has emerged, it will be easier to add to others," Rammus added.
In ten years, two people have moved to Estonia, for example, from North Korea, as much as Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If an annual residence permit is available to around 6000 third country nationals, it is about 0.46 per cent of the total population.
Even if the citizens of the European Union were to add, migration will remain around a percentage," said Maasing that the numbers were actually small.
In total, 14 822 people travelled to Estonia according to the statistical authority, while 13 792 people traveled to Estonia.
This means that immigration crossed the second year of migration.
Most foreigners and immigrants are Estonian citizens, but more are amongst the departers.
Therefore, Estonian citizens had a mileage of 2,000 people.
The Estonians travel in particular between Finland and Estonia.

I have a friend full of the saunas of the dresses of my created haute couture.
Because it's not her fault that she doesn't live in Hollywood and doesn't go on a red carpet every day, she wants to wear the most beautiful dresses and wear it!
You can live your own life as a special!
The fashion artist does not recognize the gap between shining events and gray everyday.
That's exactly what this thought move has put a rolling plan to take the high fashion to land in Estonia, between forests and fields, to people that the mood often fails to reach.
For example, the collection of Mammu was presented in Võrus, Jõhvis and Pärnu, where the Royal Defile with 45 models filled the entire street.
In Tallinn, there are often a lot of people in the store, and there are dignitaries, but there are more emotions in the rest of the world - calling Braavo, getting up, wanting to thank you for your hand.
A lot of the audience had to be news, but now they're Mammu Couture's fans.
If you cross people's expectations, they're thrilled!
And I like the feeling that I'm in my way as if I'm in the summer tour.
We had a 50-metre red carpet in Pärnus, a whole street full of beautiful dresses, it seemed like they weren't going to end!
Maria does not recognize the fashionable fact that the creation must be presented by a supermarket supermodel, he will be delighted to bring ordinary women to the stage.
I often invite my own customers to the stage - they've always been happy.
It's such a fascinating experience, you can shine on the stage in a beautiful dress!
I'm so sorry that I've never seen my performance, I'm always behind the stage to give hopeless perfectionists the last thing to do.
My nerve wouldn't allow me to watch the hall calmly.
Maria is the kind of moder who wants not only to play a representative role, but to be in all hands.
I've got my sewing machine in the studio. I'll do most of the collection myself.
I like the whole process you play with the details, you find out.
I'm never far from my creation, and I'm not afraid of work.
It's not limited to design, it's also stylistic, logistics, organisation, organization - everything has to fit a temperamental woman's day.
These hours of work are going to be huge in the fanatics.
I can't tell you when my workday ends, for me it's just a day full of joy!
I'm still very lucky - it's like an infinite chain of luck: I'm doing something beautiful, a man gets something beautiful and yet compliments.
Many times have been said that my dresses have magic - they make themselves feel like a princess.
The vile satsi series that made Maria's talent famous overnight have remained the signatories of Mammu Couture until today.
Martin Müürsepp of the U18 boys: the Estonian subgroup tour weapon was turned against us now
Too bad, the fairy tale's out.
The first thing I saw was that we couldn't get our table.
And if there's such a difference in the table, there's nothing to do," commented Estonian U18 basketball boys 61:75 of the recession of our only basketball player in our NBA, BC Kalev/Cramo assisted trainer Martin Müürsepp.
The opponents took 28 balls from the attack table, and they got so much more attacks.
We weren't ready for their aggressive defense or attack, it created.
Many of the English attacks ended in three to five seconds, we couldn't build protection.
In defense, however, they were able to hold hands everywhere, we couldn't combine.
It ruined the team's legs.
The work of the opponents was better done.
According to Müürsepa, Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes in order to take off the momentum of the opponent.
In the last quarter, we had zero errors, but the opponents have already received several fast baskets.
The athleticness and the closest entrance that our weapon was at the subgroup tournament now turned against us.
Today we had no power against their aggression.
The noise stayed in peace with Kalev, Matthias Tass.
In general, the tournament can say good words about the whole team, today there was a single slack.
It's a pity that this is aggressive opponent who has already been confronted before.
The cup has been confident all the time and played out today, but it seemed like he was tired - he's been carrying quite a burden.
But he did some pretty move I've seen in practice before," added the instructor.
Horrible numbers: in the basketball box of these women, the EM tournament threw at three quarters less than 10 points...
In the U18-year-old class, the EM B basketball tournament in Tallinn was not only visited by young men, and the women began overnight in Dublin.
And Estonia’s game with Poland, unfortunately, fell into the field of anti-rekords.
Estonia lost 25:65, but after the third quarter, it was 9:49, or only in the last ten minutes, the opponents took their foot from the gas pedal, and that period remained at 16:16.
Both in the first and second quarters, Estonia threw the 4, third 1 point...
In the beginning, in two minutes, the Estonians caught two of the first four whiskeys, and then they hit 25 of the game, then one of the three and then another 21 shots...
Maybe in almost half an hour, one of 47 whiskeys was caught.
In addition, 2 points came from four free shots.
There was a reasonable number of sources with that time, 12.
At the end of the game, Poland's whiskey hit 33 and Estonia had 13 per cent (68/9).
Estonia has started with two losses, on the opening day it was necessary to recognise the better of Portugal 83:56.
NATO ships came to Tallinn to supplement stocks
Today, NATO 1. permanent mine control team arrived in Tallinn for the weekend for a scheduled port visit to complete ship resources and prepare for pre-existing exercises.
During the visit, ships prepare to return to the sea and give team members a chance to take a couple of days' leave.
After visits, NATO ships will remain in Estonian waters to carry out a number of exercises and be ready for future search operations for historical explosives.
"Estonians' participation in the NATO unit and their co-operation training in local waters reveals our integration with allied forces," said Chief Major Arto Reinmaa of the Operation and Planning Department of the Navy fleet.
Since 29 June, the Latvian Military Lt. Gvido Laudups, a permanent mining control group of NATO 1, took over the duties of the ceremony group leader in Riga from the Estonian Maritime Officer, Captain Johan-Elia, Seljamaa.
The group's flagship is designated by the Latvian Navy Support Ship LVNS Virsaitis, which also operates the Group's Headquarters.
Sakala, the Estonian Navy mine hunter, also belongs to the international unit this semester.
One of the four fleet groups under NATO Marine Command is NATO 1's permanent mine control group, a preparatory unit among the primary fast-reactors, which the alliance may be sent to different world positions within five days.
4th to 13th August, the ancient ruins of the Pirita monastery will turn back into a place where 13 years ago the Birgitta Festival called for by Maestro Eri Klas.
According to Risto Joost (36), this year’s Birgitta Festival will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented.
Risto Joost: Listeners reach the classics of the opera world include "Traviata" and "Tosca", ballets by the fascinating "Bolerost" entertaining "Karlssonin", and also lack the plan of their own production, which is the stage of Joseph Haydn's wonderful Orathorium "Workers" by the same international creativity team that brought Pirital to the stage in 2015 "Location".
Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatre stages.
It's bigger than any music theater in its usual form.
It's a festival the charm takes power and never let it go again.
Because the experience that the listener receives in this overwhelming and mysterious environment makes the human souls sound and touches the human minds in a way that cannot be described.
Risto, for the first year, you are the artistic leader of Birgitta Festival.
Didn't maestro Eri Klas's shoes seem a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Eri Class, it's been a lot of help.
He directed me through my student career and also supported me at the beginning of the diversion career.
Maybe just because of that, it's easier for me to go on with his job.
Eri Klas has injected the Birgitta Festival team so much good and, of course, it will all be transferred to me.
It was great to join the team who knows how things work.
The great heart of Eri Klas also gave me the strength to move forward with the Birgitta Festival in Tallinn.
And here I am now and I can do it!
What could cheer the audience at the modern festival you offer?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania, and as a surprise, the first ballet written on the story of Astrid Lindgren will come to the presentation.
That's what "Karlsson is flying."
And one of the crimeal noises about it is that the author of this ballet is the author of the Latvian composer, Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed the desire to write this book.
He must have lived in his soul since he was a child.
Risto, how do you handle all this?
I'm sure thanks to my supportive partner.
That kind of work needs a support system and a lot of love, and I'm lucky to have it.
And I've noticed that my personal emotions are not so dependent on other people as much as I am, or how I'm going against every new day.
And such an informed tone, keeping the positiveness and actually smiling yourself in the mirror in the morning, significantly increased my percentage of luck.
Especially now this week, when the most important samples are, I have practiced it particularly enthusiasticly, and it works.
Smiling at yourself activates the brain and raises the tone.
It's not just a word.
I don't think people know half the things about their body that the universe offers to them, but, you know, everyone's gonna discover it at the same time.
Right now, it's an important moment.
Do you have a ritual before you enter the dirigend remote?
There is. We've got to change our clothes for more comfortable.
This is a little moment for yourself.
But in general, yes, I don't have a chance to rest before the big show or to make a little sleep.
In fact, I even like to communicate with people actively, even before entering the dirigend panel.
But everybody come to the Birgitta Festival, here's what to discover for not a very big opera and ballet friend!
Look at the moody video with Risto Joost!
New results of the age assessment of Swedish acyl applicants were published
In Sweden, a test was carried out with medical assessment of their age with a new approach. The latest results of the test show that more than 80 percent of the untested were estimated older than 18, but not all believed in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Medical Institute (Rättsmedicinalverket) started tests towards the beginning of this year.
The tests were established for a more accurate age assessment during the application for the asyl after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to correctly determine the age of several alleged minor refugees.
To date, Migrationsverket has submitted 6880 cases to the test and the Court of Justice Institute has issued a total of 2481 results between March and mid-2017 until 31 July.
Eighty percent (2002) were estimated to be 18 years old or older and 25 more cases were assessed by the Court Medical Institute that the test could be "may be 18 years old or older".
In 432 cases, it was concluded that a person is "assuming to be younger than 18".
Tests shall only be used if the age of a person is under the question mark.
According to Johan Göransson, the institute of judicial medicine, the results are consistent with those of the previous months.
"We do not see a great difference compared to last months' statistics, numbers are quite consistent," he said to the newspaper The Local.
The fact that a large number of cases were assessed older than 18 does not necessarily mean that the applicants of the asyl have lied about their age.
The Institute issued the results of the test in May 581 and said that in 442, there are references to the fact that the investigating person is 18 years old or older.
But when the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined their 581 test results, it turns out that 243 cases were directly claimed that it would be in 18 this year.
The medical age assessment method during which smart-hamb X-rays and knee-length MRTs are used to allow dentists and radioologists to analyse is critical in some circles.
One of the sceptics is the endocrinoologist of the Karolinska Institute Claude Marcus, whose tasks include an evaluation of human biological maturity in order to determine whether they passed the puberty before or later.
"I've had reason to think about it, and I don't think that the measurement method currently used should be used.
The determination of a biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say for certain, then we should not make a face that we can," he said to the Metro newspaper.
But Johan Göransson, the Institute of Justice, defending the accuracy of the tests: "In general, it can be said that the risk of adulting a child is low.
The highest, or about 10%, is the risk if a person is slightly below 18."

Anna Maria Orel, a 20-year-old leftrahid, made a beautiful debut at the London MM, making a great 18th place with 67.37.
The Orel was the youngest female chaperone of MMI, and the joyful woman confirmed that she hopes to fight for the medals in the future.
The competition went well and got a good experience.
With the first test (64.80), I immediately did my average result, the second (62.80) risked too much, and on the third (67.37) I was able to keep my head clear," said Orel after the competition.
I was looking for my emissions, and I'm very glad I found it.
Anna Maria Orel's MM debut ended with a good 18th place.
The rainfall didn't interfere with Orel because he trained through the winter on the TTÜ stadium.
"I'm scratched," he said with a little snake.
The London Olympic Stadium had almost a full house of people, whether or could Orel sense people around him or shut themselves off?
I get it, but in a positive sense.
Everyone says it'll give you more - that's it!
If you compete, you can experience it.
The Orel confirmed that he would remain in peace with the MMi debut, and he would be waiting for many more good competitions: "I came here in the 32nd season of this year, or the last result, I finished at 18th.
That's a very decent result.
I'm 20 years old and I'm MM-- that's the only thing that matters.
I take a good experience, and some days I want to compete for the medals.
Governor of West Virginia announced a party exchange
On Thursday night at the meeting with President Trump, the governor of the West Virginia Democrat Jim Justice announced that he was changing parties.
"Let's love it or not, but the democrats walked away from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today, I will tell you, having prayed and thoughtfully... today I will tell you the Western Virginia that I can no longer help you as a democratic governor."
At the gathering, the joys were triggered.
"This will make me Republican tomorrow," added Justice.
"Treener, I'd say it's time to play another game."
Trump had previously promised a great announcement at the Western Virginia gathering.
Trump won 42 points in West Virginia and Justice did not support the candidate of the Democrats Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who, according to Forbes' data, is the only billionaire of the state, proved to be elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and he owns the coal industry from his father.
His value is about $1.59 billion.
At the same time, the National Committee of the Republics (RNC) announced on Thursday evening that "the exchange of the Governing Party of Justice is another strike on the democratic parties, which would rather prevent the country from becoming better than working for it".
"From all 15 governors and control over the lowest number of states in history - the announcement of Governor Justice is simply the most recent denial of parties that are ultimately guided and cannot find a positive and combining message," said Mrs Ronna McDaniel in his statement to CBS News.
It's no surprise that where there are many people, there are many injured people.
Urmet at the weekly medical axis told the evening paper that they had to distribute a lot of patchs.
The blisters and convulsions are fundamental, out of twisted and light falls.
Of course, the headaches, back and leg pains.
Urmet said that visitors will come to the festival with false demands of foot, and that is how the problems come.
Medicalians have also had to help a few more injured visitors - have been some panic attacks and one fracture of their legs.
We also have sewings when a person has broken a hand or a finger.
We're gonna do the smaller seams here. We're gonna send the bigger ones to the hospital.

Coe thanked the Russians for their honest apologies for the doping dance.
According to her words, the International Neighbour of the Light Force, Sebastian Coe praised "Russia's Thursday honest apologies" for the doping candal, but repeated that it is not time for the country to return sports.
Dmitry Shylakhtin, the Russian mild-powered nephew at the IAAF Congress in the pre-event of the World Championships, said that the contest ban on his country is right and that he has a firm goal to fight doping.
He apologised to "all the lightweight men who have been snapped away from the gold and silver medals in the races".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of putting in place a contest ban established in November 2015 after the World Antidoping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of the country's supported doping in Russia.
"I think it was a very honest answer today, a very fair presentation," said President Coe of the IAAF to journalists.
"The entire Council and the Congress were pleased that the Russian Alliance itself acknowledged that they have had quite difficult times and that they will make everything possible for the reorganisation."
According to Coe, he was also pleased that Russia accepted its own criteria for reintroduction.
"I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress will take place, but the Congress supports the working group's proposal that this is not the time for Russia to be withdrawn," said Coe.
"We're gonna do everything we can in the next few months to normalize the situation.
We have always based on the principle that we want to separate clean athletes from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian militiaists who meet the strict criteria of the IAAF will compete as neutral athletes in the World Championships in London on Friday.
Rune Andersen, head of the IAAF Working Group, said on Monday that Russia does not meet a number of criteria for re-establishment.
After the report to the IAAF Council, he stated to the journalists in London that doping controls are still insufficient and that trainers who have been banned are still free to operate.
The revolution of electric cars significantly changes the demand of metals.
Who are the winners and the losers?
Not only will the revolution of electric cars significantly change everything from the fuel market to the infrastructure, it also creates new winners and losers on the metal market.
Although mines like Glencore can say that from one place they win and lose, smaller mining companies will not help.
Now Glencore serves coal and oil, but then the age of electric cars increases demand for cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminium and nickel.
In this year, the decisions of the UK, France and Norway on the spread of electric cars have increased their contributions, which will allow the sale of new cars using fossil fuels to be prohibited in the coming decades.
Since then, Volvo has already known that they are planning to abandon the internal combustion engine and Tesla will bring a cheaper model 3 electric car on the market.
According to the Bloomberg New Energy Finance forecasts, more electric cars are already being sold over two decades than those using oil fuels.
"That changes everything about the metals in the past," said the Capital Economics raw material analyst Simona Gambranin to Bloomberg.
We have already seen a major impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium that have grown in demand for years.
In electric cars there are about three times more copper than in the ordinary car, Glencore reported.
More copper is needed in loading stations, and Exane BNP Paribas estimates that it will increase copper demand by about 5 per cent by 2025.
The increase in demand for electric car accumulators means additional demand for lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese.
Glencore will receive from the growing trend of electric cars from copper price increases and from the fact that it is the world's largest cobalt producer, predicted by Jefferies Group.
According to this broker company, other electric car races are the winners of Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market is responding to a changing trend.
This year, 70 percent of the cobalt has risen at the London Metal Exchange.
The price increase in the country was 37 per cent.
Copper has also grown by 14 percent today, mainly due to growth.
Glencore's share increased by 20 percent in London after rivaling Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billitoton and Anglo American.
On the side of the losers, there are lead-providing companies such as Recyclex and Campine, who need to adapt to a new era.
The main end-use of lead is batteries supplying starters of petrol and diesel motor vehicles with power.
Electric cars use lithium ion accumulators.
"This is a serious risk of plinch racing unless another purpose is found to overcome the decline in demand", said the Bank of America Merrill Lynch metal market analyst Michael Widmer.
The impact of the unfolding trend is still not seen in the form of a lead price movement.
Lead has risen by 17 per cent this year, with the best metal in London among the main industrial metals.
Investors can see problems with metal only far from the future.
"I'm not sure the lead is so bad because cheap oil keeps the ordinary cars in competition," said Triland Metals' sales manager Herwig Schmidt.
If the demand of the lead falls, it happens slowly.
It could be like this in about ten years.
However, the stricter emission standards mean that the demand for hybrid cars is increasing depending on the lead-based battery developed on the regular start of engines is assessed by the international lead and zinc research organisation.
Light metals like aluminium replace steel because the lighter car can drive further by less electricity.
This explains the additional demand of 1,6 million tonnes of aluminium eggs until 2013-2016.
This represents 2.7 per cent of the total production of aluminium in the world.
This trend is likely to get worse, said Widmer.
Aluminium has risen by 13 per cent this year, as increasing demand by car manufacturers has led to market deficits.
Steel producers don't sleep.
The AK Steel Holding will cooperate with General Motors to use nanotechnology for the production of amazing light car bodies.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also trying to develop a lighter melt of steel to resist the aluminium rubber.
"The superior steel should be the answer to this development," said Exane BNP Paribas analyst Sylvain Brune.
There is some success in Europe.
The end of the naphtha period can also cause suffering on the platinum.
The soil cost about half of this precious metal diesel car catalysts, reported by the metal refiner Johnson Matthey.
"Now there are high demand raw materials such as oil and platinum that may not have a great demand in the future," said Natixis raw material analyst Bernard Dahlah.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole become less important, but they become important within 15 years.
Platinum producers believe that the demand for diesel hybrid cars continues.
The uncore leader, Marc Grynberg, said that in 2025 more hybrid cars will continue to be sold in 2025.
In the 10-year perspective, the platinum manufacturers have great hope for the developed hydrogen base of Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motos, which depends on the platinum to produce hydrogen electricity.
However, this technology has not yet justified itself in commercial terms.
"Disel seems to be a clear loser on the way to the electric cars," said Exane BNP of Paribas Brune.
In July, the German car manufacturers became involved in a major re-run, since the Stuttgart court prohibited the use of diesel in Mercedes-Benz and Porsche’s hometown.
How football financial rules affect Neymar's transition to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing uncontrolled use of European football clubs do not prevent Neymar from the Spanish football club to the Paris-Saint Germain club.
Any consequences of the UEFA, the leading body of Europe, which has the power to prohibit the teams from taking part in the UEFA tournament, are still waiting for Paris Saint-Germain.
The financial rules for the fair game imposed by UEFA in 2011 (FFP) mean that the PSG must at some point demonstrate that Neymar’s transition was financed without huge losses.
Barcelona was paid EUR 222 million (262 million) exclusively for buying a Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar's salary is going to reach tens of million dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of Neymar's transfer to the French club.
The PSG will undoubtedly be able to get Neymar recruited and add such money to its star-developed line, given that the team is financed by a family in charge of the Qatar energy criminal.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on recruiting players, but they need to balance it with legal sources of income that allow them to come out in the football business.
The FFP was founded on Michel Platin after he was elected President of the UEFA in 2007.
This former French player believed that the clubs that were successful in searching for large debts actually engaged in fraud and risking loss if banks or owners were to refrain from supporting them.
As from 2011, the FFP’s debts are focused on monitoring these losses instead of FFP’s debts.
This change means that the business model Roman Abramovich used first in 2003 to buy a club with potential potential and then make major costs to make the team better and create a global brand is harder to apply.
FFP for the current three-year assessment period, which lasts until 2018, the clubs may bear losses of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite the fact that Platin was dismissed in 2015 from the Presidential Office, his descendant, Aleksander Ceferin, is still committed to preventing excessive spending.
"FFFP is certainly not dead, and we will certainly continue to strengthen these rules," said Andrea Traverso, the Associated Press, who is a supervisor of the UEFA FFP last week.
Although the PSG paid for Neymar’s oversale clause as a whole issue, it is possible for them to divide this amount into parts for accounting purposes throughout the period of validity of the contract.
Neymar concluded a five-year contract, which is why the transitional fee can be shown in the following five years as an amount of EUR 44,4 million per year.
In the case of the first wave of FFP sanctions, in 2014, PSG, together with Manchester City belonging to Abu Dhab, received the most serious penalties.
A fine of EUR 60 million (this time, EUR 82 million) was imposed on PSG, which was later reduced to EUR 20 million, and the club was required to limit the team of the Masters League in the period 2014-2015 to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA is searching for clubs who may try to design regulatory financial institutions by exploding their income through companies related to the owners of the club.
The KATAR company may sponsor PSG, but if the sponsorship value is considered to be above the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered as official income.
This was the case in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of the Qatar Tourism Authority's PSG support was dissolved.
It has been said that a certain part of Neymar's PSG service can become from the 2022 World Championships Management Committee through payments from Katar.
However, PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar could be ambassador of the World Championships, claiming that the UEFA regulatory authorities could easily reveal such a maneuver.
The penalties previously imposed on PSG mean that the UEFA is even more vigilant in relation to any effort to disregard the rules.
People who were familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not discussed the transition with PSG Neymar preventively.
They talked to The Associated Press on condition that their anonymity is guaranteed because they are not allowed to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that the PSG earned more than EUR 10 million of profits in the period 2015-2016 on the turnover of around EUR 542,4 million.
Data have not yet been published in the last financial year.
PSG hopes that Neymar's arrival will have a good effect on sponsoring transactions, trade and shirt sales.
The club is expected to increase turnover by at least 30 % in connection with the conclusion of the contract.
Spain too, clearly irritated by the departure of one of the biggest football stars, tried to prevent Neymar from moving, claiming that PSG would infringe the FFP.
"This is a clear "financial doping" case with the club and the country," said President La Liga Javier Tebas to the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the fact that PSG belongs primarily to Katari.
Arsenal's manager, Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to the American Sports Magnet, shares the view of La Liga that the country finances the club.
"This is the result of property rights and has completely changed the entire football landscape in the last 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"If the club belongs to the country, everything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of the fair game, as the country may have other ways or other interests to represent the country of such a great player."

Today 50 years ago: the hurricane storm in Estonia, which ripped the roofs and windows from the houses.
The hurricane referred to as the 100th storm, which caused major damage to the West, Harjumaa and Raplamaa on 6 and 7 August.
In northwest Estonia, over 30 m/s was the wind speed during these days.
My old man ran from one cornered tree to another in the garden and touched his hands to support them.
It was all dark and bruised, like the end of the world.
In 2002, the old lady Linda Kurova Haapsalust, an interview from Estonian Nature, was already flying from the houses.
Linda's husband saw his planted garden collapse.
But what do you still support with the wooden hands where you get against that storm?
The sea came under the window, squeezed into the windows," said Mrs Linda, who lived in the street of Kalda Haapsalus.
The fact that the road was full of trees and the roof of the railway station had fly 20-30 meters away, most of Linda saw like the Haapsaluans only the next morning.
According to the locals, the trees behind Paralepa were in the loop, some completely down, some to half.
Everyone looked very depressing, the storm went through beautiful old trees as a rag and pragin like a war.
In the August of 1967, West Virumaa was not able to suffer very much from West Estonia, but the damage was also large there, written by Virumaa Journal in 2007.
Haapsalu Lossipark and Padis Park were wiped off the ground, but the parks in our neighborhood were also severely affected.
In Tallinn, the wind rate was up to 35 meters per second, approximately 130 kilometres per hour.
In Tallinn, in the evening of the 6th August, a little girl cried: "Mom, Mom!
Chickens are in the air and can't be down anymore!", wrote the Virumaa Journal.
During the storm, the building of the landscape in Viljandi destroyed so much that it was decided to destroy later.
Augustitorm did not resist the Tyri skiing mountain structures, which were no longer restored.
On August 12, 1967, the Red Star wrote that the cleaning of cities and settlements is slowly progressing from the fallen trees and their occupying them, and the inhabitants could be involved in cleaning.
In the storm, fruit crops were also severely affected, and the newspaper stated that "partite organisations must be both in the work of reconstruction and in the harvesting process as a stimulator and a guiding director".
Orcans can be spoken if the average wind speed exceeds 32,7 m/s.
The clean wind record in Estonia lasts from 2 November 1969, when Ruhn was measured at the speed of 48 m/s.
Onlydloo’s island broke a measuring instrument, so the strong wind rate measured there could not be accurately recorded.
The secret of clean swimming pools: night cleaning and poor beach weather
Cold summer eyes also mean a smaller cleaning condition in Tallinn bathtubs.
"If there's no weather, then there's people on the beach, and if there's no people," says the beach cleaner.
On the beach of Stroom in North Tallinn, the shouting eagles.
They are offered a melody of competition in low turns of tractors, which squeeze the stripes off the plaque.
In fact, the last seven centimetres deep into the sand, picking out the seabed and the man's abandoned ribs: bottle caps, cigarettes and stuff.
People still come to the beach, regardless of whether the water is warm or not.
If there is a beautiful weather, then there are people on the beach, and if not, there are no people," says the company Haaberst Administration of the beach cleaning director Aleksandr Usov.
It's 6:30 p.m. and the beach has a bitter cleaning work, because at 8:00, the plate must be good for the people.
Usov's already on the office at 4:00.
After Stroom, he's still keeping an eye on Pirita, Harku Lake, Kakumäe and the Pikakar of the Paljasaare.
The amount of waste has decreased.
It was a lot more years ago.
People are already able to appreciate what they are doing for them," says Usov, who has been cleaning up the beach for 15 years.
Before something new was set up, it was broken the next day.
Now they're keeping what's on the beach.
Clean beach price
One of the biggest works on the Estonian beaches is cleaning sea waste or adrud on the shore.
For example, at the beach in Pirita, it needs to be carried on a beach season of 400 000 tonnes.
"This is an incredible amount," says Usov.
The second large category is the waste of folk, or all that people leave behind.
There are eight large garbage containers on the beach strip of Stroom, which need to be empty three times a week.
That's how much garbage comes.
However, colder summer eyes have meant that the garbage is five times less than otherwise.
The third species consist of abandoned items.
Mostly, they're kids' bones.
As this harvest, Usov has swept ten of the model cars out of the sand.
They'll be waiting for the owners on the beach.
"It's usually coming out more of them, but it's a normal catch," he already knows that soon he'll find them again inside the sand.
Children come to the beach and take toys to drown them again in the sand.
Waste dispersed
Erika Scholler, the representative of Haaberst’s administrative services, acknowledges that the work of the tractor is disturbed by the locals.
The noise, which lasts from night to early morning, disturbs the sleep of the people living in the neighborhood.
But this job is impossible on the day.
In one month, the wrist has to be screened twice.
"If we don't do this, the part of the city will punish us," says Scholler.
However, the aim is, like Pirita, Pikakar and Pärnu, to get the Stroom beach under the international quality mark of blue tree.
"Working with Europe there is much more work in Estonia to ensure that the beaches are maintained," says Scholler.
We have more adrenaline and stones and harder to sew sand.
However, there are less garbage on our beaches than elsewhere in Europe.
Having heard about the garbage on the beach, Martin, who lives near Stroom, will enter the conversation circle of journalists and cleaners, highlighting the current narrow spots on the beach.
There's a terrible picture everywhere in the morning.
The problem is with birds and bottle cleaners who have been pulled by garbage bags," says Martin.
Although it is difficult to assume that people can change their behavioural habits, Martin hopes that the city government will do something about garbage bags and put on covers, for example, to prevent at least the birds from renewing it.
However, Martin is generally satisfied with Stroom’s coastal development.
It can be seen that the city will take care of it.
With children's fields, lighted and freshly asphalted roads, it has become more pleasant.
There was only one way to drive on rollers once," Martin says.
Findings of a treasure hunter in Stroom: coins, only coins
The 40-year-old Dimitri, who as a treasurer, has come to use the medal period of the morning, combines with a metal detector on the beach.
He doesn't think he'll find anything valuable today or in the future.
The sea gods aren't generous enough for that.
"I've been working on this for a year and I haven't found anything valuable until now," Dmitri says.
As a hobby cheque, Dmitri has some euro coins, bottle caps, and dangerous pounds that later throw in the garbage box.
Normally, there are coins.
"Dear, rings and other such things are usually not," says a treasure.
Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to keep interest rates at the previous level, as ineffective economic growth and inflation reduction have softened speculations in relation to the rise.
Bank of England has warned that economic growth remains a blur, since households' sealed incomes have put interest rates on hold.
The policy makers of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted in favour of maintaining 6:2 rates at 0.25%, and fewer members require an increase in this month, as slow growth has weakened support for growth.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank cuts the growth forecast of 2017.7% and its 1.6% in 2018. It warned that the pressure on household incomes would remain, as the autumn is still expected to increase inflation by 3%.
At the same time, the Bank also indicated that the increase in rates would be necessary to control the inflation caused by Brexit over the next few years and that there might be a necessary increase in the expected loan costs on financial markets.
Members also voted a year ago in favour of partial withdrawal of the mammoth package, which was placed on the economy as a result of Brexit.
In February, the Bank will terminate a fixed-term financing scheme providing banks with low-cost funding, although it said that there is now a GBP 15 billion greater offer, which is GBP 115 billion.
In the minutes of the decision on the determination, the Bank says: "The central forecast of the MPC will remain ineffective in the near future of GDP, as the difficult situation in real incomes in households will continue to affect consumption."
For the definitions, it was repeated that in order to mitigate inflation, a "supporting some of the financial policy" and a "supporting much more" than expected on the markets is necessary.
The stock exchange is now predicting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and the second increase in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that all jumps were gradual and limited.
The reduced growth forecasts of the bank for this year and next year are comparable to the forecasts of May and 1.7%.
The forecast for growth of 1,8 % in 2018.
After this news, the pound rate fell for the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to make changes is due to recent disappointing growth indicators that have squeezed growing hopes of increasing GDP growth in the second quarter of the previous three months increased by 0.2% to 0.3%.
The bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although at the end of the year it is about to accumulate a bit.
The Bank’s latest inflation report gave little reason to cheer households suffering from rising inflation and aggravated wage increases, saying that the situation would get a little worse before recovery.
It was added that monetary policy cannot prevent the impact of income in the next few years, but the three-year projection is expected to recover substantially.
The growing demand for British production also stimulates the economy because of a weak pound, which will partly reimburse consumers' lower costs.
The decision will take a year after the rate was taken by 0.25% in the last August after the shocking EU referendum, leading to a sudden weakening of the pound.
According to the Bank, it is likely that it will take four years to fully absorb prices and the economy.
Before the last decision of the Bank, it was to feel the growing demand for the increase in the rate, as inflation had increased the pressure on households in narrowness; in July, three policy makers called for a 0.5% increase in the rate.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month, compared to 2.9% in June, although it was expected by the bank in the following months and is expected to rise again.
The Bank stated that the excess growth compared to the 2-percentage objective was caused by a weak neighbour.
Coreco, head of mortgage brokers, Andrew Montlake, said: "After the recent fall in exchange rates, it seems that the mortgage market will become increasingly competitive as lenders want to work and hope to end the year positively.
The stock exchange seems particularly favourable to those whose current transactions will be completed because refinancing, often unserved and low rates, has become increasingly popular."
NHS is writing to 10,000 people contraindications to HIV
Since September, patients have access to the preventive treatment of "transformative" HIV after a battle in the Supreme Court on whether NHS should finance the medicine.
NHS England reported that NHS England is now making available to 10,000 pre-exposure (PrEP) tablets for the initial three-year clinical trial, which are administered prior to the interim interval, which has shown a decrease in the risk of infection in people with a high risk by approximately 86%.
The NHS agreed to finance the clinical trial after the appellant court supported the decision of the Supreme Court that NHS would be able to pay for PrEP, despite its own claims that the medicine should be financed by local authorities.
Simon Stevens, CEO of NHS England, welcomed this on Thursday's publication as a "new extensive intervention", while the NAT described it as a "twisted moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to register people. In October, more clinics will be added before the programme will be launched everywhere in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prevention (PrEP) is a curve of HIV medicines taken prior to the interval to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
The results of clinical trials show that PrEP significantly reduces the transmission of HIV in people at risk of infection.
Prevention of PrEP means that there is a sufficient amount of medicinal products in the human body that prevent infection in HIV.
Such medicines may be taken every day or at the latest two hours before the interval.
The appropriate candidates include homosexual or bisexual men, transsexual people and people whose partners have been infected with HIV and are not receiving treatment.
Clinics will identify suitable people who are willing to participate in a clinical trial, including men, women, transsexual people and those whose partner with HIV is not receiving antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there can also register their wish for participation in the local sexual health clinic in the program.
The programme will pay £10 million, and NHS England signed a contract to obtain the pharmaceuticals this week after the international procurement procedure.
The clinical trial aims to assess the actual potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence of the intended product and how it is consumed and applied in a large picture.
Stevens said: "This new extensive intervention should complement and strengthen the fight against widespread and increasingly successful HIV spread.
This is another milestone of over three decades in the fight against one of the greatest health problems of mankind."
Deborah Gold, CEO of the NAT said, "This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if it is properly targeted to those who need it and belong to the risk group, offers an opportunity to change the HIV epidemic of England.
Since September, people with high HIV risks in England have access to a powerful new tool that is individually managed and is not dependent on negotiations with a partner, thereby improving many lives.
We welcome this announcement warmly."
Terrence Higgins' Executive Director, Ian Green, said: "Now it is essential to ensure that the clinical trial over the country is quickly delayed and that no member of the HIV risk group would be missed.
Now that PrEP's clinical trial medicine has been obtained, we are on our way to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV infection.
Sharon Hodgson said: "The start of the preEP clinical trial is very welcome and very late after months of delays and strangling the government's legs.
The evidence shows how much changes this medicine can lead to the termination of HIV prevention and its life-changing infection.
This clinical trial will bring us a step closer to the full understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that a clinical trial be carried over by the country as soon as possible to protect people who have contact with HIV, and to bring us a step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society."
Electricity price increased by 12% in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
In July, the difference between the stock exchange price for electricity for the next day between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania fell to EUR 1.94 compared to EUR 7.71 in June, Elering reported.
The main reason for the price difference is the errors in the Lithuanian-Sweden Community.
In Estonia, the average exchange price for electricity was 34.33 euros of megawatt-hours last month and the price rose by 12 per cent compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by five per cent from 36,27 euros per hour.
In Finland, the price was EUR 34,17 and the system price for the Nord Pool of electricity exchange was at the same time EUR 26,37 per megawatt hour.
Prices increased by 12 per cent and by seven per cent respectively.
Between Estonia and Finland, electricity moved 75 per cent of previous month's hours in Estonia and 16 per cent of hours in Estonia in Finland.
The remaining nine per cent of hours between the two countries did not deal with the next day.
The electricity between Estonia and Latvia moved 99 per cent from Estonia to Latvia and 73 per cent of the hours of the total transmission capacity was used.
According to the transactions that took place on the last day of July on the Nasdaq OMX market, the electricity stock exchange price may be around EUR 34 and EUR 37 per megawatt hour in September in August.
The price of carbon dioxide affecting the production price of electricity increased last month and the transaction took place at EUR 5,04-5,47 per tonne.
Highlife - half floor and smart designs have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spatial home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker, a passionate real estate repairer, changed his big Knightsbridge home against Earls Court's apartment in 2014.
It's on the first floor of Queen Anne Terrace, and that Joanne has not packed his bags and sold the apartment on the other hand, is a respect for the new design.
"Even before I lived with an ex-husband in Knightsbridge," said Joanne.
"I was looking for something that would be equivalent to my price.
They showed me this Earls Court apartment and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and made a offer the same day."
Since the first visit, this 93 square metre apartment has passed a complete innovation course.
At the beginning, it was a single bedroom and a complex apartment - to reach the bedroom - it had to walk through the kitchen. Joanne wanted to add a storage room and a half floor to use high ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
These were my demands," he said.
He hired Erfan Azadi from the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed to use 3.6 m heights of ceilings and create a home that would not just be a development object, but a place where Joanne could live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two spaces to each other, so it was an architectural challenge to create a half floor where you could stand up.
Erfan had to make a creative approach.
"The metal structure is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to reorganise the spaces, so they were on each other, without having to bow.
It was not just the construction of the platform, but we used the steel structure to ensure that the height of both upper and lower space is correct."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to create two full- height rooms in the room with numerous dramatic elements.
From the half floor, the old, copper light from the Retrouvius window will be opened to the glamorous dwellings below.
Golden furniture with mirror surfaces, silver details and retro-reflecting Serge Mouille lighters emphasise room style.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatricality, spatiality and light.
The mirrors are attached to both ends of the short corridor to make it seem longer.
In the kitchen, the back wall with a mirror makes the window open to another room.
At the entrance, the mirror cabinet offers a storage room for all Joanne's dishes and glassware.
The living room will be added to the charm to close the kitchen section if not used by imagination of the glamourous space.
The conventional kitchens aren't new.
At this kitchen, however, there is a unique fact that it is a lifted door of the type of garage.
"It's a bit of a projection," explains Erfan from the MDF door with steel strength.
"It has a counterbalance, which makes it slidering very easily if it pushes up."
Thanks to the smart use of the room and the storage room, Joanne now has 16 extra square meters, an additional bedroom and a better housing plan.
"In the end of the end, the floor area is what you sell - or what gives value to real estate," says Erfan.
"The real estate broker enters an old-fashioned room and makes calculations based on the area of the floor."
Here they have been able to increase the floor surface by using high-quality materials that add luxury to the room.
"Materials are what you touch and thus help to create emotional ties with home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the power cable in the wall.
It's important, but don't make your heart sound."
This shows that a good design and an enlarged area helps make a rather common apartment something amazing.
In fact, they can cause a desire not to leave, as happened to Joanne.
The main character Dane Jensen is a chicago's skyfighter who competes with his colleague for the promotion.
It's nothing but the amount of money you earned, with all the ethics you forget.
His wife and three children only see him early in the morning and late.
In the first half of the film, I think that it's the version of the "Maker" business world, even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler's speechmaneer.
What's going on with the film, the less the cable house element remains, and the moralizing intention of the filmmakers is becoming more and more visible.
A life-changing experience will be the cancer of the son’s disease to the main person.
Now a choice must be made between work and family life.
A dreaming son from the architectural office makes my father walk to the large buildings of Chicago think of really important things like faith, goodness, love... without even touching the disaster of twins.
After the third scene, where the son opens his eyes, it becomes a feeling that filmmakers are based on the goal of crying to the audience, because even the most grieving viewer cannot hold tears back in the face of the sufferings of the cute cancer boy.
When the son falls into a coma and his head seems hopeless, his father will fully understand his work’s morality and will do a good thing for an old man seeking work.
Now, I bet myself in my mind - if the movie has a happy feeling, I'll prescribe my visibility after the movie's coffee, but if I'm wrong, the scener can at least give you one surprise.
For a moment, there's a suspicion that I'm going to miss coffee when your husband calls Dane from the hospital and the man storms down the hallway.
Rather, the son has miraculously healed, and even though his father has just lost his job, it is also positive, because it is now time to deal with the family.
I can feel well too - I can predict the end of the American drama!
In honor of the truth, the film has been well-built, all the elements necessary for it are there.
Can cry, can laugh, actors are good and moral beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
I'm sure this movie will bring you in well.
The new Staff Commander of Trump intends to limit the media consumption of the President.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do this.
Then he'd be the first.
Politico writes that the new Head of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the information flow, including news, reaching President Trumpin, in the hope that it will keep the boss in a better way.
Here's the break reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When the new Staff Commander of the White House John F. Kelly met with high officials on his first working day, he raised the key problem of President Donald Trumpi in the White House, which he was planning to solve to reach the President's hands for bad information.
Kelly told the officials that the information had to go through him, either on paper or on meetings, because the president would make better decisions if he was given good information."
Kelly's diagnosis seems perfectly logical, but others have tried it and have failed to track Trump's media consumption.
President Trump's relationship with TV goes back to decades, and now that he's in the White House, his television screening habits aren't lost.
"When the candidate Trump was mad about the dishonest media reflection, it was worth showing him that he was reflected honestly in the impressive publications," said the former campaign counselor Sam Nunberg in February to Politico.
Politico Tara Palmer wrote at that time that "the six former campaign workers said Trump's Twitter habits are the key to ensuring that his personal media consumption contains a stable song of praise".
All right.
But the idea of using Trumpi Twitter has never been "controlled" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign workers know something that the rest of us don't know that Trump's sparks would have been even more combustible without their interventions.
We'll probably never know about the sparks Trump didn't post.
When his assistants were able to save him from trouble a few times, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to stop Trump from constantly creating noemika.
A part of the problem is that in the White House, which consists of competition clicks, people try to promote their own interests exclusively by sending to Trump material that supports their world views, but may not always be reliable.
Politico, reflecting the whole story, wrote in May about the tendency of advisers to feed information with strategic question to the President.
One of the examples described by reporter Shane Goldmacher is as follows:
"Prices and former Trump are underlined that Trump may react to negative press, particularly harmful information leaks, explosively, obsessing the detection of their source.
This also happened at the end of February when someone gave the President a printed copy of the article of GotNews.com of the website of Charles C. Johnson, which accused the Deputy Chief of Staff of Katie Walshi, that he was a source of the White House's "Multiforms".
It doesn't matter that Johnson's been permanently blocked from Twitter because of a distraction, or that he did not offer any concrete evidence, or that he has filed false charges in the past and taken them back.
Trump read the article and began to ask about Walsh. "
Goldmacher added that the former Staff Commander Reince Priebus and the Head of White House's Office Rob Porter " has tried to establish a system for managing and documenting documents coming to Trump."
How did it work?
Kelly's trying to do exactly the same three months later.
Maybe he's a more effective leader from Priebus, but Trump's still impulsive and his assistants are still competing for influence.
These unchanged factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians coming from the foreign capital do not get permission for the bitter performance.
A lot of foreigners play in the city centre of Tallinn.
Those with whom the evening paper got to talk were admitted to playing in the old town without the permission of the city government.
First, we found three street musicians near the Viru gates who had taken as many dogs with them.
It was clearly seen that musicians with scrambles and loose clothes were backpackers who needed a shower for the berry.
Despite the appearance, the only woman in the community played a story with a fun rhythm, while one man next to him called the three balls and the passers closer.
The third man had sat next to them on a backpack and smoked a screw-up in his heart.
Their three dogs didn't let the past people disturb themselves.
Bob, who played with Noem and balls, told me that they were playing music on the streets for fun and money.
The aim of the society’s performance was to collect ticket money on a ship flying to Finland on the same day.
Question: Did they ask the city permission to play in old town, shake Noem and Bob's head?
First of all, we didn't know.
Secondly, we will never stay in one city more than a day or a couple and mostly give permits for a month or something like that.
There's no point in paying for that," explained Bob.
When we got back to the Viru gates about 20 minutes later, we saw that two women were at the musicians' house and they were chasing them away.
The Society moved to the center of Viru to touch happiness with backpacks and dogs.
On the Viru street, three Polish young men, one of whom played a violin, the other cluster and the third had brought along an electronic piano.
"We are here to provide people with entertainment to spread music and joy and to make money for fuel and living," explained Mivosh, the trio pianist.
According to Mivosh, they are aware that the city government must have permission to perform.
"Of course we don't have it," he said when he was joking.
But we hope that if people enjoy our music, there is no problem.
Of course, when the police come, we're going somewhere else, but we have to try," he added.
Eesti Pank purchased bonds for 149 million euros in the framework of the euro area central banks' public-purchasing programme in July, with a total increase of 4.36 billion euros in the central bank's debt portfolio.
The central bank shall not publish more detailed information on purchases.
The Estonian Bank President Hardo Hansson has previously explained that the Eurosystem central banks’ asset purchase plan covers three different purchase programmes: financial sector covered bonds, asset-backed bonds (ABS) and public bonds (PSPP).
The central bank purchases bonds from the market to encourage investors who have sold bonds to invest elsewhere.
As a result, the yield of lower risk assets falls and it motivates investors to take greater risks.
In general, under the public debt purchase programme, each central bank purchases its government bonds and does not purchase debts from other countries.
Since the Estonian State has not issued debt instruments, Eesti Pank will make the so-called substitution items within the volume allocated to them.
In the countries where the offer of bonds corresponding to the purchasing scheme is limited, the central banks will also make replacement purchases.
Eesti Pank usually purchases debts of European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank with the approval of Hansson.
Eesti Pank purchases bonds under the asset purchase programme from March 2015.
In the meantime, Elering’s bonds were also purchased, but Eesti Pank will no longer buy Elering’s bonds from June 2016.
On behalf of the central banks of the euro area, both Elering and Eesti Energia are purchased from June to the Finnish Central Bank.
Travelers ignore the scratch and return to the "millionaire divisions"
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in West Midlands have reappeared to contradict decision-making travellers who have ignored the dignified deck to win back the field away from their wool.
Travelers have parked their 20 trailers on the field of wealthy "millionaires" in the area of Solihull street.
They have returned with the army of horses, children and trucks after they were kicked out in May, without letting themselves interfere with the cargo that was dug by the council to prevent their invasion.
The tactical group found a weak place in the protection boundaries by squeezing their vehicles through the unprotected part that had been left on foot.
The people of rabbits have shredded the Solihull Council, saying that the council is "non-profit in dealing with the problem".
One anonymous resident said, "They moved there on Monday night after their expulsion from Bentley Heath, where they were throwing passers with stones.
The Council must be ashamed to act, because they are useless to deal with the problem.
The travellers were there in May, they were driven away, and now they're back.
They came to see them last night, probably even more today."
He added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with such things by obtaining long barriers to protecting his parks.
I live on the streetsbrook, and I am not pleased that I have to continue to pay the voluntarily tax if the council can't even stop it."
One local resident who also wanted to be anonymous said: "It's ridiculous, and we just saw the last of these travellers leaving, and there's already a new entrance.
This time, the number has grown, and even the horse has been seen in grassland."
The representative of the Solihull Council said: "We are aware that there is an unacceptable campsite in the nearest country of Streetsbrook, and we are working with the Solihull police, and we are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them to move as soon as possible.
The collection of evidence will be very helpful if as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by calling number 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation for the court if we present the case to them."
The Weekend Festival is also visited by the Minister of Culture, Indrek Island, who is pleased to be able to bring the world's top names to Estonia.
To the question why the Weekend Festival is so important for Estonians, the island responds that it should be asked from all those who enjoy the festival for three days on the full breast.
But he will tell us that the true people in Pärnu have arrived.
"Looking at the level of artists that can be brought to Estonia, then bringing home the absolute top names of this music genre - this often does not happen in our range," says the Minister of Culture.
But what festivals do the artists speak themselves most?
I think I'm a relatively old-fashioned man, and for old-fashioned people like me, I'm sure one of the most experienced artists, Armin van Buuren, who came up last night.
According to his recording, at some point, all of us have twisted their own legs," he says.
But he'll bring out a number of names, such as Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, our Estonian artists too: starting from NO.P. and reading in a whole row.
In fact, the concentration of known names is very high," he says.
Look longer on the Evening Page video!
Audit updates up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in the middle of criticism hit by car manufacturers
The day before the Audi announcement, BMW said that it would offer software supplements to more than 350 000 vehicles.
According to the BMW Chairman, the company believes that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions", referring to European cities, including the BMW home town of Munich, which has considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe will be renewed to reduce diesel engine emissions.
None of the companies described these operations as readmission.
European car manufacturers have encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions.
However, nitric oxide from diesel engines is considered to be carcinogen and may cause asthma.
At the same time, the cost of the equipment to be installed to neutralise the air-resistant emissions of diesel vehicles for automotive companies is increasing, making it difficult to keep the cars price competitive.
While German car manufacturers are undergoing a thorough investigation, Chancellor Angela Merkel's Government is also accused of refusing the powerful car manufacturers and disregarding the problems.
Companies are trying to avoid repeating Volkswagen errors, which quietly dismantled the use of such deceptive devices that allowed the evidence of exhaust gases to be adapted to the regularities during the car testing, but reversed in normal driving conditions.
A number of Volkswagen leaders have been charged in the United States and the others are on both sides of the Atlantic investigation.
Last month, the former head of the thermodynamics department of the Audi engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Former President Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is therefore not protected from the issue and may be brought to trial in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, the audit was drawn to the criminal investigation of Volkswagen in Germany when the authorities accused the installation of the Audit system in order to evade the requirements of European emissions gases by extending the investigation that had previously been focused on the United States.
The involvement of the audit in the investigation may be a major boost to Volkswagen’s luxury car manufacturer generates a disproportionate share of Volkswagen’s profits.
The European Union flags will be purchased for Estonian schools for €20 000.
The Ministry of Education intends to purchase flags of the European Union to Estonian schools by 1 September to mark the presidency.
A total of 105x158 centimeters of the European Union flag will receive 570 educational institutions.
The flags are designed to be exhibited in indoor spaces, they must also be performed in high-quality printing techniques in indoor spaces with tunnel confirmation, via the ERR news portal.
The flagstone label has the following text: "Announcement of the first presidency of the Council of the European Union to Estonian schools.
The estimated cost of 570 flags is EUR 20 000 at the level of the Ministry of Education, i.e. one ticket will cost EUR 35.
The murder of the journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
Riodoce employees are usually gathering on Wednesdays to review the plans for reflecting the most recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa, which are sown by organised crime, corrupt officials and endless drug wars.
But today they have gathered in the shadow of a personal tragedy to discuss their security.
They're told that it's important to change their routines.
Two older writers discuss which seems safer: whether to bring children to the office that was targeted by the granade attack in 2009, or to leave them home.
Security experts have written three words on the front end of the room: "Enemy", "neutral", "Little".
They ask reporters for names in every column to provide evidence, enough impressions and inner emotion.
In the presence of governments or cartels, drug traffickers, politicians, business men and journalists are suspected of a whole list of illicits that make the chaos in Mexico dangerous.
The majority of these journalists, according to journalists, have been reported to have them since President Enrique Pena Nieto's resignation in December 2012, at least 25. 589 journalists have been killed after attacks and threats under national protection, and during this year there have been at least seven journalists in seven states.
The most recent deaths include their editor and source of inspiration, Javier Valdez Cardenas, the contributor of Riodoce.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his many books on drugs.
His absence gives a deep sense, although his presence can be perceived everywhere on the facade of the Riodoce building hangs a great picture of the middle finger showing Valdez with a letter "Justice" and two 30th reporters, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing a T-shirt with his smiled glasses, or a characteristic panama hat for him.
Reporters discuss joint trauma, their nightmares, dreamlessness, paranoia.
Although a separate public prosecution was established in 2010 to deal with journalist cases, only two cases have been brought under judicial responsibility by the Committee on the Defence of Journalists.
Like most of the annual murders related to drug trafficking and organised crime, the number of thousands, journalists rarely come to trial.
Riodoce's editorial continues to reflect violence in Sinaloa, although their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without the data and justice of the murderers, Ibarra says there is no great benefit from the meeting on security.
"It's really silly to waste your time in this meeting," he says.
"So long as the reason is not known, you're distrusting everyone."
Valdez left the Riodoce office in Culiacan in the state capital in the morning of 15 May.
He managed to drive only a few blocks before two men stopped him from the red Toyota Corolla, forced him out of the car and shot him 12 times.
A man with guns drove away in Valdez's car and crashed in the vicinity.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She left a woman and two adult children.
Rumors spread freely in Culiacan.
However, the issue of Valdez is essentially purely the silence.
Since Guzman was arrested last year and given to the United States in January Sinaloa has been one of the most bloody battlefields in the country, since the cliques are rivalizing to fight for the execution of the power wagon.
No matter what a person or a number of people are shot every day on Sinaloa streets, or that the graveyards crawl with abundantly decorated two-fold drug kings of mausoleums, which are larger than many living homes.
For a moment, let us forget that the time of peace refers to the fact that only one cartel leads to the coastal state with valuable ports and drug routes to the United States.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the risks associated with his work, Riodoce, the contributor and the President Ismail Bojorquez (60), feels huge guilt that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes led to the killing.
The first of them was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a cartel competing with Guzman's sons and on the warfare.
This article may have angered the sons by suspected gang members bought all copies of the edition as soon as they arrived in the newspaper sections.
The second mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country for his own security after the capture of another newspaper that reflected the same story.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad and his killing is seen as a turning point of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would be there forever.
In 2003 he worked as a veteran reporter at the Noroeste newspaper when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling 50-dollar units.
Bojorquez said that in Sinaloa, it was impossible to deal with the press without touching the drug problem.
In time, the newspaper increased its bold and honest reflections and sales and advertising.
Reporters liked to publish powerful research without fear of the censorship, and readers in a fascinating print that they could read stories that no one dared to reflect.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, the newspaper won the prize of the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot for his Latin American reflections.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Prize (AKK) to follow the Mexican narcotics story wherever it leads.
He openly admitted he was afraid.
"I want to live further," he said, accepting the AKK prize.
Last October, he told Rompeviento TV that drug trafficking was a lifestyle in Sinaloa.
"You have to take the task that the journalist agency has another chance to play is stupid.
I don't want to be asked what I did in the face of so many deaths or why I didn't tell you what was going on."
The Riodoce collective misses Valdez, a joker who roared like a sailor, a friend who kindly shared sympathies and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They supported his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went from the office to the El Guayabo bar along the way and always sat on the same table.
Now they're asking if his routine love became destiny to him.
His death has also made them doubt as to how to do the best of their work and survive.
"They don't like you hanging around with these women, their children, their legal business, the secret landing sites used to transport drugs."
"These things weren't to be touched," said Bojorquez.
Even in the best times, the result is strong self - control and self - control.
Trusting your instincts.
If it smells suspicious, stay away.
According to Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, the problem is, "the smell can be deceived... and that's what happened to Javier."
He and others say that the old rules in Sinaloa no longer apply, just as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerreros, or in other states, which are home to the toxic association of profitable smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce’s employees were gathered for security training, mobile phones were suddenly no longer allowed; for some days before that, it was revealed that only governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
In front of the house, two police officers in the tree's shadow were looking for relief in 40 degrees of heat.
The government appointed them to guard the Riodoce office located in a four-story building in the Culiacan middle class neighbourhood.
Some reporters wondered whether these cops were among the 50 percent of the police who were unreliable by the governor himself.
Several months have passed since the reporters have traveled to mountainous lands where control is actually held by drug forces.
Riodoce this week's publication discussed three main stories.
One of them was the murder of a brother named Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
In addition, they had a revealing story about spending government money on the governor’s hometown.
And a group of people were kidnapped from one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants in a quarter away from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official announcement about the one who was kidnapped or how it happened, so you had to be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows is a place for drug dealers and authorities.
Reporter learned from the public documents that the restaurant was registered to the name of a politician who belongs to the Institutional Revolution Party (IRP) in power, which dominated all levels of policy almost throughout the previous century.
Recently, several IRP governors have been accused of a broad reflection of corruption in the context of cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about the previous incidents in the same place, including how the name El Chapo's son escaped from the military.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have searched the Valdez column to get information on the kidnapping from the best sources.
"We would have known what happened," said 46-year-old Villarreal, whose dressed body construction has served him with a nickname El Flaco.
"Now all communication channels are broken with our sources."
Valdez's office has become a storage room for tags and stickers protesting the killing of journalists, and the editorial staff have become something they never expected to activists for the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a couple of tags and went to the local prosecutor's office the next morning for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the West of Michoacan State three days after the murder of Valdez.
The burned body has been found, and the officials say it belongs to him based on DNA tests.
Journalists have become more loud across the country and criticise the "SOS Press" phrase as organised protests on walkways and buildings.
On this day, President Bojorquez is in Washington, trying to collect international support for justice in Valdez's case.
The day after Valdez died, meeting the governor Sinaloa, Ramirez accused of sneaking and killing the journalists of the power because of telling the truth.
After that, he asked for it to be transferred from the government to the rest of its activities, worrying that his anger has affected his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that the Mexican journalists were "limited in within".
In his last book "Narko journalism", he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug forces, but also by the command of politicians and security forces organized by crime.
In the last year, more than half of the attacks of journalists were assigned to the police and state officials by Articulo 19.
"In Mexican you will die because you are wanted to be quiet," said Ramirez.
Murders are obviously bloodtight.
No one forgets blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias' death in the North Border State in Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body was found with a letter that probably signed by a cartel in Los Zeta, "I'm here for my reports."
He had a computer keyboard and earphones lying next to his bruised head.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, such as the newspaper El Norte in the North Border State of Chihuahua, following the killing of their correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others go on like El Manana de Nuevo Laredo, following the murder of their President in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez spoke with the headline "What do you want from us?".
Some journalists have escaped from home states or even the country.
It's a neurological decision.
It's hard to find a job in the exile, and they still have to keep observing the streets to avoid dangers.
And sometimes they will be pursued, as probably happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in one of the apartments in Mexico in 2015 three months after being escaped from Veracruz.
Those who remain still and continue to work must dance every day around risky decisions.
Ibarra, who ever wanted to be a poet, admits that the recording of the drug business scares him.
"Mexico's on his way to hell, and that's why I started to be a reporter," he said.
In the middle of a recent Friday night, when the latest number had already been locked, the editors of Riodoce sat on the way to the office and roared a beer when all the phones suddenly vibrated.
In the coastal resort city in Mazatlan, 19 persons were killed in the firings of rival gangs and security forces.
The war continued to escalate, as was promised by several messages from the cartels found in the region.
On the same side of the walk, reporters put news on the Riodoce website using a mobile phone.
The first partner of the next day needed a change.
The sirens blew up another firefight in the area.
Bojorquez went to the guarded police to see if they were alert.
If they were afraid, they wouldn't show it at least.
Under the massive portrait of the fallen founder, where his average finger is visible to all Sinaloa, the workers of Riodoce carried out his tracks.
"How could I even think about closing," said Bojorquez, "when the day Javier was killed, the trainee asked me to send him to the streets to report?"
Dinosaurus used a protective color to avoid the enemies
At first sight, it seems like a figure, although it's pretty scary.
Scientists have now disclosed the first findings regarding the incredible size of the canda miner, which has been so well preserved, that experts have described it as "dinosaur Mona Lisa".
It has been so well preserved that it was even possible to detect that his armored skin was red brown color and his past had been somewhat "complicated".
The report published in Current Biology described the nature as "the most preserved gum dinosaur that has ever been found" and as "one of the best dinosaur entrances in the world".
For fossil, it is a new species of nodosaur, which lived in the middle of the critical age, 110-112 million years ago.
Its incredibly good preservation is open to researchers who describe it as "really significant".
This vegetarian covered with armpits is the best preserved fossil of this type ever found in the National Geographic data.
It was found on 21 March 2011 by Shawn Funk when he extracted Suncor Millenium in the mine of Fort McMurray near North Albertas in Canada.
He hit something that didn't remind me of the surrounding stone, and decided to examine more closely.
The discovered fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrelli Paleonthology Museum.
For the next six years, it was developed to extract the animal from a land of 2500 kilograms (1100 kilograms).
After all this hard work, the final result is now finally ready to make public.
"If you kiss a little eyes, you can almost believe he's sleeping," said the leading author of Caleb Brown, a scientist in the Royal Tyrrelli Museum where the existence is exhibited.
"That goes to the scientific history as one of the most beautiful and most preserved dinosaur entrances - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
In studying his skin, the scientists found that this vegetarian, who is covered with gums and recalls the walking tank, was likely to be at a significant risk of meat-food dinosaurs.
This dinosaur with numerous rings used red and white protective color to hide from the predators, and applied a shadowing technique called suppression, and also used by many present animals.
According to the experts, this enabled dinosaur to be better enclosed and avoid enemies, as the major dinosaurs likely hunted him.
This 110 million - year - old family of nodosaurs first came to the news in May and is now visited in the Royal Tyrrelli Paleontology Museum.
The scientists have now investigated the nature and named Borealopelta markmitchelli, after Mark Mitchell, who was part of a team that spent more than 7000 hours to expose the animal to hard work.
Thanks to the amazing well-preservation of the person, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the animal on the body.
They discovered a suppression - a protective method common in the animal state, which means that the top of the creature was darker than the bottom.
Although the suppression is common, the findings come as a surprise, because Borealopelta is much greater than those living today with suppression.
This suggests that the dinosaur was actively hunted by other muscle-eating dinosaurs, that evolution preferred to survive as an act of contradiction.
However, most of the animals that use contemporary suppression - such as deer, cebras, or armadillis - are much smaller and more vulnerable, suggesting that the nodosaurus had to make real effort to survive.
"The vigorous hunting of dinosaurs with a large and numerous armor shows how dangerous the crises could have been from the dinosaurs," said Brown.
The chemical analysis of the organic compounds of the guts also revealed that the skin of the dinosaur was red brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal to get clues about its life, including the preserved content of this intestine, to find out what the animal ate for its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur died in the river, thus reaching a stream of sea, where he fell to the bottom of the ocean.
At that time Alberta was as warm as now in South Florida, and the rivers and oceans are likely to spread much further to the inland than now.
"This nodosaur is truly significant because it is fully covered with preserved gum skin, while it has also remained three-dimensional, keeping the original shape of the animal," said Brown.
"The result is that the animal today looks almost the same as in the Christian age.
In order to reconstruct it, you don't have to use much imagination - it's just enough to kiss your eyes and it seems like she's sleeping."
The time of the crisp was when huge dinosaurs — teropodes — traveling on two legs on Earth.
Although their king in Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, some of his scary predecessors could hunt it from the abstract dinosaur.
They include the Acrocanthosaurus, the 38 feet (11.5 meters) long and the six tons of a monster.
Scientists whose recent findings have been published in Current Biology believe that Borealopelta was washed in the sea after death and it mumifized in the mud.
On 21 March 2011, Shawn Funk discovered the existence of the Millennium mine in Fort McMurray near North Albertas in Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved pancakes in the world, including skin and skins, and it is a complete conic to hips.
These creatures were an average of 18 feet (five meters) long and weighed up to 3000 pounds (1300 kg).
Two 20-inch valleys came out of its shoulders.
Scientists believe that it was adventured by a vegetarian covered with armor, through the current West Canadah, until the flooded river flooded over its open sea.
However, the underground landing site of the dinosaur helped to preserve its favours with excellent details.
The stoned residues of this particular specimen have been so well preserved that the musculoskeletal skulls of the dinosaur still cover skin residuals.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic: "The degree of preservation is as rare as the lottery winner.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it feels.
The acute skin residuals are still covered by the skull of the animal’s mysterious pants.
The right one lies next to him, and five of the toes are stretched upwards.
I have the opportunity to count the rings on his plate."
How did one activist find the answer to the question "Who streets?"
On August 9, 2014 Brittany Ferrell became a complete shock.
Just a day after traveling to New York, this resident of St. Louis sat in a room rented through Airbnb, blinking on the phone to Facebook.
He got posted on his former schoolmate.
It said, "The police just killed the 18-year-old, and he's still on the street."
He was confused why no one else had posted this information to his stream, so he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
Continuous @TheePharoah user posts were repeatedly distributed on his timeline.
In real time, the rapist from the St. Louis region sent Michael Brown, unarmed for the death of a 18-year-old black man who killed a white cop in Missouri in Ferguson.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying on the street, staying there for four hours.
"It's crazy," said Ferrell himself.
But death was nothing new for him or his community.
He put off his phone, but later night he saw a blink that reported the gathering of people in Canfield Drive this time.
They shared photos of police tapes and screaming people and a man who claimed to be Brown's father and kept a sign in "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
He was looking at a real-time flow where the police officer stood in front of a dead dog in front of a group of protestors.
In the second video, another policeman said he had a gun and screamed, "I'm gonna kill all of you... animals."
Ferrelli remembers how she hit herself from the thought: "It's unusual."
"This isn't the kind of murder we've been used to and what we might call typical."
I felt frightened at that moment.
I was angry and wept."
He booked a flight back and rode home the next day.
When he landed at 23 p.m., he went to see his father for his six-year-old daughter and decided they'd drive the next morning alone to Ferguson.
What happened with Ferrelli and Ferguson in the next three years is the central theme in the new documentary "Whose Streets?" (Who streets?), which will be highlighted in the cinema on 11 August.
This is the story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and strength of people who live in this community and who met the answers demanding streets.
When Ferrell and his daughter, who had a flower dress on his shoulder, went to Ferguson again, they spoke about the experience and conditions of life of the blacks before that morning.
"Do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for his rights?" he recalls asking himself.
"We're driving Ferguson right now because the police killed the 18-year-old boy and it's not right."
"I couldn't take him away," said Ferrell later.
"What's going on is... the culmination of the past.
He needs to know and see and grow in the middle of it.
He must learn about activism and organisation, while also knowing the different layers of black experiences and living conditions, and what we need to do to get free and free.
Even if I succeed in raising him in such a way that he does not personally experience brave racism, he does not differ from another black daughter.
"I feel like I'd make her a bear if I were to protect her from this world."
The first stop they made at Ferguson was on the way to South Florisant - in a place across the police station, where they had become a certain kind of campsite, where the activists were waiting for news about Officer Darren Wilson, who had not finally been charged.
There Ferrell and his daughter joined the local business owner who made lunches.
They put together food bags and helped share them with protestors.
For Ferrelli, a new type of activism slowly began to form.
"My activation changed completely after 9 August," he said, pointing out that when he was a student at Missouri-St. Louis University, he was President of the Less Students' Union and focused on food justice and health inequalities in the black communities.
"I didn't have any organizational experience.
It's all just fading."
Weekly later, Ferrell met with a film director, Sabaah Folian, during the evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and the film operator Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to just document it.
The Ferrelli question came to the mind: "Would you try to document what's going on or find a story that can be used?"
Such skepticism was caused by countless cases where people - often white - come into the community and try to benefit from its pain and endurance.
Folayan explained in the recent interview: "We had heard that the voice of the people who were born and raised in Ferguson was not heard and we wanted to do otherwise."
Folayan had already smashed hands with co-chairman Damon Davis, an artist in the region, known for activism regarding the sentenced prisoners.
His involvement made the project binding for Ferrelli and the other six locals who were tracked by the Whise Streets team for years after Brown was shot.
"No one talks about us or us in this documentary, but we talk ourselves," Davis said.
"For me, it was important how these people were imagined, 'cause that's how they picture me."
Although the aim was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - they wanted to show that the movement was not a "construction guide, but a community meeting", as Folayan said - he became the most open part of the film.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" is surprisingly documenting personal aspects of Ferrelli's life, such as falling in love and marrying her.
"I felt like I was naked," said Ferrell, laughing for the first time when he finished the tape.
"But I realized that this work and the humanization of black people must be accompanied by certain vulnerability."
Moreover, the Ferrelli story stresses and reinstalls the role of a black homosexual woman in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two moves from three beginners who thought in the social media in 2012 after killing the black teen Trayvon Martin thematic references #BlackLivesMatter are homosexual.
"In the current role, black homosexual women have kept movements in general," said Ferrell, "and that is because we must fight on several fronts constantly.
Black, homosexual women must bear all this burden."
Folayan agreed, noting that "the movement is indeed kept alive by black women and many of them are black homosexual women".
At the same time, he claims that "doing not with any type of equal opportunities" - Ferrelli did not choose to be the center of the film because of his identity.
"He was a person from whom he expelled the right energy," he said.
"But it's not a coincidence that he was on the front line because a black homosexual woman living in such nodes is much at stake.
His energy can be perceived through the screen."
At the same time, newscams from Ferguson have long been missing, but racial links between the community and the police are still fragile.
During Ferrelli's demonstration, the conditional sentence for blocking the road will last for another 2.5 years.
He describes the social policy atmosphere in the area he calls home, just "smooth fountain".
Nevertheless, he still considers the mantra to be important from the time he went to Ferguson's streets all three years ago.
"Our duty is to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains."
7 Tips on how to get over the pohmel after Weeken's party
Some mighty men find a party after a snack, that it helps.
Or they're based on the word "except cheeky, stay drunk."
But it's just an inevitable postponement and a decent garment for health.
What can you do to get better in the morning and as painless as possible over the Weeken Trall or other party after today and tomorrow?
Drink water.
Alcohol down and down, after a big party in the morning... or, if possible, instead of alcohol.
Since the body loses a lot of fluids while drinking alcohol, it has to be recovered somehow.
With water, minerals are also dehydrated out of the body and it is good to drink mineral water.
Since the stomach is often irritated after drinking, it is especially good if it is bubble-free or only easily stabbed.
Go for a walk.
Certainly it wouldn't cost you to go to Grandma and break trees - it could be a fateful false decision.
But a light walk helps the body to remember what it's like to be alive again.
Lessing in the tent and falling out of the neck is a more time-consuming way of healing.
Give the body energy back slowly and carefully.
If you're about to throw up last night, I'm sure it's not worth trying to load a big fat steak.
For example, start a fresh juice containing fruit sugars that are quietly marketed in your body.
If the health of the southern places already suffers, you might want to try a wedding, for example.
And a little later on the back.
Avoid coffee.
This diuretic releases your body from the final water.
As has already been said, water and juice are your friends.
Don't bet on the painkillers.
If you're taking a painkiller to prevent the pomell tonight, your liver has to deal with paracetamol or ibuprofen in addition to alcohol and loses performance.
So you're gonna ruin your liver even more, and then there's a lot worse.
In addition, the painkiller won't stay in the body for long anyway.
If you take a painkiller in the morning, don't do it with an empty stomach, it'll irritate your dirty stomach.
Or if you don't have a partner, you'll get along well with yourself.
It works like walking, but walking can't get an orgasm.
Avoid too active tempo and mad positions during the posing, physical effort should be moderate.
You gotta be kidding me.
Time with friends and associates a foolish story, make simple fools and laugh friendlyly about yourself and others (experiences).
A joke and a laugh may not make a mess, but I'm sure it's more fun to bear the aftermaths with them.
One time, the twist goes over anyway!
Professor Northwestern and Oxford University staff are being searched for suspected murder.
According to the police, the professor of Northwestern University and the employee of Oxford University are being searched nationally for suspects after finding a dead body of men with fatal stabbing wounds in one of the Chicago luxury apartments.
According to the Cook County Court Documents, on Monday, no bail-out arrest orders were issued for the arrest of 42-year-old Wyndham Lathem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren in the murder of the first grade due to their alleged coincidence with the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to the documents, 26 years old Cornell-Duranleau died after repeated stabbing.
According to a warning issued by the Chicago Police Department to the community, the body was discovered on 27 July.
The police received a phone call and found a victim on the body of multiple stab wounds when they arrived at the Grand Plaza Corteror.
According to the officials, the Cornell-Duranleau event was declared dead and the investigators are concerned about stabbing as murder, while the police are actively looking for two suspects.
Lathem has been a co-professor for microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
In an e-mail declaration sent by Vice-President Alan K. Cubbage of the University of Public Relations, Lathem has now been temporarily withdrawn and is prohibited from entering the city centres of the University of Northwestern.
"It is now the criminal investigation of the competent authorities and the Northwestern University is working with the investigators," said Cubbage.
Warren is a senior associate in the financial department at the University of Oxford.
In an e-mail declaration from the University and the University of Somerville, the representative said: "We've been in contact with the British police and are ready to assist the U.S. investigators in any way possible."
In addition, the statement stated that Mr Warren's colleagues were shocked and wished to present themselves.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of the Chicago Police Department's Communications Department, urges suspects to give themselves up to the authorities.
"The police have a clue where they are, but we are working more and more closely on defining the exact location," said Guglielm.
According to Guglielm, suspects will be assisted by both local, regional and national authorities.
Guglielmi said that the police received a phone call from the Grand Plaza Corporator who had just received a cryptical clue that there was something going on in the apartment 1008.
According to the police, it was a spectacular vision.
According to Guglielm, it is not clear whether the event itself took place on 27 July.
He said the security cameras confirm the presence of Lathem and Warren in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," added Guglielm.
The Grand Plaza Bureau sent a letter to the inhabitants: "The police are currently working to determine the background of the events and the victim and examines the various motives, including the possibility that it was a family type."
Individuals that help your company to avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of workers in his e-commerce start-up company, but the surveys were profitless.
The answers were often insecure, useless or, even worse, misleading.
And even if he promised to ensure anonymity, some employees did not trust this process.
"This system was simply not consistent and objective," said Errett, who runs an e-commerce company that sells hair care products with 75 employees in San Francisco.
So he called for help from outside people.
There are start-ups with new types of human resources that help companies to find out what their employees know.
In developing and licensing software, which is designed to measure the employee's involvement, they allow companies to conduct sudden interviews, target specific teams and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and a hot line of complaints and, in some cases, allow linguistics to go past C-level leaders and contact directly to the board.
"Now there are tools such as Strava and Fitbit for health monitoring, but where is Fitbit for your company?" asked Jim Barnett, the co-chairman and CEO of Redwood City, Glint, whose software analytical tools are used by companies to measure the employee involvement.
According to Errett, he has received a much better overview of what his employees think and know in three years of use of Glint.
In addition to sudden investigations and specific team surveys, it provides a company's heating card, which provides an overview of which departments have the highest number of complaints and which leaders have the lowest support, allowing them to explain the reasons.
Companies have begun to understand that they must remain aware of their work culture in order not to become the next Uber, which has been revolted into scandals since the former employee published a blog post, which described the abusive environment in which those who dared to speak were punished.
For start-ups such as Glint, the desire to have an overview is a profitable business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance area can be worth more than $ 118.7 billion, according to the Let's Talk Payments website in 2020.
Convercent, a start-up company in Denver, Colorado, which helps companies to prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour, observed interest and increased activity in Uber's suspicious reputation this year.
Convercent has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered himself as a client.
Like Glintki, Convercent allows companies to send customised pulse visits, collect real-time confidential answers and look at the heat maps from problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous communications line that enables employees to report inappropriate behaviour.
And in the case of the CEO, the complaints go directly to the board.
"The public opinion has been announced by the regulatory authorities," said Convercent founder and CEO Patrick Quinlan.
Quinlan said that, if it is found that the company treats its employees poorly or acts in an ethical way, the company may face serious consequences, such as consumer bocotics, workers' departures and cases, even if the regulatory authorities do not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with over 25 000 employees at 500 sites has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that workers are aware of the rules and operations and to offer an easy way to communicate with the headquarters.
If the employee wanted to report the problem earlier, he had to find the head office phone or e-mail address of the corporation, make an official complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
This was often an uncomfortable and uncomfortable process, said General Counselor James Vitrano, who said that there was no good way to monitor workers’ complaints.
However, now that the company uses Convercent, there are problems such as discrimination, harassment or dishonest wage practices that have not previously reached leaders who acted in offices in other cities or states, to quickly identify and deal with them.
"I can get closer to the holistic experience of workers in 360 degrees," said Vitrano, who runs Ruby's risk management group Tuesday.
"And we're protecting our counterparts against trial with employees."
Quinlan said that companies started to take ethical behaviour, values and employee involvement much more seriously in 2002, i.e. after the audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed in connection with the Enron scandal due to ethical violations.
But only when "social media became mature", the companies realized that they could not prevent their black laundry from being cleaned publicly on the web.
"Before using technology to monitor ethical behaviour, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, taking a periodic fee from companies for their use of their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity to approve venture capital investors who have been supporting both start-up companies.
Convercenti financed 10 million dollars in February by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the capital collected to a value of 47 million dollars.
In November, Glint invested $10 million in Bessemer Venture Partners, increasing the corporate total funding to $60 million.
Such investments will not be a surprise to take into account the interconnection between enterprises, culture and venture capital.
More and more studies show that modern workers expect more from their workplace than before.
Competitive markets, such as Silicon Valley, have high wages and interesting projects merely on board contributions.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they devote their time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy in the company, they feel that they are listened to and that the work they do is satisfying, they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, who is Vice-President of the General Benefit and Worker Experience Department in LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors earn income when companies belonging to their portfolio are doing well; companies are doing well when employees are committed and involved.
If third-party analytical tools allow to increase the commitment and inclusion of workers, it is no wonder they will find support.
The knowledge of employee involvement is important, according to the experts in the work culture.
However, these data are useless if the company's supervisors fail to deal with them.
In fact, if the company asks for feedback from its employees, it may create expectations that changes are expected.
And if changes do not take place fast enough or not at all, it can cause disappointment and reduce employee involvement.
"When you ask 4000 proposals, you must be ready for 4000 discussions," said President Russell Raath of the consultancy and business management company, who has seen how companies make a mistake by relying on too much data collection.
"Because if things don't end, the workers will think, "Do you really take me to hear?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care?" "
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly studies among employees, has been able to implement measures on the same day as the problem has been reported through Glint.
And after receiving feedback from disappointed workers at the speed of decision-making and communication quality, he was able to reorganise several teams in the company and offer communication training to deal with problems.
On Tuesday, however, new data on workers are collected and hoped that in the long term this will lead to the long-term commitment of workers in the industry, which is known for the flow of their large labour force.
"If you are not committed to ensuring transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you lose clients.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies."
The bright star in the euro area is Baltic: incomes are growing rapidly
Although the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic, the three Baltic countries are rapidly approaching the income of the rich countries of Western Europe, Bloomberg writes a reference to the report of the European Central Bank.
According to the ECB since 1999, total economic production per person has exceeded expectations in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
Low debt burden, rapidly improving institutions and business and free market-friendly policies.
"Baltic countries in one of Slovakia are few euro area countries where real GDP per person from the purchasing force has a significant approximation to the EU average", the Central Bank announced.
Although the objective is to ensure that the total economic output per person is equal to the richer Western Europe, in 2015 the total production of the Baltic economy per person was only 2/3 of the average of 15 countries, which belonged to the European Union before the enlargement cycle in 2004.
Low wages have led the Baltics to find a better wage abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltics in positive light and the economy is growing today, local residents are not enthusiastic.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of the Latvian and Lithuanian population assessed that their economies were doing very well or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, it was a little less than half of the people questioned about their economies.
NCAA's decision to cancel twice daily exercises will make Bruins' days long
It's almost 23:00 when a trophy of UCLA footballers stops talking to the team in the campus of the university in the edge of a new field of training.
Some of them have taken a shirt off their backs by exposing the efforts of their first day of training.
For a large part of the team, these power emitters offer a midday break.
During the summer courses, players will be headed back to the campus after three hours of training before they return to Wasserman's football center next morning at 6.30 a.m.
"The next three days are a real trial for them," said Bruins Coach Jim Mora a little before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA's decision to cancel the players' loads twice a day, has actually changed their days longer - at least until the end examinations have reached one half on Friday.
For this reason, the UCLA had the first three trainings scheduled to start at 19.15 to fit into the players’ schedule.
The shift from two training days will mean more days with one exercise - the beginning of Bruins training course was raised over the last season almost a week in advance and for the first time in the course of the summer courses of Mora six Westwood seasons.
They have 18 training schedules until 20 August before the official preparation for the opening game in September against Texas A&M.
According to Mora, he is in favour of NCAA's change in the rules, although it adds another item on the players' close schedules.
"They have a huge burden on three or four days and this is a serious challenge," said Mora.
"And they break themselves through this trial; they stretch, they are nice young.
I believe that when Saturday comes and we have more time, it's really nice."
When the camp is finished, UCLA's training will be closed, which is not a simple task, given a clear view of their parking site nearby and the Luskin center, a higher-class hotel that has already been hit by footballs that have escaped from the portal protection network.
From this weekend, the players in the hotel Bruins, but Mora acknowledged that there might be problems with free rooms during the season.
"We're working on security," said Mora.
"It's a real concern, and it's not overreacted to think that people can rent a room and film training from there.
If you have a recording of training, you can make a pretty good deal with it.
But we're using security in there and on the 8th parking lot.
Let's do the best we can by using the existing one.
I'm trying not to worry about it.
We have a plan."
For the revenge of the Electoral Union of Savisaare-Ivanova, the Electoral Union of Savisaare-Ivanova, Kristiina Ojuland and EKRE, who has been forced to leave the Electoral Party to join the Electoral Union of Our Tallinn and Party, Tegus Tallinn, seems that the electoral unions set up in the Party's policy are at least as involved in the local elections this year as political parties.
However, chicks are considered to be in the fall, and the key issue is whether they all have enough disappointed voters.
Who's staying with Savisaar?
If the Edgar Savisaare support group has fallen to a small extent, it may be unfamiliar to the events organised for his electoral union.
One member of the Riigikogu, some former and current environmental and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the electoral union?
And is it possible for some loyal constituents and friends of the Savi islands to dismiss the application in Tallinn to look for the fact that the list of deputies "Savisaare", which are suspected in corruption and corruption crimes, is becoming reality?
The video film filmed on the roof of the city department on the Russian pop song, in which the older part of Lasnamäe participates; and, in any sense, the original computer game in which the main character of the Prime Minister Jüri Ratas must avoid the drifts and squirrels of the road - is this the first time the Environment tries the votes of 16 and 17-year-old electorals to be allowed to the electorate?
We will look forward to the idea of the other political parties from the juvenile election campaign.
If you see a black square from the beginning of August to the Channel 2 or TV3 viewer, you will have two choices: agree that only ETV, ETV2, ETV+, Tallinn TV and English France24 channels will be seen in the free leisure, or a decade of each month will be given to some television operator.
There are probably also those who start to rejoice publicly on advertising-free television experience, but at the end of the day - although opposedly - pay for television and advertising.
The music, the noisy people and the garbage left on the streets is an unpleasant side of every major music festival.
If you don't want to get a share of noise at home, however, instead of having a headache, it's worth finding homelands - and leaving a place to sleep for a stubborn amount to the festival visitors.
Washington will change the green card rules.
The media publications quote President Donald Trumpi, who says there's a new U.S. immigration plan that changes the green card rules.
The plan provides for a reduction of the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 people per year, stricter rules for the acquisition of temporary working methods and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans and the President supports them.
The bill goes to discuss in the two Chambers of Congress.
"This law reduces poverty, raises wages and saves billions of dollars of taxpayers' money, as it changes the way it delivers green cards to other US nationals.
The law reduces chain migration and will replace the current programme.
The new application process benefits candidates who speak English and have financial resources for their own support and skills that will benefit our economy," said Trump, according to the US media publications.
Siberia's seto young people move into town, pensioners return to the country.
The Jevseyev Anatoli continues the tradition of the former famous seto gold miners in the river of Maana.
He works 140 kilometers from home as a gold artelli driver on the side of the Earth’s additionaljoe Kuvai.
It's a hard job: two months in a row without a rest day and then only ten days at home and back.
For three years in Artelli, Anatol has only seen gold once.
"There's a hard time: in the way you go, you will be thoroughly checked that you don't bring vodka, and when you go out that you don't bring gold," says Anatoli.
Mare Piho is talking to the village of Haida with the local seto Jaan, who has told him a lot about the memories of his family in Siberia.
Siberia setoes still preserved archaeological culture will also affect home-cetoes, because it is just so amazing, thinks the most thoroughly remote setoes researched by Piho Mare.
His first study trip to Siberia lasts 30 years this year.
During that time, he's been there 14 times and lived there together for a year.
How many sets did Siberia still travel out at the end of the 19th century and early 20th century to get the land here?
That's an unsolved question.
I'm saying 8,000.
I figured it out by Siberia's seto men who have thought about it myself.
It's exactly hard to say, because there may have been up to 30 people in one group at the time, but the passport was only given to the man.
The passport was only given to one, but there were children with him, sisters and other female relatives.
Look how big this area was here!
It was several times bigger than historic Setoma.
It was needed to be educated, managed in some way.
Setod came here as farmers, but their lives changed, because here they came to areas not only related to agriculture but also to the river (browning), gold mines, industry.
For example, in New Peters, many sethos later went to work in a classified city in Krasnojarsk-45 (then the Soviet power built the uranium wealth industry - J. P.) when it was formed.
Did the seths make up most of the population in this region?
Yeah, they lived compactly.
In addition, the tradition of getting married lasted a long time, and the plurality.
Seven or eight children in the family were common.
How much did Siberia’s seth culture differ and differ from the seths of the motherland?
They're different, although what was brought here was the same.
They brought a lot of public clothes.
Then they also made themselves (squares), but they always made the difference that was brought along and what was made here.
Climate change had a strong impact on the traditional dressing of cetoes, because it's colder here.
Food changes.
For example, in Setomaal the meat was salted, but it was just soaked.
Where are the villages of Siberi setode and what life is living there? / graphics: Alari Paluots
The relationship with the motherland was spiritually strong; it was considered very important.
It seems to me that now this Setumaa is going to give back to it, it's going to affect them.
Those girls who have lived here in families have listened to amazing stories.
The Piho refers to the people of the Estonian Seto delegation who came to Haida at the beginning of July to the day of the Kingdom of Seto and lived at home for four days - J. P.
What's left here is amazing.
"It's very easy to come and go, because the city has a great place: in the rail node and the road crossing point," says Reigo Tamm, from Tapa.
The city is no longer just military leader, we have lots of nature, sports and culture, and we get pizza on every corner.
Kill is the top city!
There is a small island along the White River that runs through the city, where the killers practice jani parties.
"This beautiful place doesn't appear in the train window," reels Reigo.
Whoever is not afraid of cold water can swim in the river because the river is full of sources.
I've been swimming there, it's gonna be all right!
You can keep a picnic on the river and simply make romance - you can face the flow of the river and think about life ahead and back.
I've been out there walking with my bridesmaids.
After all, Ooperisolist Tamm has been on the riverside between the three bridges to practice his arches: "When this place is at the side of the city, no one may come up against it if he joins his own stories."
"The countryside opens a wonderful view for Tapa, but there are also health tracks where you can run, winter skiing, and now, for example, discgolf play - golf course has been made, disks can be borrowed from the sports centre," Reigo leads.
Of course, the old pros go there with their disks, but I haven't gotten to play there yet.
You must probably invite my colleague, Rasmus Kull Tapa to visit because he's an experienced discolfi player and has discs.
He's gonna borrow me!
Reigo and Männikmägi were inseparable for the present period of childhood of operasolists.
At least during ski lessons.
There are many tears and disappointments left on this mountain, and you will win in my sports life.
Not to mention broken skates and skis.
"The whole middle city is now full of construction work, everything changes to unknown," praises Reigo.
Kill an old and tired vacant building, however, is a very attractive place to play in the summer responses.
I am pleased that in 2012, the leader of R.A.A.M. Mart Meos accepted my idea and came to make a vacant theater with my theater.
Although this year's theatre season with Aleksei Karenin just ended, on 11 August, the railway station has "Elluarning" when the old vacancies are moving around in the 1980s.
"To August 11, the days of the town of Tapa, where the vacant building has been awakened by open houses and there are a series of cultural events, including a public competition," Reigo, who recommends visiting the city of 91 years in those days.
In a small yellow house on the wooden road of 1 May, there is a museum since 1994.
"The house is small, but there is a great deal of information and information," praises Reigo, a place full of Kill City's history, most of which focuses on rail and warfare.
Reigo tells us that if Kill walks through all the recommended places, the belly will be long gone empty, but fortunately, the small town is full of cafes.
"We have so good dining places, and when we sit in cafes sometimes feel you're abroad," he describes.
The trained and young soldiers who have come to Tapa spend a lot of time in pubs and places, because when they sit there, it is a strange feeling that you are in Estonia and in your hometown, but in the circle, such an international company is together.
I think it would be very exciting to listen to stories from French or Americans.
Warriors, yes, we're moving a lot!
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal tent in Greece
The TV channel quoted the Foreign Ministry who reported that two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal tent in Greece.
In the morning of August 1, the police arrested a group of illegally telged people on the Sithonia Peninsula, including two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, but this is the investigation.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the TV that the Bulgarians were released later.
The Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free tent and are already setting hard fines for all who are missing the rest of the place that is not intended for that purpose.
The checks will continue throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may impose fines.
The puppies teach the wolves go to break the sheep.
The Hiiumaa farmers have to return to the wolves from their flock after a year's break - probably the wolves that taught the puppies have already broken a number of sheep.
This year wolves in the region of Hiiu have broken sheep three times, a total of 23 sheep and injured eight, written by Hiiu Leht.
The number was only three, a year earlier, 124.
There are also data from the Environment Agency with breaking syncs that the Hiiumal wolf house was not born and the information from the Hiiumaa Hunting Council that this year two wolves were fixed on the island.
By Monday night, wolves broke the land of Emmas in the village of Kabuna and injured 18 survivors of sheep.
On Wednesday early morning, wolves broke a sheep in the flock of the village of Reheselah and severely injured another person who had to be killed.
The rules on the treatment of genetically modified crops must be clear.
The Ministry of Agriculture sent a draft law on the release of genetically modified organisms into the environment (GMOVS) and amending plant protection legislation to the coordination circle.
The amendment of the law shall refrain from the creation of a separate data collection for both genetically modified crops (GM) and operators, which will continue to be used in the plant health register.
In addition, the obligation of a GM crop operator to have a prior agreement with a person engaged in honey in the specified radius is amended.
Although at the moment genetically modified crops are not grown in Estonia, we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of genetically modified and unmodified crops.
At least until it has been decided to declare Estonian GMO free," said Sigmar Suu, head of the Department of Plant Health of the Ministry of Life.
"It must also be taken into account that the measures developed must be targeted and proportionate, taking into account both the costs and administrative burdens associated with the private and public sectors," added Suu.
The draft law repeals the provisions relating to GMO and the data collection of GM crops and to the processing and training of operators in the GMOVS, lays down requirements for the treatment of GM crops and for the start of economic activities.
With regard to beekeeping, the obligation of the GM grower to inform beekeepers of the start of GM crops is replaced by the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with a beekeeper prior to the start of farming.
The draft law has been sent to the ministries for coordination.
All interested parties will have the opportunity to access this in the information system of drafts and, if you wish, to present their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Life.
The proposed changes affect in particular persons, bees and the Agriculture Agency in the field of plant farming.
In the European Union, including Estonia, only one GM crop - maize MON 810 is allowed.
However, so far, no Estonian farmers have been interested in the cultivation of GM crops.
The reasons for the facts are that there is no maize damage in Estonia, a European sleeve density for which MON 810 is resistant.
The varieties of this corn line have also been developed for the southern regions, and this may is not suitable for our climate conditions.
In 2015 and 2016, the Ministry of Agriculture has ordered studies to detect potential GM pollutants in the seeds of various varieties of summer rape, maize and soybean grown in Estonia.
The results of the analysis of the samples taken showed that the seeds did not contain the alien genes and that the study concluded that the seeds of rape, maize and soya varieties in Estonia do not contain genetically modified organisms.
In turn, it can be concluded that in Estonia, genetically modified crops are not consciously grown and that there was also evidence that there was no accidental contamination.
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United recruited Nemanja Maticu as a "genius"
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has recruited Nemanja Maticu as a "genius" after the middle player against Sampdor on Wednesday night made his debut.
For 40 million pounds over Chelsea, the player started in the last seasonal game of United in Dublin before Uefa Super Cupi Real Madrid on Tuesday 2-1 wins in the primary line, impressing on the defence force, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go on attacks.
But after staying away from Blues' seasonal Asian windfall, Maticul was desperately in need of a match form, and he only endured 45 minutes, according to Mourinho, to improve it firmly before Premier League season began.
"He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, brilliant thinking - he has a football mood," said Mourinho.
"We'll help him reach the form as soon as possible."
As in Matic, other newly recruited Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku began on the Aviva Stadium, and Mourinho began to set up one of his first men at the beginning of the season.
The Independent published this week that Mourinho still wants to recruit three football players, but he confirmed that the club has already done the "great work" with three of his four priority choices.
"I'm grateful to the club that they were able to realise three of the four," he added.
"I'm even happier if they can make four out of four, but they've worked hard for me."
Another sooker son came to the foot of the GSM sender on August 1, and then Muhus.
According to Mati Martinson, a bird viewer living in the ring, the first cucumber son was found in Sorves equipped with the escort, and this neighbourhood is already flying around, leaving the base and joining a large group of nights spent in Mullutu-Suurlah.
This is because the Sword is not a fertility field, the Sound of the Islands writes.
On that Tuesday, it was relatively late to ring the throats, and one more cunning son on the island of Muhu came to the escort.
According to Martinson, the installation of escorts is in fact an international project carried by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
I was equipped with a cucumber son named Mati GSM sender at Sõrves Torju.
"The works of her are all watching online: how she went to Spain more winter, coming back a while at the borders of Germany and Poland, and then came to Saaremaa," said Martinson.
The British inventor let him put a microchip in his body to get into the house and the car with a handcuff.
The British inventor became the first person in the country to which a microchip was installed so that he could only open his front, get to the office and even start the car.
A 33-year-old Steven Northam lets you install a small chip between your thumb and your nominal finger, and now it offers this service through its company BioTeq to businesses and individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology.
He has combined the forces with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant anaesthesiaologist in Hampshire County, Winchester, Hants, in order to ensure that the installation procedure complies with the medical standards.
The technology is similar to that of the microchip to be installed on cats and dogs, and it takes only 30 seconds for the procedure.
The Northam company also replaces the locks of houses and cars to match the chip, asking for 300 pounds for one lock.
This married one child's father has installed technology for now both home and car BMW Z4, which starts when his hand is on the wheel.
The White House Exponent went to pay taxpayers thousands.
According to the military documents published in TIME, the White House decided to fly the Navy helicopter last month to the South Oak taxpayers for an event that celebrated American production.
The green and white colour of Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One at the time of the President's board, was the central draw number of the event that introduced the American construction programs in the White House on 17 July.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and the High officials of the White House, in their turn, reformed industrial products from all 50 states.
The helicopter built in Connecticut was exhibited together with a hunt from Maine, a fire extinguishing car from Wisconsin and a fork designed in Mississippi.
According to the documents of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) responsible for the operation of the helicopter, the White House's military cabinet required the helicopter's presence of the helicopter's command, or FARGO, only 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the southern yard for the "unusual" event.
"I wanted you to be aware of this because this is an unusually significant event," said HMX-1 commander the day before the event to e-mail to his commander, the deputy officer of the Navy.
The message indicated that the helicopter arrives at the southern courtyard on July 17th, at 7:00 a.m. and stays there until the yard is cleaned between 18:00 and 21.
The fact was added that if leaving the White House should be stayed, a second ekipage is needed for re-entry due to the limitations of working time.
The initial flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, and the security team of the escalator stayed close to the aircraft for the whole time on the ground.
From the documents given to TIME magazine, it was not possible to read if the second ekipage finally needed or not.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using government assets for political purposes.
The documents indicate that HMX-1 examined whether this event could be infringed.
"We asked if it violated Hatch's law, and they told us not to violate," wrote the commander.
"It turns out you have no choice," responded the deputy officer of the leading officer.
The White House declared the event "made in America" as an official event, and the Hatch law wouldn't cover it.
But even official events have political subtones.
The President supported the efforts of the health reform during the senate debate at that time and praised the efforts to keep government regulations under control.
The name Marine One or Air Force One known as the use of an aircraft for politically profitable purposes is not a new phenomenon.
The presidents must use them to travel.
However, the requirement to use them purely for a photo session is unusual.
Trump was caught in February when his first campaign event in Melbourne was rolling behind the President's plane in Melbourne, and his Twitter account is clinging to messages that complain about the way his predecessor used the President's plane.
"The White House is very pleased with the presentation "in America", where the products were represented from all 50 states that have been manufactured by American workers from American materials," said Lindsay Walters, the White House press representative.
HMX-1 teams often make experimental flights around Washington and on the south yard to train the American President's White House with a centimetre precision.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 arranged 58 attempts in the White House.
According to the official, the flight to the event was considered as a standard for that month's study flights from the "American" flight crew.
The Escader helicopters flew that day for another 11 hours for "non-presidency support missions".
According to the White House, no other exponent in this event burdened the taxpayer's wallet.
According to the representative Sikorsky, the company in the southern yard was not related to the organisation of the exhibition.
HMX-1 does not preserve the budget documents of the President's flights and the exact costs of the event are difficult to determine.
However, according to the Finnish Ministry of Defence for the financial year 2017, the VH-3D compensation rate is EUR 24 380 per flight hour.
The records of the Escader indicated 30 minutes of the flight from the main base of the Navy Quantico airport in both directions from Virginia.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using the helicopter is much less than that.
"The calculation of the costs of payers based on estimated compensation rates is very misleading," said Walters.
"These estimated reimbursement rates include staff, maintenance and many other irreversible costs taken into account for annual appropriations."
According to the RAND Survey of 2015, the compensation rates of the Ministry of Defence do not include staff costs, but they cover the costs of fuel, maintenance and contracts.
The former press representative of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of a helicopter at the time of the event.
"The idea is to show this week things made in America," said Spicer.
"And I know that the state of Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of their contribution to our national security and that there are supposed to be hundreds of people, not even thousands, whose work depends on it.
And I believe, just like most Americans, we're all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have been working on.
So, of course, it is right to highlight it."
It's not clear if Trump touched a helicopter or not in the southern yard during the event, but he did sit behind the fire truck's steering wheel.
In the White House, Trump Sikorsky turned to representatives, throwing a joke on media publications about company products in his personal aircraft park.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of their products."
Grit Shadeiko - through tears arrived peace and joy
In Daegu, 2011, Shadeiko was hit in the last area, 800 m running a foot cramp, and the stadium was taken away with the canderam.
Right before that, he had received zero in a distance jump in the universe in China.
In 2012, the Helsinki EM was damaged by the low-cost injury, but at the debutolympic in London, it received a point 23 of 6013.
However, the misfortune continued.
After the opening day of the 2013 Moscow MM, the Estonian records were inflicted at the distance of the Estonian record.
Two years later, he received the 15th place at the Beijing MM, and he fulfilled the Olympic norm, but it was more than what a sportsman wanted to be disappointed.
Shadeiko’s hardest catalogue only passed into the soil unless the result of the distance jump in Amsterdam's EM was obtained at the beginning.
I'd just like to put together a decent multi-competition once.
One time, Shadeiko confessed.
Even worse was ahead: a month later, his Olympic competition in Rio was abolished by the first barrier due to a thundering.
It's time to take it off, whether we're going to go on with seven competitions at all?
Are two days' effort worth all of this?
She thought long, but found peace.
I just got my head cleaned up.
This experience is relatively difficult to describe, but I've been thinking that last season and the Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Fortunately, there was time to cure and think about it.
"I knew I wouldn't put a pill in the bag yet," says Shadeiko about his self-cleaning.
I've been able to turn the clean sheet and move on with a new moment.
According to Coach Anne Mägi, it was very difficult to look at the cared suffering, but he realized that the athlete had to find out first and foremost.
He was so buried on all sides.
It was hard to endure.
"Grit, however, said that he wouldn't give up and he wants to prove to himself what he's worth," says Mägi.
Now there's some kind of peace in him.
He'll do it for his own pleasure.
The competition came back in May when Shadeiko set up 6280 points of the new Estonian record at Götzis' multiverse.
At a high-level competition, he improved the personal peak drop of bullets with a metre (13.89) and runs the barriers to record close time.
Then the multi-competitor felt that it was not the ceiling of power, but that it was erased only the primary sight of competition.
The Mägi, who instructed him for years, says that Shadeiko is a pattern student.
He's an athlete, he's a good trainer.
If something's in trouble or wrong, he'll say it right away.
He knows his own body and trusts his knowledge.
That's what we need to do.
I can't tell you exactly what to do and we'll follow it.
Shadeiko has also found a new approach.
"I'm not the one who's making the maximum in practice," he says and he says that the most important thing is getting the right feeling is because it also provides a good result.

Good emotions have also been offered to Shadeko the happiness of loved ones.
Her former coach Maris Mägi and sister Grete recently became parents, and a multi-competitor has received support from the new world citizens.
"It's been interesting," says Shadeiko.
One alcohol that drinks equal to "training" of the brain.
Livestrong writes that Dr. Gordon Sheperd is such a big wine fan that believes that wine can train the brain better than any other thing in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
His words are not about alcohol, nor about how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but about the "very active" taste process of wine.
By sniffing the glass, sniffing the wine in the mouth, enjoying it and feeling after taste, we'll make our brain work to create a taste for wine.
Sheperd said that wine molecules do not actually contain taste, but they produce taste from the way wine stimulates the brain.
He's going to compare the way the brain sees the colors.
"There's no taste in wine, the taste creates the taste of wine," says Sheperd.
Things that still affect the formation of wine, such as our age, sex, and even the amount of spices that a person produces.
Sheperd, of course, exclaims that wine is not to be drunk.
"There must be more in practice," he says.
If you get too big, the system's overwhelming.
Excessive drinking can cause harm to the brain instead of benefiting - according to the 2004 study, people who drink more than three glasses of wine, memory loss, loss of balance and reduced mental capacity are at risk.
10% of employees in the Estonian ICT sector will receive less salary from colleagues
Data in Fontes reveal that 10% of employees in the Estonian ICT sector receive less salary from colleagues.
The ten percent pay gap is between men and women, writes the portal in Genesis.
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in the Font ICT sector's wage survey.
In total, there were under 8 577 posts.
63% of the posts worked by men.
"Although only 3 companies stated that the difference in salary is for men and the rest of the companies feel that there is no difference in wages, then, in reality, the basic wage of the month of men is on average 10% higher than women's average and the total wage of men's year is 8% higher than women's," said the Fontese analyst, Ilmar Northla.
"Narcose" 3rd Semester Advertisement Clip: Now that Pablo Escobar has gone, the Netflix hit series enters the center of Cali cartel
Despite the fact that the second season of "Narcose" was exposed to Pablo Escobar's killer, Netflix's serial is far from over.
The third and fourth season has been confirmed by the transmission service, and the first of them has already been prepared by a commercial clip, which stretches the series with new illusions.
In the third season, the DEA will pay its attention to the most rich drug business organization in the world - Cali cartel.
They operate under the leadership of four powerful godfathers "like Fortune 500 companies", simply with more bribes to the government and more violent acts.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the cartel leader, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis), Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann), and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York.
Pedro Pascali is returning to Javier Penana as a character recruiting the American and Colombia law enforcement aid in the war against drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of "Narcos" will be open on September 1.
According to the United Nations, it depends on the role of women in politics in Afghanistan.
On Wednesday, the Head of the UN Afghanistan mission said that the elections can only represent the people if all members of society, including women, play a role in them.
Nicholas Haysom, Head of UN Assistance Mission, said that hundreds of women are applying for local council elections, three women are applying for Vice-President and more than 30 percent of recently registered electorates are women.
"Women's role cannot be exaggerated by stressing the importance of the women," he said in the statement made on Wednesday.
Elections can truly represent and be credible only if women participate fully and are involved in all stages of the electoral process.
The elections and presidential elections of the local councils of Afghanistan will take place on 5 April.
On its part, the Taliban has threatened the electoral process, which coincides with the transitional period when the role of international military operations becomes advisable.
This year's elections will celebrate the first time in which the power will be given peacefully from one democratically elected government to the next.
According to Haysom, women's strong role will increase the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the independent electoral committee of Afghanistan, 1.2 million women have been registered from 3.6 million electorates.
The joy of sharing makes everything more intense in the great and small.
There is always too little time in the common world, but the workout with the spuns gives a good opportunity to combine together, game, proximity and burden.
And what a convenient solution - wherever you cruise in the summer, living garbagemen will always come with you and remind you of your penis voice, "Let's go to practice!"
Start with warming-- it's a very good game of dick, or running along the beach strip.
The doll is the basement of standing in the form of legs and tuhara - who would then like to shape a sand cake that was floated from the waves during the summer?
Wonderful is to use children instead of a cane!
Firstly, it is safe and comfortable, the difficulty is gradually growing at the same pace as the trainer's power.
The advanced ones can also make a bucket with pretty big children.
The child trains balance, reads repeats and feels like fun from the opportunity to get high and be important.
At the same time, larger children can make their own spices.
The scope of movement is set by touching the earth and stretching the hands.
Keep your fingers straight, ask the miniabilities to hold on properly.
The child can read repeats and feel like a coach.
Plank is very useful, but hopelessly boring practice for the child.
But it's easy to make it more fun!
Game Plan: Take a long plan colon, from which to run through.
Actually, it's harder than usual, but it's much more fun to do when you give a friend a hand.
To add the load, you can stay in the plank, on a tiny turd, and walk around in this position.
To be extra trouble, a small child can sit on the hips, but this exercise offers fun for all children.
While crabs slice on sand, they get trims, abdominals, and muscles of the abdominals, like a crab.
The child falls on his feet so that his body weight is distributed equally in front and behind.
To be safe, you can hold your hands.
Kneel your feet and stretch right up.
Flying can fly, have fun, train balance and be difficult.
A little coach's life is extra fun when he gets a little kiss on every coming up.
Additional load is provided by stretching the legs.
Make sure the back is in a neutral position.
Children themselves have much more fun to do with their stomach muscles in pairs and plaques.
Handicraft and pulse.
Watch the child's safety, knee position, and keep the back in a neutral position.
All the children's favorite and great fun!
For the parent, at the same time, the whole body of practice is truly effective.
The sport tools were Ott (10), Säde (8), Lucky (4).
From the philippines to the heart of the moefans of the wide world or Oil Home
Sacks of shoulders are a summer class, which has become a separate product in recent years, which must hang onto one right summermate and which traders have been able to weld an additional price sign according to the faith, despite its modest origin.
A bag of oils must be one of those things that have existed for every time in life and which has not caused any particular emotions.
It's just there, and if it's not, there's nothing broken.
Now, however, the shoulder bags are making a real race, and the moefans have changed their fine design scratches for summer months against the simple shoulders.
It's not just a beach bag, it's just as popular today as a street bag, and the bravest women walk with it even to the office.
However, it is worth clarifying, first, whether such a summer look to the boss is still sitting or worth a moth and a laptop, though, pushing a little more formally into the somataan.
The disparities of the shoulder bags, however, have made women truly love for the summer.
For example, when reading foreign fashion blogs, the first thing remains to be seen is that the moegurmaans take the first thing on their holiday trip to the local market and buy themselves some shoulder bags, which will then be loyal throughout their holidays and which will be accompanied by beaches, markets and friends on the city.
Some bloggers are so generous that they buy more bags from the market and sell or give them away to their loyal readers.
In this regard, it is worth noting that among the readers there is such a demand for bags that women (and men!) in the real world would probably go after each other in order to become a happy owner of a bag.
In some respects, such a madness is also understandable, because these are rare times when some of the things in the fashion can be bought for only a few decades.
True, it is also true that intensive merchants have discovered a simple opportunity to make money available, and so finer luxury brands also sell beer bags for a few hundred and a thousand euros.
Apparently, richer customers should not feel like they're simple mortals who promote some cheap bags around.
For example, it is possible to buy Dolce & Gabbana over a thousand euro-paying shoulder bag.
However, for the interpretation of Chanel’s shoulder bag, there may be 6000 euros.
Unlike most moehites, the shoulder bags come not from some large fashions, but their story began farther.
In fact, the shoulder bags are allegedly far from the Philippines, where they have been carried without a wide range.
The redness of the shoulder bag is mainly an ex-boyfriend, and the locals are very often unlikely to see them.
It is alleged that strawberry is from the 14th century, and it is quite crooked by a regular basketball drop.
However, since the shoulder bag does not need to be bruised as strong as the basket, patterns and other materials that make the bag more personal and more ambiguous.
For example, in recent times there are particularly trendy bags with colored strips or leather strips.
Thanksgiving bags may, in particular, be sent to an actor Jane Birkin, who had not yet been seen the greatest bruised shoulder bag fan.
In fact, he adapted his shoulder bag to all the clothing sets, and he didn't even think it would be much for the Cannes film festival.
At the popularity of the bags today, however, it does not play a lesser role in caring for them as a skullhead and, unlike all kinds of other sumadans, it does not need to be cared with special means, but water and wet towels do it.
As in the case of trend raids, after classical appearance brands have come out with all possible interpretations.
For example, if you wish, you might get a strawberry or a tiny shoulder.
At the same time, it is worth remembering that a classic shoulder bag will never go out of fashion, but it is a shoulder.
But, what's the classic shoulder bag?
For centuries it has been considered classical to be such a red bag that reminds me of its style of basket, has been open and is short, as well as straws, sangs.

The missing man was found in the island three days ago.
The treasure left his home on Wednesday night in the nearest unknown direction of Kärla.
The last contact with the treasure was yesterday, Friday night, and the phone positive was the location of the man in the West Saare municipality, the village of Miracles, where he was searched for by the helicopter until midnight and the dogs until early morning.
Then his cell phone battery was empty, and the location of the man was therefore no longer identified.
The police continued searching this morning.
The police thank everyone who helped find the Aare.
GMB is concerned about investments in McVitie's Glasgow factory
The trade union awaits confirmation from the managers of McVitie's cookie manufacturer on long-term production plans at the Glasgow factory.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has silently invested in the future of the Tollcross object.
In a factory where Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products are produced, more than 500 people work.
McVitie's owner of Pladis said they've invested an object over 5 million pounds over the last few years.
They hired more employees and the union presidents "the first to hear" if anything changes in the factory's activity.
In a letter sent to the company's head of object, GMB Scotland called on McVitie's side of the request to "resolve concerns about the fact that the funding is not used to modernise the production lines".
Drew Duffy, GMB's senior organizer, said: "The fact that we are not able to find out from the main chairman of the object about the business needs of Tollcross and the investment plan for the future, makes our members deeply concerned.
There have been many generations of families working here, and the labour force is largely composed of the local community and the people of the Glasgow region, while it is essential to ensure proper employment in an area where there is high unemployment and is a social weather.
Therefore, Glasgow needs a firm with a rapidly growing productivity in McVitie, in terms of employment, wage and well-being in the eastern part, and Brexit, in view of the increase in the cost of living and the chronic decline in production."
The representative of the Pladis said: "The object manager of Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company responds directly to him because we value active communication with employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, a regular meeting was held between workers in Tollcross and GMB representatives, which opened up a number of problems.
We then discussed with employees that, like all the other firms operating in an extremely competitive and insecure economic climate, we are looking at our activities on the current stage - and this applies to all of our businesses and objects - to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: "In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds of Tollcross object, most of it has gone into production lines and improvement of operations.
We fully understand the heritage of Tollcross as a production object, and if any changes in the activity of the object are to occur, employees and representatives of the trade union are the first to hear about it."
Did the PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar three years ago?
La Liga may regret his interest in Marco Verratt
Paris Saint-Germain does not give up efforts to attract Neymar to his lines by making a offer of 189 million pounds for his purchase. But did they warn Barcelona three years ago about this recording trip?
This disgusting approach has opened the summer transition window and the League 1 club is ready to crush more than double the current world record of overpurchasing, which was set up last season by returning to the Manchester United by Paul Pogba for £89 million.
Once the transition has been completed, Neymaris will become the world's most expensive player and also the most rewarded professional athlete in the world who will receive payment from PSG for more than 500 000 pounds per week.
Barcelona is known to be angry both because of the approach and the break-in of Neymar, although the close source of the Catalans board confirms that the club has always taken the best care of the football player since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
But did the President of the PSG warn the football world about such an opportunity three years ago?
In 2014, when Manchester City showed interest in concluding a contract with Blaise Matuid, Nasser warned harshly all clubs thinking about recruiting some of the best players in the PSG.
"I don't worry, because they know that if they touch one of our players, we'll come back and contact these players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to make a deal with some of our players, they must face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed the border, since the Spanish club previously showed an interest in this summer’s central field player Marco Verratt.
The PSG made it clear that they did not allow Italy to leave on any condition and that Barcelona would be able to receive a back strike as a result of this interest, losing one of its precious assets in Neymar's form.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges after Brexit, not borders.
"Brex is seriously threatening to strike the gap between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Britain and Ireland", Vardkar warned the first visit to Northern Ireland after his appointment in June.
"I can't imagine who could benefit from it," he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made it possible for the free movement of current people and goods, said Varadkar.
"This is our vision for the future: build bridges, not borders," he stressed.
According to Varadkar, he would prefer Britain to be part of the European Union, and since it is not possible, then remain part of the European common market.
This would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another opportunity to make Britain's departure more smooth would be the creation of the European Union and the United Kingdom Customs Union, explained by the Irish Prime Minister.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said, "We could have this kind of agreement with Britain."
An alternative would be to return to customs, which would declare historic fragmentation and political failure.
"Free to trade, prosperity and peace," said the Irish Prime Minister.
He called Brexit "the challenge of our generation" and warned that the result could affect every aspect of the everyday life of Northern Ireland.
The Irish Prime Minister met with the leaders of the Northern Ireland main parties in Belfast.
Marty Avandi, his first half-piece triatlon: everyone can pass Ironman.
Today, the largest triatlon festival in the Baltic States was held in the winter capital, where about a thousand triatlets from more than thirty countries took place in half-piece of Ironman.
The distance of 70.3 miles consisted of 1.9 km of swimming, 90 km of bike and 21.1 km of bike.
Among others, Mart Avandi also completed the first triatlon of his life.
"I thought it would prove complicated and finally it was complicated," said Avand in the final.
Despite the complexity, Avandi realized that the triatlon was actually a powerful head for all.
"Not the distant kills, but the tempo kills," he said, suggesting that with a high speed, everyone gets to the finish of the head.
Except Ott Sepp: "The physicist is fine, but he can't swim."
Avandi had practiced enthusiasticly since February.
At the start of 4-5 hours a week, and then ten hours a week.
At 05:34:12, he reached 270 in his general accounts.
Although Avandi lost both to Raio Piiroja (time 04:59:53) and Jürgen Ligi (time 05:06:37), he won other so-called "prominent class" champions.
Last year, Tanel Padar lost a good example to Avand in seven minutes (time 05:41:54), journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes (time 05:50:23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm in about an hour (times 06:31:53 and 06:45:18).
The general winner of the Otepää stage of the Ironman series was crowned at 3:58:27, the Estonians were the best Ivo Great time at 04:14:09.
Among the women, the Danube Helle Frederis won at 04:24:01, but the Estonians, Maria Jänes, who lost nearly half an hour to Frederisin, and became 04:58:58.
The opening passed 1.9 km long swimming distance in 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
He came out of the water at position 410.
